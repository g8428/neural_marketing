This drama was such a delight and surprise to me. It was sold as a melodrama, but there is no melo in it at all. Instead, it is a beautiful and lyrical story where each episode is a chapter in a beautiful fairy-tale, as pointed out by the beautiful art at the beginning and end of each episode.


Story: This is a character-driven story, not plot driven. This is the story of how they met and changed each other's lives, and how they individually grew, and I couldn't have been happier that this was it, without any cliches or contrived plot points.

Characters: On one hand we have Cha Soo Hyun, a chaebol through and through who has never had a chance to have a live of her own, because of the deep love and commitment she has for for family. On the other hand we have Kim Jin Hyuk, an old soul who loves poetry and has a very positive way to look at live, not to be confused with naiveness; he is also a man who is completely free of the toxic masculinity that has been so talked about in recent times. He always respects Soo Hyun's decisions and backs her up, and encourages to empower herself, without pushing her.
There are good side characters throughout the story, but this is a story about these 2, and the drama doesn't waste much time focusing anywhere else.

Acting: Song Hye Kyung and Park Bo Gum have great natural chemistry together; they pulled the drama all on their own, and did a great work while it. With them we were able to see 2 people fall in love, especially in the small details. They were able to convery their emotions and story without having to talk at all. Their scenes felt so real that sometimes we as the audience even feel like voyeurs by watching something so intimate.

Music: This usually is not a very important part for me, but the music in this drama really lifted up the story and gave it great ambiance; it was also great to hear music in Spanish.

Overall: I loved almost everything about this drama, from the simple story to the great chemistry between Soo Hyun and Jin Hyuk. I loved that their story wasn't overly dramatic but instead very realistic. Each time it could've turned into a clich√©, the drama subverted it and went the other way. If I have one complain is that characters, especially antagonists, talked a lot about creating havoc but never actually did anything, robbing some momentum to the plot; however, the cute scenes more than made up for it.

Watch this if you're feeling down or just want to feel fuzzy all over; it'll help you remember your first love, and all the small moments and feelings that you go through when you first fall in love.

So this beautiful Romcom has finally come to an end. What can I say, I'll truly miss it and I know some of you will too.

From the scenes of Cuba to South Korea, episode 1 to 16 were well exicuted. Big props to the writer and the cast that brought this lovely story to life. I loved it very much. That ending was everything a Romcom suppose to be in correlation to the plot, so subtle and romantic.

WHAT I LOVED

1.THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.

It was very steady and not forced by both Ms Cha and Jin-Hyeok love relationship. I really liked that alot, I've seen many times the love was force and prematurly occurred but in this case it was not. They both got to know each other first hand.

2. EMOTIONS

Showcasing emotions In films plays a big part in how well an individual can act, how well we as the audience/viewers can connect with what is being portrayed in an emotional standpoint. Both Soo-Hyun and Jin-Hyeok did that, as a matter of fact the whole cast did that. I was able to connect with them and to be honest I even shared a tear which is not quite often ????. Big thumps up.

3. CINEMATOGRAPHY

I know the majority of the scenes took place in South Korea but the scenes in Cuba were breathtaking. I don't know if is BEACUSE I'm form the Caribbean so I'm being a bit bias or what but those scenes they captured were supercalifragilisticexpialidocious lol it was wonderful.

4. OST
Easily rated at a 10. So soothing yet catchy. My favorites are the day we met, don't hesitate love and that night. They go so well with each scene.

5.LESSON LEARNED

All dramas give out a different vibe and sometimes the vibe might be similar to another drama that you may have seen. Now this drama I've learned alot of life lessons but there is one that stood out most to me is that sometimes you have to stoop to conquer. Both Jin-Hyeok and Ms Cha could have just gave up on their love for each other because of the obstacles that stood in front of them.
Yes one might say Ms Cha was a bit coward and let go a bit but the most important thing is that she never gave up and her man stood by her all the way and in the end, both hand in hand conquered the obstacles and their love were able to flourish.


WHAT I DISLIKE

There were not so much major things that I could actually say I disliked but there was one thing. Ms Cha took so long to stand up for herself and allowed herself to be battered by family that was no longer family and at times I was becoming upset with her, but in the end it all turned out great. Patience is surely a virtue, something I wish I had lol.

MY RATINGS

As Jin-Hyeok rightfully said ""don't be sorry, thank you for being brave""
There is hope in Love so with that being said my rate is ;
10/10.

This was a well put together drama and I highly recommend it to everyone. ????

""Encounter"" is 100% romance, with no filler, so if people falling in love isn't your thing then this drama definitely should not be on your list. It's an opposites attract story in some ways, but not in a romcom sense. The vibe is much more poetic and serious. There's also a flip in the traditional Kdrama roles with Song Hye Kyo playing the cold CEO usually played by men and Park Bo Gum playing her younger and quirky love interest. I admit that in the beginning I wasn't sold on this pairing at all, but by the end they seemed extremely genuine, and I liked them together much more than I thought I would.

Seeing Song Hye Kyo as such a mature and straight-faced character felt awkward at first. She's come a long way from ""Full House"", one of the first dramas I've ever seen, and though this is not the first time I've seen her serious, it is the first time seeing her as a cold and at times emotionless character. There is also such a significant age gap between her and Park Bo Gum, that they initially just seemed wrong together. The early scenes in Cuba are particularly awkward at times, but there was just enough spark to keep me curious and interested enough to keep watching. Eventually, I sensed more of a chemistry between them, not exciting chemistry, but more comfortable and sweet chemistry. Bo Gum's smiles started to feel less forced. Seeing her loosen up to the possibility, made me loosen up to the possibility as well. Next thing you know I was rooting for them with no hesitation. So maybe that means the casting was genius after all.

There's not much to the story honestly, so I couldn't give it high marks. There are a few points in the story about family & business drama, but it really is about two people figuring out if they can make a relationship work. The pace is also very slow, but I was never bored watching because I think the pace matched the drama's mood well. I'd compare this drama to sipping wine rather than drinking soda (for the record I love both!). The wine has to be to your taste in order to enjoy sipping it, and sucking it up fast with a straw would just seem odd. It isn't the most original or exciting premise either, but there's one thing that makes this drama stand out, the visuals!

This drama is completely gorgeous to watch, and not just the scenes overseas. There are moments that are cinematic, moments where a strategically placed painting makes a huge statement, and animated moments before and after each episode that gives the story a whimsical fairytale feel. The soundtrack is also beautiful and matches that mood well. I think the star of this drama is definitely the director, and since one of the main characters is a photographer, the focus on viuals never seemed out of place. I think it raised the bar for this drama, which never would have been as interesting with a more traditional look.

Would I watch it again? Not likely, but it depends on my mood. There weren't enough things that I loved to want to see it all over again. I also liked but didn't fall in love with the lead couple, or the supporting cast. They were all great, but I didn't feel like I would miss seeing any of them once the show ended.

Overall, this is strictly for romance fans. The love was heavy-handed at times, but there were enough moments that felt authentic, realistic, and relatable as well. I felt calm watching, even during more upsetting moments, so I would categorize this drama under ""Kdrama & Chill"". Just like the title suggests, this was an unexpectedly enjoyable drama that I'm glad I came across, and decided to give a chance.

This drama is a treat for romance drama lovers. Cha Soo Hyun's life after divorce once she gets Donghwa hotel as her alimony is picturised here. She meets a young man in Cuba who later turns out to be her employee. Their beautiful lovestory is well picturised here.

I wanted to write a review on 10th episode because this episode for me is like a beautifully written poem.

The actors Song hye kyo and Park Bo gum are very natural in their acting and handles their roles with ease.

The music compliments the story beautifully.

The 10th episode is a good example of everything coming together beautifully - the acting, story and music.

Now after watching all 16 episodes, I feel like the story can be condensed into 12 or 14 episodes but viewers like would have wanted more of this drama. The way they have presented a simple love story is just amazing. 16 episodes are just perfect for a beautiful slow paced(in a good way) romance drama.

If you are a romance drama lover and haven't started watching this already, then it is time to include this in your watch list.

It will touch your heart and soul
Whenever I watch a movie or series, somehow it's important to me that the characters looks good (I know I might sound shallow but who doesn't like good looking characters?!) and the places they shoot should be attractive as well to keep me watching. This exceeds my expectations!

Cliche in every story cannot be completely ignore. So this is a classic love triangle and the struggles that comes being born rich and powerful. I love the cinematography! They do justice in shooting their scenes in Cuba. It makes me want to visit the place. I also love the beach and the tall wooden tower they have visited.

So far, I don't find it boring. Their lines are well delivered and some poetic. I love the phase on how the series is moving. The acting for me is just fine. Meaning, they are not exaggerated at all. Some of the scenes are very emotional and heart breaking. It does made you wonder from time to time if rich people do really have this kind of problem lol!

Supporting characters are not bad either. Park Bogum's friend Kim Jooheon and Song Hyeko's secretary Kwak Sunyoung are someone you need to watch out too! They are cute. The friendship between Hyeko and Sunyoung is something to be admired too. I also find the driver, Ko Changeseok funny!

Hopefully this series will not keep me interested till the end.

UPDATE:
I finished the series long back but forgot to update. It was great! There are several funny scenes as well. What I really admire in this series is the fact that Park Bogum never gave-up. Though it has hinted, he opted not too. In other drama, that will be case and the partner will chase back. In this case, he showed he will stay until Song Hyeko realise his worth. I love how he used the shoes as a symbol. I love it so much that I repeated some of the memorable scenes. There are several lines from Park Bogum that find very poetic.

This drama's visuals were what impressed me the most. Everything looked stunning, the animations that played at the beginning and at the end of each episode, the scenery, the actors, everything.

The romance was so heartfelt, it made me wonder if such a beautiful romance with such a deep connection between two people in love could actually exist in real life, I hope it does.

I can't not mention how I loved the osts, they were simply beautiful and fitted the situations well.

Although I loved the romance part of the story, I could have liked this drama more if the plot had been more interesting.

Also the episodes were all too long and there were a lot of boring scenes.

The last two episodes disappointed me because of the use of one of the typical unnecessary situations kdrama writers like to add in the finale episodes to cause drama.

But I did like the ending, it was simple and good and although I didn't rate this drama that high I still recommend it just because of the romance. If you are a hopeless romantic like me you will love the pairing in this.

I can't find enough words to describe how I feel about this drama. Maybe because this is much more then a love drama, it is a beautiful poetry ‚ù§! A love poem with incredible beautiful words and beautiful souls. A fairytale I really loved it ...
I can say it‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve watched a drama that involves so many emotions. I cried and I fell in love with the characters and their dialogues. Park Bo Gum it was perfect and I am wondering if he actually exists, Song Hye Kyo was amazing and their romance was so warm and smooth, like a dream ...

The premisses of the story were good, as the story of the leading lady was tragic and it was obvious that when he met the young man, her life changed as well as her as a person. However, the romance and the love story all together lacked intensity. After the strong start, the events tended to repeat each other and the twists were boring. At least the performances were good, however, the two leads lacked chemistry and looked more like good friends than lovers. So, four out of ten, because it got tiring to watch after a while.

Romance in full bloom
If you want to immerse yourself in a beautiful romantic adventure, then this is the one for you. Rarely does the chemistry of two stars come across on the screen like Park Bo Gum and Song Hye Kyo portrayed in this series. The story of two beautiful people of different ages and different walks of life coming together as a couple. It was a pleasure seeing them survive through a storm of difficulties. It was also refreshing to see a male lead who never gave up on his love and a female lead who didn‚Äôt turn to another man even when she was almost broken. To me, this was the story that showed the beautiful healing power of love. Each episode was a chapter in a love story that urged me on to the next.

The supporting roles were perfect. Each character added something without overpowering the main story. Excessive parental control is one thing that gets me riled up. I must admit the parents in this story were great at making my blood boil. I especially liked Ko Chang Seok‚Äôs portrayal of Nam Myeong Sik. As the episodes flowed by, he gave you hope and helped tie the entire series together.

Song Hye Kyo was terrific as always. She has the X factor, and her mere presence lights up the screen. Her portrayal of Cha Soo-Hyun was something to behold. I think this was a complicated character for her because it required her to portray so many difficult mindsets or emotions. She did it perfectly. She changed from a sheltered rich woman battered from wicked parental control to a free soul opening herself to her first real love. It was like watching a flower bloom or a butterfly emerge. In spots, she controlled the entire flow of the scene with a simple smile. It was captivating.

In my opinion, Park Bo Gum‚Äôs portrayal of Kim Jin Hyuk was the best role I‚Äôve ever seen him play. He showed us strength in a male character through love, kindness, and understanding. You don‚Äôt see that on-screen very often, and it was surprising but refreshing. It made me want to be a better man. Soo Hyun‚Äôs reactions to his never-ending flow of love advances were priceless. He also has one of the best smiles I‚Äôve seen on a male actor.

The music was sensational. It was well-orchestrated as it blended with each emotion.

The subtitles were outstanding. Since I don‚Äôt speak the language, I rely on subtitles. Sometimes, they can be misleading or show words that don‚Äôt fit in the English language, but they were perfect in this case.

And finally, the most critical part, the kisses. You can‚Äôt sell a romance on screen if you aren‚Äôt committed to the kisses. The kisses in Encounter were likable and believable. They made you smile and maybe even tear up a little. You could feel the growth of the love through each kiss.

In summary, I loved this series.

*First review so plz bear with me*

First, I'll admit I started this drama because of the cast, (I mean who would resist ?)
Song Hyekyo did a stunning job, and Park Bogum was incredible.
They were so good at capturing the right emotions, their talent and chemistry was unbelievable.

This drama was so aesthetically beautiful. I've never something so well directed, and visually pleasing.
The scenes at Cuba really makes you feel like you are physically there with the characters.

The story was just amazing. I was hooked every week, wanting to know the rest.
You might feel like it's the typically love story with the evil step mother, but it's not.
It's really original and unexpected.
You don't know how it's gonna end, until the last episode.

For the music, I never really loved OSTs in general, except the one from Descendants of the sun.
But in this case, every song was so good, and went great with the drama, especially Lee Sora's and Eric Nam's songs.

To put it in a nutshell, it was the first drama that I watched as it was released, and every week, I was floating.
So many emotions hit me every episode, and I have to admit, I teared up a few times.
I would recommended it a 100% to K-drama newbies, or anyone in general.


I hope this was helpful <3

This drama has a very simple plot but the thing fascinates me is its process is beyond perfect. I am a lover of book myself, poetry and arts that's why I love this drama even more. The million bonus is the cast golden acting especially PBG and SHK and their face profiles. Truly eye candies. I love how the PD made the flow of the story. The scenes are putting up little by little until climax. The cinematography is just fantastic. All sweeeeet moments are refreshing as in refreshing and makes my heart jumps out. This drama makes me remember the feeling of being in love bc of PBG excellent acting . The drama dialogues/quotes are all rich in life lessons that even now I save it and compile it. This drama makes me want to visit Korea again and go to the places where it has been shot. I learn so many things regarding literature since Jinhyuk is really an intelligent man same with Soohyun with arts. So heartwarming. It embraces my hearts and life. This is a drama that when you are sad just watch it then those sadness will throw outside the window just watching PBG and SHK aside from the eps 14, truly tear jerker. Amazing drama. I LOVE TO HAVE SEASON 2 or else another drama for PBG and SHK. To those bashing it with SJK's issue, please REAL is way way way different from REEL. Grow up, people. To those who did not enjoy, you just have not the intelligence to catch up with the class and beauty of this breathtaking drama. Peace.

This drama set itself apart from all others from episode 1 itself. I don‚Äôt know much about cinematography or lighting or any other film technicalities but throughout the series I couldn‚Äôt help but admire how beauty of each shot. I feel it is on par with Goblin if not better. The Cuba scenes were especially stunning.

Going into this drama, I came with high expectations since Park Bo Gum is one of my favourite actors. Song Hye Kyo I like as well. I can‚Äôt say their chemistry was exceptional but there was enough to make the story believable and leave a lasting impression. Needless to say, my expectations were fully met.

The side characters served their purpose but no one really stood out for me. Music as well., it was pleasant to listen to and fit the mood very well but not particularly memorable.

As the series went on I noticed that there were a lot of complaints about the pacing of the story. I fully understand their point of view but I feel like it‚Äôs one of the things that makes this drama so unique. Yes, it is slow but never boring. In this fast paced lifestyle that we now live in, this drama reminds me of old times when people took the time to savour the little things in life. I love how the bond between the two leads grows over the course of the series. There is no crazy villain, throwing curveballs at opportune moments. Every cliche that k-dramas have is flipped. A 2nd lead/rival that you can‚Äôt help but sympathize with. Even if this storyline has been done a thousand times with slight variations, the little differences mentioned above and more made the story refreshing.

This drama felt like a good movie that I wish would never end. It was pleasant, and served as relaxing end to each week after work. I spent the better part of the time with a goofy smile plastered to my face. Guys like Jin Hyuk are one in a million.

To conclude, I will say that the series was one of the better ones of the last year. I appreciate how the writers gave a proper end to every storyline, big or small. I truly enjoyed watching this show. However, I don‚Äôt think I would watch it again. Not because it‚Äôs not good but because, I know that the excitement that I felt the first time around won‚Äôt be there on a repeat viewing.

This drama.. was absolutely wonderful and refreshing! It was the most aesthetically pleasing kdrama I have seen. Every scene, every item, every frame... was carefully thought out and placed. The tone of the drama was carefully chosen and fit the mood of what the characters were going through. I cannot say how pleased I am to have encountered this series. Each dialogue was thought out and made my heart ache and race at the same time. It made me feel as if I was falling in love alongside the characters.. and I truly did.

Both Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum were wonderful in their performances.. they convey such raw emotions towards each and every expression they made... I swoon! I felt so warm after watching this show.. their process of falling in love went at a desirable and realistic pace. Definitely a true depiction of falling in love and being loyal.

Currently rewatching this series and the more I am grateful of the artwork displayed. Good to watch when you‚Äôre feeling blue and in need of something to warm your heart up!

i gained nothing
i binged watched this whole drama in like two days and i don't know how to feel about that. admittedly, i was high for 80% of the show but even then it was a chore to get through. at least once per episode i found myself sighing like, ""why are you crying again?"" girl...what was this? this was my first drama with park bo gum and i get why he's popular, he put his heart into acting this subpar script, but chile... he could only do so much.

i'll admit i started to watch it without reading the synopsis because i like surprises, but i went into it not knowing and i left not knowing. i really had to start skipping lil 10 second clips because it was so boring lol. i respect the whole romance thing but something about their love felt off. Idk if it's because song sun kyu is married to her fine ass husband, but i can't believe the chemistry between them. they had me like, ""no but WHY do ya'll love each other? it's been maybe a month."" i was more invested in the side couple's love, i would've watched them flirt.

i can't even say that i'd recommend you watch it. i gained no happy feelings from it. i didn't even cry because i couldn't get emotionally invested in the story when they ended up breaking up at least twice an episode. the music actually wasn't bad but god, GOD do i hate that damn english song. it's so bad. i kept on getting distracted by the lyrics every emotional scene. ""oHh tAke mE On dOWn by ThE rIvER""

i will say that park bo gum carried that last break up scene. they had that man sobbing lmfao. it got a whole additional star for acting just because he made me feel something.

If someone put me in an art gallery for 16 hours to do nothing but wander and stare at PBG and Song Hye-kyo's beautiful faces, I'd be into it. Encounter was all atmosphere, and I think that was a bold and admirable choice to make. But it severely underused its leads's talents, and the conflict was so threadbare that I didn't particularly feel like indulging myself in the distractions of Encounter's good points (its music, visuals, its airy, whimsical tone -- as though you've been dropped into the mind of a person who is mid-thought).

[minor spoiler]
There was only one moment in which the frisson we're supposed to feel for these two characters, poles apart but drawing closer, really came through for me. She spots him in the hallway of a hotel and asks him why he's wearing a zippered necktie when she gave him a proper, grown-up one. He says he hasn't been able to get the method of wearing it right. So she matter-of-factly takes off the zippered one and makes him stand still while she puts the necktie on for him. It's a hoary old romantic clich√©, but in that moment the combined star power of these two, and the choices they made (he's trying to hide a goofy, helpless grin; she's self-consciously holding on to her gravitas) invested it with such sparkle, I got the point of the whole show.
[/spoiler]

If it had had more moments like that, Encounter would have fulfilled its promise, I think. As it is, all the kudos to whoever decided that PBG should capitalise on his stardom by playing a model of hot, supportive, patient masculinity for women of all ages to project their fantasies on.

Cute Melodrama
This was a good melodrama. Not out of this world, but engaging and heartfelt. At first I wasn't sure if I could buy the romance between our MLs. She seemed so aloof and detached. She also seemed to look at him more like a friend who amused her rather than a love interest. It got better towards the end, but it was never really a convincing relationship.

Park Bo Gum was wonderful in this. His performance as the inherently happy, unflappable, young man who sees the wonder in simple things is on point. He is so adorable you just want to be his best friend. He is almost unbelievably perfect. There were moments though that I wished he had been more selfish and more protective of his own heart. But he surprises me and shows a wisdom well beyond his years. He was well cast in this.

I didn't think this was a great vehicle for Son Hye Kyo. For some reason she was giving off some negative vibes, as if she wasn't as invested in this show. Perhaps she felt is too melodramatic for her taste. I didn't get the feeling she was all in. I am used to seeing her in much stronger roles, so having to play an abused daughter-in-law at her age, was a bit of a stretch. The storyline felt implausible that such a seemingly powerful woman would experience so much abuse in her family and professional life. The romance, yes, is all about falling in love and that love making you strong enough to face adversity, but much of her suffering is both created and alleviated by those around her more than of her facing it for herself and finding the inner strength to push back. Some of the characters don't seem to develop well at all. A big example is the ex-husband. He was the weakest character and I feel the writers could have been a little more fair to him. His storyline at first seems to be something much more important than it turns out to be. I was hoping he would be more of a helper, but sadly the script deviated from this leaving me dissatisfied.

The supporting cast was low key and fun to watch. I prefer that they don't overtake the MLs as often is the case in some Chinese dramas. The supporting couple's careful flirtations provided a nice break from the intensity of the main couple. In general, at 16 episodes, it's a nice series to watch in between other dramas.

Simple Storyline well told
The story line of this drama is typical. But I found little flaw in the way the story was told and filmed.
What impressed me most was that when I was expecting an action to take place,.. it happened.
I wish the story behind the last 3 episodes was different. It was obvious that Jin Hyuk mom had a ""self-worth"" issue and she was powerful enough to bring it out in our FL. But I wish Cha Soo Hyun awakening from dark to light was more profound. After all, Cha Soo Hyun is the heroine of the drama. She is the one who transforms the most. Jin Hyuk was her main support but really he didn't have many lessons to learn in life.
I give this drama 8.5 in this category because I think the story was told very nicely and made sense.

It was worth watching.

This is a must-watch.
I liked this drama from the very first scene to the last.I don't know why it is categorised as a melodrama, because I could not find that. I am writting this review after watching it third time because it's really worth of writing a review.
It is a romcom, smoothly going, sweet drama.. The chemistry between the main leads is really awesome and kind of immersing. Whether it is charming handsome park bo gum, beautiful, pleasant song hye kyo or the side character's real-like-acting one reason to watch the drama can not be pin pointed.
I really can't understand how can this drama get such a low and disappointing ratings where the lame story dramas are getting above 8.5 rating.
I shall not add spoiler, but if you want to rest from thriller, horror, blood, conspiracy, then you must watch ENCOUNTER.

Romantic and Sweet. It has soooo many sweet moments that just makes your heart flutter! Of course, the lead actor is just too adorable (I like him in his other drama where he was a prince - Love in the Moonlight ) but at the same time he can act!!! When he cries, you just want to give him a hug and it just pains you to watch him go through it. There was some slow moments but not that bad. I also appreciated the supportive and loving friends and family that the lead male role had (healthy family relationship for once in a Kdrama!!!) Overall, the story was not extraordinary, the selling point is that their honest, sweet, vulnerable moments that captures your heart! So YES, watch it if you like this genre.

The actors need to wake up and deliver what they signed up for. I feel like they're too afraid to cross the line, just cause SHK is married and PBG is close friends with her husband. Their kiss for me is the cringiest onscreen kiss ever, it's like kissing a wall. Even the editor knew it too, they showed the back of SHK'S head so many times and a very far shot of the kiss just to mask the god awful kissing scene. There's absolutely no heat between them which is impossible for this drama because SHK is playing a divorcee. Yes, she's a very respectable divorcee but she isn't some virgin. There were already many scenes where they were alone in a room and NOTHING HAPPENED. PBG is playing an innocent unassuming man but he is still a MAN, not some saint. The director needs to get a grip and manage these actors better than this. The lines in the script always say they have deep feelings for each other but I don't see it, so far they've been giving either a sis-bro or mom-son vibe. It's so frustrating because this drama could be good but the actors are holding back which is so unprofessional. All love stories even real ones are filled with lust too. The actors should show us what it's really like when a 30-something woman gets together with a hot 20-something guy. They should take pointers from the male and female leads of Something in the rain drama, now THAT was good acting. But in this one, it's just pretty faces and sentimental lines, that's basically it.

Oh the n number of times I burst out my crying tap with this one. Crazy.
Some scenes, dialogues, expressions and situations were just so heart touching.
It took me a while to get adjusted to the ""real life Vs reel life"" pairing, and I honestly couldn't enjoy their kiss scenes BUT, this drama was solid as a complete story, good depth of character, generous pinches of fairytale elements, great spring cast, logical and peaceful conflicts and over and above all, masterpieces of acting from everyone involved.

The music just tugs your at right places and you can't stop humming along with it.

A must watch if you enjoy good cinematography, meaningful dialogues, subtle expressions, great acting and peaceful paced dramas.

We all want an Encounter like this!
This is a review of a re-watch of Encounter, which allowed me to notice things I did not the first time around. The scenery and cinematography are out standing. The scenes shot in Cuba, paired with fabulous songs created a canvas my imagination could build on. I was captivated at all the sights and sounds. It was like a mini vacation for me. The story line that was developed in episode one became a central theme that was used masterfully to recreate romance in almost every episode. Park Gum Bo shone as Kim Jin Hyuk who was strikingly contrasted by the typical uptight role played by Song Hye Kyo. Her character, Cha Soo Hyun, appeared to be more mature on the surface but in reality , it was she that needed guidance of how to have a relationship in the end. There were many familiar stereotypical undertones of false guilt, parental control, over reacting to society, and social mishaps that brought tension. I will have to say that I found the role that was developed for Kim Jin Hyuk's mother extremely irritating. She definitely over steps her boundaries and is forgiven, of course, in the end. The OST is wonderful! I highly recommend this drama to anyone who needs a break from the heavier dramas. There is plenty of drama in this one but it is a lighter fare than most.

I wouldn't know if anyone told me the plot and general preview of the story, for it to be kdrama. When you Think of romance genre in kdrama, you'd Think of puppy love or hard core plotting. This has a Little of both, which makes this drama mature, yet not too mature for it to be hard to follow...

OST
I wouldn't per say listen to it separately, but i like the mixture of Spanish, English and Korean. IT's nice to hear that type of songs, and they were well picked, to kind of tell the story of scene without having to make characters emphasize that's silently going on.

ACTING
I don't know much drames that Park Bo Gum acted in, but i loved how he potrayed the character in this one. You couldn't help but fall in love with him. I also loved the chemistry between him and Song Hye Kyo. She Oslo did an amazing job, and im not surprised since she's quite popular for good acting. Both actors made the characters r√©al, and made the audience feel their √©motion. The side actors did well too, none of them did a bad job, and complimented the drama well.

PLOT
It would feel boring when told, but you'll find yourself loving it and being invested in it.
It basically tells the story of a lonely woman who's a CEO of a well known h√¥tel company. She goes to Cuba, and finds herself wanting to see a sunset from a picture she saw, in r√©al life. She has trouble sleeping so she takes sleeping pills but still goes, she gets lost and pickpocketed, but find the place where the sunset was shot, she there meets a man who saves her from falling, and they go around Havana... When she gets back, they both find out that the man is the employ√©e of her company. They face hardships, and develop slowly but neatly, with other characters.
_________
I LOVED the romance, it's slow but it still makes you blush and smileys from their cute interactions. But at the same time it can take a mature turn, and make you worry. The romance, isn't d√©pendend on plotting, but the hardship of a famous and rich person, who's quite older, dating her employ√©e. there are many romance side plots, and even a plot of her ex that makes him develop from trying to get her forcefully, to mathurins into someone that wants to protect his family.
It's a show, for someone who wants a bit more of slower romance, and romance that doesn't have cute and funny interactions.

slow, serious show about romance/love
This is not a rom-com (which is what I normally look for), but a slow and serious (but not melodramatic) show about love. Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum both did an excellent job. In most of the things I've seen Park Bo Gum in, there's always been something a little ""off"" to me about his acting. This role changed my mind. His acting in this was perfectly on point. When he was happy, you wanted to smile with him, and when he was unhappy it was heartbreaking. There was a slow buildup in their romance/love, and it made sense. His patience, and constant love for her was so wonderful to watch. I felt really drawn in to their relationship, sometimes I felt like I was a voyeur in their lives.

Park Bo Gum's character was open and innocent. He seemed to look at life with joie de vivre, and that was an infectious thing. I couldn't help but smile, watching him. His love for her was so apparent, even though they were so different. Song Hye Kyo's character, on the other hand, was very repressed. Her life had been decided and planned for her, and she had never deviated from that plan. I enjoyed watching him bring her out of herself, opening her to new experiences, and living the way she wanted to.

I did feel that the breakup, though necessary to keep the story moving, was a little lame, especially since it was uncalled for and none of the circumstances that she was concerned about changed, so the breakup made even less sense. I felt that Song Hye Kyo's character was a little too weak in standing up to her family (the moms in this were all nightmares!). I also felt that, because of her reasoning for the breakup, her love for him wasn't as strong, and that was disappointing.

The cinematography and the OST were both amazing as well. This show was beautiful to watch.

A beautiful Encounter
This is not one of those average cutesy romance dramas. It captures true romance. The leisurely pacing of Encounter allows the viewer to linger in that splendid feeling of love. The music, poetry, artwork and sincerity of communication bring you into those lovely feelings.

The casting was fairly well done, but I wavered back and forth on whether I liked the ML actor for that role. I felt the FL was perfectly cast.

Please be patient and keep watching past the first episode. It lacks a connection somehow in the beginning. It progresses better after that.

By the end of this drama I‚Äôm a little emotionally tired, but it was a fulfilling ride. Hope you enjoy it too.

A modern fairytale - with a fairytale ending
Time will only tell if this drama will eventually undo the heaps of bad reviews and criticisms, especially from Korean audiences, about the plot's unlikely premise - a love affair between a female CEO and a male, junior employee who met by chance in Cuba, before he joined the company.

I let the story take me where it wanted to, all the way to its happy, fairytale ending - and really loved it. Not only is Park Bo Gum a sensitive and fairly talented actor. I really believed in his chemistry with Song Hye Kyo, who plays the detached, emotionally distant female CEO, who has no friends and lives constantly in the shadow of her ex-husband's chaebol family.

Their story unfolds at regular, steady intervals, episode per episode, and conquers you with the sheer power of PBG's constancy of emotion. PBG's character Kim Jun Hyuk never let age, class, or public opinion sway him from his commitment to Cha Hyun Soo. He does, at some point, given to his family's reservations about her, illustrating his abiding love for his family - the kind of filial love that is the foundation of Korean family culture. You will have to watch till the end to see how this is resolved in the story.

I think the drama knew it was dealing with a plot many wouldn't connect with, so it tried to explore this in a smaller way through another pair of characters - Cha Hyun Soo's secretary (played by Kwak Sun Young) and the owner of the moon snails restaurant (Kim Joo Heon).

Korean's strict hierarchical culture disapproves of marriages that are unequal in class, power, or achievement (such as education). Encounter tries to point out that breaking out of these fixtures in their culture may be possible. I say may - because it's very, very hard to meet a man like Park Bo Gum's character in real life!!

Watch Episode 1, which was shot in Cuba. Please, please do. It's a masterpiece of photography and romantic plot exposition. If you give up on the rest of the story, Episode 1 is enough of an enchanting experience of movie-level production quality.

If you let it, Encounter may actually enchant you till the end. Just, well, try to ignore the one plot hole in this whole story - it is basically impossible today to carry on a romance like that in one company, without having to disclose it to HR and eventually watch one of them resign in order for the relationship to continue.

judging by the sypnosis i never expected this drama to be as realistic as it ended up being. a slow paced but never too slow masterpiece that is as beautiful as the art at the beginning and end of each episode.

story; a very simple story which helps the drama rather than hinder it. it can focus on the two main characters and allow the story to just be their growth after meeting each other.
everything makes sense, every action from any character seems justifiable which is something that i found so refreshing from other dramas and other shows in general

characters; both mains couldn't be more different, on the one hand you have cho soo hyun a big ceo, always in the public eye , someone who was never allowed to truly live her own life in any way. on the other hand this free spirited, always positive man who doesn't back down from his love while also being respectful and understanding of cha soo hyun's situation at all times. who would've thought they'd make up this perfect couple after all

side characters give good comedic relief, it would've been nice however to see more of their backstory as only a few's past have been brought up throughout ( like kim soo jun's marriage), but it's not a major gripe.

acting: both cha soo hyun and kim ji hyuk have this almost perfect chemistry from the first episode on, one while already being near perfect just gets better and more intimate with each passing episode and damn near feels very real at numerous points in the story. if i didn't know better i would've thought those 2 were actually dating, were actually in love the way they were able to convey these heartfelt emotions in just their facial expressions alone. i believe if this was a silent film these two would've done as well if not better.

ost; i'm usually not one to actually listen to OST's after a show or outside of a show but the songs on here are very well crafted, fit the mellow mood of the drama and are just overall good songs to listen to. the two renditions of take me on feel so very different despite essentially being the same song and the way they are placed throughout the episodes (saya's version being the more hopeless, saltnpaper's version being the more hopeful version) makes for excellent and emotional viewing

overall; probably my new favorite drama, i mean it even made me wanna spend time writing a review so that really should say it all. definitely a must watch during these down times

This is not just a drama...This is an experience!
I had to create an account on MDL to write this review.

What an experience it was to watch this drama. Every OST, every facial expression from both main leads, every interaction between the main leads was an absolute pleasure to watch and listen to.

Most of the reviews rave about the male lead's acting in this amazing Kdrama, and I agree with them. However, I am taken in by Song Hye-Kyo's acting. Every facial expression was priceless, and the way she carried herself throughout the whole story was so graceful to watch. The love and respect the main leads have for each other in this story is remarkable.

I did not want this drama to end. I was invested in the two main leads and experienced withdrawals once the drama ended. However, this story left an impression on me and is definitely on my top3 list.

Absolutely beautiful
If you want to watch absolutely beautiful people in highly aesthetically pleasing settings, this is the show for you. Park Bo-Gum, stop making me fall in love with you! After just watching you as Choi Taek, it was such a treat to see you grow up before my very eyes.

The sweet/cute moments were perfect, but the obstacles got tiring at times. Thankfully, the most angsty parts were short-lived ‚Äî  you just need to endure ~2 episodes or so. This story was like a more consistent Something in the Rain; the highs weren't QUITE as high, but the lows NEVER reached the depths of frustration and despair I felt from SITR.

I did have a few gripes with this show. One was the chemistry: people often tout ""negative chemistry,"" and while I don't think this show was atrocious in that regard (I also wasn't actively following during the whole Song-Song media storm at the time), it wasn't exceptional. Another was the side characters: beyond our two leads, most of them were pretty flat, and I never cared too much what happened to them. Many were awfully black-and-white as well, and the spoken explanations by people like Chairman Kim came too little, too late. Finally, one aspect of the message: an 11th hour change of heart is absolutely common in these types of dramas, and while I fully anticipated it, I think it negatively impacted the narrative. One of the most important parts of this story was the idea of a steadfast love. The whole 11th hour flip-flipping just made me frustrated, and made me question what one of the leads even SAW in the other lead to begin with (seriously, what made that person so appealing to make the other lead willing to endure such pain?!).

As a super minor note, this show is susceptible to quite a few kdrama tropes. It's nice and fresh for newer viewers, but a little tired otherwise. Think wrist-grabs, predictable plot points, and ridiculously shoehorned PPL. Another way of looking at it is ""tried-and-true,"" and I came to embrace all the highly out-of-place discussions people had while eating Subway.

At the end of the day though, this show delivered on several key fronts ‚Äî  the eye-candy, acting talent, witty dialogue, a banging OST, and absolutely stunning cinematography. The heart-fluttering moments were far more frequent than the hair-pulling ones, and that made this show a worthwhile and fulfilling watch on balance.

I've just finished watching this amazing drama. I have lots of reasons why I love it, and a few reasons why it wasn't a 10/10 for me.

1. THE MAIN CHARACTERS
The storyline aside, the lead characters were quite unique. Park Bo Geum's character was my favorite male lead characters of all times probably! The personalities of male leads are normally quite similar to each other: they can be rich and cold hearted amazingly handsome, or the most skilled person in the field of whatever is their profession. Anyways, I love that Kim Jin Hyuk was just a normal guy, that fell for this beautiful and lonely woman in his own way.
As for Song Hye Kyo's character, I loved how it's showing a different side of a rich career woman. It's focusing more on her loneliness and hardships she had in her entire life instead of being a classic bitchy boss. Even though she had a really difficult life, her heart still remained as soft as it could be, and I love how she puts Kim Jin Hyuk before anything. She chooses him over her career that was her everything so many times without thinking about it twice. I love how bravely she is embracing her love.

2.THE STORYLINE
I think the writers did a very good job with this one. The love between the two characters start and develop very naturally. I loved the gradual development of their relationship: they went from being friends that are attracted to each other to a pre-relationship phase, then they start the relationship and in the end their love exceeds everything else. I think this part of the show was written very brilliantly

3.ACTING
I mean the show has Song Hye Kyo.. In my opinion she is one of the best actresses in Kdramas. She can deliver all the emotions with her eyes which I love. I also love love love her drunk scenes where she becomes just so funny. For me she is the star of the show for sure. Park Bo Geum is also one of the actors that I admire. He really made a great job especially towards the end of the show.

4.CHEMISTRY
This one for me is the only reason why I can't rate this show 10/10. Even though I love the characters, and I love their story which was so beautiful, I couldn't sense a very strong chemistry between SHK and PBG. It wasn't because of their acting or anything, because both of them gave brilliant performances. But it was just lacking a good chemistry I guess. Perhaps the love story of this show is better compared to the Descendants of the Sun, but I still can't get over the chemistry between Song Hye Kyo and Song Jong Gi. I mean yes they got married in real life which meant they had chemistry in real life too when they were shooting. But still on-screen chemistry can be very strong even when the couple isn't dating in real life (ex: Ji Sung and Hwang Jung Eum, Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won, Gong Yoo and Yoon Eun Hye, Gong Hyo Jin and any korean actor ever, and the list goes on and on)

Overall, I think it's definitely a drama worth watching!

This Was my 2nd Korean Tv show I watched
I loved both ML & FL both have they own point of view and Identity
Even though it was a romantic series it doesnt have any villan

Storywriter & director made a unique story, I really respected ML with his cuteness made bold choices not to let go of things that he wished but to attain them in time and working on it with all the supporting character, I loved ML laugh and smile

I can never forget this drama and this was the best romantic korean show i ever watched

I see many reviews saying that the drama is very slow and awkward, and I understand it. However, what I don't understand is those reviews are based on people who haven't watched this drama pass 2 episodes, and people who enjoy this, are people who have watched this past 2 episodes. Don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on anyone who doesn't like this particular drama, it's their taste and preferences. The first few episodes are very, very slow as if it was a prologue of a book that contains very few points to the initial plot then driving people eager to read chapter 1 instead. But, I believe the prologue is very important, it paves sets of emotions with the details given, giving a sense of the audience to dive deeper into this story. Similarly, in the first few episodes Encounter does this perfectly. At least give this drama a chance.

At first I do hesitanting, Park Bogum and Song Hyekyo are classified as A+++ class actor but since I dont really like romance kind of drama. 1st episode I just wowing the entire thing, production house and screenwriter did their best for make a romance story not so childishly teenage love story or overly adult story in another drama just your everyday romance story. I'm feeling Something In The Rain all over again~~ plus realize that Park Bogum begin his flowery 20's age journey and Song Haekyo vampire beauty could win you right away to watch it. The supporting characters are not just for accessories but they could absorb viewers quickly to the story; like how we hate her ex in-laws mom and biological mom, the ex, the supportive secretary and daddy long-legs Mr Nam.

The cinematography SUPERB, every episode did fill a lot of colours. I really love the scene in Cuba, not only took scene in popular site but they tried to picturize the charms of old Havana, the street, the garden, I love it all. The sunset just to give us viewer a description of main character feeling, a warm and happy since both of them not really have an exciting moment in life especially Cha Soohyun her life just like a cold winter and shackles everywhere for our male lead Kim Jinhyuk, he suffers a burden of breadwinner since he is a 1st born male but luckyly he surround by a good family and friends.

The BGM and OST are top rate, when watching I dont know why but my heart beat so fast and happy pheromones leaking. I seriously dont know that Cuba have those beautiful places but after watching these I do want to go there. The sunset so beautiful~~

Btw I'm in awe by Kim Hyeun actress as Manager Kim after play as Park Hongjoo congresswoman in Son: The Guest, she in here play as a single mom who have a lot of love to her subordinates, loyal to Cha Soohyun and the elders; Manager Nam and Soohyun's father.

YOU NEED THIS REVIEW TO WATCH THIS DRAMA!!
FIRSTLY, the description given about this drama in the synopsis is doing the drama BAD. The drama has more to it than just that! Let me start by saying this is not gonna be one of the dramas you watch and regret wasting your time. I started this drama mainly because I'm into Noona Romances. This drama brings out a lot of emotions both happy and sad ones, and also gave me a new insight in life as well. The drama is correctly paced and the most realistic drama I've ever come across in my watching of K-drama's. Many a times when I watch dramas based on life I often wonder ""how can this be possible?"" or ""there's no way this can happen in real life!"" even though they aren't fiction or fantasy. This drama left no place for doubts like that and it potrays a very mature and strong relationship between the leads.

STORY: The overall story is quite wonderful! but kdramas always have a plot twist which you never expect. I personally think this twist wasn't really necessary as the drama by itself was going on really well!

ACTING: I couldn't have asked for a better casting than this, both the actor's brought out the life in their characters exceptionally well. For all of you saying the casting is a wrong decision, I would say y'all are blind! SHK and PBG's expressions as well as their acting couldn't have been better!

OST: The OST was a blessing to the ears! Right from when they were in Cuba to the ending . The music coordinated very well with the scenes! and enhanced the ambiance of the situation as well.

The only time when I was disappointed was when episode 13 ended. After that it was kinda unexpected and when everything came back to track the happiness was very short lived. I wasn't able to experience the joy of the drama I felt all along. It would have been better if there was 1 more episode added to it after things got back on track.
But overall this drama is ONE OF THE BEST dramas I'VE seen!
I WOULD STRONGLY RECCOMNED IT!! :)

I enjoyed watching this show very much, that said it's not as light as I thought it would be, based on the reviews I've read on this site. In fact I think the melodrama tag is completely justified, yes there were no major tragedies, even so there was a melodramatic vibe throughout the entire drama. (melodramatic music, many ppl being perpetually unhappy etc, cinematography)
Song Hye-kyo was really amazing, maybe this was her best acting performance to date. Usually in kdramas I really hate interactions with foreigners, because both the foreign actors (seriously where do they get those ppl?) & the Korean actors speaking English all embarrass themselves so much, that I find it hard to watch, here however the Cuban scenes were surprisingly good. The foreigners spoke English naturally with a normal-ish Spanish accent & our main characters were also speaking like how I would expect a normal Korean to speak English in real life, it was actually believable. The secretary lady & that fat driver were also awesome!

I could go on and on about the positives, but the other reviewers already mentioned all the important points, so I'll just list what I did not like:
1, The ML looked like a female version of Matt Damon. I'm completely used to effeminate looking male Hallyu stars, but this was on another level. (too heavy on the lipstick YO!)
2, There is an insane amount of twisted logic, like that retarded clause ..
3, I didn't like any of the 3 mothers
4, The end of episode 13 was unnecessary & for me that alone made episodes 14 & 15 meaningless fillers.
5, There is that side character that only has one role, which is to recommend that W drink to his coworkers (and to us obviously).
6, The second ML hasn't had a single scene without having teary eyes, I hated his character even without this but ..
7, The ending could've been longer & more satisfying. (still it was ok)

I dropped this after 8 episodes, before resuming my watch months later.
I thought it became rather stale at that time, but the development picked up quite a bit in the second half.

There's nothing groundbreaking in the story and the writing is pretty average.
What saved this drama was the directing, which elevated the writing above what it was.
Chemistry was very good, which was unexpected for me since I couldn't see it by their visuals alone.
They make quite lovely onscreen couple, SHK and PBG.

I love love love the OSTs. Made way into my playlist which I kept on repeating for quite a while after I finished watching this drama.
Still listen to them sometimes now.

~Kim Jin Hyuk :One of the best k-drama male leads to ever exist. Gentle, non-toxic and supportive to the end
~The romance made me feel super fuzzy and happy. It was so intimate, pure and poetic even
~I wasn‚Äôt too impressed with the FL‚Äôs acting. I found her to be bland and expressionless.
~Slow paced at times and there is not much to the storyline except two people falling in love and trying to make it work among various externalities
~The mothers were really annoying and unlikeable, borderline controlling especially towards the FL. They were the biggest turnoffs in the plot line for me
~The plot drags towards the second half and you end up wishing there were more fillers to the story
~The Cuba scenes were amazing and what got me into the drama. Beautiful OST that matched with the cinematography.

I think the best way to review Encounter is to talk about episode one. Absolutely phenomenal opening episode (in fact, the show is pretty amazing until episode 13-ish). The best I've ever really seen from Korean Dramas. The rich cinematography is right on display with the beautiful scenery of Cuba and South Korea. The great introduction for our main leads, allowing us to learn their motivations and dreams outside of the environment we'll typically see them in. Soo Hyun and Jin Hyuk's introduction and how two opposite people are able to connect so beautifully in a neutral zone and develop intense feelings for each other. Despite age, class, circumstances being worlds apart. It was a strong beginning and Encounter is able to mix usual K-Drama tropes, such as disapproving rich in-laws, themes on social class and the typical break up at the end only for the couple to get together, with good storytelling, great down to earth acting and scintillating chemistry. And not just sexual chemistry either because it's not that. It's certain chemistry that makes you feel like they make each other happy as human beings. It comes off so well and makes the show worth watching without factoring other plots and characters. Encounter is far from one-note. Don't get me wrong. There is plenty to love in this series. And while the finishing episodes aren't quite as strong, There is a good chunk of quality.

This drama is a poem ??
If this drama is a poem, here's how I would love to write it:
The sun is about to set. You‚Äôve been holding on for too long.
It‚Äôs the right time to end it all, you think.
You‚Äôll be gone as soon as the sunset, you believe.
But as you close your eyes to surrender your pain and yourself to nothingness, he's there sitting next to you.
When you think you about to fall to the deep of the blue sea, he places your head to his shoulder.
That‚Äôs how you realize, the moon will keep you safe when it gets dark.
You could have some rest, forget about the world a little, but when you‚Äôre ready you could begin again.
The pain is there, but he and the night had helped you to heal, to become stronger, to walk with confidence since that encounter.

---

(Pardon my English skill, at least that's how I would describe this drama)

This drama shares the same feeling with painting or poetry. The narration doesn‚Äôt explain but visualizes the situation. It won‚Äôt be hard for you to put yourself in the main characters‚Äô shoes because it‚Äôs all written in all the details you find in the drama: the setting, color grading, OST and even the words that have been carefully chosen for each scene.

I used to avoid melodrama. I haven't‚Äô watched any melodrama before beside Something In The Rain and Be Melodramatic but I really love watching this one. This drama is so beautiful. Even though at some point I feel depressed, mostly it‚Äôs a beautiful thing that makes me cry throughout this drama. The main character of this drama makes me realize things I might have taken for granted and teach me how to be grateful. I feel like growing together with the female lead. That‚Äôs how strong the male lead character is. He is not that common ""manly"" type of man yet he makes you feel like being cheered up and protected. Overall, the mood of this drama is that time between sunset and sunrise spent with a hot cup of tea. I would love to rewatch again.

I know this review is so subjective. I‚Äôm just trying to be honest with my feeling because this drama feels so personal to me. You should definitely give it a shot, especially when you feel tired and discouraged.

Romantic story and that's it
Well I think the show is too long.
I don't agree with most reviews I saw because, for me, it is not a slow romance. The romance is there from episode 1 until the end. But...
Episodes were too long, almost nothing happened, only the way they deal with the pressure of society and family.
PLOT - good original idea but plot was very boring, with very dull Vilans...
Should have developed more the other actors
ACTING - good acting for me.
OST Interesting. It is always good listening Cuban music also
REWATCH? - Don't think so. It is frustrating the pace of the drama, not the love that is present, but the stupid pressure of all the surrounding actors.

The ending? If it is so slow, I think they should have deliver more closure. Also i think they could close the other relationships.
I don't understand why, in simple plot dramas, it is not so pragmatic the ending... Why leaving open relationships?

So far it's been a beautiful show and I find myself smiling like fool at the sweetness. Couldn't live off shows like (too much sweetness) this but I love it so far.

After finishing the show I still really liked it. Again, super sweet and a steady diet of these could probably get old. I loved the eagerness of the main male lead and the resoluteness of the female lead. You knew who these characters were and, for better or worse, they stayed true to that persona. They risk everything for each other even when you think that they aren't going to.

The secondary stories were good as well and kept things interesting. And I'm a sucker for beautiful cinematography so I was captivated. The music was good as well, I liked the music while they are in Cuba since it's closer to my heart. I also liked how they tied the two countries together in an interesting way as opposed to just the place where they met.

There was a stall (most shows have them) near the end but the wrap up was sweet and perfect and made me happy. I love happy endings.

First thing about this drama is the acting of both the actors park bogum and song hye kyo , they both depicted their roles amazingly. The emotions of sadness,endurance ,happiness ,anger,love depicted perfectly. Not only by them and also by the supporting characters.

The drama is slow romance , the screenplay was well written that unfolds how crush or likeness on one person turns into love and it flows like smoothly like a river.

Big mention is to the ost and background score which makes drama more beautiful. In some places it makes the simple scene into more beautiful one.

Some of the scenes gives excitement to the heart. For me it is exactly in 3 scenes .
1. The jin hyuk reponse in front of all people to cha so hyun.
2. The cha so hyun reponse in front of all reporters to jin hyuk.
3. The decision made by cha so hyun when its comes between jin hyuk and ex-husband family meeting.
p.s : To know what decisions were made ,viewers have to see the drama and check it whether you also get excited at those scenes.

Lastly, the role played by the camera it took some nice pictures .

Most of them likes a love story to have a happy ending and this drama gives that happiness to the viewers.

Mehhhh!!!!!!
Sorry folks, thought I‚Äôd love this one because of the cast but it flopped for me. I loved the scenery from Cuba and the artwork but the story fell flat for me. The MFL could have done a better job in her role and I feel like at that age she should have a bit more confidence in herself, especially with all of her achievements. I do understand the abuse she suffered from the ex-in-laws would have left it‚Äôs mark but still I feel like she could have done the role better.
Music was, from memory, enjoyable and fit the scenes.
Rewatch value I have to say I‚Äôll probably never rewatch this one again. Unlike ‚ÄúOh My Venus‚Äù or ‚ÄúRain or Shine‚Äù or even ‚ÄúStong Girl Bong Soon‚Äù I have too many other favorites to rewatch than to sit down and torture myself with this one. I do apologize to those who absolutely loved this one but it‚Äôs just my opinion and taste. ?

The visual of this drama is astonishing, no one can argue with me about that. Everything here is beautiful, the animation, the song, the scenery, the actors, each shot is a beauty. The features of Cuba made me want to go there and fall in love.

Encounter‚Äôs plot is not new to us. It‚Äôs all about two people who loved each other despite the age difference, lifestyle and status in life. It is mostly used in any dramas- US against the world. I was hoping for more creative values and significance of the story which I believe it doesn‚Äôt disappoint me. A definite yes for executions of the show, you will hate the rascals and you will sympathize the protagonist. You want to embrace the possibility that love conquers all.

What I don‚Äôt like about this drama are the slow pacing and some repetitive scenes and arguments. To be honest, I got bored in the middle, almost to give up ‚Äì but what can I say, I must endure the tedium to witness the happy endings.

Romantic Show
Encounter was ineffable. I felt like I encountered a unique, soul searching romantic sensory. Just watch the show.
The cast did a fantastic job. This type of story is tough to pull off and make it believable. I believe they have achieved it. The story flows effortlessly.
I love the Go Chang Suk and Shin Soo Yeon character.
I do have a problem with the last episode. Usually this has to be spot on otherwise it will ruin the whole show. The writer had so many ways to end the show which could added more closure. The writer/director chose the vanilla version. Ending could have put the whole show on a pedestal. But it did not. I am a bit disappointed. This show still earns 10 stars from me because there is more to this show than just the ending.
It is difficult to pull off a show without any flaws. This show had it own share of flaws that does not mean it wasn't good.

Encounter is the perfect drama for romance drama lovers. This drama made me smile a lot and I'm so glad I watched it. Actually I was hesitant to watch it at first after reading some reviews about how the drama is slow, have too many flashbacks and how it could've been shortened to 12-14 episodes.

In the end, I gave in and decided to watch it as I was curious about what type of chemistry Park Bogum and Song Hye Kyo would bring to this drama. And anyway, those 2 names are enough to get me curious to give it a go.
And I must say I am incredibly surprised at how much I enjoyed this drama.

What I Liked:
THE CHARACTERS: yes the story is slow paced and that's because it's actually a drama that gives more focus on building the characters than the story it self and I think that's why the pace worked for me. The drama itself was about the journey of love between Jin Hyuk and Cha Soo-Hyun. The back story of Soo-Hyun was exactly that, just a back story to give it some tension (if that). In terms of the chemistry, I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two. I never once thought it was awkward or forced. I thought both actors did such an amazing job with their acting as well, especially in the emotional heavy scenes, you could really feel their pain and heartache.

OST: I'm a sucker for drama OSTs and I loved the OST in this, that fact that there were some in English made me appreciate it a bit more and I found myself singing along to them whenever they came on :D That aside, the soundtrack definitely worked well with the scenes and added extra emotional impact to them on top of the already incredible actors.

EDITING/CINEMATOGRAPHY: The flashbacks in the reviews I read about before watching this drama was what worried me the most before watching it. I don't like watching too many flash backs.. However, having completed the drama, I must say that those were actually very well done and I actually really liked them. The flashbacks were edited in during certain scenes that gives extra impact to the 'present' scene. And actually in some of them it makes the 'present' scene even stronger as it shows the reasons why Cha Soo-Hyun or Jin Hyuk are doing certain things.
I especially thought the retro-photo style and the fairytale animations were a great touch too. The photo style obviously reflecting Jin Hyuk's love for photography, whilst the fairytale animations reflect the fairytale-like story between the 2 characters.

What I Didn't Like:
-The turnout from the backstory of Cha Soo Hyun with Taegyong Group/Chairwoman Kim was underwhelming. It seemed like the climax of the story was going to be from the them but nothing major actually ever happens. I felt like Woo-Seok's character was a wasted character that was really just to give the slightest bit of tension between the 2 main leads.

-Aside from that, there's not really a lot to dislike about this drama. Would I watch it again? Probably not but I'm glad that I DID watch it cause it made me smile and made me feel happy. I love romantic dramas with happy endings the most and this just ticked the box. The only reason I wouldn't watch it again is that I don't think it will have the same effect to me if I watched it for a 2nd time. So I'd rather keep the good vibes that it left me after watching it for the first time.

Would I recommend it?
Definitely! BUT only if you like romantic dramas and don't mind a slower pace. If you like feeling giddy/flustered over the main characters romance then yes. If you like seeing character development/growth, then yes.

I finally got around to watching this and honestly, Park Bo Gum's smiling face as male lead Kim Jin Hyuk was probably the only thing that got me through this.

While this was a nice, slow-paced romantic series, I was disappointed in the writing of the female character Cha Soo Hyun played by Song Hye Kyo. I felt like her character lacked any real depth or personality. She plays a guarded CEO mostly throughout the entire series. In the end, I wondered why Jin Hyuk even liked or fell in love with her. There wasn't enough to her personality to make her a loveable character. Most of the time, I either felt sorry or pitied her or just felt uninterested.

This is a story of a guy who chases a girl to the end of the world and you have no idea why.

Very predictable and little chemistry


7.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2018/2019 South Korean television romance drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.

Cha Soo-hyun (Song Hye-kyo), has lived life in the spot light serving as a poster child for her politician father. Her mother, who sees her daughter as a pawn to further her husband‚Äôs political career, marries her off to a chaebol whose family has wealth and power sufficient to support her families‚Äò political ambitions. The loveless marriage soon falls apart when Soo-hyun‚Äôs husband declares he wants to marry one of the women he had been having an affair with. There are conditions to the divorce on both sides, Soo-hyun‚Äôs mother-in-law insists she continue to attend family gatherings until her son remarries. Soo-Hyun requests to be CEO of a hotel owned by the family which is on the verge of failing financially. Soo-Hyun makes the hotel so successful that she goes to Cuba to strike a deal to expand her hotel brand. It is while there that she has several chance encounters with Kim Jin-hyuk (Park Bo-gum), who saved doing part time jobs for a fun filled trip too Cuba before returning to South Korea and settling int his career. Soo-Hyun takes an impulsive trip out without her staff to see a highly recommended beach sunset and winds up being pick pocketed and stranded. She asks Jin-Hyuk to help her and they wind up spending a spontaneous and eventful evening together. They planned a good bye meeting the next morning but Soo-Hyun gets delayed and they return to South Korea separately thinking they are unlikely to see each other again. Fate has a say though and Jin-Hyuk‚Äôs new job is with Soo-hyun‚Äôs company. Differences in age, social class, and her ex in laws and parents desire for her to remarry her former spouse all stand in the way of the developing romance. Can the two overcome all the obstacles?

spoilers** Overall I would characterize this as boring. It wasn‚Äôt bad but it wasn‚Äôt particularly good either. The entire story line was very very predictable. When they were in Cuba it was slightly interesting as it was intriguing knowing neither one of them really knew who the other one was so there was anticipation in that. Also, in Cuba, they were doing some interesting things in that cultural space. When they were back in South Korea there was a moment of uncertainty when it turned out he worked for her and her company and when he had to go to an office farther away. The female lead character had a very ‚Äúflat‚Äù personality. It was supposed to be due to her upbringing but, other than a few more smiles, the character did not change or grow significantly. It made it hard to understand why the magnanimous male character would be so madly in love with her. I thought that her conflict with her ex‚Äòs family would turn out to be a way bigger deal than it actually wound up being. The fact that her father took care of it made the entire struggle leading up to that kind of a mute point. Even their small break up was very predictable and the fact that they got back together even more predictable. If it seems like I‚Äôm using the word predictable a lot it‚Äôs very intentional there were no major surprises or twists which for me made the story very ho-hum. His mom and her actions is something you would expect within the context of a Korean drama yet I still found it very mean and irritating. I know it‚Äôs the American in me that finds the way parents in Korean dramas interfere in the lives of their children annoying. When it is just them disapproving and working on their own child it is one thing but when they harm someone else emotionally it is just abusive. I was disappointed he was not angry with his mom about it. The father was and I liked that. I was glad she finally came around but it was almost too late. Not one I would rewatch or recommend unless someone is a serious fan of one of the leads or just likes very predictable romantic dramas.

i came into this drama for BoGum but im having my first girl crush for HyeKyo eonnie! she is stunning! i can't stop looking at her!

first, the cinematography technic is first class, i was mesmerized from the first episode but i was worried how can this drama continue to provide me more of this once the storyline is brought back to where MLs meet with reality but i was not dissapointed! i absolutely love how they use the camera technic for angle and focus! someone hv to credit this cameraman!

second, is the animation artwork! a shoutout to the artist that make the artwork for the intro on every eps. my habit now is to checkout every element in the artwork. it was so beautifully crafted that ive started to follow the artist on sns!

third, ost. it matched the storyline, feeling and flow perfectly and im still waiting on two more quality soundtrack that has yet to be release! the score doesnt disrupt the flow unlike most ost/bgm does in kdrama. i believe in the power of editing and score that will either give impact or destroy the flow entirely and this drama editing is almost flawless!

fourth, casting! the first choice for the role is BoGum and HyeKyo eonnie and they were right! not only they are perfect for the role but it seems impossible for any other actor can bring such vibe since both ML actors has brought a huge aura that fit the role like a glove! most supporting actors are on point! im sure if i nitpick scene by scene, i will find some flaw but the editing is so good that everybody blended so well with the storyline.

fifth, storyline. everybody have doubt, even me. but i respect BoGum's choice and i trust HyeKyo eonnie's decision. and im yet to be dissapointed. the storyline flow so elegantly i feel like im falling in love head over heel for this drama. melodrama is not my fave genre to say the least (i actually stay away from melodrama) but this drama storyline break so many normal cliche scenes that shocked me to the roof every single week. of course the storyline between SooHyun xMIL, mother and father is cliche in kdramaland but SooHyun and JinHyuk chars actually break the norm for kdramaland! Their chars is crafted so elegantly that audience has become completely invested on their growth!

this is only 6 episode in and im looking forward for next week episode on how the story develop. so far, im giving a master class review here, hoping for the following week story development with further blow my expectation for this drama. Cheers!

I'm sure you've heard this line before when a boyfriend dumps his girlfriend...""it's not you...it's me.  This drama had a great storyline, the cinematography excellent and it fits right up my ""all I want in a drama"" category.  But...in spite of all the positives that I gleaned from watching the first few episodes, I could not continue.  I know, it's not the drama....it's me.  I felt Park Bo Gum was miscast.  He's too young and his face, although handsome, was a little bit effeminate for the role.  Song Hye Kyo as Cha Soo Hyun portrayed a character so controlled and stoic so I thought that what she needed was a more passionate man that would awaken her from the placidness of her life.  The encounter or love story between Cha Soo Hyun and Kim Jin Hyuk lacked the intensity I expected and without that, the rest of the drama became a meh for me.  There was a total lack of chemistry and they looked more like an elder sister and younger brother.  I'm not concerned about the age gap because it does work if the characters have the right chemistry to make it work (to this day My Name is Kim Sam Soon is still my favourite K drama).  A So Ji Sub, Jo In Sung (think What Happened in Bali where both were fighting over the same woman)  or a Lee Dong Gun (Love Now) would have been perfect for the role.  They're not only gorgeous but they have the depth and ferocity to portray a man deeply in love with SHK's character.

Great chemistry with great main leads
I adore this drama too much. I must admit that I watched it for the sake of SHK and PBG in a first place, but it turns out differently when I first saw the drama. The cinematography is great with a really great music. The music background makes me understand the character's feeling. It makes me fall so deeply because it so damn beautiful music I've ever heard. I know it's a mellow-drama, but I wish a happy ending for both Jin Hyuk and Soo Hyun. Soo Hyun really deserves freedom to melt her cold personality, and Jin Hyuk could make the ice queen into the smiley queen whenever he near. I wish they meet their happy ending

(update)
Yes. There is happy ending.

i think i'm going to be the black sheep
when i read the summary i said to my self wow this is going to be brilliant new story

normal guy with rich elder women
then i watched :\

the main idea really was great but i think the director spoiled it cause it becomes really
very very very very slow motion drama and very detailed without real events starting from ep. 02 and repetitive

even the problems they faced wasn't serious or critical for me as it should be in reality

even the kissing scenes i didn't feel cause i thought it wasn't in it's place
like when he should just kiss her a forehead kiss he kissed her on lips
when he should hug her he just hold her hands ..etc
many times i found the romance in it lukewarm and cold which was really depressing

i liked bo gum acting sooooooo even i react a lot with his crying at ep. 14/15
i really loved his character
it was so cute and lovely but i saw it wasn't for facing strong powerful family as it should be
i thought he must be more strict & strong character than that
i saw him soft and cute most of the time

in the contrary i found hye kyo so strong till the limit of no face expressions many times
she should be more soft than that
cause love changes the character

i really loved the events between them in Cuba
these were the most lovely scenes in the drama

many characters affected their love a lot and that bothered me much

this story was detailed and shallow at the same time

i didn't enjoy much and this was really frustrating

but i liked the message it delivered
in-spite of your age difference, marital status and family materialistic level you've the right to love and be loved

I started watching the series only because of the Lead Actress - Song Hye-kyo. I am saying this, i was-am still completely mesmerized by her. Didn't like the MALE lead though (felt like i was watching romance between two girls). No offend to the Male lead but he was more girlish in his looks behavior and yes, a bis yes, his smile - too girl like. I tried my best to only focus on Song Hye-kyo and for the most most part i did, but looking at the guy,.... Everyone has their own preferences. I left the series mid way, as it was loosing interest in the story as the romance didnt attract me. I was not drawn in by the story. Thts it folks. Enjoy.

i am sorry i needed to write review even without watching the whole drama.
well,when the korean drama industry was way too much obsessed with"" rich man and poor woman"" concept ,this particular drama did a reverse in roles with rich woman and poor man.
the story -is simple and beautiful .nothing too twisted except for the MFL's in-laws.two people meet in an unknown city,makes beautiful memory and says goodbye without knowing that after this their lives are gonna be tangled together and then they meet again, that's how their story begins.simple story but still addictive on it's own way.

visual-(10/10)i am sorry i needed to add this here.cause this drama is probably one of the dramas with best scenario of 2018.

acting-NO NEED TO SAY.THIS IS A DRAMA WITH PROFESSIONAL ACTORS.(lol)park bogum's smile is enough for me to melt and song hye kyo is so beautiful.her acting is so flawless that u can't help feeling sorry for her character.also it's not possible to mention every single actor so i will say they all did very well in playing their role.

music-good.(especially the background song during the sunset scene at ep 1)[spoiler]

overall-Nice.definitely needed this kinda (soothing) drama before the end of the year.u will understand if u watch it.

now the things i loved-EVERYTHING.especially,park bogum's smile,song hye kyo's asking -do u have some money?
things i hated-nothing until now .i first hated the in-laws but now i believe this is what makes the story interesting(i mean come on we need a villain ,right?)

The Best drama of this Year
""Encounter ""
SHK is very beautiful, attractive and professional as the best Cha Soo Hyun role should be.
PBG always act natural in his progress role boyfriend, I always love him, he did very good in
Kim Jin Hyuk
I realized that it is the most wonderful time in all appisodes they played together.
I also love all actors in all appisodes too.
Love the action and words they act, very impressive style, not marketing.
Thanks for this Wonderful Series.

I have come really close, really REALLY close, but I've never given a drama all 10s so easily before. It's not because it's perfect, but it's because I loved every single episode from beginning to the end. The cast is Amazing, and includes some of my now favorite KDrama characters EVER! The story was totally different than any other romcom I've seen, and kept me fully engaged from the beginning until the end. My rewatch score is an easy 10, since I was often tempted to rewatch episodes immediately while waiting impatiently for new episodes to come out. The music has been on steady rotation in my playlist too.

Most people will be skeptical that this drama deserves all the praise it will likely get, I know I would be. A common question has been, ""Is it really that good?"". Umm... YES. The answer is YES, in ALLCAPS.

Let's start at the beginning, which most people call slow, but I was completely fascinated from the very first scene. I had a friend who was a sound editor, and I always thought the job was so fascinating, but I love the way they weave that element in throughout the show. I think it's the attention to details like that that makes this drama stand out more than others. Add the psychic premonition/flash forward element to that, and I was hooked for sure. I just had to know what was going to happen next.

I think the writing was really extraordinary in how they married all the different genres together without ever totally losing it's charm. Watching it felt like being on a roller coaster. I liked the ebb and flow of the story... Some moments are cute, some intense, some are passionate, some are heartbreaking, then frustrating, then suddenly hilarious... In telling the story of a mature and truly complicated relationship, they never settle on sticking to one approach for too long. Some people who joined in for the romance may get annoyed during the depressing & frustrating parts, and those looking for suspense probably got bored during the extra romantic moments, but I was too invested in the story to ever be bored, and I knew the story would never stay on one type of moment for too long. I know that personally that ""surfing"" shirt kept haunting my dreams... One can criticize certain parts of the story for not being realistic, but being real is not my criteria for a great drama. In fact, the only other drama I could see myself giving perfect 10s to is Secret Garden, for most of the same reasons, and that is definitely not a drama that relies on being ""real"". All the authenticity this drama needs comes from the portrayal of the characters.

Seo Hyun Jin as Regular Oh Hae Yeong, and Eric Moon as Do Kyeong, are not the ideal dream couple on paper. They are emotionally damaged, dysfunctional, and certainly imperfect, but I fell in love with both characters as they fell in love with each other. Regular Oh Hae Yeong's vulnerability broke my heart, and yet inspired me. Do Kyeong's guarded personality was frustrating, and yet I was completely empathetic towards him. The banter in the beginning was fun, their chemistry is perfect, the intensity of their intimacy got me in the feels, and they have the best KDrama kisses EVER. Seriously... ever. No need to fear them touching lips together while standing awkwardly. Eric plays repressed so well, that you would never think that he had it in him. I definitely swooned several times. I am a romcom fam, and have a lot of favorite couples, but they definitely leaped their way to the top couples on my list.

Then there is the rest of the cast. If I could give higher than 10 to some of the supporting cast I would.

Regular Hae Young's parents are the best parents in dramaland... FACT. The family moments were equally touching and laugh out loud funny. Kim Mi Kyung is just so good, and Lee Han Wi balanced her out perfectly. Any scene with them in it was automatically a good one.

The rest of the supporting cast were all 10s, or close enough, and there are way too many too mention, but shout out to the bromancemobile!

Jeon Hye Bin, and Lee Jae Yoon didn't have to rest of being attractive. They each had complicated characters who had me rooting against them while totally feeling sorry for them. I admit that I HATED Pretty Oh Hae Young, but that's because she played her part so well. Tae Jin was much more sympathetic, but both of them made the complicated love dilemma work well.

Kim Ji Suk, Heo Jeong Min, and Heo Young Ji all had very fun & memorable characters, but the true MVP of this whole drama to me is Ye Ji Won. She is my power animal! I had no idea, in her first scenes, how much I would end up adoring her character. Even If the story sucked, and the rest of the cast sucked, I would still be glued to the screen waiting to see what kind of shenanigans she would do next. I don't want to even slightly spoil any of her moments, because the surprise randomness of it is what makes it comic genius. I need to stalk her in something else. If you know of any dramas where she is particularly awesome, please let me know!

I already mentioned rewatch value, but just to be clear, I am tempted to rewatch the whole thing right now. I'll try to wait longer before I watch it again, but I will, without a doubt, be watching it all again... and again.

The music is now my one of my favorite OSTs. I listen to certain songs over and over and never get tired. What Is Love is too cute, and I love that Seo Hyun Jin is singing! Ben's Like a Dream started playing in a store and had me singing along like I know the words... no, I do not speak Korean, much less sing in Korean. Maybe I by Roy Kim is like musical crack. Needless to say, the OST is really good.

Overall, I don't know what I am going to do with my Mondays & Tuesdays now that it's over. I rarely watch on air dramas, but I am so glad I watched this one. I think it was worth it from beginning to end, and yes I did like the ending, but I won't say too much about it other than that I thought it was... in it's own way... perfect ; )

So yes I recommend it very highly. I think a romcom hater, or a melodrama hater, or a suspense hater could all agree that there is surprisingly a little something for everyone. I also loved the message at the end.

Now excuse me while I make some room for this drama, and it's cast on my favorites lists.

I'm very glad about my drama trade I did with another MDL user because it made me watch this little gem, that I surely would have never touched on my own. The summary and the promotional covers never piqued my interest before.
 
There are so many things that I love about this story. First of all is the idea in itself. They did a pretty good job with explaining the visions, making them convincing without making it look too much out of space. With the same pace Do Kyung was getting an idea of what was actually happening to him, it made me understand it step by step, too.

The way the romance was emerging. From the original setup to the new one. Well explained and real. I got a pretty good feel of how deep their emotions were growing and I liked the idea of ""fate"" here. I loved how that whole relationship was developing, even though they sometimes seemed a little foolish. But that's what love actually is, right? Acting against all logic and not getting bothered about other people's opinions. What makes you really happy and how do you want to spend that one life you got?

I was dying with pleasure seeing all that skinship. It felt comfortable and real and made me very, very happy. When it seemed like their pent up emotions were finally exploding, I felt the same. I'm a sucker for hugs and here are so many tight embraces that I wish I had someone near me who would hug me just at the same time, lol. And their kisses... Don't get me started with those. All these things are one big part of what made this romance so intense and beautiful.

The acting was very impressive. Eric blew me away. His character drew me in to a point where I couldn't stop but root for him all the way, no matter what he did. I saw his remorse, I felt his misery and I enjoyed his approach to slowly change himself and become happy, no matter the outcome. Same goes for Seo Hyun Jin. Her despair, her hunger for love and her feeling of betrayal of life itself were crushingly unfeigned.

There is some really strong writing in this drama. Some dialogues had a big impact on me and made my heart flutter all of a sudden so many times. The story did a pretty good job at riling up my emotions in every way possible.

I also loved the side stories. Interesting characters even though some of them were a little exaggerated. I enjoyed them nevertheless. Do Kyung's sister was one hell of a person. Her on/ff modes were hilarious but what I loved the most was that no matter what, she stuck to her family, supporting them in her own way whether blood-related or not and was always like a guardian. I also loved Hae Young's parents. Although her mother was really, REALLY stubborn towards the end, I enjoyed the time when she was silently giving in, showing that she truly loved her daughter and wanted her to be happy.

About the two second leads here...
Well, I didn't really care for their stories while watching the drama. Now, at the end... Well, of course they had their reasons for behaving the way they did. The other Oh Hay Young... as the story went on, her character became more palpable and explained some things, but it didn't change the fact that I couldn't care less. She had her chance, she blew it. End of story. Han Tae Jin... same goes for him and on top of that he was a petty loser. He couldn't accept the facts, acting all childish, throwing one tantrum after another. Do Kyung and him both did wrong. But at the point where Do Kyung realized his mistake, Tae Jin blamed others and continued his raving, staying blinded by his anger.

The ones I disliked till the end were Do Kyung's mom and Chairman Jang. No further explaining. Just stating that fact.

If there's one thing to complain about, it would be the dragging in the middle and until ep 16. I know that every scene and every moment were important for the story and can't be considered fillers. But I still think that they could have made some things a little shorter and not putting me in such agony >.< (although it makes you wonder if I would have gotten riled up about it with the same intensity, if they HAD made it shorter, right? Haha...)

In the end a very, very enjoyable roller-coaster with many memorial moments. Lots of emotions, lots of ups and downs and very satisfying in the end.

I am sorry to say that this drama was a total waste of my time. The lead actress was so off putting. she had a serious case of inferiority complex. I felt so bad for her ex-fianc√©. For someone she claimed to love and was about to marry, she wasn't curious about him at all. even when she found out the whole story, all she cared about was playing the victim. The lead male character was so forgettable. apart from his job there wasn't anything else interesting about him. The other characters were poorly written with alcohol as the most important binding factor.

i really didn't like this drama. there are so many things that pissed me off that i don't know what to begin with. maaany loose ends with the script.
from the start it seemed like everyone had a problem with alcohol which seemed like a lazy excuse to put the whole story together at first so it could develop from that. it gets boring watching all of the characters having the same behavior. they could've been more creative about it. also i felt like the drama wouldn't end until all of the female characters had humiliated themselves for the guys they were in love with. all of them seemed desperate and crazy in this drama and it had me feeling ANGRY most of the time. i can't imagine someone begging to be loved in real life like OHY did with PDK who seemed to have zero interest in her for most part of the drama. i hated the lead character, i was always thinking ""girrrl dont be stupid, this guy doesn't want you MOVE ON there's others out there!!"". OHY had no self confidence or respect for herself, always playing the desperate fool. i don't think its a nice thing to watch, it was really uncomfortable, it was like she was really depressed and holding onto people and feelings that were only destructive for her. in real life these sort of things doesn't lead to a happy ending.
also it never really explained what was the relation that the old singer on the TV had with park do kyung, there isn't really a connection between them, that is one more thing that was messy and lazy about the script.
and it ends out of nowhere, so everyone who has the incredible amount of patience required to watch this show until the end will get to disappoint themselves with how hurried and messy was the work done by the writers of this show, making everything happen in like the last 5 minutes of the drama, and not showing anything about how everything turned out for the other characters beside the main couple.
all of that said, the cast was good, actors made a good job but it wasn't enough to save the horrible script.

I will preface this review by stating that I'm not a fan of romantic comedy. I am a fan of the cast and decided to watch it. Another mIss Oh has an interesting adult plot that takes from the normal Korean cliches but puts a little twist on it. I don't usually like comedy. Mostly because I don't find things that other people find funny to be funny to me. However, this drama kills it with the comedy. I laughed so hard sometimes. Once when I was at work and people probably thought I was crazy. There are also great meanings as to live each day as if it were your last and you never know where life will lead. I like that for all the crazy of the story it seems real. Partly because of the story, but mostly because of the acting.

The Acting...I don't know where to begin. Usually I would start with the leads, but I have to start with Ye Ji Won as Park Soo Kyeong [Do Kyeong's sister]. She is awesome. For as outlandish as her character is, I felt like she was real and I so wanted to be her friend. I can't say too much because of spoilers, but I love where the writer went with her character. Seo Hyun Jin is also amazing as the one and only (at least in my mind) Oh Hae Yeong. Her forthright character that felt with such honesty was a breath of fresh air. So many times in a drama a character will hide their feelings. Not Her. She feels from her soul. I respect that in people. Eric was also good as Park Do Kyeong as he tries to navigate the confusion and visions that in the end help him look at life in a different and I would even go so far as to say in a more positive way. Ahhh...Kim Ji Suk. I so love him. He is so funny as Lee Ji Sang. Rooftop Party Rooftop Party

Music is good. Some of it really good.

I might rewatch this sometime.

I recommend this to all romance lovers...It is a really nice drama.

This is my first time ever in my whole 15 years experience watching kdrama; in the end of the drama I casually and with no regret say, ""I don't respect the first female-male lead character!"".

At first I like to watch this drama because its plot was 80-90% just the same with My Name is Kim Sam Soon (2005). That drama get Daesang at Baeksang Award and MBC Daesang for Kim Sun Ah (female lead). I kind of reviving again my memory when watching this drama. Same big framework and plot but different detail.

But I started to get irritated when there were many weird things happened...First of all, character twists(?) and unfortunately the worst one came to the first lead cast, both male and female. I started to question: ""Does her character all this time actually was just a childish-impulsive-destructive-selfish-disrespectfully toward parent-victim mentality-no self-respect woman?"" Until the end there is no asking- forgiveness-thing from GOHY to her mom. I am so so disappointed at her character. And also the everlasting fickle-wishy-washy kind first male lead. Giving no certainty not even after GOHY mother speak out her concerns.

For me, the best character in this drama is GOHY mother (I am quite sure most of the viewer agree with me)..and the second one goes to Isadora - Jinsung couple (this might be optional but I think many of them also agree with me) ^_^v well cast ranking end on second place..since if I carry on I might spill out some spoilers v^_^v

Anyway, not just about first lead's character, the story was too draggy and pleonastic. So many unnecessary scenes were put in. And lastly, even though this drama has a happy ending the process on to that end was too lousy. If this is a before-2010 drama I might understand and receive it as a lack of experience or knowledge or technology on how to create it as real as possible. But today is 2016..where has they're been for this time..even if they are just a debut prod.crew...(@_@)

I still put a quite high score for the acting/cast because imho there is not much complains about the cast's acting..lead-supporting-or cameo..even though some might have lack in here and there. No low soundtrack rating too because even though this drama follows the adding-funny-sound trend but the song track were good. For me this mess happened because of the awful script developing and directing =/ .

This drama offered new takes on old themes. We have many clich√©s here (the-more-beautiful love rival, a rich guy who is anti-social, a stupid chaebol-mom, a ""mystery"" etc.).

HOWEVER, all of this is depicted in quite a new way: the love rival is actually a nice person and isn't bitchy at all, the rich guy is not THAT rich - just normal - and his anti-social behaviour is totally believable and not over the top. The chaebol-mom isn't really one, but tries to be.

And there are many other aspects, that felt fresh: The main woman's parents, esp. the mom, were no minor roles and showed some hair-wrenching parts of family life. The horny attorny (yeah, you read that right) with the older sister and their wonderfull outlandishly behaviour.
The female and male leads were totally believable imo - I know the actors from interviews and I couldn't see them past their roles. I believed all of it, and even the falling-in-love happened so gradually, esp. for the man, that for once it was real.

The mystery of his visions was really interesting and they even tried to explain it.

The humour - oh, this was awesome. It was a really new kind of humour that I haven't encountered like this in any drama before. It was at the same time crazy but realistic.

The only time I was a bit unnerved was when the back-and-forth between the couple got a little bit too frequently. It was still believable, not artificially emotional as in many other dramas, but still. Thank God, that resolved rather quickly when the guy decided to do what has to be done.

I really think, that I will rewatch it, especially for the humour and this one freakishly awesome kiss-scene.... ^^

All my stars are for Seo Hyun Jin, because I really really love her as an actress.
The overall acting was quite good, but... I spent most of the time hating the story and where it was obviously heading to. Many reviews already mentioned the issue about the lack of self-respect of the main female character, OHY. I would also add that, personally, I don't find either romantic nor forgivable the fact that the male lead basically destroyed the lives of OHY and her fianc√© and, regardless, he did even manage to get the girl. I didn't like the male lead character AT ALL, and hated that she fell in love with a such a douchebag. This fact distracted me and made me forget about the funny moments in this drama, to the point that I will never watch it again, because it really gets on my nerves.

The characters make me empathize so much. I've been crying at least once almost every episode for them. Happy when something good happens and despairing when they are unhappy. Very, very well written and directed ensemble. Nice pacing of what is essentially a none story. The supernatural elements are just a spice to make the story move along and catalyst for emotional development. The visions are few and far between, so you tend to forget that this show has supernatural sides.

What should be a ""nothing special"" TV series, is in fact a very well done drama about people in love, personal relationships and emotional development. Excellent acting, brilliant directing and good paced script. The final episode has the BEST END CREDIT SCENE EVER! ??

Setting aside my orange colored bias for this review....

I've been in a drama slump for more than a year now, dropping more than I've completed. I started watching out of support for my leadernim, but didn't have high hopes. I was pleasantly surprised as the characters and the actors' portrayals kept me interested through all 18 episodes (though the extension was definitely not needed).

Set with the premise of Park Do Kyung (Eric) being able to see his future (or past?), it may have seemed unrealistic on paper, but the writing and direction were well done in that it added to the story of his falling in love. The side characters definitely helped the drama with well developed subplots of their own, adding humor to otherwise serious scenes.

My only disappointment would be with the cause of Do Kyung's visions not being fully explained. I admit it lost a bit of steam after Ep 14, but not enough for me to skip as I normally do when I feel a drama stretching itself. It recovers nicely however and you continue to root for everyone, including the second leads.

Growing up with a common name (There were 6 other people with my same name in high school), I get it. Oh Hae Young's reactions towards the so called prettier one were natural. I was also happy to see both Hae Young's perspectives of each other by the end.

I recommend this drama for the acting, Eric's expressive eyes, the laughs, the kisses, and the love.

This is a story about fate, about love, about overcoming heartache and changing ones fate with the decisions you make. For me, i connected with the story and the characters.
From episode 2 onwards this drama was so engaging and its charm and unique take along with a brilliant cast quickly becomes addictive. Initially you find plain Hae Young to be quite pitiful. You find Do Kyeong to be cold and even a little hateful. But as the story unfolds and the push pull between them as well as fate throwing them together you start to care about them as individuals learning to heal and then rooting them as a couple.
Hae Young goes down in K drama history as one of the best female character, not because shes strong or badass but because of her fearless and even shamelessly adorkable way she throws herself wholeheartedly in love. Despite being burn after being dumped a day before her wedding, she promised the next time she will love wholeheartedly. Needless to say wearing ones heart on the sleeves means embarrassment, sometimes disappointment and more heartache. But these are also the qualities that attracted Do Kyung who although initially guilt ridden becomes fascinated and even disarmed by Hae Young's frank and direct nature.
Along with this romance, we have bromance between Do Kyung and bestfriend Jin Sang, Do Kyung and brother Park Hoon and Do Kyung and his sound team workers. All generated good vibes and laughs. Then theres the family love of Hae Young and her wonderful parents who make you cry and feels the warmth of family like you've been hugged. Finally you get a second romance of noona Soo Kyung and Jin Sang. So this drama is full of heart.
What further separates this drama is the out of this world chemistry between Hyo Jin and Eric.They share shy smiles, lover's embrace and sweet to sizzling kisses. Most of all they look really comfortable and believable. I enjoy all the simple moments of them together like walks on the beach, cuddle in front of the tv watch movies and cooking for each other. Theres some cheesiness but it wasnt too bad.
By the end of this drama i still have the warm fuzzies. The biggest take away message is to live with no regrets, like today is your last day. The impeding death visions allowed Do Kyung to open up and learn to love. His character has the most growth.
Honestly after episode 11 and the extension decision, the drama did lose some of its groove and spark. But episode 17 and 18 really lifts it back up along with my spirits.

In terms of ost theres quite a few tracks that are memorable, touching and suit the scenes.
In terms of picture this drama had some of the most beautiful cinematography. Spring is captured in full beauty.
In terms of sound because Do Kyeong is a sound director (what an awesome job) it also makes me appreciate that element.
In terms of clothing, i thought Hae Young's wardrobe kept improving. And like she says love makes her prettier.
In terms of hair, finally Do kyung gel up his hair in the last scene. He looks hotter that way instead of bangs

Rewatch value is high and thats a big plus in my book since i seldom rewatch but theres too many wonderful scenes in this drama. The plot is not without flaws and the characters aren't perfect but then is life ever perfect. This drama just push alot of the right buttons for me. Its a matter of taste but to me theres really a good balance of many things but still emphasizing the beauty of love. Sometimes its that simple: make your loved ones happyn and you are happy.

I know there are alot of haters on this drama, however, this drama is one of the few dramas that I'm happy I got a chance to experience. the cast and acting has been top notch. the story was a little cliche but the acting more than made up for it.
the plot was relateable, real, funny, sad, but most of all FUN!!
it gave me feels like I haven't had since my first drama.
Its worth a watch.
that is all.

This is a truly refreshing drama and it is different from most dramas. Lately, there has been this new wave in Korean drama industry and the dramas are starting to slowly evolve onto a new level, dealing with much deeper and harder issues, that were taboo in the old dramas. It's even hard to say what is the main theme of this drama, it's rather a mix of everything: comedy, melodrama, romance, some action and a bit of revenge. Along with love problems the drama also deals with past traumas, shows what parents go through because of their children and other stuff that deal with different aspects of life. This is a realistic show that has an ability to tug at your heartstrings.

The story is simple but engaging, at least until the episode 10 or so when it becomes draggy. The 2-episode extension didn't bring anything new to the drama but only stretched it and added to the boring aspects. The director does a great job pinpointing every character's pain and happiness, there is a lot of beautiful scenery and cinematography is superb. But unfortunately, the movie-like aspects soon become boring and slow down the drama a lot. It this was a 10 episode drama it would have deserved 10 points in all aspects but there are too many repetitive scenes and a lot of crying in almost every episode. The first half was amazing and kept me totally hooked, it was hard to wait for the next episodes.

The acting is very good, every part is played well and all characters have their own place.

The ending was a bit disappointing because, even though all characters got their closure, I feel like the two main side characters were pushed aside. They didn't have much screen time during the drama obviously because they were &quot;a thing of the past&quot;, but they still played a big role in the main characters' life and would have deserved more. Especially Tae Jin who had truly loved Hae Jin and whom she had loved too, but she often acted like it meant nothing to her. It would have been nice if pretty Hae Young had more to her as well, not through Do Kyung but genuinely to herself. Also, that ""revenge"" part felt really forced.

All in all, this is a good drama with a very high rewatch value but it's a bit bland and not very memorable. It stands out a but not in a way that you'd remember it forever as one of the most amazing shows. Rather, this is a calm and slow ride, filled with pastel colors and lots of emotions. Slice of life.

For me, this entire drama hinged on the acting of Seo Hyun Jin. I have never experienced such a deep empathy for a character. She portrays someone who is devastated incredibly well. I have found that if she so much as sniffles, I burst into tears. The dead, haunted expression she had through the first few episodes, and the inner strength of her character to put on a brave face to the world stayed with me.

I found the story to be interesting at first. It was different. But after a while it seemed to have lost it's charm for me. This makes me sad, because I was anticipating Eric's return to the screen. That is not to say I didn't enjoy the drama, but it isn't one I would watch again.

As for the music, I am torn. The main song is catchy but annoying. Roy Kim's song is lovely. The two balanced out to a 6.5 for me.

Overall, I rated this drama a 7.5, which about averages the other scores. That is almost exclusively due to Seo Hyun Jin. The side characters were also fun to watch, and their stories were light-hearted interruptions to the main plot, which at times became a little heavy.

I do recommend seeing this drama, even with it's short-comings. If for no other reason than to experience acting that will literally make your heart hurt in your chest.

I didn't watch this drama once it started airing because the sypnosis wasn't really that intriguing to me but I'm glad I gave it a chance. At the beginning it did start off a bit slow but just stick through with it or else you'll miss out on one the funniest and most touching dramas. The comedy And the cast is one reason that made this drama amazing. I haven't toppled over from laughter so much. I laughed so hard my stomach started hurting and it's all because of the crazy characters. There is not one ordinary character but it's honestly the best because you don't know what to expect. What I love most about the drama is that it does take drama cliches but it adds their own twists to it which makes it fun and original. I really love the message that this drama tells you with each episode and that's to live your life to the fullest as if it is your last because you never know what will happen. With each decision we make, do it wholeheartedly and not with regret. They really delivered this message very beautiful especially at the end.

I especially love the way the characters were made in the drama. There really was no clear cut ""good"" or ""bad"" characters and it's one of the reasons why I enjoyed the drama so much. In life, few people aren't as easy to clarify as good or bad and this is depicted very well in the drama. The good people do bad things and the bad are sometimes good. The characters were frustrating and sometimes even to the point that it was hard to understand them but that's what made them much more interesting and even more lovable because they're just like real people who make mistakes and do the wrong things even with the best intentions. It's because of the wonderfully, well written, and realistic characters that made Oh Hae Young Again a wonderful drama.

I have several favorite dramas, but this one is on top of the list. The story, the acting, the music, and most specifically the moral of the story touched me. Here's my review by parts:

STORY - This isn't your typical chaebol/poor girl romcom story. Yes, the male lead is ""rich"" and the female lead ""poor"", but the essence is completely different. The way their relationship develops is pure magic. The two last episodes that were ""fillers"", as the drama was supposed to be 16 episodes, not 18, didn't have that ""filler"" feeling. They used them wisely to extend this excellent story. The other couples were so unique in their own way too. The other couples' scenes were entertaining, not boring like in other dramas. Also the second leads didn't finish the story like the ""bad"" ones. There was good character development in them. And, the ending. What a beautiful ending that was. It was so well written. Congrats to the writers, they did really well!

ACTING/CAST - Perfect. The lead couple's chemistry was so real. All their scenes portrayed the feelings incredibly well. The cheesy ones, were cheesy but not overly cheesy. The arguing ones felt real. And the hot scenes, were HOT. The passion in them was unbelievable. The other actors did really well too. My favorite was Ye Ji Won as Park Do Kyung's sister. All her scenes were funny and/or touching.

MUSIC - I've downloaded them all on my phone. As I'm more of a balladeer, my favorite song is ""If It's You"", but all the other ones were excellent and fitted nicely with their scenes.

REWATCH - I don't usually rewatch dramas, but this one is so good that I see myself rewatching this soon.

OVERALL - As I said above, I think this is my favorite drama from all time. It had everything, even the psychological part that I like so much and it's usually non-existent in romcoms. Also the moral of the story for me is that we should try everything we want to do, so that we don't regret it later. That touched me and changed my way to see life. To end this review, the phrase in the ending: ""Please live. We are grateful that you're alive"" touched me so much.

Everyone who's thinking of giving this a go or not, do it! You won't regret it. :)

Original storyline & epic romance
I really liked the originality of this story. It starts out with the male lead seeing brief glimpses into his future. They all revolve around the same woman who just so happens to have the same exact name as his ex girlfriend who left him at the alter. I‚Äôve never seen a story quite like this. And the reason for his seeing the future is both unique and touching.

The acting in this drama is excellent. The main leads, their family members, and even the side couples all do a great job. You can just feel the pain of the main leads over their past lover‚Äôs betrayal. And there are such rich entertaining side characters that bring great comedy to the table at just the right moment to keep things from getting too sad. The male leads sisters ordeal with the toilet just cracked me up.

The romance is really good and one of the most endearing parts of this drama. It‚Äôs very realistic and not cheesy at all. There are real kisses, piggy back rides, and lots of skinship. They have amazing chemistry.

The character growth is what really stands out in this drama. The female leads journey of seeing her self worth and stepping out of the other ‚ÄúMiss Oh‚Äôs‚Äù shadow was a joy to watch. And when the male lead let‚Äôs go of his past and decides to fight for his future I wanted to stand up and applaud.

There wasn‚Äôt too much I disliked about this drama. But the female lead forgiving her terrible ex was a disappointment. I can‚Äôt imagine forgiving and even dating a man that dumped me the day before our wedding. NO reason would be good enough for the pain and embarrassment he caused. Thankfully her bad decision only lasted briefly. But it did detract from an otherwise wonderful drama. That and the really annoying selfish mother of the male lead (and her poor acting) kept it from a perfect rating.

That being said, it‚Äôs a great drama definitely worth watching. In fact, I‚Äôve watched it twice myself!

This drama become the best drama I have ever watched, I love the story-line, the chemistry between the main leads, and of course the OSTs. Everything was on point!!! The reason why I really like this drama is that there are both sad and hilarious scenes which help balance out your mood throughout the drama. The chemistry between the main couple is just perfect. Trust me, you won't regret watching this drama. Not to lie to you, I have re-watched this drama more than 5 times. I highly recommend you to watch this drama!!!

The Kiss Of The Century
Let me start right out by saying I loved this show. It had drama, comedy, and a romance to remember. Seo Hyun Jin and Eric Mun were fantastic together. The romance grew as the show progressed leading up to a moment I will never forget. In episode 9 the first kiss was show-stopping. Maybe the most emotional, raw kiss I‚Äôve ever seen in a K-Drama. I was holding my breath while it was happening. Seo Hyun Jin kisses with her whole essence. I‚Äôve never, ever seen a kiss that displayed so much emotion on screen. I was happy to see it again at the start of the next episode. Seo Hyun Jin has mastered the art of kissing to a point it‚Äôs almost mind-boggling. The second kiss was every bit as good.

The story itself had its ups and downs. A 32-year-old woman being hounded by her mother is a little foreign to me, but I see it in a lot of shows so I just accept it. Smacking her on the head about 20 times in the show is not cool. But I love Kim Mi Kyung as an actress, and she did a good job playing Hae Young‚Äôs mother. I also liked Kim Ji Suk who usually plays ‚Äúthe other guy‚Äù in shows. Even though he was a little flaky for a lawyer the comedy was funny.

The music was nice, and it blended with the scenes setting the mood perfectly. I couldn‚Äôt understand the words, but the sound and the tones carried it all. I would have liked to have seen subtitles with the music.

The concept was unique and kept me interested. The twists and turns were non-stop. The emotional flow battered you to a point of anger. Which of course it is intended to do. They didn‚Äôt quite sell the pretty one versus the ordinary one. To me, Seo Hyun Jin is gorgeous and stood out even when they were trying to make her look ordinary. As the show went on she of course glowed, especially after that first kiss.

Please watch this if you haven‚Äôt seen it. Let me know what you think.

I'm not entirely sure I even know where to start writing a review for this show - so many thoughts. It was so layered and tightly written. The only thing that knocked off that half point for me was that there were a couple of episodes in the middle where it got a little draggy, but not enough to ruin it for me.

This story is about choosing love over fear, loving someone unreservedly, living without regrets, how ones perspective can impact one in ways you don't even realize, and how the decisions made can change your fate The layers of perspective make it meaningful, and the writer was able to tie in things that you would not have thought important at first look. I experienced the emotions of the characters with them and felt all the heartbreak, tension, and giddiness along with them. Despite any shortcomings this drama may have had, the characters were its strongest draw. The main couple had intensity and and passion. My advice would be to not judge the characters motivations and actions too quickly on this one. (Perspective, remember!) What you see at the beginning may not be a full picture, so you need to watch it unfold. Also, because Do Kyung's job was to do sound for movies and such, I started to become hyper-aware of the sounds in the show. It was pretty cool actually. It was a pretty interesting addition to the storyline to see a little BTS magic, but was also relevant to the story. The cinematography was also beautiful. I thought that there was a good closure at the end and lots of good resolution that the characters needed.

While so many drama characters are black and white, good or bad, hero or villain - the characters here are more shades of gray, imperfect, messy, a little dysfunctional, and sometimes selfish. They were interesting and against type. This is not just a romance, but a little slice of life as well. You almost feel like a voyeur peeping in on their developing relationship because they have an off the charts chemistry and hold the tension so well. The characters (nearly all of them) experienced growth throughout the show. The main romance was not the only love relationship either. There was a 2nd and 3rd romance, as well as family love. They were all realistic and raw and make mistakes. Our Oh Hae Young was emotional and honest. She can also be petty, jealous, and quick tempered, but is quick to admit when she has been wrong. She cut right through to Do Kyung's core and took down his walls brick by brick and unlocked his heart. (And I would just like to say that our leads should give kissing lessons to the rest of dramaland because WOWZA! That's how you kiss!) Do Kyung is thoughtful, but so reserved and introspective. His feelings come out in his actions long before he allows himself to express them in words.

The secondary characters are also well done. Do Kyung's sister, Soo Kyung, is such a strange character when you first meet her. At first you will believe she is just there simply for comedic effect, but you soon learn what motivates her as well. She became one of my favorite characters next to the main leads. In fact I loved every one of DK's family, save his mother (who was pretty much the worst mother ever. She barely had a shred of anything resembling maternal in her). Speaking of secondary characters, I have to say that OHY's parents may be my favorite drama parents ever. Mama Oh especially is like a mama bear with her cub, OHY. She may seem harsh and quick tempered, but she loves her daughter so much and always does the right thing for her in the end. And Papa Oh is a quiet support for them both. He doesn't say a lot, but he always knows when to jump in with his support. In fact, OHY's parents characterizations seem to parallel OHY and DK. The 2nd leads aren't even really 2nd leads, though, and their impact on the story does not equate with their portion of screen time. But honestly, I didn't really want to know more about them.

The casting was well done, and I felt that each part was done believably. I was swept up into their world.
The music went very well with each scene as if they were written for it, and the main theme was cute, if a little overplayed. I think it was very well done even though I don't always notice the music so much.

Would I re-watch this? I think I would. I think the layering of the story makes a great re-watch because you catch even more the 2nd or 3rd watch-through.

Overall, I was thoroughly entertained by this show. I do not expect my characters to always act realistic and the way that you would expect people to act in real life. But they do still manage to make them feel real and relatable. If you dropped this drama before the back half, you really have missed out and I think you should give it a second chance. While this was a romance that maybe should ""never have been"", at the same time you feel like it's the only way it could have been.

The songs caught my attention the most in the beginning- kind of hauntingly beautiful in a way. The initial story was a little strange for me to follow at first but I was half drawn to wanting to know the character's backgrounds (because I was hesitantly intrigued!), so I continued. The first two episodes were hard to swallow because characters were all over the place or drunk but starting episode 4 everything became to be more clearer. On a slight side note, that's kind of a drama rule for me-give it 4 episodes. If it's still not good... then whoops. It's interesting how they both start out as broken characters that try to find their way back, together. (In that respect, OHYA reminds me of It's Okay, that's Love) I loved their open communication, even in the beginning.

Just as a note, all the leads in this drama are completely new to me except for Kim Mi Kyung (loved her in Healer and here she is a completely different character) I like the characters so much. They feel like real people I would really meet in life. I admire Seo Hyun Jin's character, our Oh Hae Young. She has so much tenacity and willingness to throw herself out there, both in her wrecked love life and difficult work life. Her humorous antics are also hilarious. She gave this drama life. Of course, Eric was stellar at portraying his brooding character that is actually warm inside but SHJ's multifaceted character and her way of portraying our OHY is what made this drama. From being down in the dumps to easily happy, SHJ acting as our OHY, made me fall for this drama.

On the surface, the plot isn't really that new but DK and our OHY's relationship is what makes this drama what it is, regardless of the flaws because that's a part of it as well. Family love, dealing with abandonment, self-exploring, and more are all something this drama touches on and deal with well. Sometimes I hate Do Kyeong so much for his selfish actions, but then I can't help but love him later on again. Aiya, basically he made me a mess of emotions. Thanks Eric. And yet, I find myself rooting for them despite Do Kyeoung's mistakes, despite all he has done. It's amazing what some raw, sizzling chemistry can do.

Speaking of the chemistry..wow, just wow. For their relationship, it isn't just the feels-it's completely heartbreakingly realistic. Whether it be an ecstatically happy scene or an agonizing, tearful scene that is making me bawl- it all hurts and in a good way. Often times, I feel like I'm on a train that will eventually crash. I know that and yet I keep watching anyways even though it hurts so much. Their tug and pull relationship was overwhelmingly hard to watch, seriously, and every time they're together, the charged atmosphere and tension between them is so tangible. They shouldn't even be together given they need to heal themselves and get the secrets out of the way first, but regardless of all that, I still want to root for the impossible to turn into the possible. I have to give it to the writer for making me feel all these emotions.

On a completely superficial side note, I love Eric's voice. I love how sound was incorporated in this drama. So ingenious, and so essential to the story. The importance of sound, emphasized through Do Kyeong's job, is beautifully expressed and creates some awesome scenes with gorgeous cinematography to top it off.

I know some viewers were in a controversy about the 'cop out'. In all honestly, when it happened, I sighed in relief. Up to then, I couldn't completely justify rooting for the OTP because it seemed wrong, in a way.

Now, side characters. If anything, I feel like the office scenes were too long, as well the drunken scenes. Less is really more. Bromance is serious in this drama. I loved it so much. The duckling squad always has DK's back no matter what. In terms of the other storylines, I really liked them. No character seemed one-dimensional; for the most part, all the characters had purpose and was fleshed out, and given a chance for redemption, to have a fresh start if they chose to take it. I appreciated that the second leads weren't purely vindictive. Circumstance made them who they are and maybe some incorrect choices took them on their path. So in that sense, I liked all the characters. Even for those that I didn't like, I didn't want them gone from this drama either because it didn't feel justified. In their own way, they added to the drama.

The songs are so appropriately fitting to the drama. Like the theme of this drama, the songs (sound) perfectly complement each and every scene. AOHY really made me fully appreciate the importance of sound (and sound directors) in dramas to enhance the whole drama experience and just in everyday life in general as well. I love this whole soundtrack- every single song! If I have to choose one, though, it's definitely 'If it is you' by Jung Seung-Hwan.

If there is one themeI learned from this drama, it is: We should live life to the fullest; pride really isn't everything. If you don't try throwing yourself out there, you might never be reciprocated. If you don't give, why do you expect to receive?

I recommend if...
-you want to see some fireworks chemistry
-you want to see some of the best kiss scenes I've ever seen in a drama
-you're ok with lots of revenge and raw, unfiltered emotion
-you like hardcore bromance and heartwarming love between family
-you're a huge romance lover (like me!) and wants to see something different and surprisingly new

If you're still on the fence about whether to watch this or not, just watch it! Don't be afraid of throwing yourself out there! (Did you get the pun? LOL) Okay, seriously, give it 4 episodes then decide whether you like it or not.

This drama has so much heart, so much depth, and just so much love. In the end, the raw emotion this drama provokes as a whole overrides the flaws this drama did have. I love you, show, and you'll stay in a heart for a while!

2nd male lead released from jail and got to know that he was wronged from 1st hero. Later he starts pursuing ok ok Oh back but However OK OK Oh has fallen in love with 1st hero. This makes our 2nd lead angry.

I haven't been this addicted to a drama in a long time
This show is the most realistic romantic kdrama I‚Äôve watched. It's been a long time since I have rewatched a drama so many times. I stay awake all night just rewatching scenes because it gives me so much feeeeels.

Every time I see the girl smile or do something embarrassing I can‚Äôt help but smile or when she picks herself up and brushes it off I smile even more. I can relate to the main leads so much. I understand her struggle in comparing to others and I understand his sadness and struggle in opening up to his feelings. The scenes are romantic because the guy is sad and shy so when he does anything that shows his real emotions, it‚Äôs really romantic.

It doesn‚Äôt have the typical jealous moments or the death stakes. It‚Äôs just 2 people who fall in love and the struggles that come with that. Such a believable romance.

The writer really understood emotions. I understood why the characters would act the way they did. She really understands pain and loss. I could feel the same pain when the characters were hurting.

The directing was amazing. I like how they used sound to create emotions and story tell.

I have to take points off for the slow 4 episodes before the ending. Sometimes I think the girl can be irrational like an annoying child but other than that, I love it.

I would rewatch it for the romance.

First of all, this is the first Kdrama where I was totally against male lead from the start. He did a very immoral thing and it was never properly addressed in the series.
Secondly, the characters in this drama are a mix of likeable and unlikeable. Except the female lead's parents, male lead's sister and some other people, even major leads are unlikeable.
Some arcs and scenes were sheer torture- in part due to characters and in part due to shitty storyline and dialogues. Throughout the episodes I watched, I got the feeling that I am watching something very wrong.

I started watching this because the screenwriter is same as My Mister and I heard praises about it. I thought the storyline would be new and interesting. It was not.

I feel like I wasted my time by watching something this shitty. The rom was so wrong and the com started strong, but got weaker with the episodes. If you aren't a huge ""oppa"" fan, I suggest you don't watch it. There are better romcoms. The last one I watched ""Eternal love"" is far better. There are lots of other romcoms. Watch them.

Without spoiling much-

STORY: It's not much of a kdrama in terms of the theme and plot like Pinocchio, I Hear Your Voice and Descendants of the Sun, but in terms of relationship, chemistry, character progression, and the main couple's personality, it was the most adorable, loving and REALISTIC couple relationship I've ever seen portrayed in a korean drama (and I have watched A LOT)

Not just the main couple being the most adorable, but also the side characters and what they bring to the story. They were also very cute and had better chemistry than most main couples in other dramas, that and they were very entertaining and brought comic relief for the most part.

THIS DRAMA REALLY TEACHES A GOOD LIFE LESSON - - about how you can never avoid the inevitable, but it's up to the person and individual to make it a positive outcome or see it as a positive thing (see it in a different light)

THE DRAMA ALSO HAS PROBABLY THE BEST ENDING AND MOST UNEXPECTED SURPRISING ENDING I'VE EVER SEEN! PROPS 9.5/10 for the story

ACTING/CAST: Like I said before, the actors and actresses really portrayed their character really well, if not better than most dramas I've seen. When ever I saw Seo Hyun Jin (girl who plays main girl Oh Hae Young) cry, I teared up easily, and I barely cry in dramas, even during deaths of loved ones in many other Korean dramas. The acting was the MOST CONVINCING I've ever seen. Seo Hyun Jin did a really great job.

Eric also did a really great job, portraying a much more chill (but not so chill) male protagonist. Both main actors did a really great job. Not only that, but the side characters had really convincing acting too (even during parts where they cried also)

MUSIC: Of course this drama has great music! The theme of this kdrama plot revolves around the male protagonist being a CEO of a sound recording company! Great OST, reminds me a lot of Western music, like Perks of Being a Wallflower OST. Really well made and set the tone when ever something intense, lovely or just plain fun happened.

REWATCH VALUE: The rewatch value will be different for everyone, but for the general audience it would probably be a one time watch for them. But for me it will probably be a 10/10, only because this drama brought me so much joy

OVERALL: In conclusion I had a lot of fun following this drama when it was ongoing. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode because each episode ended off so well. I haven't felt like this in a while with kdramas (other than Descendants of the Sun)

9.5/10 for this drama!

The series started off strong. Unique storyline & enjoyable characters. However some things annoyed me early on and then it totally went downhill around episode 8 or 10.
I didn't understand how the vibrant adult Hae Young lost all confidence once ""pretty"" Hae Young re-entered the picture. Come on. Pretty Hae Young herself never made fun of or put her down, it was always others around them. That was extremely disappointing & irksome. However, I still enjoyed the show until Hae Young's fiance Tae-Jin returned; then it torpedoed into hating it.
This is the man that you loved enough to marry & sent you into drinking stupor to try to deal with the loss but when he comes back & tells you the reason he left, you didn't run back into his arms???!!!! That's a freaking joke! She knows he broke things off with her to save her but was still cold towards him? Disgusting. Hadn't only a few months passed before he came back? In that time, she moved on and fell so hard for Do-Kyung she couldn't go back to her fiance? That's a lie and incredibly unrealistic. She still forgave him after finding out he ruined her potential marriage over he same woman she hated from high school? I think not. I'm infuriated by this and made me hate the whole series. Why not change up the standard ending & put her back with her fiance? If she moved on so easily, she never loved him in the first place. Do- Kyung didn't show her some love she couldn't move on from.
Lastly, Hae Young's mom was too much. Her first reaction when she found out she wanted to cancel her wedding was to beat her? Then when she saw her daughter spiraling & coming home drunk every night she kicked her out of the house instead of talking to and trying to help her because she was embarrassed by her daughter? Wow.

I just finished watching an amazing drama about a week before starting this, & I didn't think i was going to find another drama that could impress me. When i started this drama i didn't think that it was going to be as good as it was but it proved me wrong. The story kept me interested from beginning to end. The Actors & Actresses were amazing with really good chemistry between them. Music was on point. I loved the funny scenes that are scattered through out the whole series. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great current drama for the summer.

This drama was DAEBAK! If not for fellow MDL'ers comments/reviews I would have put this in the ""bubble-gum"" category - Thanks fellow MDL'ers!

Story: Well written, and directed. Story dealing with being alive and living - Regrets & passion - Defining learning how to love! Loved the surrounding cast and all the realistic quirkiness of their lives & loves. Well written + stellar camera/sound work. My only issue from a full 10, the last couple eps felt like they pull the story along unnecessarily, the story was gripping enough.
Acting/Cast: An entire cast of REAL actors. People with skills and chemistry. The two leads were simply magnetic, drawing in each other and us! The lawyer & noona couple were simply delightful and magical to watch their story & iteration of love bloom. Well done selection of actors to carry off this this twisted storyline.
Music: Rather ""wormy"" & well done!
ReW: Yes - after some time to digest all the content of this drama.
Final Note: Do not be fooled by some of the bubble-gummy looking posters. Read some of the reviews, trust the fellow MDL'er whose reviews you can believe. Learned my lesson -

One of the BEST laughs I've had...
I hardly write reviews...but this funny drama is really one of my favorite...The story is not the best but I enjoyed it A LOT because of the funny scenes...I seriously laughed so hard in many scenes. I laughed even harder the second time watching it so I decided to write a review about it...Each couple has their funny moments and touching scenes...My favorite is the older sister with her brother's friend...I believe I will watch it the 3rd time a few years later...The story has its unrealistic side but the heartache the main leads go through is very relatable...I can see why many relationships don't last...This drama will help you realize that ""forgiveness"" and ""courage"" is the best combination/medicine you'll need to meet happiness...Enjoy!!

At first I was hesitant to watch this drama since I am not familiar with the lead oppa but still decided to watch it because my friend told me it is really funny. And OMGee this drama made my heart feel like a rollercoaster, it made me cry but in another 5 sec it also made me laugh. Its like I can feel the Ordinary Oh Hae Young's pain from her past huhuhu... This was some kind of lightweight drama but I really liked this and it also had an interesting plot. I really had my eyes swollen because I cried each episode. You won't regret watching this. This drama is really a must watched kdrama. Plus the support actors are super funny esp. ISADORA hahaha...

Firstly, I didn‚Äôt start watching it for the cast as most people out there. I watched it as romantic comedy is one of my favourite genres.
The drama gives a real outlook on most people‚Äôs mind and how they handle relationships and fear of loss with some twists. At first it seems like a psychological one, though I‚Äôll say I am a bit disappointed with the loss of focus on that part later in the series.
Regarding the characters and their development, the leads are oh hae young or just oh hae young as referred in the drama and park do kyung; there‚Äôs another oh hae young referred as pretty oh hae young in the drama. Though I liked just oh hae young better than pretty oh hae young.
The story revolves around just oh hae young and park do kyung. Oh hae young is dumped by her fianc√© the day before her wedding and is miserable. Then she meets park do kyung and the story develops from here. Though it is quite bitter between them but it grows eventually with twists and turns.
I liked the character development in pretty oh hae young better than any other character. I liked the acceptance that eventually indulges in her. The leap of faith that do kyung takes is also heart touching . just oh hae young ‚Äòs character is what you describe as honest, she reveals and expresses her feelings so effortlessly that it took me by surprise, though I didn‚Äôt found much development in her character and I guess I liked it is as it is, I wouldn‚Äôt have appreciated a change in her free spirit. Do kyung‚Äôs mother is the most annoying character I have ever seen, I would really like to tell her to grow up, she is very very annoying.
The story that develops between the leads was great , though at some point between the series I began to like the chemistry between do kyung‚Äôs sister and ji sang better than the main leads.

about acting‚Ä¶soo kyung ( do kyung‚Äôs sister) is great. I liked her personality , she is mature and understands and grasps the situations well, though her actions are hilarious and so is her chemistry with ji sang, with seriousness and twists at some point. The leads were good and portrayed the characters well ,especially oh hae young (seo hyun jin) . And yes oh hae young‚Äôs mom and dad are sooooo good. I don‚Äôt know why but I loved her mom and her dad is so sweet, like really sweet.

the music is good.. some of them cheerful and some of them slow and sweet kind..

I don‚Äôt rewatch dramas, so I won‚Äôt recommend it.

This is recommended to all romcom lovers, you‚Äôll love it. It‚Äôs worth a watch.
And lastly, the review is purely based on my opinion and is not meant to offend or oppose anyone else‚Äôs opinion.

There's something very refreshing and beautiful about this drama. I actually watched this drama after having been stuck in a kdrama slump for a while but this drama immediately tugged me out of it.

One of the things I loved most about this drama was the realness of the characters. Oh Hae Young (Seo Hyun Jin) was a very vulnerable and raw character. She was not perfect and her struggles of having to compete with someone with the same name throughout her whole life were very touching. Some might say her actions and emotions make her seem childish but I disagree. She chooses to embrace her feelings and emotions without concerning herself with the opinions and judgments of others. I admired that despite her brokenness she continued to thrive with her fearlessly bold personality. Seo Hyun Jin's charcter is inspiring to me on so many levels as she doesn't hold back and learns to pursue what makes her happy.  

I was also really captivated with Eric's character, Do Kyung. Do Kyung is one of those characters who would be terribly hard to play as his character is very closed off and reserved. His character's emotions in so many scenes were portrayed solely in his face and eyes. Often times, it was a quiet stare or couple words which carried behind it the most powerful meaning. When a person is scarred it is a very natural reaction to close themselves off and to hide their emotions and feelings from others and I was very moved and impressed with Eric's acting and portrayal of such a difficult character. He portrayed Do Kyung's healing journey very beautifully.  Also supporting cast was phenomenal!   

 I could honestly go on and on about how great this drama is as I do with all my favorite dramas, but rather than that I would just really encourage you to watch it. It is beautifully done and the chemistry between the main couple is extremely moving. The uniquely hilarious comedic moments are balanced perfectly with the heavier areas of melodrama and the hint of supernatural in this drama adds just the extra element that it needed. The work aspect of this drama is also very intriguing and interesting and I especially love when dramas intertwine occupations in with the story. One last thing, the music was amazing. Definitely worth the watch. I'm honestly not opposed to watching it for a 5th time.

OMG the OSTs!
I am new to MDL and that's why I'm only writing this review in 2021. But I watched this drama when it was airing week by week. However! I will point out later on why this does not make my review any less valuable or with fresh memory.

Hm, where to begin?

The story: I've never been fine with elements of fantasy and supernatural and very rarely enjoy such shows. However, this storyline is very appealing, extremely emotional, soft yet engaging, and quite relatable in terms of romance. I really enjoyed the turn of events. To me, every emotion was understandable, relatable, endearing, and with good reason. Remember that this show is not about solving mysteries, but it's all about feeling emotions! And I mean feeling them deep... Now, this next sentence will be a big spoiler so skip to the next paragraph if you prefer, but the FL and ML have their emotionally realistic ups and downs, they have their hearts broken, fall for each other, have their reasons to suppress their feelings, get mad for the mistakes that have been made, go through the pain of letting go while still wanting more, not withstanding the distance, and finally deciding to forgive themselves and the other.

The acting: I literally felt all the hurt and the joy and the bubbly feelings of Seo Hyun Jin's character all along. She is indeed an outstandingly capable actress. Her character was really hard to carve out and yet she made me believe that she was really the Oh Hae Yeong of the story and radiated all the emotions the audience was supposed to feel. I believe her acting did make the show a full 10/10 from maybe an 8/10. Eric moon was also pretty good at acting the grumpy, mean, yet soft and caring deep inside Park Do Kyun, which is actually his typical type of character in dramas (or at least the ones I have watched). Among the other actors, I only need to mention Kim Mi Kyung, the true, one and only, not-rich Asian mom in drama history. She throws sticks and stones at her daughter, but you can feel so much love and affection coming through her and it makes you feel warm and safe, just like how you would feel with your Asian mom.

The music: Honestly, this show was the point at which I started listening to Korean music. I'm not big on KPop and never really paid attention to the OSTs. But I still have the whole OST playlist of this show on my phone and listen to it on a regular basis, probably 2-3days a week. I loved every piece and after almost 5 years, am still enjoying them all. ""If it's you"" by Jung Seung Hwan is still my go-to song whenever I want to get goosebumps with emotions. (This singer is amazing. He also did great on Startup with ""Day and Night"" and I love it.)

The rewatch: Hmmm... About that... It's really hard for me to confess, but I have already watched this drama 5 TIMES FRONT TO BACK, NO SKIPPING! This is a big deal for me guys. I almost never watch a drama without skipping or fast-forwarding and yet, I have watched this 5 times scene by scene and loved it every time. In fact, I'm watching it a 6th time right now. Go figure how great this drama can be...

Overall, hands down the best drama I have ever watched from 2010 to 2021!

At first I thought this would be a normal drama, and that nothing about it would be special, but I was totally wrong, it was a good drama and at the beginning of it, I had all sorts of feelings inside of me and joy, injustice and pain were part of it.
I think that Eric and Seo Hyun Jin had a really big chemistry, when they were on the screen together, my heart was pounding really strong.
My favorite character was definitely the one played by Ye Ji Won, every time that she spoke in french and was drunk I was crying because how much funny it was!
The songs really fits on ""Another Miss Oh"", and how could they be bad when one of them is made by the excellent Ben?
The first half episodes were just so good, but sadly after the episode 13 it was... how could I say it? It was boring, and I just wanted it to end so I was angry because this had a big potential to be one of my favorite drama.
They could've at least maintain this to 16 episodes, because they were here just to be here.
So I would say that in a general point this a a good one which had a lot of imperfections, but you watch it to make your own view on this.

One of the best kdramas out there, hands down. It made me FEEL things from the very beginning, my heart just ached. This actress takes you on a journey, you absolutely feel like you're walking with her through everything.

The male lead complemented her well, quiet to her dramatic, which made his more emotive scenes all the more powerful.

The side characters all had me invested in their stories as well, fully fleshed out-- I laughed and I cried with her mother and father. It was awesome to see something different from kdrama parents (though the trend seems to be improving on this note). Lots of complicated relationships and plot twists you can't really predict, but at the center of it, this is a show with HEART.

One of the best romance drama ever!

Definitely one of the best unique romance plot that I have came across.
1.) Unique characters. Instead of the story, I am more drawn towards the characters and personalities created by the writers. From uncommon jobs like sound directors to straightforward and sassy personalities, sparks really do fly between these characters.

2.) I need to talk about the character of normal Oh Hae Young. I find her so relatable (especially her voice-overs). People find her irritating but at the same time cannot help but sympathize her for the comparisons that she suffer. She is confident yet feel inferior when she is with the gold OHY.

3.) Gotta address the biggest illogical part of the story, which is the revenge part. Although the revenge on ex-girlfriend seems to be weird, I gotten over it really quickly as the main point of meeting another Oh Hae Young is more attention grabbing. Especially such a weird/special Oh Hae Young.

4.) The strange part of the story will be the psychic visions (no spoilers right, I am trying my best). Seemingly unnecessary, yet very important. There will be a lot of question marks and guessing throughout the drama, maybe even after it end. Then just let your (or netizens') creativity take over:)

I am really a super super big fan of Seo Hyun Jin right now!!! Totally captivated by her and Eric's chemistry. Not gonna talk about all the steamy kiss scenes that I have really enjoyed. You will definitely be laughing like crazy especially at the second couple, their chemistry is also no joke. So much fun and surprises.

Music is nice too. The OST ""What is Love"" is really addictive and sweet. Meanwhile I want to give credits to the unique cinematography, making it look a bit like a movie. Although sometimes I do find it irritating, I enjoyed it for most of the time especially during emotional scenes, it makes me immerse into the feeling/atmosphere.

Definitely a rewatch:) My favorite romance drama. Teaches me a lot about love, to be brave and to cherish what we have. And don't jump into conclusionssssss. GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find a single way to say to her.‚Äù
‚Äú ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô.  Wouldn‚Äôt that be enough?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for flattery. That‚Äôs just to calm her down.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy do you always interpret that phrase like that?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat phrase just doesn‚Äôt fit this situation.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe phrase ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô is always the right thing to say.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would get this drama. The slow story telling, the basket of crazy but boring characters. And then by Episode 7 I GOT IT. There‚Äôs something really different about this show. I like how they make you tired of the constant OHY mix ups and then they make fun of the premise with their own clueless characters.
I never get bored with the ‚Äúyou treat us so bad and we hate you most of the time, but when you‚Äôre hurting we‚Äôve got your back‚Äù clich√©.
I really loved how they looked at step-sibling relationships. They are so harsh with each other, but fiercely loyal and there‚Äôs that dynamic of adult siblings house-sharing.

‚ÄúI was going to fabulously have a go at you and leave.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust come at me. Then leave.‚Äù

One of the things that stood out to me is that dramas often portray the concept of, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt really know why we like each other we just do‚Äù. And this show consistently shows that it‚Äôs strange and stupid, but I can see that they like each other to the extent that they really make each other happy. I kept asking these characters, ‚ÄúWhy on earth are you attracted to each other?!‚Äù  But the point is they are convincingly in love despite all the ‚Äúbuts‚Äù. Seriously, so many times I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYou guys are so dumb...but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre all smiley‚Äù
With the start of this show, the logic of everyone is really weird relationally. The pacing of the show is much slower especially after I just finished a university drama.
I didn‚Äôt have much love for the characters in the show. They don‚Äôt have very appealing personalities. Our heroine gets drunk, glares at people and is generally out of control. The hero is just quiet and isolated. It took till episode 3 before I could see the potential of the couple.
And this drama commits the great crime of way too repetitive and lengthy flashbacks.

Do Kyung

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt control people with fear, Do Kyung.‚Äù

I‚Äôve never found Eric Mun attractive. Usually, if I don‚Äôt like a hero‚Äôs face at the start, I‚Äôll like it at the end, but this is my second drama with this actor, and I still think he‚Äôs ugly. Sorry! To top it off, the drama takes a long while for us to get to know him. Usually even if a hero is gruff to his heroine, we‚Äôll get some good scenes when he interacts with others. But not Do Kyung. Showing affection to no one ‚Äì not his friend, his brother or his mother or sister. That being said, sometimes his personality comes out when Hae Young is around and I started to see the beauty that is his character. I really appreciated how his character sometimes really embarrasses himself or does silly things and it‚Äôs just gold.
The idea of being a sound director is really interesting. I like that Do Kyung is so aware of his auditory environment.

‚ÄúInsert the sound of sunlight coming in.‚Äù

Hae Young ‚Äì female lead
I kind of like Hae Young‚Äôs glasses look. Hae Young is chatty, which is obviously necessary to fill in the fact that Do Kyung doesn‚Äôt say anything half the time. But she also points out her observations of Do Kyung‚Äôs nature and personality, which surprised both Do Kyung and me.  

I like that despite her being one of the worst heroines ever, when she decides to be hard-assed she goes all the way and stops with the crying.

‚ÄúIf you like me 89 on the scale, not 100 then tell me so. I will like for the same amount.‚Äù

The actress for the female lead is actually really good. Despite me disliking her character I really came to appreciate the actress ability to make her lines come alive, and be full of emotion. The way she talked drew me in, her acting made me care about a stupid and idiotic character.

Parents
Hae Young‚Äôs mother is fierce and loyal to her daughter. Actually Hae Young‚Äôs parents probably gave me the most laughs and I loved how they were so sensitive and thoughtful. They really seemed very in tune with Hae Young.

‚ÄúOf course. My daughter is wonderful.‚Äù

I really like the way Hae Young is also wanting to tell them everything and allow them to comfort her. I also like how Hae Young‚Äôs dad looks to his wife so he can be in sync with her or be prepared to stop her.

Soo Kyung
This actress gets some weird roles. And I didn‚Äôt want to like her, but as it went on, I kind of did. I like that her love interest is ridiculous but also really quite weighty. I really love what a cold and miserable character they make her. I actually really felt for her. And I love how multi-faceted she was and how you think she‚Äôs going to be a stereotype but she becomes an interesting and well-rounded character with a good amount of warmth for family.

Other Hae Young
I really appreciate that we got to know the other Hae Young. I like the way they explain her. The drama makes a good show of showing how the ‚Äúpretty Hae Young‚Äù is jealous of plenty of things about Hae Young‚Äôs life. And how the pretty Hae Young lacks the things she wants.

Jin Sang
‚ÄúYou used to beat the crap out of me for petty things.‚Äù
Kim Ji Seok is a really decent actor. I‚Äôve seen so many transformations of him and he always delivers his character so on point, it‚Äôs impressive.

Somehow I came to love the side characters when I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever pick up a pom pom and cheer for any of them. I became interested in what they were up to and their stories. I even really liked OHY‚Äôs office friends.

Live your life with unconditional love not fear.
This drama is delightfully fresh, charming, laugh out loud funny and touching.
I got some definite Sam Soon vibes because of the seamless blending of hysterical humour and heartfelt, grown up sincere emotions; not to mention a spunky and delightfully emotionally messy female lead who's always at 100% not 89%.

I love the message that this drama portrayed, about living life to the fullest, unconditionally, and doing things that you won't regret on your deathbed. Different kinds of love and human relationships are showcased in the drama as represented by the main story as well as all the side stories. I especially love that the characters, including the leads were flawed and on a path to growth and improvement, there's no one character that's perfect. The journey to being better is what makes this show special.

The love story is exceptional in the age appropriate way its handled; I especially appreciate that the characters are grown up and behave as such, they talk about everything that normal couples talk about. I was very impressed with conversations the lead couple had about their sexual frustration, when they would sleep together, when they would move in together etc; this was refreshing as it's so rare to see this in a kdrama; the skinship is also so realistic and natural, the kisses and hugs were some of the very best I've ever seen in any drama.

The acting and cast is great. Eric Mun's taciturn and closed off turn as Park Do Kyung is spot on, he was adorably stiff and it was such a pleasure to watch his character gradually open up and allow himself to feel love and live life fully.
Seo Hyun Jin's unabashed, wholehearted portrayal of Oh Hae Young was the life of this show, she was the perfect foil for Do Kyung and the two of them were magic on screen.

The supporting cast is impressive in this drama, all the side characters had fully developed stories and they didn't taper off at the end, something which I really appreciated because I've watched many a drama where the supporting cast stories are abandoned towards the end never to be picked up again. So well done Show for being consistent.

The drama may have been a tad overdramatic around episode 8 and 9 with too many tears and angst, I felt it was drawn out unnecessarily, and overall there was way too much self medicating with alcohol among many of the characters, the alcohol consumption is epic! My final criticism is with Oh Hae Young's mother, I found her to be too much, considering that Oh Hae Young is 32 years old, she was over-protective and meddlesome. I get that she loved her daughter but I just think maybe she made Oh Hae Young too sensitive with her constant hovering.

Anyway criticism aside, special mention has to go to the OST which was absolute gold; all the songs are amazing and catchy and appropriate.

I adored the vibe of this show, there's just something about it that's so unique; it's very well worth the watch, you will not regret.

Overall score is 9 out of 10.

Although I've been watching drama's for years, this will be my first review and I'm writing it because this show deserves it. It instantly became my favorite, I was never bored, and although it had some predictable tropes, the acting WAS SO GOOD that it made everything okay. I especially loved the bond between the mother and daughter, the feelings they created were so amazing. Best kissings scenes I've ever seen as well! Theres going to be your typical angst where the two characters can't be together and have scenes of one watching the other walk away with tears streaming down there faces etc. etc. which i usually roll my eyes at but this time, because of the reasons and acting, I understood and respected the characters decision.

4.5/10...
...Because 18 episodes felt like 50

If you've read my reviews before then you know I'm a major binge watcher but this Kdrama was purely unbingable!

When I first started this drama I thought the concept was great and it completely chained my interest but as I saw the mystery unraveling I got disappointed and the concept turned cheesy. Which, if I'm to be honest, matches the rest of the story because this show has a heavy emphasis on ROMANCE.

I'm not a big fan of pure romance and the comedy was not my style so this drama did not hit home with me. Yes it is somewhat super natural but it's only there to fuel the love story. so if you're a major romantic, you will love this. If you like awkward but proud women, you will like the lead. If you like the concept of evil exes then this is for you. On the other hand, if you dislike loud humor, lovey dovey couples and mothers you'd like to kill then this is NOT for you.

the acting was average, the music was good, the scenes were pretty and the script tickled my vomit reflexes but if you're a fan of Eric, ignore all the above and...

...ENJOY!

Another Oh Hae Young/Another Miss Oh is not your typical romantic-comedy that will make you laughed out loud most at your seats. It is a dramatic romance-comedy drama that will not only make you laugh but also will make you feel sentimental and touched by the characters.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS
When I first heard about this drama, I felt curious because I saw some netizens on facebook that they are currently watching it. At first, I told myself that I will not watch an on-going drama after DOTS but as my curiousity goes up, I watched it right away when it was only 6 episodes and I started to marathon it in order to catch up with the latest episodes.

I sensed that this drama was all about fate and love and I thought that this drama is also about mistaken identity or switch identity because of two Oh Hae Youngs but they have really the same name! *shocks*

ON THE CHARACTERS

Eric Mun as Park Do Kyung - I find Do Kyung's character as the typical male lead that does not confess his feelings right away for the female lead though I find his character as a Sound Producer very unique because it is my first time to see the male lead like the type of the job. I love Eric's portrayal as Park Do Kyung, I love him more! It makes me want to watch his previous dramas MY AHJUSSI! <3

Seo Hyun Jin as Just Oh Hae Young - I love her being cool and free spirited woman. The only female lead that I was sentimental and touched by her character, really love her 'till the end. I like Seo Hyun Jin's portrayal as Just Oh Hae Young and she really nailed it! Also looking forward for her dramas.

Jeon Hye Bin as Pretty Oh Hae Young - REALLY PRETTY OH HAE YOUNG <3 Though I am not really hooked on her character because she was popular when she and JOHY when they are in Highschool.

Lee Jae Yoon as Han Tae Jin - I was really annoyed on Tae Jin because of what he did on JOHY >.< He needs to reflect on his conscience on what he did to JOHY and on his company.

JUST OH HAE YOUNG'S PARENTS - FAMILY GOALS! They are your typical parents especially JOHY's Mom that are supportive and at the same time very overprotective but I also felt that they want the best for their daughter. I REALLY LOVE JOHY'S MOM! One of my favorite k-drama land Mom

Kim Ji Seok as Lee Jin Sang - I find his character very funny even though he is a playboy though he is also handsome, I still find him funny xD

Ye Ji Won as Park Soo Kyung/Isadora - I didn't like her character at first because of her moody attitude but as time goes by, I find her character likeable especially when she is with Jin Sang, she is also funny xD

OVERALL PLOT/STORYLINE OF THE DRAMA.
I can say that this drama has also a unique storyline, the only common cliche here on this drama is the love triangle among the characters. The plot twist of this drama is somehow unexpected that it will make you feel nervous of what will happen to the main characters. You can easily get interested on this drama because it's a rom-com drama and I know that everyone loves romantic-comedy drama.

MORAL LESSON OF THE DRAMA
Do not lead on a person if you can't commit him/her 'till the end or do not lead into a person that doesn't have a relation about you. Everything happens for reason, if it does not come to you, there's always behind a reason to it or in other words, if it's meant to be then it will happen it is also fate or destiny. Lastly, live life to the fullest.


10/10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. MUST-WATCH DRAMA. NOT THAT OVERRATED.

Fresh drama and different prospective about love with light comedy included. However, no mistaking - this is a romantic drama and the writers had the guts to explore several levels of love through its outstanding cast of actors and actresses. Once you become hooked - the story becomes engaging to the point you become judgmental and critical or situations :out loud.:, I found myself talking to the television set without hesitation. What is the most intriguing for me is adult immaturity in the matter of love, life and consequences. - Add the word pride and sometimes lack of it you begin to enjoy each episode more and more. Ending did not disappoint and that is why the high rating

Well... I started to watch because i heard really good things about Another Oh Hae Young... i was searching for something really romantic and i think that i really got the point! This drama was really something! I love every second of this even the secondary couples!
The main actor was so cute about his feelings and when he was embaressed, i really loved his acting!
This drama was amazing from the start till the end! I was crying like a baby in last minutes of the episode thinking that something bad was about to happening ;_;
The music was soo fitting| God, when i heard a french OST here i thought "" what!? why?"" and then some characters had to talk in french so the others wouldn't know what they were talking about!
You should really give a chance to watch this!

Oh, this show!! I just didn't give it a 10 because it took me 5~6 episodes to start to love it, but when I did was so wonderfull! The cast was amazing (all of them) and felt so good to not watch a show where do you really hate someone.. a drama where you can recognize a little bit of yourself in every character (this year the dramas are being so fucking human). Eric did an amazing job and so did Hyun Jin, it was nice to watch how people who got trully hurt can go over it and be real happy.. Their love made me cry out loud and laugh too. Ye Ji Won as Soo Kyeong and Kim Ji Suk as Ji Sang was hilarious! Every time they appeared on the scream I just knew that would be amazing.. when they started to speak in french, OMG! HAHAHAHA! Kim Mi Kyung as Hae Young mother was a show apart: when I was watching her I felt like I was watching my mom, a lion mom that does everything for her baby lion and this is so beautiful.! Like I said this is a must watch drama! Everything was amazingly done and the sound is a plus one at this show. Maybe because he is a sound director, dunno, but almost all the scenes have remarkable sounds/soundtracks. I'll definitely miss it at my mondays/tuesdays and rewatch it some other time.

Didn't think I would enjoy this drama based on the synopsis, but I really did. It ends way different than expected.

One thing I like about this drama other than the amazing soundtrack and camera work is the play on what happens when you don't explain yourself/the situation properly to those around you.


Let me explain....so both Pretty OHY and Han Tae Jin had something happen that stopped them from marrying their other halves and in my opinion it didn't need to go this far lol. Ok Tae Jin had something major happen to him but instead of explaining to Just OHY and truly thinking about her and giving her the choice to decide whether she wanted to stay or go he left her using a cheap ass line like 'I don't like the way you eat'. POHY's reason for leaving was quite deep but again instead of getting mad at Do Kyung there and then she decides to run off. But what I like about this is that they both come back trying to make amends on the ethos that they were 'doing the right thing at the time' and their exes are having none of it.
The clich√© would be that they would explain themselves and fall back in love again but they didn't do it this time and I'm so friggin happy.
The story was quite realistic apart from the villain soon-to-be father in law, but other than that it was quite realistic you definitely felt for Tae Jin and POHY even though at points you didn't really want to.

I love the side characters, the guys that work for Do Kyung and JOHY's clique at work who support her and back her up. I also love Soo Kyung and her story, she brings comedy to an otherwise dreary scene but I love how they have expanded on her character and made her storyline deeper and more realistic, I was definitely shocked by her storyline but it made me love her character even more. JOHY's parents are absolutely delightful, I love the stark comparison between her parents and POHY and Do Kyung's family situation.

I don't really see the need for the 2 episode extension because it could have all been completed in the 16 as one full episode I think 15/16 can't remember was dedicated to gushy showy affection between the two mains which kind of made me uncomfortable (probably cos I'm not that kind of girl lol) but I guess it gave the chance for the side characters to round off their story. I did really enjoy the last episode made you smile whilst watching it.

The soundtrack I really enjoyed not too many songs (its on Spotify) but they all worked in their various situations.
Ooooo another thing I loved is the opening, it was really smartly done and fun to watch I never skipped it lol, which I usually do.

I personally think this drama is really underrated. It suppose to at least has the rating of 9.5 and above. I am popular with high taste when it comes in choosing and rating a drama. This one cannot even be beaten with the famous new drama, Goblin. To be honest I never wrote a review but the low rating urges me to take a stand and fight ! LOL

I wont give you spoilers.

The story: Superb! The writer is genius and it is amazing how you will never want to miss every details in each episode and how the story start to take its place one by one.
Watching this one, you will need to prepare a pillow and tissues as you will turn to a crazy person that will laugh for a five minutes and cry immediately after that and after few minutes you will be feeling angry. They really done a good job in playing with our emotions. Well, my emotions..

The cast? WoWWW!! Literally WOW. The superb story combined with A++ acting from each character in the story would not give any better results. Its the best ! You will start to think you are the lead actor as they able to relate to your emotions.

The music used was catchy and you will start to hum along and will haunt you in daily life even if not watching. LOL

Rewatching would differ for each person as some people like me really hate to watch again on any dramas. But I rewatch this one haha. I joined my friends who currently are watching Ms Oh.

As you can see, my comment started getting shorter and shorter. This is because giving a review is really not my cup of tea but I'll say one last thing., You will regret it if you skip this one. Bye.

Hey all! If you want a fun, light romance this is it though I found the story line got dragged a little.
The acting was great!
One wish in this show is that if the writers hadn't lagged so much, it got dragged all over the place in a few spots as if the writers were't at the top of their game.
So I recommend it if you are bored. Use it as a filler

Okay so where do I begin? This drama is by far the most refreshing romance drama that I've seen in a while. There is something about the characters that makes me unable to turn away. This drama felt REAL. Unlike cutesy, beautiful kdramas.... this drama had aspects of the ups and downs of a real relationship and the interaction between the leads are amazing!

To be honest, I admit I wasn't hooked right away, but there's something so addictive and so real about the characters and their relationships Not every single episode was full of super cutesy moments or plot twists...rather than that, the drama has a more natural flow and pacing.
It was slow, but not draggy...it was enjoyable to see how all the cast interacted even though most their personalities were completely different.

Anyways to sum it up, here's my list of reasons why you should watch Another Oh Hae Young:

1. One of the most realistic female leads ever. She goes through so much and still stands her ground.
2. REAL KISSES, not the wide eyed , no lip movement B.S in so many kdramas
3. Awesome Bromance!
4. AMAZING SOUNDTRACK. The music is so DAMN GOOD!
5. A unique love story
6. SUPERB Acting!
7. Lots of character growth!
8. Learn awesome facts on how the sound effects in kdramas, movies and shows are made (It's super cool to watch throughout the drama)
9. Lots of deep conversation and beautiful monologues
10. It's so much fun!

If you're still unsure. Just go youtube some Fan Made Videos and I'm sure you will fall in love.
Anyways, if you haven't watched this yet give it 4 episodes and it will do it's magic. My initial thoughts were ""it's alright"" but now I realized that I would have missed out on such an amazing drama if I dropped it. It was so good that I forced myself to not watch the last ep until 2 months after because I didn't want it to end Lol.

Another miss Oh is about two women who share the same name.The story gets even complex, as the one misunderstanding follows the previous one, but fortunately, it is easy to keep up and it actually quite interesting. The fact is that the drama keeps you entertained up until the end, though the last episode wasn't as good as the rest of the series. Though the secondary stories weren't as good (actually they were kind of foolish), but the main one was really good. The romance was great, with good chemistry between the two leading characters, as well as great performances, that give out laughter and sadness as well. Maybe the whole ""seeing the future"" thing was a bit of a let down, but it didn't mess up with the story too much and actually gave the story some twists here and there. So, 8 out of 10.

Love the show. Started watching coz of Eric i had a crush on him from shinhwa. His sister just made the show interesting with her weirdness and excellent karate skills. Another interesting character was heo young ji. Ever since roomates ive loved her. She was doing the most and made that character come to life. Despite being a regular kdrama this one had lots of romance that were not childish. Loved the story and everyone.

Considering the makjang premise this show turned out to be a huge surprise. The typical tropes did not really come into play. The secondary love interests didn't cause too many problems & their existence was a meaningful part of the show, which almost never happens with these triangles & squares. I loved the main love line, it was awesome from beginning to end, although at its core it's quite similar to the love story in Goblin. There was an unusual amount of honesty at unexpected times! The 2 secondary couples were also fun to watch, especially the noona + lawyer pairing. The supernatural element was okay too( not great), it did make the show more interesting, especially early on. The pacing of the story was surprisingly good, almost every episode had some melodramatic parts with a good amount of comedic relief in between. The OST was perfect at creating the mood for almost every scene. I usually don't comment on sound quality, when it comes to kdramas, but generally they use budget microphones and there are a lot of pops & clicks that I can clearly hear with my higher end headphone gear. It's nice that in a drama that touches upon sound engineering I can enjoy the sound & music without those usual annoyances.

Naturally this drama isn't perfect. The plot has some weaker points, such as the way our MC accepted death, or how pulling the investment has led to jail time, I mean that is pretty outlandish if you think about it. The sound engineering procedural parts looked awesome, but this is not how they do it in real life, they do make the sounds in a similar way with all kinds of props, but the scenes aren't reenacted in real time, but rather if there are 20 seperate sound sources they record those 20 sounds separately & then merge/edit them in post, plus the step sounds are looped, there is no need for sound engineers to run for minutes on end during recording.

I'm rewatching this for the 4th time and I'm still loving it.
It's a great drama, whatever they say, and the reason is simple: because it's well constructed. A quite easy pre-requisite but so many dramas lack overall coherence.
Its storyline isn't on the more sophisticated side, but because of that, they managed to make it work from A to Z without losing the viewer's attention, without making up weak plot lines to fill the 11 to 16 episodes like so many other do.
The story involves two ladies sharing the same name and a man messing up one of the lady's life, thinking she was the other one that he fell in love with before she abandoned him. He later realizes his mistakes and starts getting more and more interested in the one he didn't know.

So I was wondering why I loved it so much. I knew I liked it because it has some similarities with marriage not dating (same director) for those who like this kind of quick-witted strong female lead type. The lead actress, Seo Hyun Jin is really good by the way. When she cries I cry, when she's on the limit of losing her mind, I totally feel her. she's never too dramatic, never too cute, she's extremely relatable, and I think that's one of the reasons I was able to watch every episode without being too distracted, pause, or look at my phone.
Also this Director has a very convenient little trick to make the episodes sort of stick together well: each episode starts with a flashback and the whole episode is a series of actions leading towards it. It allows the viewer to focus more on the action expecting how the action will end up this up the direction the flackback went for.

But I think what makes this drama go to the funny rom-com to the rom-com you rewatch once a year are the side characters. One f the best set of comedy actors in K-drama land imo : we got COMEDY LEGEND Ye Ji Won, God bless her soul honestly she's the sugar in my tea, the sun that rises, the kimchi on my rice. Next, we've got Heo Jung Min, who's literally the funniest side male character ever I don't even care for your opinion, and we've got Kim Mi Kyung, another legend, the personification of the sassy K-drama mum. Loving the love-hate relationship with her daughter in this one. always defending her from the neighbors but also wanting to kill her.

All of the relationships that the characters have with each other, as dramatic and theatrical as being
(sister of male lead also the boss of female lead who's best friends from school made first male lead think he's life love long with the same name as the female lead was gonna marry the first female lead's husband but NO she just has the same name as her so first male lead decided to ruin his life and then feels guilty for the female lead) *BREATHES* you didn't understand anything? yeah that's the point. It's K-drama. but quite weirdly, the director makes it looks easy to get and digestible, as unusual and unlikely as the situation would be in real life.

Finally, the story gets an actual progression: every character gets to move on the situation they were in when we found them at the beginning of the series and find either maturity or redemption which I completely endorse.

It's overall such a heart-warming cringe free drama, maybe more for 20 to 30 yo viewer rather than teen, which also adds up to the credibility of the -HOT- relationship between the leads.

9/10 only because I'm tough. lol.

Self-Sabotagers Anonymous: How To Stop Holding Yourself Back
Right - I think you need to have some semblance of patience to endure this show, as it definitely has its frustrating moments with Do Kyung's constant back-and-forth with his emotions. However, that back-and-forth is exactly what makes Another Miss Oh so beautifully real.

For my fellow self-sabotagers out there, the drama plays with the very real idea that becoming a better, healthier, happier person is a daily conscious decision. Throughout the show, Do Kyung struggles with his welded-shut heart, a product of a fairly traumatic parental loss as well as the betrayal of Oh Hae Young #2. Fearing any further pain or loss he could open himself up to if he opened up his heart, he stays behind his own self-constructed walls, comfortable, but lonely, and ultimately injuring himself even more.

Even when we have our main couple happily in love, we still see DK hesitating to say what he feels, to act on his emotions. Right until the end, he still makes the wrong decisions - the comfortable decision, the decision to turn your back and keep yourself away from others so you don't open yourself up to hurt. And yet, gradually, he begins to turn around, faster each time. He learns to open himself up to love, to life, even when that means opening himself up to hurt.

Have you ever seen the French film Amelie? Very unexpectedly, Miss Oh reminded me of it. Both feature a protagonist who has been traumatised by the world, by human relationships, and who would rather hide themselves away behind a wall, even though deep down they know they're doing themselves more harm than good. Both try to open themselves up to people multiple times, but run away scared, back into their own comfort zones. But, in the end, you've got to make the decision: do you let your heart grow cold or do you reach out and grab life, with its equal parts love and hurt, by the hands?

You grab it by the hands, MDL. Never would I have thought a Kdrama could teach me such an important, and much-needed, life lesson, but here we are. Watch the show, internalise the well-written, well-acted message, and then do it. Pull a Park Do Kyung, and reach out and grab life.

I watched this on a whim and didn't expect to finish everything but I did and it was worth it!

First of all, the poster is very misleading. It's ironic how Eric was smiling on the poster but he's miserable in the whole drama lmao. This ain't a romcom, more like a melo romance with a side of comedy. I'm glad I was fooled tho bc if I would've known this was melo, I wouldn't have watched this as I'm not into melo. There's tons of comedic relief tho so if you're into romcoms, this is still a must watch!

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ THE GOOD ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

- acting!! This show definitely brought out acting chops of everyone! I've always adored Eric Mun and he did a great job in this one, hope he'd be in a new drama soon! I'm now also a fan of Seo Hyun Jin!

- character development: everyone had a redeeming quality in them. OHY#2 may come off annoying at first bc she was too aggressive but yknow whattt girls can be like that too!! What? Only guys can be aggressive when it comes to love? Heck no. And that kind of love is obv what Do Kyung needed bc he's MISERABLE and needed push, a lot of push. I'm also glad that they didn't change PDK's cold outside persona in the end bc that's who he is, what i mean is, at least they didn't change the character's individuality.

- flow of story: everything happened for a reason. It never felt draggy to me...well, maybe a little bit by the end but the HY & DK chose to be together by then so it kept me going and assured me everything is going to be alright! No unnecessary makjangs.

- every characters mattered and contributed a story to the drama. No one felt unnecessary.

- music!! Loved the ost!!

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ THE NOT-SO-GOOD ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

- the looming ""phenomenon"" that DK was waiting for to happen kept me from being too happy while watching but since he said he's just going to keep going, I kept on going too without worrying much about it!

- some lovey dovey scenes between Eric and SHJ felt kinda awkward bc it didn't feel genuine. Lol. I feel like they can do intense romance but once it gets mushy and stuff, it's kinda awkward. Idk if it's the acting or intentional. I'm not talking about the kissing and hugging and cuddling bc they're really good at that but more like when they have sweet convos and stuff. Maybe it's the dialogue? Idk, it just felt a bit awkward!

- Han Tae Jin deserved better!!!!!! They should've connected us with him more. I felt like his character was so disconnected in the drama that he seems like in a diff world. They let us get to know OHY#1 but didn't get to let us give more than a glimpse of HTJ & OHY#2's story. I felt bad for him, really.

That's all i could think abt rn. I watch dramas for entertainment so I'm not going to say anything political or noble here. This one is definitely worth the watch despite the flaws! Give the first 4 or 5 eps a try! Then stay for the kissing and hugging ;) (lol srsly they kiss and hug so good! now i want a hug :3)

I can't believe this drama has such low ratings here!!
I'm late on watching this one but it was so absolutely worth it!! I loved everything single thing about this drama! The plot was interesting but they made it rather funny and light-weight to make enjoyable. You will definitely love all the characters and get attached to them... I think the actors and actresses were superb, and this drama really took my emotions on a roller-coaster...
You know its a good drama when it has the power to make you feel for the characters... I can't express how much I love this drama

Feels like comfort food for the soul
Overall Rating - 9
Highly recommended! It's a solid romantic-comedy of two star-crossed lovers whom you can't help but root for. Perfect to watch on a long weekend as you warm yourself up with your favorite blanket or duvet.

Prepare some tissue as some scenes can really move you to tears.

<:>

Production Value - 7
Picturesque wide and close-up shots make up for most of the drama's storytelling. Tight shots can be much more stable and easier on the eyes. On some parts, I almost had a headache from the shaking camera angles.

Color tone for the entire series reminds of spring, which brilliantly evokes that hopeful sensation you'll feel while watching the series.

<:>

Script and Screenplay - 8
Dialogues are sensible and comedic relief timely for each scene. There are just some unnecessary and redundant scenes that could have been removed and air-time used to further showcase depth to the main leads' growth.

<:>

Story - 9
Plot is your typical romantic comedy trope with some semblance to ""My Name is Kim Sam Soon.""

Although I have a love-hate relationship with how they call the female lead ""regular or ugly Hae Yong"" just because her rival and namesake is the ""pretty Hae Yong"", the writers were able to deliver justice to this premise.

Our heroine, Hae Yong, despite being confronted with the insecurities of placing second next to the ""pretty one"" grew stronger and independent, which was evident from how she stands up against other people. As a viewer, I can relate to her struggles in so many levels, and I'm so proud of her for saying these empowering words:

""I am me, you are you."""" There is such power and pull to her. I am charmed!

<:>

Acting and Casting - 10
Stellar performance from everyone in the show. Side characters served more like plot devices to move the story but are likeable and true to their story arcs.

Also, Eric Mun and Seo Hyun Jin were perfect as lead roles. HJ instantly became one of my favorite Korean actresses through this show.

<:>

Music - 10
Background music and soundtrack have truly blessed my ears that I quickly searched for the songs after finishing the first episode.

<:>

Rewatch Value - 10
Another Miss Oh is that comfort food for the soul. Watch it when you're sad, lonely, happy, and worried. Watch it when you're madly in love, and watch it when you're falling apart. You can't go wrong with this one.

This is an extraordinary rom com with many twists and turns on the traditional drama tropes, and will leave you laughing from the story and crying for your mom.

We start off having the traditional lead character setup: male ruined female's life, then they accidentally fall in love, but male couldn't tell female he was responsible for ruining her life, then ???, then happily ever after. So many melodramas are like this, it's not even interesting anymore.

HOWEVER.

We also have something supernatural on the male lead's side, which really added to the foreshadowing/suspense/mystery element of the show. And despite the sad circumstances of the female lead, she is not a dumb character who holds everything in. We also got real villains in this story (more complex than the ""jealous second female lead"" or ""male lead's disapproving rich mom"" tropes), and people's lives are at stake. The foreshadowing along with the ""will they/won't they change their fate"" element really hooked me in, and I can't believe I nearly missed this gem because of the crappy drama title.

First time seeing Eric Mun act, but this is my 3rd? 4th? Seo Hyun-jin drama. And her acting excites me everytime. I can see why Another Miss Oh is one of the fan favorites, because she really killed it with her character emotions. I also hated the villains' guts, so like that's great acting right there (just saying). Also, the chemistry between the leads is so strong! The rewatch value score completely comes from their steamy kiss scenes (shhh

When melodramas give female leads a nice family / mom, the mother-daughter scenes always give me (happy) goosebumps. One thing to look forward to in the drama is the way the female lead's mom expresses her unconditional love for her throughout the story. Not the Go Back Couple / Queen for 7 Days tear-jerking level, but still soooo much heart warming happened during those scenes.

Overall there are better rom coms than this, which is why this is a 9/10; but it's a must-watch if you're looking for some heart-warming family interactions and steamy female/male lead chemistry... and a break from traditional melodrama tropes.

Till this day, this was the only Korean drama to really leave an impression. This drama was SOOO good and iconic, it is a must. The story line was a little confusing, but once you got a sense of what was going on, everything was perfect. The music, cimatagophy, acting and humor about the show made me really care about the story. This was a much better and more fulfilling drama then most k drma people tend to like these days. A guilty pleasure and must watch Korean rom-com.
Sooo many iconic scenes that made you laugh and cry. They were all fun to rewatch. Ep 7 was the most eventful one where she confesses to park dong. Seo hyun jin has the most beautiful cry ever. She not only manges to cry beautifully but realistially in a not annoying way that makes you want yo give her a hug ( this girl had to cry alot) its a serious but not to heavy drama. Liked it.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when I started watching it, but I got hooked very quickly!
Why? Because of the characters. The premise of the story is quite interesting (more interesting than the synopsis lets you think) but for me, it fell flat quite quickly.

The characters only are a reason to watch this drama They are wonderfully written and all the actors are doing an amazing job.
The male lead's sister is one of the best character ever. She's crazy and over the top but in such a great way, you can't help but love her. Her scenes with his best friends are also some of the best (on a side note as a native French speaker, those French speaking moments were a mix of hilarity and wtf?!).
The male lead's brother and his girlfriend came off a bit stupid at the start, but they grow on you quickly and are just adorable.
Kim Mi Kyung (as the female lead's mother) is as amazing as ever.
It's rare to see so much evolution in secondary characters in dramas. The were a great part of the show, and let's face it, I was quickly in more for the 2 other couples than the main one.

The plot itself is quite good, I liked the revenge aspect and the repercussions were played out quite well. However, I found the story became a bit predictable after a bit.
I just couldn't quite buy the whole ""seeing the future"" part, thankfully it's a very small part; I quite liked the reason behind it, it's such a great idea really, but the way it was explained seemed unnatural and forced. The writer(s) just told us part of the plot, a part that no one in the story should have been able to understand.

This drama shows you the work behind sounds in movies/series, and that is quite interesting, I had never really thought about it, and you'll probably find yourself paying attention to all the sound effects in the drama like I did!

It has an excellent plot executed by wonderful actors. And I feel the one thing to carry away from this drama is to never hold back one's affection towards the people we love. I doubt I've ever come across any drama that was similar to this one.

A delightful show
STORY:
- In the main plot, two idiot friends try to take revenge on a girl who dumped one of them on the wedding day and it leads into a total unexpected situation for a lot of characters. The main story takes some unexpected turns until the end and it is very fun. But the most interesting here are the charaters because around this main story they evolve and we finally are able to really understand them as persons and how they accepts reality, and how they take decisions for their life.

CHARACTERS/CAST:
- I loved the main FL lead. Many people said she was annoying and childish. But I found she was a cute imperfect person often victim of this name she shares with a ""perfect person"". Her character evolves but she does not become perfect. She learns to accept herself, find solution to the confusion, find a man who undestand her and really loves her... So many scenes I love with her: when she leaves her house to ""marry"", when she jumps into his arms in the street, when they kiss on the sofa... She was very human and fun to watch when interracting with her parents.
- Do Kyung was also a great character. I liked his job like I liked of they explained it in this drama. Very interesting and useful to the story at the same time. I liked how his life filled by his job is changed by our main girl. He looked lost, sick, vengeful, waiting for someone to save him. I liked when he talked to his best friend that he needed to man up regarding Hae Young and take responsibility.
- I liked the second Ho Hae young too. As the story evolves we understand her better and what she did. She was reallly not perfect like she looked.
- Isadora and Jin Sang were great. Two very weird people who are drawn together. Their dialogue are among the funniest of the drama especially the ones in French.
- Tae Jin: the bf. At first I thought he was just some idiot muscle man in the end I even had sympathy for him as he was the target of many people unknowingly but he still was able to stand up and take proper decisions.
- I loved Oh Hae Young parents.
All these characters and their evolution and interconnections make the richness and cuteness of this drama.

MUSIC:
The music was cute but nothing really to remmeber.

REWATCH: Totally even if I have not rewatched for a while. Too many drama to discover. Anyway I have my favourites scenes I enjoy watching just to have a good laugh.

OVERALL: One of my fav korean drama. Highly reommended.

Overall:
- Very fun rom-com to watch. If you're ready to laugh a lot, then go ahead. :)

Acting/Cast:
- The actors were well-casted, so they played their roles very well. I have watched many of them in previous dramas, therefore; I truly anticipated watching this drama. In the end, I was not disappointed.

Music:
- I swear, during the drama, the music went so well with the scenes, that I often found myself dying laughing. The music was chosen very very well.

Rewatch Value:
- This would be a good rewatch, to be honest. Often, when I have finished a series, I often don't know what to watch next. But this series, I often watch over and over just for laughs.

best support character ever
Of course with any show, the leads are the primary focus. I'll get to them in a minute, but what made it for me in this drama was one of the support characters.

After watching tons of dramas, i think this is the first one in which one of the supporting characters was my favorite.
I just loved, loved, loved Park Soo Kyung, one of my favorite characters ever, by far my favorite support character. I thought she lit up the screen with every scene, showing lots of versatility and just awesome reactions and amazing flexibility. Her storyline started off with her as 'Isadora'- the typical cold hard woman in charge and she played that well, but then things got serious and she shined showing vulnerability and tenderness. I smiled and laughed in almost all of her scenes and also got a little teary eyed during the more serious moments. Can't give her enough praise, such a great character and wonderful performance. Some might think it was over the top, but I thought it was outstanding.

Also liked #1's mother. I like a good character who is not afraid to say what is on his/her mind. As an American, i don't totally understand the Korean/Asian culture of controlling the kids well into adulthood, but i was happy to see mom 'give in' when she saw how deeply the couple loved each other. It was really quite good. Some other dramas play this out with the family torn apart. I hope that is not the norm in real life. As for the dad, nothing there- I guess it was to show parents being on both ends of the spectrum, but I thought he did not add any support at all for his daughter, just looked dumbfounded through his scenes.

Lastly, for support stories, also like An Na and Hoon's story. Loved when they would run and jump in each others arms. She was so bubbly and supportive. Just thought it was cute.

As for the meat of the story- 1st, the female leads, I liked Oh Hae Young #1. In the looks department, #2 was the obvious beauty, but I thought #1 looked good too, but it was easy to see why she felt insecure (and not just in looks department either). As far as being a good person, i thought she was sweet, and really held out for a long time even though she was essentially being rejected in the beginning. Although she was not the superstar like #2, I thought she measured up pretty good. Both of them were scarred on the inside, even #2 who you would think had it all. I guess it teaches you that looks and popularity are not everything? I did like how their relationship developed. I admired how #2 never was nasty and just seemed to be a good person, but she did make the one serious mistake when young which hurt her and him a lot.

As for male leads, i really did not care for either #1 or #2. Prevalent in a lot of these dramas is the way a person just does not respond, does not react or talk about things. Do Kyung was the ultimate say nothing and do nothing guy. There were so many times i kept saying 'say something, do anything'. So i thought this made the first few episodes kind of slow. It always amazes me how such pretty and seemingly with-it girls will wait around so long for someone who seems to not want them and treats them bad. For #2, just a bad guy. Did not like him at all.

Overall, this was a good drama, worth the watch. Lots of good story lines and acting, particularly from the one female support character. Probably won't watch the whole series again, but I will definitely re- watch Soo Kyung's scenes.

The Story
Another Oh Hae Yong is charming, endearing, and heart-tugging. I remember watching the first episode of this drama and I immediately felt the same way as I was watching Coffee Prince (there is some kind of a special place for the first drama that hooked you).

The tragic premise of falling in love with the person who indirectly ruined your life because of a mistake makes you always think when the New Oh Hae Young will find out the truth. Another Oh Hae Young immediately had me invested and as the show is doing really well, extensions were announced for the drama. And as all other extensions, some scenes were a bit dragging but I don't mind the extra scenes for Soo-kyung noona and Ji-sang.

The Cast
I like that the other characters are not written as purely evil and that how all characters are funny and amazing in their own right except, maybe, you know - the mom.

Our Oh Hae-young is just as crazy as she could be. Sometimes she makes me cringe with all the crazy and cheesy things she did. But hey, what is wrong with wearing her love on her sleeves - or her whole outfit? Hahaha. Everything she does screams that she is in love but that just makes her someone I want to root for.

Do-kyung does frustrate me more than he should but I still like him for being caring and all but chooses hide or deny it. And oh, I wanna thank Eric for giving us super duper awesome kisses! :* :* :*

The Music
i love AOHY's OSTs. I always have the Last Song Syndrome on days I watch it. our lead guy is a sound director so I think it's a given that the music should be the best? Honestly, after this, I appreciate the sound directors more and how much they give life to the dramas. I love even the white noises and the sound of nature.

Rewatch Value
Will totally watch it for the crazy antics, warm relationship, and steamy kisses. Definitely for the kisses.

Overall
Beautifully shot, wonderfully directed. Another Oh Hae Young is poignant. Made my heart lonely, happy, sometimes flutter. But it definitely left me warm and hoping for the best for our characters.

i simply adored this drama
it's smooth & easy to watch you can't resist pressing the button to watch next one
& Eric the main actor was so innocent in this drama & the main actress was so cute
& as i love in dramas it had happy ending
i could rate it 10 but i couldn't figure out the relation between the singer & the main actor
till the end i couldn't get it why their lives connected to each other & the drama didn't explain much about that
but simply you have to watch it do not hesitate ;)

It took me a while to start this drama. When I first read the premise of this show, I was baffled by all the positive comments it was getting. Honestly, the premise is still kind of the craziest part to me. The number of coincidences, and then the whole seeing the future is just ridiculous to me. But the execution of such a fantastical idea was so beautifully done, I kind of just forgot the impossibility of it all as I watched the drama. The reality of how harsh and how happy love can be was implemented so, so very well. Every character had depth. I loved that the female lead wasn't perfect, that she was that person who had suffered from the feeling of not being the lead in her own movie, as many of us have felt at some point. The male lead was far from prince charming as well, and that made him all the more charming. Even the antagonists were portrayed so well, you can't help but feel empathy for their situation.

All the actors did a fabulous job. I honestly had not seen most of them before and was very impressed. From the main characters to the supporting, all portrayed their characters very well.

The music is pretty good. I especially enjoyed the song by The Black Skirts. The soundtrack fit the drama well and stays with you, but it's not anything exceptional.

Overall, for me, this drama captured so much of the ups and downs of love, from the feelings of betrayal, to the embarrassment and pain of not having your feelings return, to the crazy things one does to get over it, to the bliss of being together with nothing and no one else to care about. It made me laugh, it made my heart hurt, it made me want to shake the characters at times. It definitely caught me by surprise and I am really glad I decided to give it a chance. I will probably watch it again in the future.

This drama is so crazy that it's loveable.

Seriously. The mood swings, the drinking, the yelling, the crying. It's somewhat exaggerated, yet relatable.
This drama captivated me since the first episode. I loved the chemistry between the main characters, and the side characters really make the story more fun and loveable. Sometimes, the scenes feel a little draggy, and repetitive- but that's the only downside to the drama.

The supernatural component of the drama is what made the drama more interesting for me.

I recommend this drama to anyone who like romance dramas.

I was really excited about this drama and was really enjoying it... But I just couldn't get past the male lead's anger issues. Most of the time he was a very gentle lead, very thoughtful and caring to the female lead. He would get overly aggressive with his younger brother and some of the younger guys on his team, with slapstick hitting and what-not, things that I have come to overlook in dramas. But over all I liked him, he seemed to care a lot about the other characters welfare. BUT then out of nowhere he would have outbursts of anger that were so over the top I just couldn't overlook them... I mean I tried... I really did, but they just got too extreme. At one point he hits a car window (with the female lead inside the car) so hard that he busts the window and cuts up his hand. He gets angry at the second male lead for something SML had said to the female lead and he purposefully crashes his car into SML's car. Then is shown not as the INSANITY that it would be in other dramas ( let alone real life) but as somehow heroic or romantic. Then in one scene (because male lead can see the future) he sees himself and female lead having a physical fight with each other, and then making out, and this seems to turn him on... He later threatens to hit female lead if she doesn't comply with something he is asking of her... and she replies with ""Does hitting me get you excited?"" as if this idea is a turn on for her as well... This only makes his think about the fight they will have and the makeout... as if yes, indeed hitting her would get him excited.... FINALLY, I had to drop this drama, when we actually see the scene he had scene in his vision, she the female lead gets angry at Male lead for toying with he so much, (which he has been doing) and she starts being pretty violent to him... Hitting him repeatedly, male lead becomes violent back in order to get her to stop hitting him, she ends up with a bloodily lip because of it, he DOES get excited, slams her on the wall and makes out with her. Guys, this is not romantic. This is NOT okay. If this was real life, he would FOR SURE be an abusive partner. I can normally overlook some of the aggressiveness in male leads, especially in older dramas... I know that this is a stylistic and cultural view of masculinity, BUT this is just abuse. If this were any other genre, even in a kdrama, this would be the character that we think might be unhinged or the serial killer... but because it's a rom-com, we are supposed to just see him as passionate. THIS IS NOT PASSION. This is a mane with dangerous anger issues, who needs A LOT of counseling and who doe not need to be dating anyone! Sorry that was a lot, but I had a lot of feelings, thanks!

This drama garnered much anticipation and it had good reason. This drama is about the struggles about a person who has to go through so many struggles as she was constantly compared to a person who was better than her in almost all aspects.

The Good
I enjoyed the story- it was hilarious and heartbreaking as many of you probably had that situation where there is always a person better than you in every way. I loved Isadora (soo Kyung) and her hilarious drunken antics- honestly she is a great actress! I loved all of the actors and actresses since all of them were hilarious in their own right. They portrayed their characters so well that it made me fall in love with them even more.

The plot-line will pull at your heartstrings- the pain of wanting to be with someone but you can't will make you tear up. The two main leads have a great chemistry with one another and it will just make you fall in love with their relationship.

The Bad
In all honesty- i feel that the normal Oh Hae Young's acting was quite unrealistic. She fell in love with Do Kyung- but she seriously got onto my nerves when she demanded unrealistic expectations of Do Kyung. I find it irritating whenever she over-exaggerated her emotions. In my opinion, I think it wouldv'e been better if her character wasn't that demanding.

Not to mention the romance was sometimes overly unrealistic- especially when the two main leads get back together after a fight. Honestly- how does a couple go from nearly ripping each other apart back to a love-induced fantasy without any regard to why they broke up in the first place. I felt that Do Kyung's character was faking it a bit too much whenever he got back together with Hae Young after the break up- like his character had a complete 180 degree turn around. Since when did Do Kyung smile and grin so wide that it makes the viewers just think he's a totally different character!? (although i don't mind since he's such a cutie)

Despite my comments, I know that this drama wasn't intended to be realistic, however I thought it would be nice if there was consistency in their emotions but that's just my little excerpt.

Music
Although the music was fantastic and was quite fitting- they kept using the same 5 tracks over and over again as it gets quite repetitive.... on the bright side, at least it sounded great!

Overall I enjoyed this drama quite a lot and perhaps will be visiting this drama once again in the future!

This is the first drama I have been able to watch all the way through with Eric Mun. Don't get me wrong, I love him to bits. I think he is gorgeous. But I don't usually like melodramas, and this one almost went that route too. But the story kept up the humor too, so I stayed through til the end, and I am so glad I did! The story was wacky and cute. The OST was perfect. I am even listening to it again as I write this.
Most importantly, the reason I watched this drama. The kisses....were...ahmahzing. Like. WHOA. Now I am going to have to rethink all of my favorite K drama kisses. Totally worth the wait on this one guys. The skinship too, was pretty great. I liked this drama a lot and will be reviewing more about it soon on my blog, I am sure.

More than any other part of this drama, the cinematography annoyed the crap out of me. Multiple times an episode there are scenes with this intentionally shaky camera and it made me a little seasick. It was so hard to watch. Like...ok you're trying to add drama so you shake the camera all the time? Or did you let the intern film it? Did you hand the camera to a toddler who was constantly bouncing from excitement? Once you notice it you can't unnotice it.

The comedy was also woefully lacking, I think if they had done a better job pulling off the comedy elements I would have rated it higher. In the end, it just ended up being really sad the majority of the time. The acting was ok for the most part. I wish they had used some of the side characters for more effective comedy, especially the lead dude's sister who could have really been hilarious but ended up just sort of being a dud most of the time because she was so limited by the boundaries of the script/direction.

IDK, for me this drama wasn't that great at all. I gave it 5 stars because there were some moments that made me chuckle and some I could relate to, and the concept wasn't terrible...but not more than 5 stars because the execution was not well done. It's always sad to me when it seems like the actors gave it their all but either in script or direction the whole thing just flops sideways. I wouldn't rewatch this and probably wouldn't recommend it to friends either.

For me Another Miss Oh is one of the big surprises of this year. After stumbling upon some articles about the drama, I decided to give it a try. As most rom-coms tend to be very clich√©, I wasn't expecting much. But it sure didn't disappoint me.

The drama doesn't set itself apart with it's story as it's a common plot in a rom-com. That doesn't mean it can't be any good. It's nice for a change, to see how a drama works it's way around a clich√© story(line). What really makes this drama worth watching is how the characters are portrayed. It's something where Another Miss Oh distinguishes itself with from the rom-com genre.

What this drama does perfectly is bringing out the charms of every character. Every single ""main"" character had depth, his or her own story and how they (try to) deal with it. The characters are written in such a good way that they are relatable and you sympathize with hem. That's a difficult thing to achieve in a rom-com as they usually focus on cringy, clich√© stuff. Both Seo Hyun Jin (Oh Hae Young) & Eric Moon (Park Do Kyung) did a excellent job portraying the main characters. Especially Seo Hyun Jin. You don't see characters very often that are pretty straight forward (genuine) as her. Whenever Oh Hae Young is happy, you feel happy. She feels sad, you feel bad for her. Eric Moon does very well portraying a hurt and by result, introvert guy who struggles with himself. Park Do Kyung's journey to happiness is nice to see as he slowly opens up to Oh Hae Young. It's not strange to dislike ""Pretty"" Oh Hae Young (Jeon Hye Bin) in the beginning. If that's the case that means she played her role pretty good. Learning more about her story, you can't help but sympathize with her. Almost every scene with Park Soo Kyung (aka Isadora) was memorable & fun to watch. Her 4D personality & ""French"" conversations with Lee Ji Sang (Kim Ji Suk) are hilarious. She did a really good job portraying her serious/emotional side as well as her random/drunk persona. Let's not forget the other characters as they all contributed in each his/her own way. If I had to single out someone from the supporting characters it would be the mother of Oh Hae Young played by Kim Mi Kyung. She played a convincing mother, one which feels real. Encouraging and worrying. Whenever Oh Hae Young needed her, she was there. I have yet to see a drama where she doesn't do her character justice. Heo Young Ji did very well as she stood her ground with her first role in a tv drama. Acting as Yoo Anna, a cheerful & energetic girl, I could see similarities with her personality in real life.

The OST is filled with great songs & background music. Ben, Wable & Roy Kim's music (and more) really fit in well with the vibe of the drama. They provide the necessary feels in each scene which sets the tone. Some songs are played more often than others but overall they choose the best suited one for the mood of the scene.

With an extension of 2 episodes, I had hoped they would have ended this in a better way. There were still some loose ends that weren't settled. Not saying I'm entirely dissatisfied with the ending but the extra episodes were pretty much unnecessary. Other than that I really enjoyed this ride and would recommend people to check this drama.

Another Miss Oh is a drama that provides good laughs mixed with touching moments and great acting. Add a little bit of (subtle) life advice and there you have the drama in a nutshell. A refreshing take on how a rom-com can be.

The story of this drama from the outset isn't really a typical romcom, though it is certainly a romcom by genre. The story first and foremost is about being the best version of yourself, living the best life you can live, and loving yourself. It's a character-centric drama and that's what I love about it.

This show features one of the hottest makeout sessions you will ever see in a Korean drama. But that really wasn't the selling point of the show for me. It was the characters.

I just love the character of Normal Oh Hae Young. Precisely because, as her nickname indicates, she is so normal. And for lack of a better word, relatable. She is such an atypical Korean drama heroine, and I feel that this is one of the few truly female-centric K-dramas out there (just because a drama has a female lead character doesn't mean it's female-centric). I mean, even the drama title has her name in it!

Eric's character, Do-kyung, is very much a typical male K-drama lead, but in this show, you can observe real growth and progression in his character, which is pleasing. The supernatural element in his character's storyline is intriguing and definitely an important part of his character and his growth, but it isn't the thing that will stay with me from this drama.

Even then, this show like any other K-drama is definitely not free from angst. After the midpoint of the show, the angst kicks in fast and really hard, and made me wonder, oh man when will the . I do wonder though, if there wasn't a 2-episode extension, whether the story would have been slightly better. The extension was certainly felt, but it wasn't painfully obvious as it usually is in many dramas. But as I always say, the angst usually has a great payoff.

Seo Hyun Jin and Eric have sizzling chemistry, which is not surprising as they're known to have good chemistry with their co-leads in other dramas as well.

Seo Hyun-jin breathed so much life into the Normal Oh Hae Young character and you can just see how much love she had for Normal Oh Hae Young. I first watched her in Let's Eat 2 and I've loved her ever since. Eric is hot, what more can I say. Good actor too.

As for the supporting cast and characters, Jeon Hye-bin was alright; I believe she infused her Pretty Oh Hae Young character with compassion, to win the viewers over from what would have started as a very hostile position against her character, to one of empathy and love. Lee Jae Yoon honestly wasn't given that much material to work with, so it's hard to give a firm comment on his character as well.

Some of the other more 'miscellaneous' characters really steal the show - Normal Oh Hae Young's parents, Soo-kyung and Jin Sang (love Kim Ji-suk so much and wish there was more love for him) with their own little cute but in no way insignificant loveline,

Ben is killing it with these soundtracks; I previously heard her sing on the Oh My Ghostess soundtrack, and she had a great song on that show. She sings the theme song on this show too, and it's fantastic; it's catchy and meaningful too.

After completing the show I wondered to myself why it took me so long to watch this show. So please don't be like me and regret not watching it sooner!

I thought this was such a wonderfully crafted show. Seo Hyun Jin herself claimed that if the show failed to deliver then it'd be on the actors, and she's absolutely correct in that statement. The writing is tremendous. Another Miss Oh had many wonderful characters with vivid personalities and attributes and an original story that blended well-thought out fantasy with realism in our characters. Park Do Kyung has a precognition power, but it's explained in a perfectly logical way from a scientific point of view. There isn't a clear flaw in the theory of his visions and what they mean. It was incredibly tight. And Oh Hae Young was a brilliant character. She was a loveable loser who cried, complained and laughed all the way through. Compared to the pretty Oh Hae Young, she was worse in every regard but of course, we, the viewers, know the real truth, as does Park Do Kyung. The side plots were all engaging in their own right and added a lot of depth to the main plot thread, making this show as well rounded as need be. Excellent show. Eric Mun shone really well with his minimalist, brooding performance, even compared to the more eccentric Seo Hyun Jin.

My opinion: good story, there is a lot of grief by a misunderstanding, the incomprehension between the two women (Seo Hyun Jinis/Jun Hye Bin) is touching to see. The inferiority complex of the key player is well acted. Eric: his inner battle with his feelings for Seo Hyun Jinis and knowing that he has sabotaged her upcoming marriage (is a good sample of acting). His friend there had a less pleasant role. what the man, who has the ability to see into the future, this ensured for the airy in the series. It was a pleasant series to watch, you have to stand up in order to write a story.

You either love it or you hate it
I just love this writer so much that what can I even say...I mean it's the writer of My Mister we are talking about. The direction was also mind blowing. Some scenes are just like a dream, and here is the irony, an innuendo you will figure out only once you watch the drama. I still listen to the soundtrack and it still brings me back to all the messy, complex and nostalgic feelings of when I first watched it. The love stories were all so tangible and understandable that you can't but feel closer and closer to her emotions. This drama is not aiming for perfection, hell no. Every character is so imperfect and somehow at some point it feels complete, it feels like you were in the story all this while and you start feeling empathy for each of the characters.

The acting of the whole cast was superb and it was so funny! My favorite character is the eonni, she is so funny and talented that I can't imagine how much they must have been laughing or been in awe while shooting her scenes! You will find yourself laughing in scenes you thought were the saddest. It was Korean comedy 10/10. During some cuts it was difficult to keep watching in public for the fear that some weird reaction came out, especially during the kiss scenes, but oh let me tell you, the first kiss, that was the best onscreen kiss of Korean television ever. No overestimation here.

I found the story-line to be extremely unique and all the characters were three-dimensional. Many of the things will make you extremely angry and they should: that's exactly the portrayal of the beauty standard in Korean societies. If you think it's unfair, well done, you got the point.

Amazing
I absolutely loved this show!! Solid 9.5/10. I wasn't bored once and every episode kept me watching from scene to scene, all the way from beginning to end. It's very hard to find a drama that will keep my attention like that these days. This show has some of the best chemistry I've seen (those hugs!) not to mention what might be the most intense and hottest first kiss scene in kdrama history.

My only complaint is half way through the show FL started to seriously get on my nerves. She's so incredibly moody that she was annoying even me and I'm not sure how ML could stand her, she was so moody that sometimes he couldn't do anything right. She's also crazy, and would tell him things like randomly blurting out ""I want us to die together right now."" By the end of the show she was constantly whining, nagging and crying and even embarrassing him.

That's literally my only issue with this show, and it was easy to overlook because everything else was so damn good. Definitely a must watch for the chemistry alone.

PERFECT! JUST PERFECT!
I'm writing this review while listening the OST and I still can feel the happiness while watching this drama.

So far, I only have 2 dramas on my most favorite K-drama list: Because This Is My First Life and Another Miss Oh. These 2 dramas value a perfect score to me. I have nothing to protest about them two. Everything is just awesomely perfect.

Another Miss Oh is one of a kind, very special. At the first time, I even questioned why the title has to have that ""another"" word. Turned out, that word is the main keyword of the whole story. Brilliant!

I already saw Seo Hyun Jin from Dr. Romantic ( yes, I watched Dr. Romantic first) but she didn't awe me like what she did in Another Miss Oh. But I can tell that she's a good actress. No matter what role she plays, she's good. What awe me the most is how she sang beautifully on one of the OST is this drama. She sounds very nice! Not forget to tell that Eric Mun is very handsome in his 40. I still wonder why K-drama actors don't age! The older, the hotter. Gosh!

Please do watch this one if you haven't yet!

I insanely died and came alive again after those heated moments between the main leads. They had so much chemistry my heart could barely take it all in. I think that is what really captivated my attention towards this drama. Most drama kisses are usually stiff and it aggravates me, so it was refreshing to see something that's actually pleasing.

The plot of the drama was also intriguing enough for me to want to continue watching. Here we have two people with the same names but two different personalities. Both female leads had cute moments with the male lead, but inevitably only one was able to truly become end game with the male lead. Supernatural effects of the male lead receiving foreshadowing moments that dominantly contained visions of the female lead.

The show was in fact pretty predictable. There wasn't many plot twists, but they happened in places that was expected of the drama (I mean, I'm not complaining though).

Overall, my rewatch scale is high just to notify myself that the scenes between the two leads are a must watch again. Such a spectacular drama that deserves being watched again and again.

Light and fresh comedy
I looked for something to watch while waiting for the new episodes of ""Vincenzo"" and ""Sisyphus"", and bumped into ""Another Miss Oh"".
No regrets.
Loved the mom (""today is the day I kill her"", ""you can keep her"" ...) always looking out for her daughter, though trying to show that she doesn't.
Loved the fact that among the members of the two original couples there were no bastards, but merely victims of the circumstances. Too bad that the author did not give a glimpse of what happened to TaeJin and Pretty Oh HaeYoung (simply showing one dating and/or applying for a job, or deciding to attend the wedding notwithstanding the earlier mess).
Not too crazy about the punk girl and her boyfriend.
Could have improved, and better rehearsed, the French spoken by SooKyung, e.g. the ""embrasse"" in the elevator, and the other guy saying ""better get out"". Having French instead of standard boring English was however refreshing.
Loved the beach scene where one of the girl is also called Oh HaeYoung and is unrelated - of course - to the two other Oh Hae Young from Seoul.

Another Miss Oh, where do I start?
This was a ""last resort"" drama for me, I avoided watching it over and over again, would always find another drama to watch instead, etc. boy was that dumb of me.
As one of the top reviews states, this drama isn't your usual romantic comedy, I've watched two dramas by this director and without a doubt, this one blew the other out of the water.

Now I will say it begins slowly and speeds up quickly, there is a lot of push and pull and this drama is not for the judgmental types. The characters are the most real-to-life drama characters I've seen, they handle things realistically, and realistically people make dumb decisions that impact them and others negatively, so you'll see a fair amount of that in this drama, if you're someone who can relate strongly to characters and understand dumb decisions this will be a good drama for you. As someone who frequently tries to understand the psyche and decision-making process of characters, this was a joy to watch actually.

An interesting thing about this series is the premonition aspect, I love how it's not so pushed that the series feels unrealistic or fantasy based like While You Were Sleeping, which is one of my favorite dramas, but that's beside the point. The combination of different genres was fantastic, unlike Introverted Boss's genre transitions (Introverted Boss is by the same writer, mind you.) this felt fluid and natural in terms of the scene changes. The drama can become frustrating because, as a stated before, the characters are realistically ambivalent and often dumb, so you will have to go into this drama with patience and understanding for human faults.

The main couple doesn't have a perfect relationship as some reviewers have stated, but in real life, relationships aren't perfect, that said I would not by a long shot say their relationship is toxic or abusive. They have drastically different personality types, but that makes for amazing character development of their flaws and fears, it was great to see their relationship progress with Do Kyung being so closed off and protected and Hae Young being so open. That said if you read the ""Cold Man/Warm Woman"" tag you needn't worry, while he is quiet, stubborn, and many times irritating or grumpy, Do Kyung is never one of those male leads that is super possessive or abusive to the female lead. Any character faults or relationship problems are self-aware and out in the open, they aren't viewed as positives or ambiguous as sometimes character flaws are in dramas.

The supporting cast is WONDERFUL, after watching this Ye Ji Won moved from being an actress I liked to my current favorite drama actress, as I'm rewatching this series for the third time, this time with my mom, my mother and I are constantly laughing at Ye Ji Won's character, she's so lovable and crazy while dually being serious and understandable. Despite their flaws, all the supporting characters felt in some way lovable (save Chairman Jang, I hate him) or at least understandable. I do however think I'm the only person besides one of the top reviewers here who really disliked Tae Jin and found him irritating while dually understanding him and pitying him, I noticed while watching the drama many people hated Do Kyung and loved Tae Jin then eventually changed sides and acted as though they were rooting against Tae Jin the entire time. My problem with Tae Jin was that at least popular OHY knew when to call it quits and at least Do Kyung regretted his mistakes and felt remorse, as the other top reviewer states, Tae Jin reacts like a child throughout the entire show and throws temper tantrums, understandable tantrums, but anger-blinded tantrums nonetheless. I may be biased though because while I believe he's a good actor, I've never cared for any of Lee Jae Yoon's roles.

Regarding the OST, there are only three dramas where I like more than two songs off the OST, those dramas are While You Were Sleeping, Goblin, and Another Miss Oh. I'm not into Kpop, but I do love me some Korean ballads and indie music. There are a couple songs that occasionally are played too much, but the good songs make up for it. If It Was You makes me nearly cry every time and this drama introduced me to one of my top 10 favorite artists, The Black Skirts. The first time they played Till The End of Time/Wait More by The Black Skirts I was like ""Oh no, I'm gonna get hooked aren't I?"" I was right, every time they played this song I broke down crying, Bryan Cho/The Black Skirts is so gifted at melancholy music and Wait More is one of it's kind where OSTs are concerned, very unique and not very drama-like if that makes sense. Another artist I loved on here was Roy Kim, if he's on an OST you know it's a winner.

Overall, I'd say to definitely watch this drama, if I were to suggest three dramas to a person who has never watched one I'd suggest Good Doctor, WYWS, and the first one I'd recommend is this. My main suggestion would be to go into this drama openminded with patience and understanding of human faults and if you can do that I think you'll love it.

It may seem like a typical RomCom drama but it's beyond that. I never expected anything from this drama but it gave me unexpected things. It's imperfections makes it perfect. Every moment was touching from Hae Young's struggle to gain her individuality, Do Kyung's regret of the mistake they made which made him care for Hae Young, Hae Young's ever supportive parents (which in the beginning didn't know of Hae Young's real situation), every character's own struggles, to every relationship made in the drama. I love how the two Hae Youngs affected the whole plot. It's not titled Another Oh Hae Young for nothing. The characters have their own personality, the differences which made them build bonds. Although at some point, the other characters seemed to be confused by the relationship between the two Hae Youngs, Do Kyung, and Han Tae Jin that the one who knows have to explain what's really happening and that's all because of the two Oh Hae Youngs. Lol. Anw, it's a roller coaster of emotions. One time, I'm laughing, the second time, I'm crying. There are also times that I'm both happy and sad. That's how it pierced through my heart. The female lead's crying moments are one of the best things about the drama.

Interesting Premise, slow in some parts
8.5/10 is my rating. This tv drama is also known as Another Miss Oh. This is a 2016 South Korean drama with 18, 60 minute, episodes.

Oh Hae-young (Seo Hyun-jin) grew up in the shadow of another girl, who went to the same school, who had the same name. Things finally seem to be going right for her in her adult life when she is on the verge of marrying Han Tae-jin (Lee Jae-yoon) an attractive businessman who is worthy of bragging about. However, the day before their wedding, Tae-jin breaks it off saying some very hurtful things. Park Do-kyung (Eric Mun) is no stranger to heartbreak, his fiance did not show up on the day of their wedding. Do-kyung finds out that Hae-young is going to marry another man, Tae-jin and Do-kyung and his friend formulate plot to ruin the husband to be and stop the marriage. Do-kyun is a successful sound director who supports his brother and his widowed mother. His mother is looking for a wealthy husband who just so happens to have the right connections to help Do-kyung carry out his plot. Only problem is he is breaking up the wedding, and ruining the husband to be, of the wrong Hae-young. Now there are two miserable, jilted, people who fatefully cross paths and find solace in each other. Hae-young does not know Do-kyung, who she is drawn to as if by fate, is the very person who caused her current unhappiness. Can a relationship built over such a deception last? Tae-jin is acquitted and returns to reclaim his intended bride. Will Hae-youngs feelings rekindle? The other ""pretty"" Hae-young returns and decides she made a mistake and wants Do-kyun back, will her beauty and style win back Do-kyun? Can the ""normal"" Oh Hae-young step out of the shadow of the other Hae-young and realize her own worth?

Spoiler ? I liked this one but I didn't love it. Some of the posters showed dolls and such so I thought it would be a lot more comedic than it actually was. The characters said things to each other that I cannot imagine anyone saying to someone else and that person still liking them. They also say things about other people and life that is a bit shocking. I really liked the side romance. I also liked the main male lead's sister and his friends. The story was compelling, the romance was sweetly satisfying but there were times, when I felt angry or shocked at things the characters said or did. I also found that it dragged a bit for me, in some areas. And her mom was strangely abusive to her daughter. it was good but I didn't think it was great. Totally worth watching but not a list topper.

Why oh why didn't I watch this sooner? I can't believe how many times I passed by this title and didn't bother clicking, I was such a fool!

This drama has now become my NUMBER 1 FAVORITE OF ALL. It's original, it keeps you guessing, it touches your heart, it makes you laugh, it makes you fall in love, makes your heart break, it's just a freakin' good drama!

The characters, main and supporting were perfectly written and perfectly portrayed by the actors. I can relate so much to Oh Hae Young who's just all in when she's in love because I'm just as crazy when I was in love.

This drama moved me so much and I have not been so affected like this by a drama in such a long time.

If you like to dramas that make you swoon, angry, and cry. This is for you and you won't regret it. By end of ep1, you will be hooked!

Such a glorious angsty relationship. Love it when the ML is not the typical flowerboy. Takes the past connection trope and twists it upside down. Loved the 2nd ML (esp. with exposed forehead). The hospital scene at the end of ep. 13 was brilliant, and so was the message at the end. I'm sure CLOY had at least three references to this drama, which was a great way for the writer to show her appreciation (e.g. the Rat's new profession at the end). I just wish the FL wasn't so over the top though. It made her much less relatable.

It initially took me a very long time to begin this drama because it looked much too cliche for me, but this drama never ceased to surprise.

STORY:
Reading the summary of the show first made me very skeptical of this drama, so going in, I was pretty critical. As the episodes progressed, I realized just how charming this drama was! I loved the chemistry between all three couples in the show, each for different reasons. Do Kyeong and Hae Yeong were a really loving, forever couple who made me feel as if as if all love ends happily. Soo Kyeong and Jin Sang are a mature couple who may seem as if they won't last, but overall, you can't stop rooting for them to be happy. Hoon and Anna are that first puppy love couple who make you either want to make you want to roll your eyes or ""awwww"" over. Overall, I was delighted with each's story and growth.
Hands down, my favorite part of the entire show was the relationship between Hae Young and her mother. I instantly fell in love with Duk Yi for her overbearing protection over her daughter. I think it's rare to see mother's who come off as stoic and cold, but are really caring and have nothing but the deepest love for there children, so seeing such a character on screen was refreshing. And I absolutely adored Duk Yi's explanation of her feelings towards Hae Young in episode 16. It reminded me of my own love-hate relationship with my mother and caused me to tear up a bit.
The story and pacing overall seemed to drag on a bit and they are the main reason why I'm not giving the story a 10 :/.

ACTING/CAST:
Other than Kim Mi Kyung and Lee Jae Yoon, I was completely unfamiliar with the entire cast, and yet everyone shined! I really don't know how to get into detail each person individually, but overall, every character in the drama fit so perfectly in their roles.

MUSIC AND REWATCH VALUE:
I enjoyed a few of the songs, but most I couldn't stomach after having to hear them play over and over again.
Because the drama seemed to lag on for so long, it's hard for me to see myself rewatching this again. But because of my love for the story and characters, I feel that I will find myself cuddled up in bed, late at night, during a long weekend rewatching it.

OVERALL:
Overall, Another Miss Oh is a delightfully charming drama and I hope that I can find such charm in many more dramas to come.

So Many Feels!!!
This Kdrama made it to my top 10 all time faves.
This is just so good. It made me feel so much in every episode. The story is unique and very heartwarming, not just for the romance but for the other aspects of the drama as well. The relationship of the FL with her parents especially her mom is very relatable, the side characters and their stories are not annoying and enriches the drama and the ending was very well done as well. For me, they were able to close the show happily for all the characters and their issues resolved satisfactorily.
The acting was on point and the entire cast was amazing.
The soundtrack was also very good. I watched this a few years ago but up to now I still listen to their songs.
All in all a very great drama and very highly recommended.

Extremely funny
Came to watch it bcos of I Live Alone tv show. And LOVED it, I laughed hard and cried too. I wasn‚Äôt a fan with none of the main casts but turned out they didn‚Äôt disappoint. LOVED THE MANY KISS SCENES hahahah very natural making the romance believable, I don‚Äôt like the awkward lip-locking-only kind of kiss.
And the comedy is so funny but not slap-stick like. Overall I believe this series is slightly underrated, trust me and give this a try until the second episode and guaranteed you‚Äôll be hooked.

My forever favorite drama
Oh Hae young has a piece in my heart I watched this in 2016 and till this day I still watch it. This drama is not for everybody but it did to me cause I related to Oh Hae Young and the strong hope of atleast once in her life be the first option and have a good life without feeling like an underdog specially since her character is not a push over but a fighter. This drama talks about heartbreak, depression and specially self growth. Even though I agree PDY doesn't deserve Oh Hae Young she in the end loved him fully and that's who she wanted and became first option without feeling like a second option because it was always her for him. The story is messy but well explained and it unravels ep by ep and you understand everything at the end of the drama. So if you have like 100 questions at first ep no worries everything is sorted out and not dragged. Like I said this drama is definetly not for everyone, it's usually for people that can relate to her story which I highly did and once you finish it you feel a sort of warmth because like the drama says "" living is winning"" I wish the Oh Hae Youngs in this world to keep fighting and keep your head up regardless of how shitty life is. I hope anybody that reads this review gives this drama a chance and sees how special it is.

This drama is mostly like foreshadowing which in my case thee used Pretty well. I loved how every character big and small where somehow very important and a big key role to fuel a lot of the anger and disappointment in the episodes. Every character is important. I feel as the characters bring the main roles together. It‚Äôs like a force pushing them together. This drama is one of the hilarious dramas I have ever seen thanks to the lead actress in here. Her facial expression are really really good. Every character is connected from the past all the way to the present and even in the future. You will know what I mean when you watch the drama.

This is another one of those dramas that are always on the recommended lists. After watching it, I can see why. It has a lot of good qualities to it.

The characters were all pretty likable, and mostly acted in none stupid ways. When someone made a dumb decision, I could at least see it from their perspective and understand how they would of come to that conclusion.

I found the main romance to be very delightful. It took awhile, but once they started showing their feelings too each other, it was very heartwarming.

The main problem I had with this drama though, that stopped it from being a 9.5 or even a 10 from me, is that it did a terrible job letting the viewer know when the scene they were watching was a flashback or present day. The timeline in this drama moves so erratically that when a scene changes I always expect it to be like the next day or later that day, but then realizing sometimes that it was something that happened over a year ago. The opposite happened sometimes as well. A scene change and I think they are in the past because the characters are wearing something different or they are talking about something that was never shown, only to find out it was still present day.

I really enjoyed this drama and can understand completely why it is recommended so much.

I highly recommend this drama.

It's a must watch drama

The story of this drama is simple but very it's captivating. The story is written beautifully with consistent pace from the very start although it slows down a bit after episode 11. Twists that have been added to the story make the drama become more intriguing. Moreover, side story of characters other than the leads is inserted with a good proportion. Honestly, the story is perfectly written.

The casts have done great job in playing their roles. Not only the leads, but also the supporting characters. It's really heart wrenching to see the female lead despair as well as the male lead remorse. The other characters, especially main lead's sister and friend are potrayed in a very crazy but suitable way. I highly appreciate the casts

I love all the sountracks of this drama. I listen to all the soundtracks without being tired of them.

I strongly recommend you to watch it.

Silly and fun and a bit too serious, all keeping each other in balance with a touch of whimsy. loved the main character, she was Wonderful (and so refreshing compared to your average kdrama female lead). All of the side characters were ridiculously fun to watch as well. Even though I still don't really get what was going on (with the premonition stuff), I really enjoyed the story, and how it was all dramatically revealed piece by piece~ such a fun roller coaster ride! I also have a newfound appreciation for Eric Moon

Refreshingly mature take on the romance K-drama.
I absolutely loved this drama, and thought the way the story progressed and eventually resolved was such a mature, refreshing change from what I have traditionally seen in the romance genre. Even the side/second-lead stories wrap up beautifully, and I love it when side characters and secondary love interests are given agency independent of the main characters and story arcs. You will come to love each of the characters in this drama for who they are as individuals, and I was honestly sad to say goodbye once I reached the end of the series.

Conflict is handled very maturely, and it feels like the writers favoured personal growth - however painful - over stereotypical, unearned resolutions. After following the characters' journeys it felt like everybody got the ending that was best for them, NOT the ending that made them happiest, and I will always treasure this series for that. I also really like that the main couple were given the opportunity to grow and learn about each other, as despite the extraordinary circumstances it felt like we were watching a far more realistic love story unfold.

My only real negative with Another Miss Oh is a particular side-couple we meet early on, who are a strange juxtaposition to the rest of the highly mature cast. They have a significant age gap, with the girl being a young teenager and the ""boy"" being close to thirty, and although I understand they were comic relief I just found the majority of their scenes both uncomfortable and pretty unnecessary.

Other then that, Another Miss Oh is a wonderful drama I'd be very happy to sit through again, due to its fantastic emotional maturity.

Some wise words I heard from this series
üë•
Ep 2: 23.55 01.03.45
Ep 3: 49.20
Ep 6: 58.53

I might not really into this series because I've seen a lot of spoiler out there on the internet (which says that this title is underrated for the good stuff it brought). I had high expectation for that and it is end up ruining my experience of watching. Some comedies aren't my type of humor. And the romance too. I'm sorry I know this is a romcom drama. I just can't handle it. But still, I agree when people says the OST's are the BEST OST.

I never considered watching Another Miss Oh because it seemed really complicated and just not my thing, but after being encouraged multiple times by my friend Kingsqueen whose watched it multiple times, I figured it was time to give it a chance. And I must say - it very cute! I very much enjoyed it. The ending was nicely done where everything was wrapped up neatly. I was told that there was a plot twist and you don't get to that twist until the ending :D. I can happily say that the twist and overall execution of the drama makes sense based on the rules set by the drama, so that was also a plus for me. I'm not sure if I'd watch the *whole* thing all over again, but I did love some very specific parts that I'll probably watch again on YouTube as clips.

I really loved certain characters, such as the lawyer friend, Ji Sang, and Oh Hae Young's parents. I personally enjoyed watching Ji Sang and the noona interact the most - their dynamics were pretty laugh out loud hilarious.
A lot of people said that Do Kyung's mother was pretty horrible, but I didn't find her to be that bad because the Chairman was WAYYY worse to me. And in the end, I still felt bad for the ex-fiance of Oh Hae Young. He got the short end of the stick soooo many different ways by so many people that I feel for him. He was douche-y at some moments, but I pity him, really - his life was pretty crappy all because of other people.

Overall, it was a very nice drama. I'm glad I watched it. Personally, I like a bit more comedy in my drama, but this was still good even though it had a bit more serious parts in it than I prefer. It actually reminds me a lot of Laughter in Waikiki. Laughter in Waikiki is very similar in set-up, just a much lighter version with no *real* bad guy other than life itself.

its hard to come by a good comedy romance drama because it tend to be cliche and predictable. most of the time you can guess what would the characters say next or what they gonna do based on their personality/role and the situation. yet this drama overcome all of that. while the scene or situation might seem cliche but id often go ""woah thats cool line"" or ""what a darn thing to do"". this drama also managed to avoid useless filler and unnecessary fanservice scene. every scene count for the build up. tension and emotion. and while while it is a comedic drama it has some depth to its story. pretty rare.

there are also many memorable scene like the ""drunken french"" or ""drunk/crazy dance""

the music also complement the drama well

This drama was sooooooo hilarious!!
The story was pretty different but in the same time was ""okay""
For me was dificult to fall in love with the main characters, anyway I started to like her (Just Oh Hae-Young), but the others (Support characters) were the best.
The best caracters were Park Soo-Kyung, Lee Jin-Sang and Oh Kyung-Soo (Just Oh Hae-Young's father)
Park Soo-Kyung puts the comedy here, she was so badass and crazy.
I enjoyed the drama

‚óèThe story was nice with all the chaos caused due to the same name. But I wasn‚Äôt expecting the 180degree change of story centering the ML. Park do kyung deja Vu was making the story pretty interesting and I enjoyed it. When the story is fully untangled its really satisfying to see the bad people get punished.
I don‚Äôt like the soo kyung and jin sang story. The characters were interesting but they were like screen filler to whole story.
‚óèActing wise everyone one was very good. I enjoyed it. My favourite character was mother of oh hae young that is hwang deok yi.
Seo hyun jin was playing the role of heartbroken oh hae young very nicely but I didn‚Äôt like her hairstyle. If she tied her hair she would be more beautiful.
Eric Mun was handsome and good at the role but felt more cold in the entire series. When there was romance also he felt cold.
The dance sequence at the end was amazing I just loved it.

‚óèAnd am extreamly disappointed with this bully culture and judging people around based on looks. Calling someone pretty and ugly is so not right.
Based on colour,money,parents,looks, judging has been a plotline of so many dramas so i feel its necessary to be stopped.
‚óèOverall this show is a good watch. But definitely not a rewatch for me

This drama has a nice mix of the serious with the fun, a nice broad mix of characters and nobody really feels like a ""bit part"" - everyone brought their elements to the story.

The ML and FL were great but for me the secondary characters were just as good, whether it was Kim Mi Kyung's portrayal of the slightly insane mother of Hae-Young - she's definitely one of my favourite older female actresses and it was good to see her role given much more of a presence than I've seen her with in some other ""mother"" roles previously. Heo Young Ji as the girlfriend of one of the family's brothers was another real wildcard too, I didn't know what to expect from her character when she first appears but she turns out to be a really good character in the story and really fun to watch.

The other secondary character that was actually the main reason for picking this show was Ye Ji Won - having enjoyed her work in Thirty But Seventeen where she played a monotone, black and white, mary-poppins type character I was curious to see her in another role. In the first couple of scenes it looks like it's going to be a similar type of character but it doesn't take long to get a bigger picture and wow what a difference :) Wild and wacky and yet another great comedic element to the story.

All the comedic side characters are great as they provide an emotional break to some of the heavier elements of the story.

Main story was great, and has a nice under pinning message of living for today. Give everything your all, don't risk looking back later and wishing if only you'd done more, loved more etc. Don't let pettiness get in the way, don't let your pride stop you from doing what you wish you had.

My main issues were that some times it just got a bit confusing what was going on, in one instance one of the secondary couples has a major blowout and end their relationship and then a few scenes later all is back to normal without any scene to reconnect them - not the end of the world but just seemed odd as they made a big deal of ending it. Some times there are flashback scenes to the past where you learn more about Hae-young's history in school, but it wasn't always clear until a bit of a way into the scene that this is what was happening. There were numerous times where it just felt like something had been skipped along the way, or a scene missed.

The ML's business is adding the sound layer to movies, and this had the odd side effect of making me hyper-sensitive to the audio layer on the drama, suddenly every walking sound or any other sounds sounded layered on, I don't know whether they amped the sounds up to contribute to this or if it was just psychological on my part but it was amusing and actually added to the sounds somewhat. For those that don't know how this side of movie and tv production works it provides an interesting insight I think.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this one, a good mix with a decent main story and some interesting side characters with their own stories. OST - nothing outstanding but nothing bad either.

Would probably re-watch this at some point.

Lesson learned: never judge a drama from it's title.

I put off watching this drama because the plot didn't sound very promising and I especially hate the annoying third party arc in a lot of dramas but after reading reviews, I finally took the plunge and happy that I did.

The story line was interesting in that they have some supernatural elements that seemed plausible. There was a good moral to the story, the side/supporting characters were all interesting, the friendship deep, a filial son, very supportive parents (Oh Hae Young's) and a great love that went through a lot of challenges.

Pros: different types of love were shown - parent's love for their daughter, brother/sister relationship, noona romance, May-December romance, love and loyalty between friends and co-workers, et al. 
Cons: there was not much difference between the 2 Oh Hae Youngs, beauty-wise. I really wanted to give the main Oh Hae Young a good hairdo but she was equally pretty as the other Oh Hae Young.

I'll stop here as I do not want to spoil anything by giving too much info.

Bottom line: Watch it!

no words..... PLEASE WATCH HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
I can't even put into words on how beautiful this drama is....
I'm not the type to binge dramas. I don't really know why, but if I watch the same thing on my computer screen for a along time I GET BORED, so I usually watch 1-2 episode and go to any other website like youtube and watch something else.

But this drama... I BINGED THE WHOLE DRAMA IN 3 DAYS, which i know may not be a big thing for the expert kdrama binge-ers *idk if that's even a word* out there, but seriously though this drama got me hooked from the very first episode till the last. I couldn't stop myself craving just more of this drama.
This drama made me laugh until my lungs started to hurt, this drama made me cry my eyes out, the cute scenes between the main leads made me feel butterflies in my stomach, and the side characters i loved every single one of them except taejin, Dokyoung's mother and Chairmun Jung...
The ost Till the end of time by The Black skirts made me emotional every time it started playing.
Eric Mun's did such an amazing job portraying Dokyoung.
Seo Hyun Jin's acting is just out of this world, she's amazing.
I would've watched the whole thing in a day, but I couldn't because my exams were going on..
I'm sad now that I have finished watching the drama, I really want to watch more...

When I first found out about this drama tbh I wasn't really interested in watching it because of the following reasons
1. It came out in 2016 which was 5 years ago
2. The name and the poster of this drama isn't really appealing to me.
3. I wasn't really a fan of the main leads *BEFORE*

I started watching it because of Seo Hyun Jin, I recently watched her recent drama YOU ARE MY SPRING and I am telling you her acting is just WOW.. Then I watched her previous dramas Dr Romantic p1 and Beauty Inside and then this drama...
You can say that I'm in love with her I WANT MORE OF HER WHY IS SHE SO UNDERRATED WTH..
Anyways, Next on my list are her dramas Temperature of Love and Black dog ^^

Starts slow. Picks up in the middle. Ends amazingly
I really really wanted to drop this drama at around the sixth episode. Usually I drop them pretty fast if the start is slow. But somehow I persisted and I am glad that I did. Even though the start was slow, something kept me going. The start was slow but it had it's charms. The male lead's unique profession, the female lead's hopeless situation and the things that connected them, all of these kept me interested. After the drama passed the half-way mark it was smooth sailing. Things started to come together and created a good and enjoyable experience with satisfying ending.
The best part of the drama for me was the acting. Every single cast did an amazing job in this drama. It was very easy to get immersed into the scenes because of the great acting.
The OST was quite good and I enjoyed the creative way they used it in some places.
Considering everything the drama was a steady watch with a very stable pacing. Ultimately it was an enjoyable experience.

The story is an 8 for me because i wasn't expecting it to be so well thought out and actually complicated. I thought it would be just another mistaken identity romantic comedy so i put it on hold and i wish i had prioritised it.

It might well be just that for some but i have seen so many of these and i think what set this one apart was the emotions/acting from the leads. Everyone including the supporting actors delivered their emotions so well i found it hard not to empathise with all of them, needless to say i found myself so conflicted and frustrated with the emotions this drama was bringing out in me. Few dramas do this because i mostly roll my eyes these days at the things writers come up with so for me the fact that this actually stirred me up was a huge plus. I'm always pissed off at the writers of romantic comedies but i was impressed with this one.

I was also surprised at how much i enjoyed the romances not just between the leads but supporting couples. As mentioned, i feel like i've seen it all as far as dramas and nothing excites me but i enjoyed to the point of embarrassment the candid attraction between characters and the kisses actually had me questioning if i was still watching a kdrama. They are not usually that...real??

I don't tend to rewatch romantic comedies unless there's something i'm trying understand as far as the story/plot so that's the only reason i've given this a 5, it's not because i think poorly of it. The OST wasn't memorable either

First off I'd like to thank this drama for giving me another annoying and slightly embarrassing thing that I do when I get a little tipsy. Which is to sing ‚ÄúRoof top party‚Äù over and over while shaking my butt in an unattractive manner. Okay, so I do it while sober too. What can I say it reminds me of one of my favorite characters/couples of the show. (If you've watched it I bet you've done it a few times too. Don't deny it.)

Another Miss Oh definitely was a surprise drama of the year. When I first read the synopsis it sounded like a hot mess. When the updates came in from other friends who decided to watch this one, I picked My Beautiful Gong Shim instead, they claimed it was amazing surprise that surpassed most of the dramas this year. After caving (and being disappointed by my Beautiful Gong Shim in the later episodes) I soon found they were totally right! Another Miss Oh is a unique and wonderful find.

There's a lot going on here. Tons of ideas and concepts used and explored. Yet the writer masterfully introduces and utilizes them. The crazy idea of Park Do Kyeong being able to see glimpses into the future transforms into one of the most beautiful love stories I've been able to enjoy in a drama. The whole idea that he ruined Oh Hae Yeong #1's current life because of mistaken idintity was even handled well. Having the same name as someone else even turned into an amazing story of self love and being happy with who and what you have. There's so many amazing elements that I can't cover them all, and I don't want to spoil them.

The side characters and stories were also fabulous. Oh Hae Yeong #1's parents where epic! Instead of being this cold or cruel things, or just parent figures for the sake of parent figures they were real people. I loved seeing the echoes of Park Do Kyeong and Oh Hae Yeong in her parents relationship. The idea that Oh Hae Yeong did pick someone like her dad was epic. The scene where her parents take her to karaoke to help her heal was funny, moving, and one of the best drama scenes ever.

Park Do Kyeong and Oh Hae Yeong aren't the only quirky romance going on. There's two more that I absolutely loved and I won't spoil anything. Just be aware it's there and it's awesome.

Oh Hae Yeong #1 is a complex lead and while she seems like the standard clumsy girl you soon find yourself realating to her and completely becoming wrapped up in her. She's fearless and even after being beaten down by love she fearlessly goes all in again. Despite doubts, fears, and reasons not to she choses to go all in. Because she never wants to say that she had regrets.

So the must noisy girl about love finds herself falling in love with Park Do Kyeong. A man who isn't in touch with his emotions, has super amounts of pride, and is quite the quiet one. Who better to awaken his emotions and realizing how much of his life he'd regret then her? Hmmmmmm?

Their love is beautiful and in the end fearless. Even with others opinions frowning down upon them they remain brave.

That said I did have some issues with the drama. First is that no one even mentions that Oh Hae Yeong is pretty much a drunk. I was really bored with how the first half of the drama kept showing her drunk and that the other characters were aware that she gets that way even when she isn't being dumped/miserable. That was probably why I felt disconnected despite all the amazing character building. I'm not someone who likes to get drunk and I don't care to watch drunks. Especially as getting drunk resulted in her doing things that made her miserable. When she quits drinking because she finds happiness I'm pretty sure her amount of alcohol consumption would lead to alcohol withdrawals. (It needed to be said.) I do give points to the writer for emphasizing that you are the biggest factor in staying miserable and sad. No matter what happens you can always be reborn again and move on.

Secondly was the pacing. So we spend a lot of time with drunken Oh Hae Yeong, lots of dramatic crying, staring/longing/dramatic moments of contemplation. There was one scene where we just watched Oh Hae Yeong watch the train leave the station over and over again. These moments felt like a waste as they lost their impact due to boredom and it took away from developing the story! No really I think it would have been good to use that time to let the side characters/stories shine more!

About episode 11ish I felt a shift in the drama, like the writer suddenly decided to add some new elements. It soon became almost like a dedication to someone. A bigger idea and you really have to pay close attention to catch and realize that it was there the whole time.

The music and cinematography were amazing. Considering that Park Do Kyeong works in sound production for movies I believe that having an amazing OST was very key for this drama. Well it is one of my top OSTs for the year! The sound team on Another Miss Oh did such a wonderful job that everything made a bigger impact by what music was playing. Even if you thought it wouldn't have worked it did.

Rewatch? Well I know I really want to see this crazy cast again! The slow bits make me a little leery and I really disliked how stupid OH Hae Yeong was drunk. I think way down the line after many years I'd want to revisit this unique drama. For now I'll just watch my favorite parts only.

Despite all the fabulously crazy ways it gets to it the message of Another Miss Oh is of finding happiness, never living with regret, saying what you wanna say, and that every action will have a reaction. I firmly believe that this breaks down many stereotypes of dramas! From side characters, to how female leads should be, cold male leads aren't that simple, parents are people too, and so on! Another Miss Oh should not be missed.

Underrated Gem!
I first saw Seo Hyeon Jin in Dr. Romantic. Didn't exactly like or dislike her there. Just so-so for me. This changed when I watched the Beauty Inside. I loved her acting. It was so effortless!

When my sister recommended Another Miss Oh, I decided to try it. It is turning out to be another gem of a drama. Just the right amount of comedy, laughs, romance, tear jerking dialogues.

The storyline for me, was unique. Have never seen one similar to it. I could feel her heartbreaks, trials, having to go through difficult times just because she was mistaken for the girl with the same name.

The stories of the other characters were something I could do without though. I kept skipping through them.

Back to the leads. It was my first time to watch a drama with Eric Mun. I have never seen or heard of him before so it took some time to get used to him. I actually found him not a typical Kdrama lead. Maybe his looks? But he grew on me eventually.

One thing I have found in the dramas that I like, is that Korean actors and actresses are really GOOD! You can pair them with almost anyone and more often than not, the chemistry is there. Their love stories turn out to be so believable that you end up rooting for them to take it from reel to real.

Still have several episodes to go for this, and I can't wait to see what happens next....

This drama was horrible, the story progressed in fast and empty way. There were a number of loopholes in the character development and story. The acting was very juvenile, with the characters either being portrayed in a 2 dimensional and childish manner. Take for instance the main characters mother, was very surface like, her character was not built on, so the audience was unable to empathize with her. If you look at the drama ""Pretty Noona Who Buys Me Food"", the mother was built on her, her character was strong and powerfully expressed, making you understand why she was an antagonist, and allowing you to see good in her. This show was disgustingly filmed, written and acted. The characters, the settings and just everything in total was horrible.

If you are into mature, deep, and perfectly made dramas, please don't watch this nonsense.

#TeamTaejin
I‚Äôm not even finished watching this drama but I feel the need to review. To date, I have just begun ep 12 and am way too emotionally invested in the characters and storyline. Firstly, I absolutely love this drama. At this point, if I see ‚ÄúStudio Dragon‚Äù in the opening credits, I know I‚Äôm in for a great experience. I have not been disappointed with anything that‚Äôs come out of there yet. Secondly, I am Team Taejin all the way. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I like Do-Kyeong but not nearly as much as Taejin. What Do-kyeong did was already foul but once he found out the truth and didn‚Äôt tell ‚Äúordinary‚Äù Oh Hae Young, it became unforgivable. Taejin‚Äôs breakdown rage scene in his car was me by the end of ep 11. This drama has my blood pressure UP! I am so over Ordinary Hae Young‚Äôs absolute dehydration for attention and expectations of very specific responses from Do-keyong. She‚Äôs the kind of person who plays scenarios in her mind and if real life doesn‚Äôt go as she planned, she gets mad. I can‚Äôt with her. Thirdly, I am not feeling ‚ÄúPretty‚Äù Oh Hae Young or her fan club. Good Lord! Her fan club is so extra. Pretty OHY just needs to let it go! The entire ending of Pretty OHY and Do-kyeong‚Äôs relationship is completely messy and both of them are dead wrong with how they handled it. Dead wrong. Both of them. Equally. I said what I said. Lastly, like most dramas, I can predict how this one will end but I just wish it to be otherwise. Time to get back to the show. #TeamTaejin

**Post completion edit: **
The leads:
‚ÄòTwas a struggle making it to the end of this drama because by episode 14, I was completely over Ordinary Hae Young‚Äôs childish and whiny personality. Every 5 minutes, she‚Äôs crying over something stupid and her inferiority complex makes her insufferable. Instead of a 32 year old woman, she acts like a 14 year old girl who has her first boyfriend. It‚Äôs not cute. I also feel like the marriage business was rushed. Hae Young is way too mentally immature to marry anyone. It got to the point where, the more I hated Hae Young, the more I liked Do-kyeong. Every time I saw her, I scowled, and every time I saw him, I smiled. I hated Hae Young almost as much as the MIL in Something in the Rain.

The others:
I really liked Soo-kyeong and Jin-sang‚Äôs relationship until it became rushed after ‚Äúthe night‚Äù. It was way too inorganic for my liking. Overall, still a great drama but the last 7 episodes were rough for me.

Too overrated. One of the worst dramas I watched.. A drama where everything feels so wrong but you just have to finish it.
It's like watching a horror movie and covering your eyes with your hands and peeking from time to time.
IT IS A HORROR MOVIE! INCONSISTENT CHARACTERS. MAD AND CRAZY LEADS. I think Tae Jin is the only one who isn't. NOTHING FEELS RIGHT IN THIS DRAMA.

I think this drama is quite good. It has drama and comedy in the right amount.
At first I thought the story was going to be really sad, but that didn't happen at all!
The acting is very good! The leads have so much chemistry... I think Eric did a really good job, because he didn't have a lot of lines, most of his emotions he just have to express by his eyes, that was so intense! Also, all the supporting roles were very funny, specially his noona and his best friend, also Hae Yeong mother - I loved her, and that thing she did with the clothes were sooooo good :'D I am gonna miss this one, totally going to rewatch someday.
The soundtrack is good too, the musics match the moments, howerver, after watching this drama, I never saw movies and tv shows the same way because of the sound effects :D
I think it is very enjoyable, for me it was just lacking a better production. Sometimes the scenes just didn't change smoothly, also the cameras were shaking a few times... But I totally think the story can overcome these.
Give it a try!

Pathetic!
Possibly the worst drama I have watched. The acting was great but the characters were a mess and I could not engage with them. FL just the worst - drowning in self pity , literally in alcohol. Just a pathetic mess. I gave up watching as I just didn't care about her. She avoids any meaningful communication by drinking, sleeping, walking across busy roads! As usual chases the ML in the first part - how old is she?!! 32? Please more like 12!
The amount of drunkeness in this drama is just unbelievable - for adults to behave like this is just dismal. Totally unfunny and hardly giving young viewers role models.
All characters are simply dysfunctional and unlovable.
Dont waste your time watching this!

The most worthless and irrational story among all series in the world
I really could not finish the drama
A few friends finished it, but like me, they were amazed by its irrational story.
How is it possible to write such a story and make a drama out of it and get a high score !!
The whole story is based on the failure of the main role woman's wedding and her hatred of her ex-fianc√© for this.
In surprise, she immediately takes refuge and embraces someone, who is the cause of the wedding failure and the imprisonment of his ex-fianc√©.
Begging For Love and excessive humiliation of main role woman.

And worst of all, the common hatred between the two, the main role man and woman of the story, from the former fianc√©, even after the truth of the matter is known.

And even more ridiculous is that the main role man even mistakenly accused and imprisoned the former fianc√© and ruined his marriage.
The main role man has no regrets and considers himself right
And the former fianc√© was introduced as a monster, who deserves to die.
Because he told the main role woman that he hates her eating !!! :)))))
It is good that the author did not execute him, maybe she wanted to.

But the one who committed all the sins ......
The most worthless and irrational story among all Korean or American series and movies and so on
Again, where has reason and logic gone !!!

--------------------------------- The following section has been added ---------------------------------------------

The ML personally asked his stepfather not to invest in the second ML work exactly the day before the wedding‚úÖ

ML did this To take revenge on her fianc√©. But what is the guilt of the second ML?
ML inflicted torment on the second ML. The torment that he himself had endured‚úÖ

ML never apologized to the second ML.
Even more interesting hit him with the car.
ML just said sorry to the FL. Even the FL said, only this.
And ML said, what do you want me to do?‚úÖ

with Seeing the misery and unhappiness of FL and his family up close And the Imprisonment of the second ML in prison, ML did nothing to make up for his mistake, Even He stole the second ML wife. He could tell the truth, Or at least he could have indicated that the second ML was in financial trouble‚úÖ

If we say that his business partner was corrupt, this has nothing to do with the second ML, Or if we say that the stepfather was a problem for the second ML in any case. It is like saying, for example, a murderer kills someone. And Interpret it this way that, In any case, every man must die one day. And ignore the guilt of the killer.‚úÖ

The most important point is that the ML never did anything to make up for his mistake until the end of the Drama.‚úÖ

We should not accept everything the media tells us. When the devil shows as an angel and evil as a good. At least we should know. These high scores, which have reached 20,000 so far, are very worrying.
Korean women writers are really professional, but both in this series and in other series, they analyze issues very irrationally.
Maybe it's because their only focus is on showing romance between a man and a woman at any cost to attract the viewer.‚úÖ

It was ok, liked Ugly Ploy more
1. Very lacking in who they had in the lead actor and actress categories
2. Watch this before you watch Unlucky Ploy the new version, other wise this one will make you disappointed. They actors and actresses pop more in the 2nd version, just more chemistry.... Felt this was pushed to fast and wanted to bring in up and coming's. Where with Unlucky Ploy they spent more time on casting the right actors.
3. I love the older actors who are in the support roles, they add a strong force to the movies, do to the strength of their acting skills. They really make the shows work.
4. Learning new things in life is what makes the world go around, there is a huge cultural difference between what I am use to in everyday life and what is seen in the Asian Culture. LOOKS and MONEY, play a huge roll in almost all these shows.
5. Until 2018 American Shows where what I watched, now I look to see the who, what, why's and when? Oh lets not forget the HOW? The ones I have seen thus far are very innocent based to an extent, no nudity, no major violence (until last week) most of the time, it leave most things to the imagination.
6. Korean shows have a lot going for them, and have been drawing me in more and more.....
7. Work on the endings, most feel rushed in the last 2 episodes just to get things wrapped up. There is a need to leave them wanting more, or a vision there could be a spin off to more seasons.

Well, here we go again with issues of communication! And, dysfunction. More than any other kdrama that I‚Äôve watched thus far, there has been more drinking and hitting each other! That is slightly disturbing frankly. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm American but I found it really weird that a mom would be hitting her 31-32 year old daughter. Even when Park Do Kyung and Oh Hae Young have their first kiss, it‚Äôs after she starts hitting him with her purse and they tussle one another into a wall! And, that lawyer friend and PDK‚Äôs younger brother are constantly at one another too! Park Soo Kyung‚Äôs drinking scenes were so OOT I could barely stand to watch them. Hair in front of face, total inebriation, etc. Ugh! Onto to dysfunction and back to PDK‚Äîin flashbacks from his relationship with OHY Girlfriend #1, he‚Äôs happy and smiling. After she bails on the wedding, he goes into total emotional void. Then, once he‚Äôs with OHY 2, he‚Äôs able to smile again. That seemed a bit unlikely as a premise although for the sake of the series I suppose it made sense. After reading Episode Guides, I skipped Episodes 10-13 and was glad I did as all that could have been wrapped up in one episode. Even though I was annoyed by the excessive physicality/hitting/drinking, I still was invested in the relationships, particularly of the leads, as they had great chemistry. ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù OHY was actually not so ordinary because of her bubbly, free-spirited and gritty personality. Here‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me for a while‚Ä¶as in all other kdrama series, the female lead never wears the same clothes twice. But their closet space doesn‚Äôt seem to accommodate all the clothes they always wear‚Äîit‚Äôs a perennial mystery to me. And, original OHY was criticized twice for having ‚Äúpoor‚Äù clothes. What does that mean? She seemed to dress casually yes, but in Korean culture, does that mean someone‚Äôs poor? A bit baffling as in America some real slobs can be really rich so you never know.

It's such a great drama that I rewatched it again. Storyline is wonderful, cast shows their character's emotions really well, and the OST is also wonderful.
The camera work and angles capture the scenes really well, and honestly, it just makes the drama so much better.

While rewatching it, in Episode 11, there's a easter egg (background music wise in a scene-- not the drama's OST). In one of the scenes, i'm pretty sure I heard an OST from Marriage Not Dating (same directors for both these dramas) and the ironic part is that one of the cast members from Marriage Not Dating and Another Oh Hae Young was in the scene when the OST from Marriage Not Dating was playing. I thought I'd share my discovery.

I just want to share some thoughts I had while watching this drama.
Above all, I really enjoyed watching it, I was longing to watch a romantic comedy with angst at the same time and luckily I was able to find everything I was looking for in this drama. 18 episodes of 1 hour each was nothing for me! I watched so fast bcs it really caught my attention, all the episodes left me with a taste of wanting more.

So first, I want to talk about the main characters. Regular Oh Hae Young was, frankly, a very realistic character. I confess that at times she bothered me, but that was the most attractive thing about her. She is an independent character and could easily exist in real life. I was able to feel very empathetic about her, her insecurity and ‚Äútrauma‚Äù with the beautiful Oh Hae Young may seem silly but in fact I managed to understand her completely. Sometimes she was selfish, as in the scene where she wished all the other women in the world to disappear, because she was feeling frustrated by her non-reciprocal love, and when she felt comfort in ML's pain. Those two scenes made me think a lot, and it made me like her sincerely. These feelings are Real, we all have these ""intrusive"" thoughts and feelings, and it's completely normal.

Park Do Kyeong was the most relatable to me. He is not an cold man, but an introverted man who is traumatized. His difficulty in expressing his feelings, in saying and acting when necessary, his way of giving up on things out of fear or simply feeling without energy for this, was very real to me. I am just like that - not traumatized with love at all - but quite the same introvert. And that is why his actions made so much sense to me, I could really feel with him and empathize with the character. The plot of how it was necessary for him to see his regrets before he died was also very interesting and made me reflect a lot on.

The romance was very captivating, it was great to see the growth of their feelings for each other and how deep it turned out to be. I confess that at times it was quite stressful, despite the characters being so realistic the romance didn't seem much, but I don't know why. However, I liked it nonetheless.

Here come the disgrace:

I couldn't stand the supporting characters, especially Jin Sang. HE GOT ON MY NERVES. I hated him and everything about him: without charisma, childish and SO BORING. The romance between him and Soo Kyeong was totally forced, meaningless and UNNECESSARY, I hated every moment of it. It was one of the things that ruined the drama for me. I was hoping for better development for Soo Kyeong, who was clearly a character with lost potential. Jin Sang could have had a much better development as well, he didn't return her feelings at any time, that was so clear to me. I HATE IT HERE.

Pretty Oh Hae Young and Tae Jin were okay for me, they were essential for the development and growth of the main characters. I also loved Oh Hae Young's mother and everything she did for her daughter, she is an admirable woman.

Also the use of alcohol to some extent was okay but there is a line that should not be crossed. I understand that it was used as a comic relief, but it was so exaggerated.

Overall, I really enjoyed this drama, it was a nice experience. Some of the conflicts were so real that they made me reflect on my life as well. In spite of everything, I do not recommend this drama for those who are starting in the world of k-dramas. I have this feeling that this drama is not for everyone.

Horrible and jealous female lead
I didn‚Äôt like the female lead. She was excessively desperate, jealous of the pretty Hae young and way too emotional. I couldn‚Äôt finish the show bcuz the female lead annoyed me. She hated the pretty has young just out of jealousy. I decided to stop watching when the female lead told Eric to hate the pretty har young just bcuz she hates her. Like that‚Äôs so toxic. She told Eric boyfriends should hate anyone the gf hates.....The only person I liked was Isa Dora. She was so funny and cool. Made me laugh

The drama closest to my heart.
There are dramas that you either enjoy watching or you don‚Äôt. And then there are dramas like this that manage to reach the deepest parts of your heart.

I believe It‚Äôs Okay to Not be Okay is a drama that you‚Äôll fall in love with when the story hits close to home. There are many scenes throughout this drama that really made me cry and touched me in so many ways. And no, it wasn‚Äôt all the sad moments. The characters in this drama felt so real that I even cried out of happiness for them. Every time I watch this, I don‚Äôt see Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye Ji, and Oh Jung Se anymore. It is Moon Kang Tae, Ko Moon Young, and Moon Sang Tae, who I felt closer to than any character I‚Äôve seen before.

Honestly, this is the first time I ever felt this way about a drama. I‚Äôve watched ongoing dramas but I have never been this excited for every episode. My Saturdays and Sundays were never the same and without meaning to, I found really awesome people because of our shared suffering while waiting every week (you know who you guys are! <3). IOTNBO has made these past two months better and I can‚Äôt believe how time passed by so quickly.

I just loved everything about this drama: the cinematography, acting, soundtrack, and scriptwriting. This drama always gave us beautiful shots, awesome animation, and creative transitions. Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye Ji, and Oh Jung Se showed us stellar acting performances and broke my heart so many times. Even the supporting characters were really good at their roles. The OST was something that kept me going while waiting each week and I really appreciate how they had English songs. I also loved how the story had a balance between sad and happy moments. I usually get bored by a drama that‚Äôs too sad so I like how they insert comedic scenes in between. There are also so many relatable quotes and one of my favorites is a piece of advice from Doctor Oh.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre tired, get some rest. When you‚Äôre sad, go ahead and cry. It‚Äôs okay to take a break. Then one day, there will surely come a day when you‚Äôll be able to run again.‚Äù

Another thing I really loved about this drama is how it was able to incorporate fairytales and stories in every episode. Ko Moon Young‚Äôs stories in particular were all really good, especially the one in the ending. I admire the writer for writing these fairytales on top of writing a drama.

I know this drama is by no means perfect. It still left me with a few questions about Moon Young‚Äôs mom. But truth be told, I am here for the relationships and development of the characters. It‚Äôs a small part of what is overall a satisfying journey. I finally agree with Kim Soo Hyun when he said that this is a healing drama. After all the sadness and pain, in the end, I finally felt the happiness and healing.

This drama might be either something you love or you don‚Äôt. We all have different stories. But what I‚Äôm really sure of is that this drama will always have a special place in my heart. :‚Äô)

WHAT A JOURNEY IT HAS BEEN
First of all, i just like to say that this Series is not for everyone. I know everyone has different tastes especially in dramas. Aside from being a HUMAN HEALING DRAMA, this show is a character driven kind of drama. You have to immerse yourself in the drama to fully understand and go through the process of healing while watching the show.


STORY - I really love the story. It's unique and refreshing how the writer used many fairy tale and folk tales references and combined all those stories into one. It's so brilliant.

ACTING - Now let's talk about the performances for the Actors.

Immediately after watching episode 1, you will be amazed already of Oh Jung Seng's performance. It really is a role of a lifetime. He is so effective as Moon Sang Tae. I cry on most of his scenes with Gang Tae. He exceeded everyone's expectations and he will definitely get many awards from this show.

Seo Ye Ji's role is also very challenging. She is phenomenal as Moon Young. I cannot think of anyone who can do this role as perfect as her.

Supporting Roles from the younger casts, CEO, Juri, SEung Jae, Jaesu, Director, the OK staff and patients. Everyone had amazing perfomances.

Now for my bias, Kim Soo Hyun.... I have to be honest, as a fan of KSH, i really did not understand at first why he chose this project. Maybe i was used to A list actors to work with more known and award winning directors and writers. After his last drama The Producers in 2015 and military enlistment in 2017, i was really waiting for his comeback and has high expectations on the first project he'll work on. THANK GOD, he chose It's Okay to Not Be Okay. He really took time in reading many scripts and he really wants to challenge himself. His role is not as flashy or flamboyant as Moon Young and Sang Tae.... What makes his performance a stand out was the fact that his character wasn't a stand out. SYJ and OJS, being such amazing actors themselves could have easily stole the limelight from KSH. Moon Gang Tae's character was less explosive and more contemplative. His role is very deep and requires consistency. Many of his emotions must be conveyed using his eyes alone. and he did it perfectly. His crying scenes have different emotions and meanings especially his breakdown scene on episode 9. It felt like he poured his heart and soul on that scene and the audience felt it. The fact that KSH was able to get rave reviews for his performance both internationally and locally, and many people became a huge fan of Moon Gang Tae's character.... and lastly, that KSH was able to showcase such amazing and brilliant acting range for a role that's quite a challenge... that's really IMPRESSIVE and not all actors would be able to accomplish that.. I'm just happy that KSH is a risk taker and took this risk and not doing the usual OPPA dramas.


CINEMATOGRAPHY/MUSICAL SCORING/EDITING -
We have to commend the cinematographer of this show. WOW. just WOW! the camera shots are so perfect. i love how the cinematographer used different techniques. It was so effective. Same as the editing. I love the transitions from one scene to another. Not just the cool transitions but just the regular transitions where musical scoring is used to properly connect one scene from another.

OVERALL - this show will be one of my all time favorites. I have to admit that i expected more from the mother's plot. maybe because i watch too many crime dramas and i wanted more explanation how the mother survived or what really happened. I guess i overthought and had watched too many theory videos that i forgot what the show was all about. Thank you to the Finale episode""FINDING THE REAL FACE"". My take on the mother's plot is very simple. The mother survived and whatever stories we saw from the father's POV and MY's are not really accurate since the father had brain injury and even had major surgery for that, and MY was too young and grew with too much trauma to remember everything and just remembered the trauma she experienced during her childhood. Once the ""Finding the Real Face"" story was told, everything made sense to me that this drama is not about MY's mother. It's about the journey of Moon Young, Sang Tae and Gang Tae. From episode 1 to 16 we saw their character developments and how they were healed in the process of knowing each other. There might be an evil witch who took their real faces, but like in any fairy tale, there will always be a happy ending.


Reading this definitely gave me some closure on the mother mystery :

I have to say that this drama has one of the best finales and most satisfying endings I've ever watched. I don't know how many times i cried watching all episodes but one thing is for sure , i learned so much from this drama. I immersed myself in the show and this show really healed me to overcome some of the trauma and regrets i have in my life. The title itself is such a meaningful and powerful phrase that ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"". Here are some of the lessons i learned from this drama.

- Family is Beyond Blood Relations
- Fight for your Happiness
- Don't Make Rash Decisions
- Don't Judge a book by its cover
- Confront your Trauma
- Remember Good Memories
- Speak Up for Yourself
- Reach Out for Help
- It's Better to Kiss than Fight

""When you're tired get some rest. When your sad, go ahead and cry. It's okay to do that.""

Damn, there so many life learning quotes in this show. Watching this while on air is the best decision i made this year. Usually i will wait for a show to be completed before i binge watch but i made an exception for IOTNBO. I really invested too much in this drama. I'm happy to be one of the active posters in IOTNBO page and one of the users who broke records of having 16k+++ comments on the 16th episode. Most of all, i'm very grateful for this show because i met many friends who will be my forever MDL friends!

I felt like i was also riding in the camping van when the show ended. It really is a great and amazing journey. Thank you OKAY Family! Thank you IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY.

Okay, after all, It's Okay to Not Be Okay was an amazing journey. It's one of these dramas that deserve their hype and high ratings. The show stayed strong and mantained high quality from beginning to the end. I feel like nowadays, this is one thing that Korean dramas lack a lot.

While the drama looks like a cheesy romance at first glance, it is actually not. It's a story about healing, about learning to accept yourself, about learning how to accept others, about how it's okay not to be okay from time to time. I believe the drama had a great impact of the viewers who are struggling with life and needed to be comforted.

The plot itself could have been a lot better. The introduction was strong as well as the first half, then the second half was kind of inconsistent. But well, if it doesn't get overdramatic and way too cheesy, is it even a Korean drama?

The cast was very well-chosen and I must say, Kim Soo Hyun chose the perfect drama for his comeback. I was never a fan of his, but he won me here. He was simply perfect as the selfless Moon Gang Tae. His character went through so much and Soo Hyun portayed his emotions so well, I believed every word of his.

And there's our queen, Seo Ye Ji. Such a versatile actress, she can seriously pull off any role and she always looks stunning. Go Mun Yeong is not an easy character to pull off but she did it flawlessly. I can easily say that this is the best role of hers.

Oh Jung Se though... if this man doesn't win an award for this role--- Like, honestly, his performace was insanely good. A total show-stealer. He has all of my respect.

Overall, if you're looking for a good 2020 drama, then congrats, you just found it. An engaging story, a smartly written script, a couple with great chemistry, brilliant directing and an amazing cast -- what more do you need?

Healing, beauty and acceptance wrapped in spooky fairytales
Gosh, I spent 70% of this show with a lump in my throat, 10% with happy warmth in my chest and 20% bawling my eyes out.

It's a fast, intense, twisty emotional roller coaster that keeps you engaged throughout.

The best thing about this drama is the smart and impactful portrayal of mental illness. It's not preachy, it's not overly idealistic, it doesn't try to pretend to be extra woke, it's not trying to pass itself as an educational program- it's really just a touching story about three damaged, emotionally stunted people who are trying to get by.

I am not a medical professional and I am not gonna waste time trying to analyze all the symptoms and guess the disorders and argue about that because that's grossly missing the point.

The main focus of this drama was showing the pain, frustration and sorrow that comes with suffering from trauma, dealing with conditions out of your hands and the hurt that comes with mental illness for both who have it and their family members.
But most of all it highlights the strength of these people, about how they help each other and get help from each other to make things a bit better.

It beautifully expresses themes of understanding, resilience, love and friendship between people who've had a very tough life.

Ofcourse, in typical K drama fashion, it's not without its cheesy tropes, cliches and some flair for dramatics but despite all of that it gets the message across in a powerful manner.

The beauty of it is that despite being filled with heartbreaking and emotional moments that make you shed tears and snot, it never lets the dark side become overpowering by adding much needed comic relief and heart warming moments that make you giggle and feel good inside.

There is extra charm in people who are beautiful AND excellent actors. All the cast delivers phenomenally with the two main leads having electric chemistry with each other and sharing glorious, steamy kisses that will go down in k drama history. ;)

The show is easy to watch with a bit of suspense, thrill, murder mystery, psychotic parents and drama mixed with emotion, heart and healing. It's fast paced peppered with wholesome slow moments and amazing character growth.

Seo Ye Ji's impulsive, passionate, gorgeously dressed, blunt, morally questionable female lead with childlike tendencies is undoubtedly a crowd favorite.

On the other hand, Kim Soo Hyun's handsome, selfless, persevering male lead with bambi eyes and a mutinous heart brings his own to the table.

Finally, bringing them both together, the veteren Oh Jung Sae brought forth an endearing character suffering from autism who is extremely pure hearted and just trying his best.

The moments between these three are powerful and literally make you pray for these people and their happiness. The side characters are all relevant and enhance the flavor of the show

The OST is stunning, the direction is beautiful and the pretty story telling incorporating scary fairytales and creepy animations brings everything full circle.

It's definitely binge worthy and a full of feeling ride that you don't want to miss.

Enjoy!

This review may contain spoilers
A lacking story with a pretty package
**CONTAINS SPOILERS**

**The GOOD:**

1) Aesthetics: the FLs costume, cinematography and animations are really eye-catching. However, it must be said that the animation style and aesthetics style they went with is very derivative, clearly taking inspiration from the works of Tim Burton (and his team) as well as Tadahiro Uesugi and Neil Gaiman (Coraline). Anyways, bravo for the art direction department.

2) Representation of people in the autism spectrum: although seen in Western movies and series, it seems that in Kdrama-land the depiction of people in the spectrum is overall lacking. Oh Jung Se also does a great job in this role, picking up on the small details without coming off as a caricature.

3) Acting of leads and chemistry between the main couple: Oh Jung Se and Seo Ye Ji showed that they're great actors. Kim Soohyun was good too, but I wouldn't say he was particularly remarkable. However, he and YeJi did a good job building the chemistry between the main couple. Also, on a superficial level, they just look good together, period.


**The BAD:**

**lots of spoilers ahead**

1) ASPD being used as lure without proper development and approach: the drama original title (Psycho, but it's okay) is sensationalist enough -- and one might say even offensive to those who suffer with ASPD -- but it could be given leeway if they were to subvert the stigma carried by people diagnosed with ASPD. However, besides one single mention by a secondary character, the show never expands on the FL alleged diagnosis. Her toxic behaviour in the beginning of the series were even excused by some viewers on the ground that she has a personality disorder. Unfortunately, in the end, we learn that the FL was just a person that had traumas and developed (toxic/unhealthy) coping mechanisms. So basically the show used ASPD as an ""exotic"" character trait to get viewers interested on the show and then didn't raise any awareness about it. It was a mere plot device.

2) The trope of the toxic male lead but with genders reversed: we all know that many kdramas are guilty of having a jerk ML that constantly mistreats or looks down upon the ""doormat"" FL only for him to be redeemed and the couple finally get together. Usually, in order to redeem the ML we learn that he actually had a terrible childhood, even though he was rich, his parents were abusive or just absent etc etc. We all know that. What this drama does is the exactly the same thing, except that the toxic part of the couple is initially the FL.

A lot of people considered her rudeness, aggressiveness and manipulative behaviour as ""badass"" and others excused her because of her supposed ASPD. Well, even if she did have a personality disorder that absolutely doesn't excuse behaviours like sexually harassing the ML, using his disabled brother to lure him to her house, among other gratuitious mean behaviours she had initially.

The whole idea that one should endure boundary-pushing, threats, and manipulation until stockholm syndrome kicks in and they finally heal their stalker who loves and obsesses over them is just an outdated and tired troped that should be dropped by writers at this point.

On a side-ish note, I guess it has also become a trend in kdramas to have a FL with alleged ""sociopathic tendencies"" as seen recently on Itaewon Class for example. Seems like writers are overcompensating years of male toxicity by writing toxic females, which is not the point of feminism at all. And seeing people lowkey (or highkey) glorifying that behaviour is kinda disappointing too.

3) The trope of the destined connection: aka ""we actually knew each other as kids but can't remember that for some alien reason!"". Do I need to say anything more about it? I guess it's consensus by now that we're done with such trope. And it was barely needed in this drama too.

4) The trope of the forced cohabitation: again, not only this is tired but it was also connected with the FL toxic behaviour as explained above.

5) The gigantic plot hole: welp, the whole way they dealt with the FL mom was a mess and a half. It was textbook *deus ex machina* plot device. The implausible survival and comeback of the mother serves as a way to bring ""resolution"" and a happy ending to the characters.
One could disregard this argument and say this series is inspired by fairy tales and it was borderline within the magical realism genre. First of all, I think it's a strech to call it a magical realism work of fiction. But even if it was, every work of fiction regardless of genre should have generic verisimilitude (https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-verisimilitude#what-are-the-types-of-verisimilitude-in-fiction), even fairy tales. No matter how outlandish the premises of the work are, it should carry internal consistency. In the world/universe established in IONTBO the mother plot still doesn't make any sense, nowhere it's hinted that magical plastic surgery exists etc. It's just poor writing, let's admit that.

6) The trope of 'love heals all': people who loved this drama will say the characters improved on their own and weren't really codependent. But weren't they really?

The haircut moment -- usually used as an example of MY independently healing -- is more a symbolic and cathartic moment but it by no means is proper treatment or would accomplish major strides by itself. The show didn't give treatment of mental illness any layers of complexity. Not once she had to sit through therapy sessions, take medication, and her progress was pretty linear when in reality we have ups and downs. Another issue I take with her development is that she barely builds any relationships outside of the one with the brothers.

KT could also have gone through therapy to learn some healthy coping mechanism and how to assume his role as a caretaker in a less burdensome way.

What we saw on the show was that the leads healed as their relationship developed/romantically progressed, it was an intertwined process. The overall message conveyed is that they could ultimately heal because they were each other ""safety pins"" and that's neither healing on your own nor how it works irl.

So yeah, the show did not approach healing of trauma in a groundbreaking way, they went with the ""love heals wounds"" path.


**The ""what isn't really my cup of tea but isn't objectively a flaw"" aka personal side notes one shouldn't take as criticism**

1) The drama is really slow-paced, nothing much happens in its first half and barely on the second. But hey, some people prefer slow-burning stories and character study dramas. So there's that.

2) Having not read much about this show before watching, a friend told me this would focus on mental illness, so I build the expectation of it tackling this social issue in the way Sky Castle did with the Korean school system. But the show actually is just a romcom/melodrama that is set up in a mental institution. The main focus is the romance and not a commentary on the Korean mental health system.

This drama gives impact with their initial episodes, but fell flat and get confused afterwards.
This drama gives a great impact with their initial episodes (1-3), but unfortunately fell flat and get confused afterwards (imo).

FL and SML (brother) are really carry on this drama on their shoulder. Without them, i don‚Äôt really think want to finish this and it‚Äôs kinda sad because of the big name of KSH. I love him in LFTS as an alien but in this drama, his character almost feel like the same. His hairstyle, his attitude, his gesture, the way he talk and cried... i really want to sympathize with him as a character, but end up skip almost his crying scene for the entire episodes (T_T). The only drama that i really like him as a character is in ‚ÄúThe Producer.‚Äù

The story itself is kinda confusing. What do you really want to tell? About mental illness, healing process, love story, or thriller? The combination of lots of genre didn‚Äôt really work in this drama (imo, i don‚Äôt wanna upset anyone). There is so much information that really don‚Äôt take the story anywhere. And it really bothers me that the FL doesn‚Äôt get any treatment whilst her behavior is really disturbing and danger for anyone around her (push someone from the stairs-not cool, driving like a maniac when angry and threating someone to fullfill your request-not cool, always scream at people-not cool and many more). I also don‚Äôt get why FL falls in love with ML (apart from his physical that really annoys me and it serves as fan service a lot of time T_T). There is no consistency on the characters also (the brother can act like an adult with high function intelect shows, but sometime he respons something like childlike with no intelect at all). I am not expert on this at all, but saying as a viewer who want to enjoy a ‚Äúfantasy‚Äù drama that feels logic at least. And don‚Äôt get me started with the confusing timeline and lots of surprises that not necessary at all.

But, if you want to watch drama with full of beautiful people, fancy costumes, good CGI, don‚Äôt care about stuff that really matters in real life, and want to know about mental illness then this drama is for you :)

I will recommend anyone to watch ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ok It‚Äôs Love‚Äù instead if you want to see about mental illness and healing process through being loved by someone. They focused on the main theme of mental illness that the ML suffer (JIS really good in this drama) and other characters with some condition were just information for viewers, that people with condition still can be fully function in their life.

Most people are not ready for this kind of kdrama, but I guess it's time
It is a very unique drama that really needs to be appreciated. It was a big step to produce a full-length drama tackling about different mental health disorders. This drama is very psych-heavy but I guess people need to be aware of these disorders too. They need proper treatment and not judgement. The story is a bit cliche but they really added a unique touch to it. Since this Psych-themed drama shows how their thoughts run in their minds, I love how they portray these thoughts using animation and exaggeration (for differentiation from reality). People with mental health disorders might not be able to distinguish reality from their imaginations, thoughts, or fantasies, but the people around them could. We should show them that we understand them and we care for them (Just like how Gang Tae does it). It's good that they get treatment. I just wish Mun Yeong will also get treated. I know her character will still develop so let's wait for it. However, we must not romanticize her inappropriate actions. She has anti-social personality disorder which makes her unable to distinguish between right and wrong. This must not be tolerated and Gang Tae is doing a great job correcting her. This is still ongoing but it already made us feel different emotions. It's good that people are becoming more aware of different mental health issues and the triggers that can be associated with it. Thank you, It's Okay To Not Be Okay :)

Music, animations, acting 100% Seo Yeji's voice? 101%!!

PS. I just hope TVN or Netflix will add trigger warnings. The content can be disturbing to some. Trigger warnings would really help.

UPDATE: IT WILL END SOON AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO FEEL ?? THE EMOTIONS ARE SO REAL I WANNA HUG THEM :(((

UPDATE: OH JUNG SE FOR BEST ACTOR PLS!!! He really did touch our hearts. I really love his character and how he portrayed it :((( ILY Sang-tae oppa!

One of the best Kdramas out there, imo
Never in my life have I ever watched a drama as it was airing. Never. I always waited until it was completed because I'm one impatient fella~ But this drama got me so curious since before the first trailer came out. Kim Soo Hyun, one of my fav actors, was officially casted for a drama role since his military discharge and Seo Ye Ji had caught my attention since 'Lawless Lawyer'; her voice was golden. So when the first trailer came out, I remembered being so intrigued with the couple's visuals and chemistry, I never stopped waiting for the 1st episode to come out already.

The show's over but I still need more! I've literally turned into an addict! I'm not satisfied with 16 eps. I can't believe it's over... I walked into this drama only knowing bits and pieces, and now, I walk out of this with a heavy heart, missing it like crazy. This was such a well-paced and life-learning series.

The story, from the get-go was nothing I've ever seen before. I don't remember watching anything quite like this. The added effects, animations and the cinematography tripled my excitement, and the uniqueness of how each episode title relates to the story of that particular episode increased my anticipation for the next ep. Each episode also has a lesson to teach us, and every week, the episodes keeps getting better and better. There's not one episode I've watched with dry eyes.

Also, from the first trailer itself, they tell us something about butterflies. This was the ONE thing I was so DESPERATELY curious about. They explain it in the later episodes, but butterflies are the main imagery of this drama. So beautiful, yet they hold an underlying despair.

""Don't let the past trap you, or you'll end up like me.""
""The past can trap me? Then I can just open the door and get out.""
""No, you can't. You won't be able to see the door.""

I feel like every one of the characters in this drama has their own ""mental illness"", you know? Either subtly or quite obviously, and I'm excited to see whether they try to overcome it or learn to live with it. Most especially Goo Moon Young. Also, remember that ""your eyes can tell stories your mouth never could."" This was Moon Gang Tae His eyes ... they tell a thousand stories.

Another reason this drama intrigued me was the chemistry between Soo Hyun and Ye Ji. I've honestly never seen chemistry more explosive, more beautiful, more visually-appealing, more REAL than these two. And that's saying something. Also, Moon Sang Tae, he's a character I've began to love over the course of the drama. His character development, his kindness, his innocence and just about everything about him was so pure and beautiful. The trio have an amazing relationship with each other and no matter what, they're family.

Now for the music, oh, the music, man. I've got no words for the music in this drama. EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is a masterpiece! Every. Single. One. The aesthetic and the feelings that well up inside of you when you watch the scenes as the OSTs play in the background are unbelievable. Sometimes you can't help yourself from smiling, but most of the time you end up with a few or more tears. Fyi, I've added them all to my playlist ^_^

All in all, this show was a crying FESTIVAL and Moon Sang Tae was MVP! And that DARN DEER omg!
Tbh all the characters were so lovable (except that evil villain ofc)~ And all the side characters were worthy of being main characters. They were the stars of their own story and I just really liked them all~

I'm telling you this with utmost sincerity. You won't regret watching this drama. At the very least, just give it a try. The aesthetic, chemistry, acting, music, Kim Soo Hyun's eyes, Seo Ye Ji's voice, and Oh Jung Se's character. They are all best-sellers for this drama <3

I'm sorry if this review was all over place. It's my first time loving a drama this much and writing a review this long omg

A lot loved it, me, not so much
After all the hype, I thought I'd give this one a try. I'll be honest, I have difficulty watching shows about mental illness, but I especially have a hard time watching shows in which mental illness is not addressed. I felt that either the writers really dropped the ball on this, or just grabbed onto something that would further the storyline.

The cinematography was beautiful. I loved the different camera angles, looking up, looking down, etc. Costuming was lovely, especially for Seo Ye Ji (think IU in Hotel Del Luna).

Oh Jung Tae as Moon Sang Tae - his portrayal of autism was wonderful, even down to the smallest movements of his fingers. I don't follow Korean award shows, but he deserves an award for his performance.

Kim Soo Hyun as Moon Gang Tae - his performance was very understated and powerful. There were times that I could almost feel his exhaustion with his life. His love for his brother was lovely to watch. As an actor Kim Soo Hyun tends to always play parts where he doesn't have much facial expression, and this time it really worked for him. He was able to convey so much with just his eyes, and when he cries? My breaking heart!

Here's where my problem with the show came in: Seo Ye Ji as Ko Moon Young. They allude to antisocial personality disorder, but I didn't find anything redeeming about her character, and she wasn't able to bring anything to the table to make her likeable. She was displaying classic sociopathic tendencies (""I want that"") that were very scary. I get that we are all broken in some way, but I didn't buy that he could love someone that messed up, especially with the all-consuming job of being responsible for his brother. When she got the haircut, I think that's when we were supposed to see a change in her, but by that point I wasn't able to get back from my dislike. What about counseling? What about medication?

The twist with the mom was interesting, but very implausible.

I did like the ending, and I liked how the autistic brother was able to bring so much to the table to build a family with the other two.

pure, healing and beautiful
the plot is nothing special, the story is really basic but somehow this is one of the most beautiful dramas I've ever watched, and not just in 2020.
there are 2 things I love that as long as they don't mess it up then I'll give the drama a 10/10 without a second thought. one is a strong independent smart capable diverse female character, honestly they can never go wrong when they have a female character that carries her own weight if not more.
And two is character driven slice of life healing dramas, I LOVE these types of stories, they are just raw and emotional and sad but beautiful enough to make you feel jealous

at a certain point in the drama they handled the mains ""complicated"" bickering relationship, they focused on Moon Sang Tae's natural jealous feelings because he was no longer his brothers ""one and only"" and it could've gone really badly if the writers used it for cheap angst but they handled it so beautifully that the developing relationships became 1000x better.

""mystery"" wise I do think they lacked a little, but it's becasue they didn't use it for cheap thrill and looming danger but it was the base for their healing.
even throughout their ""inevitable breakups"" it was never about their selflessness or selfishness but it was another natural step to overcoming their past and struggles.
I was worried after ep14 that things might get off track but they stayed true to their story and I'm really pleased about where it's going

side character wise, again they lacked in delivery, the side stories and the effects they used to deliver the stories were beautiful and heartbreaking but I felt like they weren't 100% invested in their stories and they felt like mere time fillers, like Yoo Seung Jae never got any character depth and even though Jo Jae Soo was Moon Gang Tae's best friend for 10 years I couldn't understand how they all miraculously ended up in ok town (I'm sorry I don't know the name of their location xD)
that didn't make their unexpected friendships and familial bonds any less meaningful, but I wish they gave them a little more thought

the editing is beautiful, moonyoung's fairy tales and the use of fairy tale resembles, the ost and moonyoung's OOTD's just made this drama more enchanting and amazing~

I never rewatch stuff but it's only ep15 and I already miss them so much that I'm crying so I'd like to rewatch this again and again and again ;D

watching the ending I'm even happier now, this drama didn't use the past connections and the trauma as the main dish, it was always just the spice.
like in itaewon class the revenge and past trauma was the last big fight and the end was just a cleanup but this, it was always about the ""cleanup"" and I'm really satisfied with everything

Surprisingly ADDICTIVE!
I wouldn't say everyone will like this kind of drama, but I LOVE IT.

It's not the usual korean drama that comes with a cheerful starting, couple fall in love and followed with the story climax. Some people might not like the ""psycho"" theme drama because of the dark and depressing content, but I find it pretty addictive of its UNUSUAL setting of characters, story presentation and the chemistry between the main leads! As the female lead is a fairytale story writer, the show uses a ""fairytale story telling"" method to bring out some principles of life that touches the bottom of your heart, which I find it very special!

You will FALL IN LOVE with the two main leads, because they are not the usual main leads you will find in other dramas. The girl is cold on the outside but warm in the inside whilst the male lead is other way round. They both had some bad memories that shaped their behaviours; they hurt each other, but they protect each other as well :) So I would say their interaction and chemistry are the highlight of the show!!!! Not to mention, the three main leads (including the brother) acting is SUPERB! The brotherhood among the two male leads is very touching too and it will make you cry T^T

For those who are a scaredy-cat, be aware that there are some horror scenes too. Well, it doesn't really have physical ghost in the show (in case you are wondering), but because the main female lead had some dark memories, so she will have bad dreams and having sleep paralysis.

Although there were some parts not being well explained, I think you shouldn't be too serious about it and enjoy the scenes and stories this drama has brought to us. It brings joy, intense, sadness and also heart-warming relationships that makes you smile :) I love all the main and side roles and also their sweet and nice characters, the entire casting was pretty pleasing and I enjoyed watching it a lot!

Great for those unfamiliar with broader mental health issues; otherwise nothing truly new.
I finished this drama thanks to Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se. If this review possibly happens to make you question watching IONTBO, I would tell you to watch it for these two incredible actors. I've been a fan of Seo Ye Ji since her Moorim School days and her talent has only become more stunning as time has passed. Oh Jung Se is a legend in my books, period. I'd also say that, if you like artistry in storytelling, IONTBO is an interesting watch. There is beautiful incorporation of various art styles weaved throughout the show, and this is one aspect that I truly enjoyed about the show. The writing is alright; certainly better than your average drama, though it still succumbs to obvious fan service (which, to be honest, I can't completely fault the writer for because Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun are her leads‚Äîshe took expert advantage of that, haha).

So, onto the not-so-great elements. As an individual with deeply personal experiences with mental health, as well as experiences with the mental health of loved ones, IONTBO ultimately is a slap in the face. It's not entirely the show's fault, truly. KdramaLand and, in general, Korean entertainment as well as entertainment internationally, are all guilty of requiring a beautifying lens on most interpretations and storytelling of the world.

Don't get me wrong, I also enjoy watching beautiful people playing roles in heart-wrenching storylines. But there is just something irreconcileable to me about the concept of beauty and mental health. I do not (at all) mean that beautiful people cannot have mental health issues or that mental health is a completely ugly thing. However, when we talk about de-stigmatizing mental and having diverse voices or representative storytelling‚ÄîI could not help but think: how many people would be raving about IONTBO and its championing of mental health issues if the leads were not Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun? If this was a representation (note: I don't mean copy or true story) of real life, how many people would truly care if this story was told? What would domestic and international reception look like if Kwon Yoon Hwa was cast, rather than Seo Ye Ji?

And so, as the show progressed a certain cliche refused to stop ringing in my head: ""Nobody cares unless you're beautiful or dead"". While I personally can't say that I believe this to be completely true‚Äîsadly, when it comes to most mainstream media, wherever you might be in the world, this saying often holds heavy truth.

As I did not expect Crazy Rich Asians to be the representation of all Asian stories and voices, I do not expect IONTBO to represent all voices, stories, and perspectives for mental health. That being said, if you've been around KdramaLand for a while now, you'll know that this is not the first ""groundbreaking"" attempt at telling stories about individuals and mental health.

Ultimately, IONTBO will be enjoyed by most, I reckon. So, all I can say is that IONTBO was nothing new for me in KdramaLand, and is certainly not groundbreaking in its explorations of mental health. Instead, it's a painful reminder of the endless habit of beautification in film and TV industries around the world.

Loved parts, but couldn't get past others.
First let me say that I love that this drama shined a light on so many types of mental health issues. The autistic brother was my favorite character and I loved his story line. In fact, I really enjoyed all the story lines in the show. The acting was top notch and the entire drama was visually striking.

My main issue was the Female lead character. Let me try to explain...
If you knew of a person who had stolen the money from a bunch of elderly people leaving them destitute with their lives in shambles and that same person later decided to spend not to do that anymore...at least not as much, and even built a Senior center, but never made amends to the elderly they had hurt and in fact didn't even think they had done anything wrong to those elderly, you would find it hard to see that person in a positive light.

That is how the the Female lead character felt to me. In the first part of the drama we see her cruelty to animals, her self centered attitude and lack of empathy. She does two attempted murders and two kidnappings in the first few episodes. Plus the emotional blackmail that she often uses is just horrible. Her temper flairs and she gets violent any time she is contradicted. And this part of her personality never changes. Though we see her soften toward the ML, his brother, and a few others, she easily and quickly reverts to her previous ways as soon as she is challenged. Even when she had the opportunity to make amends for destroying her publisher, she makes him choose whether he will repair his business or not when it wasn't necessary for him to do so. Effectively making him choose to stay destroyed and have to rebuild everything when SHE is the one who caused the destruction. I found her character exceedingly uncomfortable to watch and was always wary that the male lead would get hurt or that she would just turn on him at any given moment.

There is a scene where she talks to her mother and says something to the effect of how she ""almost"" became like her Mom. I was literally thinking...no...you are exactly like your Mom except you have yet to succeed in killing anyone (not for lack of trying) and though you are unempathetic at times, you are not necessarily evil in your intentions.

I like the two brothers and her together, but at the same time I found it uncomfortable to cheer for because of her character. It felt wrong to want the brothers to get entangled with such a person.

Without her character, the story would not have been the same, but because of that character, I had to rate the drama lower. She was just too uncomfortable to cheer for. If the character has shown remorse (beyond saying sorry for stabbing the ML...twice), or really even seemed to change, I would have felt differently but not as it was.

Extremely Strong 1st Half Which Slightly Fizzles Out in its 2nd Half...
This was my first K-drama that I watch while it was currently airing. To be honest, I've never heard of this K-drama before. I was just randomly browsing through Netflix, saw the notification bubble, clicked it out of curiosity and the title ""It's Okay To Not Be Okay"" piqued my interest. So, I clicked on it, read the synopsis and watched the trailer. It seemed interesting so I gave it a try and BOY, am I glad that I did! The production was stunning! The animated opening was beautiful! The cinematography was interesting and caught my eye for being adventurous. By the middle of the first episode, I was hooked! With her stories, Go Moon Young is like a female Tim Burton, who I was completely in awe of back in the day when I was in high school. She also reminded me of Jo Yi Seo from Itaewon Class with her antisocial behaviour though I do prefer Go Moon Young more. Moon Kang Tae is extremely attractive and the most attractive male lead of a K-drama that I've seen thus far no doubt. The chemistry between Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji is electric! The acting is all-around top notch! The story is intriguing and engaging! I loved how this is a drama with a mystery in its background about the unsolved deaths of the two leads' parents and the reason for the mental illness in each family. Without a doubt, the best drama that I am currently watching at the moment! Hopefully, the drama is able to maintain its momentum throughout the rest of its episodes!

Upon watching Episodes 3, I continue to be impressed! Everything is just so good! The story. The acting. The production. The visuals. The costumes. Ugh. The back-and-forth banter between the two leads is just perfect! And I love how they can help each other to grow to become more fully themselves. And that last scene at the end where Kwon Gi Do is on stage having his voice heard whilst avoiding his father's campaign workers while Gang-Tae looks on longingly at his freedom and utter joy. STUNNING! To stop being so repressed and to just let go. To be free and have fun. I can only wish...

On a side note, I'm having a hard time trying to put my feelings of this drama into words. Everything is just so good! It's easier for me to criticize than to praise as I can point out plot points or story elements that don't make sense. However, if everything is consistently good from episode to episode, I don't really need to point out anything.

Upon watching Episodes 5 and 6, I felt that Gang-Tae's transition from being nervous and suppressed around Moon Young to being happy and loving seems a bit rushed. Same with Moon Young being cold and calculating to being warm and affectionate to Gang-Tae.

Watching Episodes 7 and 8, I kinda felt like this series is losing steam as it was pedal to the metal in the beginning but was unable to keep that momentum, which is understandably hard to do. The episodes are still entertaining, but I wouldn't say that they're compelling unlike the first few episodes.

Upon watching Episodes 9 and 10, I realized that the horror-fantasy elements that were present in the first few episodes kinda disappeared for some reason and the series became just a standard drama, though still a good one at that.

Episodes 11 and 12 were quite riveting as the mystery surrounding Gang-Tae and Sang-Tae's murder gets revealed and the romance between GT and MY is shown to be ill-fated. I hope that GT is realizes that it is not MY's fault that her mother killed his mother. We can't blame the actions of one's parents on them. And it looks from the preview of the next episodes that he doesn't blame MY. I truly hope that MY's mother will be caught and that MY and GT will have a happy ending... I'm so sad that there is only 2 weeks (4 episodes) left. I'm going to miss waking up late on the weekend and watching this drama right after I eat lunch :'(

Episode 13 was very slow and a bit dull to be honest. Only the last scene was interesting as it was shown that the nurse was the mother, not the patient. What an unexpected twist! I've always thought that the nurse was kinda weird and a bit off. But if I remember correctly, the nurse never interacted with MY. For someone who is willing to kill another to keep her daughter, the fact that she is able to distance herself from her daughter whenever MY visits the hospital doesn't make much sense. Either way, I'm hyped for the next few episodes! We're in the home stretch now...
Episode 14 was also quite slow and dull to be honest. I felt that there was a lot of filler as they drag out the confrontation with the mother. Also, there were a few questionable plot points, such as why GT decided to leave ST unprotected at the house instead of stay with him and MY at the cursed castle where he could protect them both. Also, why wasn't there any police at the cursed castle or any protecting MY, GT or ST? There weren't any police even looking for the mother, which didn't make any sense. And why didn't GT call the police after the mother kidnapped ST? Anyways, there's only two more episodes to go. I'm still interested in seeing how this series ends.

Episode 15 was underwhelming with quite a few plot points that don't make sense. The mother is angry that MY doesn't listen to her because of GT but MY thinks that her mother is dead. So, how can she listen to her mother when her mother is literally hiding underneath a different face? That doesn't make any sense. The mother's reason for killing GT's mother makes no sense either. All GT's mother did was suggest that MY go get help. She didn't try to take her daughter away or try to report to the authorities. There must have been teachers or other adults who saw MY's antisocial behaviour and talked to her mother about getting her help. If MY's mother is triggered that easily, she must have killed several people before which she hasn't. So, it doesn't make any sense. And anyways, I'm pretty sure that MY would be completely fine with GT killing her mother since her mother did kill his mother and she actually wanted to kill her anyways. But no, save the mother so that the mother could kill MY or GT. And anyways, how did MY get there so quickly without a car? The climax where GT and MY truffle with MY's mother was also quite underwhelming. Hopefully, the season finale will be better.

Episode 16, the season finale, was good. It wrapped up all the plot lines in a nice way and showed ST seeking independence from GT, allowing him to live for himself.

All in all, this Kdrama was entertaining. The cinematography and production design were excellent. The characters were well-developed. The acting was all-around good, especially Oh Jung Se who portrayed the autistic ST perfectly! His performance was Oscar-worthy! The story however was lacking. The first half of the series was strong! It was unique, interesting and fascinating. There was a fantasy/horror edge to it. However, the series delved into a standard melodrama in its second half and all that potential was wasted. The drama was good, but nowhere near what it could've been if it leaned into its macabre, fantastical element which would have differentiated it from the other Kdramas out there. Crash Landing on You, the first Kdrama that I watched, still remains as my favorite K-drama so far...

OVERRATED
I was really looking forward to watching this drama especially when I heard Kim Soo Hyun was playing the male lead, however unfortunately I was extremely disappointed.
I suspect it also has to do with my high expectations of this drama but honestly not only was the storyline average but also the soundtrack and character development wasn't intriguing.
I feel like it got so much attention because of the good looks of the main characters but I felt that their chemistry wasn't amazing and their relationship was overly complicated.
I didn't feel moved at all watching this and the ending wasn't satisfying. It has an interesting concept however lacked thematic value.
Overall it was an alright drama and there were some heartwarming moments however definitely did not deserve the praise that it had received.

A Bittersweet Fairytale...

It is undeniable that even amongst the drama-watcher community, there tends to be a notable problem of more well-known dramas being ‚Äú overrated‚Äù or ‚Äú glossed over‚Äù from noticeable flaws by biased fans of certain actors, actresses or directors, and ‚Äú It‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äù is certainly no exception .

Written by lesser-known screenwriter Jo Yong ( After The Rain, Jugglers), ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô plays itself upon being an ‚Äú atypical‚Äù romance between a stoic, yet kind-hearted psychiatric health worker called Moon Gang Tae ( Kim Soo Hyun ) and the eccentric children‚Äôs writer Ko Moon Young ( Seo Ye Ji) as they both try to find new ways to heal and recover from their past traumatic wounds along the way ...

Before talking about the interesting joys and delights of characterisation in the show, it is first prominent to commend most of the cast for their performances. Oh Jung Se was undeniably brilliant within his role as Gang Tae‚Äôs older autistic brother Moon Sang Tae; a performance which was angst-ridden and heartwarming for viewers over the course of series . Parallel to Jung Se, of course, was undeniably Seo Ye-Ji‚Äôs performance as the witty, sardonic yet complicated children‚Äôs writer Ko Moon Young; purposefully comical and flamboyant, yet intricately heartbreaking as well.

Truthfully, however, the show‚Äôs acting quality could sometimes be a mixed bag, not least from Kim Soo Hyun as our main lead. Although Soo-Hyun is undeniably a brilliant and talented actor, his role as Gang Tae was a little lacklustre and ‚Äú wooden‚Äù at times to say the least. This is not to say that his performance was unwatchable nor was it ‚Äú dire‚Äù , however, considering his reputation as a top-notch actor, it was a little surprising that Soo-Hyun didn‚Äôt truly add anything to his character . On the other hand , perhaps some of this can also be attributed with screenwriter Jo Yong‚Äôs deliverance of characterisation and several plot inconsistencies as well.

As a concept, ‚Äò It‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô did not truly step upon new ground with its setup of the recently popular ‚Äú reversed gender trope ‚Äù in Korean dramas (where the female lead ‚Äú calls the shots‚Äù, and the male lead is nothing more than the ‚Äú object of obsession‚Äù in her eyes at first). Nevertheless, one of the undeniable great strengths of ‚Äò It‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô was its ability to write several fairly ‚Äú fleshed-out‚Äù main characters who gradually grow over the course of the series .

Ko Moon-Young wasn‚Äôt supposed to be your typical ‚Äú Princess‚Äù heroine ( even labelling herself to be the ‚Äú Pretty Witch‚Äù of the story) ; she is successful and a talented writer, but intrinsically insecure and traumatised by her complicated past and her estranged relationship with her seemingly mentally-ill father as well. It remains apparent after finishing the show that Moon-Young often allowed her dark and twisted fairytales to adorn her view of the world; fairytales were once used commonly as morality tales to scare children and adults away from danger, a bittersweet belief (, which despite Moon-Young‚Äôs often reckless behaviour, )she applied full-heartedly to her own reality and comes to several harsh wake-ups calls by stepping away from these beliefs over the course of the series.

It is therefore apparent that just whilst Moon-Young is your ‚Äú atypical, yet typical‚Äù heroine, Moon Gang Tae is your ‚Äú usual, yet unusual ‚Äù knight in shining armour.

Gang-Tae is hard to really describe or feel true emotional attachment towards as a character ( perhaps explaining why Soo Hyun‚Äôs performance felt a little lacklustre at times) , due to his often stoic expressions and unreadable personality ( especially in comparison to Moon-Young) over the course of the series.

Nevertheless, it‚Äôs wrong to entirely dismiss Gang-Tae as a ‚Äú terribly-written character‚Äù , as his ‚Äú apathy‚Äù is often broken in the face of his trauma and clearer feelings( particularly towards his brother and later Moon-Young) in the second-half, however, the biggest problem about Gang-Tae‚Äôs characterisation was often a consequence of his sudden transition feeling a little purposeless.Although the show attempted to explain this characterisation by having to look after Sang-Tae as the ‚Äú carer‚Äù in their fraternal relationship, as well as evidently irked by Moon-Young in the beginning of the show, considering the extent of some of his traumas, Gang Tae‚Äôs reactions and coming to grips with them often felt lacklustre and perhaps resulted in Gang Tae merging into a ‚Äú stock male lead‚Äù over the course of the drama.

Naturally this draws us up onto the aspect of relationships in ‚Äò Its Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô. Perhaps the most praiseworthy thing to note about the programme is that although it is a ‚Äú romance‚Äù drama, it points out many different types of relationships ; from paternal ( such as the case of Kim Mi Sung‚Äôs character Kang Soon Deok and her adoration for her daughter Nam Joo Ri played by Park Gyu Young) ,to the fraternal bond between Gang Tae and Sang Tae and to the obvious romantic bond between Gang Tae and Moon Young over the course of the series.

In the case of the latter relationship , the show had an odd balance between genuine and striking similarities between the polar opposites acting as their magnetic force to stick together, as well as later riding upon several cliches which intrinsically took certain earlier driving factors from their fairly well-written and blossoming relationship. The ending was undeniably sweet, though perhaps a little anticlimactic for some watchers (considering the darker themes tackled).

The obvious and evident pairing overshadowed in the show by Gang Tae and Moon Young‚Äôs romance , occurred between Nam Joo Ri(Gang-Tae‚Äôs ‚Äú lovelorn‚Äù best friend) and Moon Young‚Äôs colleague and CEO of the publishing company Lee Sang In ( Kim Joo Heon). By default their pairing should have perhaps been the most grounded portrayal of the most ‚Äú normalised‚Äù romantic relationship in the show , however, by investing so much time into Gang-Tae and Moon Young‚Äôs, Sang In and Joo Ri‚Äôs pairing felt lacklustre , incredibly forced and a cliche setup between the ‚Äú extras‚Äù, rather than fleshed-out and realistically built-upon over time.

So, is ‚Äò It‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô actually worth watching? Although there were a couple of questionable acting moments, cliches and plot inconsistencies, ‚Äò It‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô was still a good drama, and certainly shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed as ‚Äú mediocre‚Äù ; the plot was intriguing, the cinematography was creative and beautifully shot, the OST was eclectic and themes of mental-health as well as psychology were fairly well-tackled and portrayed. ( Perhaps one of the most gripping scenes in the whole series came from a veteran soldier experiencing a bout of PTSD and the horrific scenes through the cinematography he was seeing on a normal bus ride.) ‚Äò It‚Äôs Okay, Not To Be Okay‚Äô is undeniably not a flawless show, however, it is certainly still worth a watch ( not least for Moon Young‚Äôs more and more extravagant attires by each passing episode).

Isn't this drama too overrated?
A tip to watch this drama: Please remember in every episode that this drama is not a mystery-based drama. It's mainly romance, so don't expect much about the mystery aspect in it. Warning: starting from ep 12, the plot somewhat will go off. It can betray you. But, episode 16 absolutely is your healer.

And here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
- Ko Mun-young's character is so badass, Seo Yeji's acting is powerful! JANG MAN WOL's COMPETITOR!
- Sang Tae's acting is 10/10!!!
- Comedy, yes.
- Legendary filmography
- Beautiful story concept (Using children's book as the main value in a drama? OH YES!!!)
- Episode 16 is super family-friendly. I was teary when watching this episode.
- Support roles make this drama 100000% better!
- Production. Castle in the forest, why not? DEL LUNA's COMPETITOR IS HERE!

Cons:
- The mystery aspect is pretty bad. Imagine, you as a viewer are supposed to think and solve the mystery (about Ko Mun-young's mother and her family story) along with main characters within +- 10 episodes. But, in the end, the antagonist herself appeared out of nowhere, without her true identity being exposed by the main characters. I FELT BETRAYED! Why I had to think hard who and where is Mun-young's mother while she would appear voluntarily?
- Sometimes, romance scenes are too long. This leads to a loose plot. This drama could have a solid plot with a rich aspect if they cut off some unnecessary romance scenes.
- Wasting some characters just to help raising viewer's curiousness about Mun-young's mother. Where did Ok Ran go? Who's the guy that trapped/being held in that place?
- Horror scenes failed! It's scary but it actually makes the plot go off a lot.
- Inconsistency in picking genres. This drama would have been better if they didn't put the mystery aspect that much. Romance-Family-Comedy is more than enough to create touching scenes.

Overrated and Such a drag!!
I am amazed by the reviews that ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay not to be okay‚Äùhas received here!! I am uncertain that those who find this show addictive watched any other K-dramas before ? Bcz honestly it was just an average K-drama. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since I started watching the show, but I got soo bored in between that I kept it on hold And watched it On and off. And if I recall to myself what happened in previous episodes ,nothing eventful and exciting came to mind. Yes it somehow put a light on mental health, trauma and autism but that was the only good part about the show.

There was too much coincidence I would say ,more than needed ,that it made their love story odd. Firstly they knew each other as kids and Besides that It was a typical plot that Ms Ko‚Äôs mother turn out to be the murderer of Gang Tae‚Äôs mother. I have seen that before in various films and dramas that I can‚Äôt even recall now.Also Gang tae‚Äôs reaction to his mother‚Äôs murderer Being Ms Ko mother was also not how I should have been considering how badly it affected his whole life soo much and I mean who would be so okay with their only parent getting murdered and then finding out who did that. His REACTION MADE EVERYTHING SOO UNIMPORTANT. Remember that this was the plot from the beginning,BUTTERFLIES!!! and when he finally get to know ,it didn‚Äôt mattered?? How !!! ALSO the reason his mom was murdered for was soo lame .i couldn‚Äôt understand that I should laugh or be angry at how stupid it was. Meaning the whole logic just got nullified. It was no suspense as some hints were shown from the beginning as they happen to be from the same town and knew each other as kids. Plot was literally boring as There was nothing new.

Also I hated the fact that Gang tae was the only one suffering the most in the show. First dealing with autistic brother and then Ms Ko, no doubt she brought thrill ll in his life but I think he deserved better. He was now dealing with the demons of Ms Ko as well. Caregiver should have gotten more care from his love interest I believe. Something normal would‚Äôve been much better than a girl with her own trauma and crazy family background.

All I am gonna say is that i didn‚Äôt get to see anything new!!

Avereage Drama wherein People are Just hyping the Shit Out of it
The Drama was really good at the beginning and deserved all the praise it deserved at first. But after the first few episodes, The writer and the director just got lazy, the production quality dropped and turned out to be an average Romance drama with a Ridiculous plot twist.

The Performance of Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se was really good an was perfect for their characters, but Kim Soo Hyun's performance was just average and nothing more than that. Although all the other side characters did a pretty good job, Kim Soo Hyun's acting became a negative influence on the drama.

The typical push and pull which started from the 7th episode itself even before properly developing the Romance and continuing it upto the episode 14 is also one of the most cliche' things, from wherein the drama started to Disappoint.

Don't even get me started with the plot twist, it was so ridiculous that it completely ruined some characters, Made them inconsistent and also even made the initial interaction of leads into a ridiculous one. What I hated the most about the writing was that not only did they ruin the Second half of the drama, but also the good parts of the drama after the plot twist and saying that it was all her doing. I just can't seem to understand why people are just overlooking over the ridiculous plot twist and inconsistent characters by saying that no drama is perfect. For God sake, the Defining plot twist of the drama is what they ruined and people are just ready to overlook that fact. (Typical Fanbase)

The Second half of the drama is full of Cliche' Romance and typical fan service which could've been nice to watch if the drama was consistent in its tone and Characters. And the Ending, Mental illness is such an easy thing to cure if it's not for our Main Characters. Many of the patients in the hospital were cured (that too offscreen), because why not, nobody cares about the Side characters. Can't believe it is the same drama wherein they used a good amount of screen time in some episodes for us to empathise with side characters.

Stop writing fluffy reviews about this drama. It's not that good you'll just have backlash because it WON'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS. I went to watch this after seeing the unusual 9.2 and was highly disappointed with how clich√© this is. The fans of this are too ride or die and idek why. Probably because of the cute graphics that resemble Tim Burton style but besides that and the autistic character there's nothing special about this show, it's tropes galore and honestly Kim Soohyun performance in this in kinda dull. Yes he's a good crier but besides that his character is not captivating.

This k-drama is so overrated!tbh I was excited for this one but It just fell flat for me I was bored half way through! The plot is so predictable and I felt it dragged on with no story built up. It was so anticlimactic! If you want an easy watch typical k drama then this is your drama! The FL was getting quite annoying With her yelling! ML I was disappointed with him picking this role I would like to see him in a more challenging role next time. I can see why it got low ratings in Korea there are better dramas out there! Overall I would say skip it!

Was more enthralled by the side stories and brotherly love than the unconvincing romance.
Everyone loved this show, and understandably so. It had the perfect formula to become mainstream that everyone would truly enjoy. Sadly, for someone like me who craves for unique and realistic stories, some parts of it were too frustrating to watch that I had to convince myself to finish this show because of the parts I loved about it.

Things I loved about it:

- The fact that it revolved around Psychology (I‚Äôm a Psychology Major so I‚Äôm a sucker for this). I found myself crying every time they revealed and focused on the struggles of the families of autistic people, as well as the other Psychological disorders that were highlighted through the various patients of the ward. The first few episodes made my heart burn and I knew it would be a good story after how they revealed the story of that guy with manic tendencies. Wow, genius and heart wrenching.

- I loved the writing style. Whenever a drama uses a creative way to place a theme for each episode (in this case, the fairy tales), I know i‚Äôm in for good writing. Truly appreciated this side of the show. The mini story books and the final story book was truly a genius way to tie up the whole story. The first scene of the show which also used a story book to introduce everything was also truly genius.

- The acting of the brothers. Wow, that autistic brother was truly amazing. And wow, Kim Soo Hyun was just truly breath taking. I managed to finish the show because of these two, and I shed a lot of tears because of their scenes.

Things I didn‚Äôt like about it

- The romance. I still find it hard to believe that someone would fall for a scary woman like Mun Yeong. She indeed was fun to watch, but I honestly believe you‚Äôll be creeped out if you met someone as obsessed as her in real life. Not to discount the fact that she also has a personality disorder, but I felt like everything between her and the male lead was too rushed and forced. They should have given their romance more time to develop to make it convincing.

- The story of Mun Yeong‚Äôs family was totally unconvincing. I hated how unrealistic her mom was, and I hated how their story was one of the main plots from the very start. I wish they explained a bit of the mom‚Äôs background just so we can understand why she turned out to be that way, staying true to this show‚Äôs attempt to explain their characters‚Äô stories through the use of past traumatic experiences. Aside from lack of understanding for this character, the head nurse‚Äôs acting was actually quite off. She totally wasn‚Äôt convincing and I found myself distracting my head whenever she appeared on screen just so I won‚Äôt turn off my phone. The original mom would have been more convincing as the villain until the very end.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was such a good show, it‚Äôs just that I was slightly disappointed about how they forced the ‚Äúthriller‚Äù side of the show through Munyeong‚Äôs family, without properly developing their story. However, I feel like the show managed to redeem itself in its last episode after it chose to focus on the brotherly love again (which I honestly think was good enough to be the main plot) and the other patients.

A good watch, truly unique, but it did not really make a lasting impression. Maybe I was hoping for another Psychological drama (a realistic one) like It‚Äôs Okay, That‚Äôs Love? Once again, my high expectations ruined my viewing of this show. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake!

An average drama which is overrated because of powerful chemistry
Let me be honest here, like everyone else I like the chemistry between leads. It is very powerful and not to forget characters are interesting by own. But calling it a masterpiece seems little overrated. It was started and promoted that FL is suffering from ASPD, if it were BPD I will adjust but this disorder is a very strong topic which needs to handle carefully. Do the writers know what SOCIOPATH means? They promoted it like now everyone out there thinks that people with ASPD are cool and badass? Why? Why do you have to ruin it using it as a promotion? FL is already interesting, even without adding such a thing. Let's focus on how they handle other character's mental problem treated, this drama shed light that mentally disabled people and all those who deal with mental problems need to treated with emotions too. But where was the professional help?? All the characters and head of the psychiatric hospital seem so ridiculous.

Now moving to leads, all the feminist out there found it cool when FL harass or force ML to do things which he doesn't want. Probably he falls in love later but TOXIC is TOXIC. No doubt, the chemistry in undernying. And the biggest mystery about FL Mom doesn't live up to expectations.

As individual characters, I like all the characters. They are at least emotionally relatable to some extent.

ACTING-

When I say that story is mediocre but actors put their souls, I mean this. Seo ye Ji and Oh Jung Se nailed their roles even though character was flawed at a time. Compare to his previous dramas, Kim So Hyun is good here not exceptional but enough to hook me with his character. The acting of Seo ye Ji stood out most for me in this one, she showed emotion with her eyes.

MUSIC -

This drama is one of the best albums out there. Nothing more to say, each soundtrack hit differentt

REWATCH VALUE -

I won't go for rewatching often but yes I can definitely rewatch some of the clips but not the whole drama since I couldn't cooperate with the story.

The same old clich√©s!
The story is not something that unique. Like most Korean love dramas it is full of predictable twists, childhood and parent relationships, jealousy and love triangles, characters trying to act cool and make the other lead jealous. For example, the other girl who loves the main lead has done nothing wrong but love him, give him a home and a job but still he never appreciated her enough and just uses her whenever he needs her. I know that happens in real life too but that's not ok as it is always shown in Kdramas. To be honest, watching that time when she is drunk and slaps the female lead and curses the male lead felt really good!
Also, again, like most other Korean dramas they just suddenly jump on a motorcycle to rescue their love in sadness. Ok, I'm not saying that's bad, but that happens in all Kdramas and sometimes it is performed even better. This show has a lot of these old cliches and I don't want to bore you mentioning all of them. Most scenes were based on them and even though it had other moments too, it was not satisfying enough.
As for the acting, the main male lead has this poker face a lot of times that I couldn't really connect with. The acting is not something that unique either. It is just fairly done.
I liked the cinematography for the first few episodes (which it just suddenly stopped). This small part is well done, but that's never enough to make a drama unique.

I want to point out some of my other views regarding the story.
let me first say that I love realistic dramas. Shows that mirror our daily problems which can happen even in a fantasy.
I don't like a show because everybody does, or hate it because everybody does so.

How probable is it that you willingly choose the same career of a mother whom you don't actually like? I'd say none.

The main reasons why I had problems with this show:

First of all, I love serious people, but I don't like arrogant ones. It's the easiest to be rude to others and angry if you're facing problems (or having mental issues). Blaming everything and everyone around you, thinking you are mistreated or you are better than others is very immature - Even though there is always a source for every bad trait of a person and they have to fix themselves and don't think it's ok to continue like this unless love happens and because they are not fine they can hurt others and people should always understand them. So, I don't want to watch the life of a person like that.

Secondly, the beautiful dresses and the cinderella complex! You may think what on earth you're talking about, but let me explain. The FL is far too dramatic. She has everything one could wish for. She has money, talents, she has a beautiful face, good people around her, and still, because of her past, she acts like she is the only one with problems without trying to work on them with the proper psychologist and overcome these problems, while people facing issues like hunger and inequality don't act rudely to that extent. I know that even rich people can suffer from all sorts of issues, but still, they have one very big problem less than others and they can actually pay for treatment. There is a difference between dying from hunger and suffering from past traumas which you can at least try to fix( with the money of course! Doing yoga, going traveling, seeing a psychologist, relaxing, and ...)

Thirdly, It still is full of cliches. In the end, she needed someone (read one man) to enter her life, so she could understand that she has problems and she has to change so she could be a better person for him, instead of fixing herself for the sake of herself and everyone around her. And the fact that even with her success she should still have a romantic life to be complete. ( I know this is a romance genre but still! )

lastly, It's completely mainstream, and still very stupid, of Korean shows when the protagonists' bad actions are always justified in a way, while those who do some bad things towards them are the mere evil ones. Let me make an example, if you have seen Revenge, the American show, you never feel like the female lead having done all sorts of things to get on with her plans is somehow justified. It's like she knows doing this she is no longer an innocent and decent person and she can never go back. Knowing that we can understand her better and like her better. The bad things she has done become a very important part of her, that sticks with her, even if she goes on with her life. Asian dramas always make everything about evil or good rather than the reality of the grey or black personality of people. Like they magically change to this person with a clean slate at the end. We are responsible for our actions and if someone does something bad to us or if we have traumas and mental problems it never justifies our bad behavior. We have to compensate for these rude actions, that's the proper response.

I want to see a Korean drama in which a woman helps other women without being arrogant (being serious still) or rude while having a bigger understanding of the world trying to be better while putting aside her own jealousy when she is communicating with a love rival, and love, well, that can happen too! But I guess I ask too much from this (dramaland) fantasy world. They are made for that purpose. :D

Started off strong . . .
I'm not going to lie, I have a strong Kim Soo Hyun bias and have been really looking forward to his post-military duty drama comeback. I think the concept of the story was intriguing, the cinematography: excellent, the cast: spectacular, the soundtrack: addictive, but the execution didn't quite reach the desired effect. I do give a lot of props to the writers for writing stories within the story. The illustrations and moral messages of Moon Young's fairytales were so poignant and beautifully written. I'm grateful for this drama because it introduced me to the talent that is Seo Ye Ji. She is gorgeous, her acting is top-notch, and her voice is absolutely mesmerizing.

The story started off so strong and made me jump to my tv at 9am every Sat/Sun morning to watch this drama as soon as it was released...sadly, a little past the midpoint it fell victim to the k-drama slump and lost its momentum. There was also a huge question left unanswered: how the hell did Moon Young's mom survive all those years?

The drama does take an interesting look at mental health since essentially everyone in this drama have their own varying conditions but it's also very insulting to healthcare workers. Never have I seen more incompetent, irresponsible, and gossipy caregivers. I certainly wouldn't trust this staff to look after my family members. The staff handle altercations so carelessly that it's a wonder they haven't been shut down yet.
Anyways, Gang Tae and Sang Tae's relationship is absolutely heartbreaking. This pair of brothers depend on each other so much that it actually caused a slump in both of their mental health developments. Fueled by love, guilt, and responsibility, Gang Tae sacrifices all of himself and more for Sang Tae however, this is a double-edged sword since the result is that Gang Tae has no life of his own and Sang Tae is smothered by Gang Tae's mothering. Enter Go Moon Young. She is the exact opposite of selfless Gang Tae. She's bold, selfish, unapologetic, and demanding with everything around her. If she likes something, she will stop at nothing to own it. . .which includes Gang Tae.
The beauty of their relationship is that Moon Young forces Gang Tae to act for himself and learn that it's okay for him to be a little selfish. In return, Gang Tae teaches Moon Young to not only think about her own needs. They also have a wonderful group of friends who at times, act as their enablers and at other times, help to raise them up when they crumble.

Overall, it was very enjoyable and it's an delight to watch these 3 characters love, hurt, and grow together as friends, siblings, lovers, and people.

BEST KDRAMA EVER!!!
Well, this is my very first review on this website and in general cause I've never written one so please bear with me if I start swooning over something while reviewing it lol. Let's begin!

First of I wanna say that this is the perfect cast ever. From KSH and OJS's versatility to our underrated queen's crazy acting we totally got surprised! Ngl but like many people I came here to check out KSH but I got mesmerized with SYJ too. The side characters are so amazing too and they've got their own character development and story going on which is pretty great as so many dramas tend to neglect it. If you're tempted by cast you're in for a treat.

Next let's talk about the story. So a lot of people say that this is a very slow drama and there's not much happening here or there's no plot twist or climax or this drama is overrated and stuff. Guys, lol just wanna say one thing that this drama for sure is not everyone's cup of tea. There doesn't have to be a plot twist every 2 episodes for this to be a MASTERPIECE! It's not an action/thriller. This drama is more character driven. There are some flaws in the story but nothing can be perfect! I'm not saying the story isn't good. The story is fantastic imo but the people who come in with high expectations for the story tend to get disappointed. In the great words of KSH this is a ‚ÄúHUMAN HEALING DRAMA‚Äù so keep that in mind. This drama has the best characters and the best character development. From the leads to a recurring character. This drama is about experiencing their journeys, their mental breakdown and their healing. You wouldn't be disappointed. I promise. Also take it as a drama lol. Some people start comparing it with real life but this is still fiction and it's here to teach you some morals.

NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY AND THIS WAS THE SWOON PART I MENTIONED EARLIER!!! I swear to God KSH and SYJ are the most beautiful human beings I've seen in one frame. I saw the poster and the poster alone had so much chemistry that I was like COUNT ME IN! These two have so much sexual tension that I can't help but ship them irl lol. It hurts. For me this is my favorite couple now. It's gonna be tough to see them paired up with another actors in future lol. Hoping for another drama from them. Guys, these two produce so much electricity that they can light up North Korea fr. I love them so much! If you're into the drama just for romance this is the one you're looking for. AND THE KISSING SCENE *chef's kiss*

I wanna wrap this up by saying that there's a lot of fairy tales in the drama that are shown from a different perspective which is rather harsh and more closer to the door of reality. It's ironic cause fairy tales are supposed to be a strawberry world where everything is perfect but this drama tends to take a darker turn on them and show the reality behind them and suddenly you question the way you're looking at life. This drama highlights a famous prover i.e. ‚Äúdon't judge a book by it's cover‚Äù. There are so many people out there who need help and just want someone to reach out to them but people are rather judgey and that's the nature of our society. But when the person just can't take it anymore and decides to end his/her life then suddenly there are a lot of people crying for you after you're gone. As someone once said ‚Äúnot everyone wants to die. Some people just wants to be able to close their eyes and feel alright. Some people just want their sufferings to end‚Äù. So everyone please just show someone near to you that you care and god knows if that can make a huge difference in other persons life like KMY. She just wanted someone to be by her side. So everyone be happy, happy happy!

Last but not the least, the transitions, editing and the OST!!! This drama is a package and if you're missing out on this i don't know what to do. This is my favorite drama now. Now I'm going cause I wanna rewatch it lol. Oh did I mention that this is a 100% rewatch worthy cause I myself have watched each episode more than 20 times. I'm obsessed and bye now. Thanks for reading xoxo!!

Just a reminder don't be overhyped by anything this is just my pov. Go in with the least expectations and that's how you can enjoy the drama even more haha! ~

It's Okay To Not Be Okay Is...Okay
I'm not a fan of romance whatsoever but I am a fan of great storytelling when it involves small doses of romance. That being said great storytelling also involves great screenwriting where the dialogue is clear and compelling and doesn't leave all the heavy lifting to the viewers. But what 'It's Okay To Not Be Okay' suffers from is its heavy reliance on flashbacks. It's okay when you're recapping episodes and if they are used sparingly for dramatic effect but if you have to continually remind viewers of certain plot points then it seems to indicate a lack of confidence in the story itself. The likelihood of a man with an autistic older brother falling in love with the daughter of the woman who murdered his mother is a hard sell. And even with some strong individual performances at times by the show's leads, I didn't buy it. I wasn't convinced of the motive that caused the mother to kill in the first place. I also thought the show did a very poor job of exploring the real-life stigma that people with mental health issues face.

Overrated
I‚Äôm sorry, but I have no idea what all the hype is about. I thought it was terrible and annoying. I didn‚Äôt believe in any of the main characters for one second. They all seemed made-up, with no connection to reality. And don‚Äôt get me started on the evil mom who survives a cracked skull, broken neck, and drowning in a suitcase at the bottom of the ocean. I think it‚Äôs actually more believable that she‚Äôs a crazy nurse who learned all about the Ko family from taking care of the father and now mistakenly believes she‚Äôs the mom. And the dad tried to strangle his daughter because he was afraid she would turn evil too? How believable is that? And the music was horrible. The singer sounded like her mouth was full of marbles. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs a nice and talented person though so I‚Äôm sorry to be mean.

The only thing that saved this drama from being an utter failure were the side characters, who were likable and more real than the main characters. I especially like Ju Ri and her mom.

I guess I just have totally different tastes from most drama fans. But I have very low tolerance for people who mope and feel sorry for themselves all the time.

This year's one of the best drama!
Whoa! my reaction when I started to watch this drama, I wasn't sure before how it will turn out but it was amazing thank god I listen to my insticts and watched cause it was pretty amazing.

But it's not for anyone I say because you will love or hate it.

The plot was very interesting and addictive and main thing it's originality. I love the character development it was one of the best thing of this drama because you see every character is developing in their own way in every episode and it was refreshing to see. I also love those stories or I can say fairy tales.

Acting was topnotch, and ost was incredible (it's in my fav songs list).

Overall this drama was amazing and worthwatching !!

HEARTBREAKING BUT BEAUTIFUL
IONTBO made me feel so many different emotions altogether. But mostly the main leads did, they were all hurt and wounded in their own ways and needed someone to love them and understand them. The very fact that it was a drama that treated psychological problems was a little different since I haven't really seen a drama this focused before. Some people said that the character's didn't even seem to have any of those mental health problems but I want to remind everyone that at the end of the day it's a Korean drama and not a documentary, of course the romance and the drama is supposed to be there, of course at one point it seemed to focus more on other elements but it was essential for the healing of the characters. Personally, I feel the actors did an awesome job, so good that at times I just couldn't stop the tears cos it seemed so realistic and painfully sad. The relationship between KT and ST was so pure, but they had their problems but I'm happy that as brothers they managed to solve them all the time. MY's slow but steady, but not complete development made her look more human by the end and I'm happy about that, since many hated her personality at the start, but probably it's because they didn't try to understand. Yes, she was rude and extra, she still is at times, but try to go to the start of her behaviour, you'll understand why she is, or why are all the characters the way that they are. It's called It's Okay Not To Be Okay for a reason.

I also wanted to talk about OK Psychiatric Clinic, the staff and patients there. Their stories made me realise and understand so many things and I just want to say that those actors also did an absolutely amazing job.

KSH and SYJ are both very good actors, and they had a very good understanding of their characters and they played their roles well. They broke my heart, they made me cry but also smile and laugh. Them two were mood. The supporting cast was also very important and without them the drama would have been surely very different, they were so essential. Also the director, writers and production really did an awesome job, the way they assembled everything, the cinematography, the dialogues and everything is needy of praises.

The OST was awesome. I pay very much attention to the soundtrack and music of a drama cos I believe that it can make a huge difference to the overall mood and atmosphere of a drama. Many of my fave dramas are also my favourites because of the high quality music they offered.

To conclude, the ending was good. The only thing is not knowing more about how things went with the mother, but maybe it's good like this. Everything I wished for happened and I have no regrets. I want to say that it was a really good journey to watch this for the last month and a half, I met so many wonderful people while commenting and discussing this k-drama on MDL, and it was a good ride. You should really give this drama chance and understanding, it's actually really beautiful.

overrated
I lost interest in this kdrama in episode 11. a lot of unexplained relationships and loopholes here and there. the hot and cold relationship makes me so tired and can predict what will happened between the couple. i dont know how to write review, but then this kdrama is just filler for my time.

few things I found its funny, how come somebody who works as a caregiver at smalltown hospital can afford to buy VOLVO car (support character who drive white volvo car) ? its such fail product placement and kind of spoiled the mood to watch it because it not believable at all.

Healing drama done perfectly
I've been watching dramas for more than 10 years now.
So far, only two dramas have managed to leave an imprint on my heart.

Now I count three.

I can't even find words to say how watching this drama every weekend has been such a wonderful journey.
There are so many meaningful morals you can take from this drama but ultimately it comes down to the importance of loving oneself, showing gratitude to people around you and muster the courage to overcome the obstacles life throws your way.

This drama is the best and the most perfect healing drama I've ever come across. I loved every minute of it.

The actors were perfect.
The acting was perfect.
The OST was perfect.
The cinematography was perfect.
The storyline was imperfectly perfect.
The rewatch value is definitely 100%.

I might sound biased because I totally, completely, absolutely loved this drama in its entirety.
But I truly believe this drama has something to teach everybody and anybody interested in watching it.

However, don't just watch it. Immerse yourself in it and it will bring you to a magical fairy tale world.

This drama definitely changed something in me, and I am forever grateful for it.

P.S.: prepare tissues, you might cry a lot.

A deceptively deep but ultimately shallow and bewildering drama on ""healing""
I'm going to go into this review as a mental health advocate and avid drama watcher and I must say , that on both fronts , I am very bewildered .

There is a telenovela called La Mujer Perfecta ""The Perfect Woman"" from Venezuela. It is a slice of life telenovela that showcases Venezuelan beauty standards in a society that prizes beauty over brains and the mass objectification of the female body . Whilst exploring that; it touches on a girl who is nonconformist ,has amazing brains , eccentric beauty plus has Asperger's Syndrome . Asperger's is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. All of which make her severely underappreciated and misunderstood in the society she finds herself in.However -the depiction of mental health in that telenovela showed that your perceived weakness in society can actually be beautiful and strong.

It‚Äôs Okay To Not Be Okay didn‚Äôt make its protagonists gorgeous but made them weak and lacking with an evolved sense of self centeredness which is far from the mental health truth .It was a plot that was rather disingenuous as it had supreme potential to break much needed ground . It could have really knocked it out the park exploring mental illnesses and their intricate effects in daily life.

The use of psychopathy was lazy and came across as a crude entertainment device. This is seen in the terrible plot twist.Also , It‚Äôs okay not to be okay could‚Äôve been a poignant slice of life drama with special emphasis on people triumphing over what society views as a weakness but instead it shallowly explored the effects of alcoholism , domestic abuse and trauma. This is due to the world building and character portraits. The world of IOTNBO was not fully lived in but was rather heavily accessorised and very much stylised focusing more on aesthetic than on substance. So in the end - the beautiful and human character portraits did not have a chance to take center stage.Instead , we had numerous employees stand back and watch while people like the Moon brother's . female protagonist et al had their meltdowns which would NEVER happen , like , ANYWHERE. And those are just a few of the many examples. No careful thought was put in this which was very off putting but people are giving it a pass because it is ""pretty"" and ""helaing"". SMH.

I do however appreciate it for what it was in the end. That's why I did not drop it even though , perhaps , I should have .Its a story that does not really focus on plot but opts to tell it‚Äôs story via the unravelling of complex character portraits in the form of the three main leads.Thats cool.The acting was also very engaging as well and the actors wove in great continiuty in their skills . Kim Soo Hyun was ridiculously tragic , Seo Yeo Ji was transfixing and Oh Jung Se needs AWARDS ASAP. Drama performance of the year ! The supporting cast was meh for the most part and annoying in some parts but I did really love ALL the patients in Ok Psychiatry Hospital . Very lovely stories indeed.

The music was not impressive and did a lack luster job on atmosphere modulation.

OVERALL - I would not rewatch it or even watch MVs on YouTube. I am glad I did watch and it was mildly entertaining and gorgeous in visuals . On substance fronts - its severely lacking. It was like going to a restaurant and having boiled ribs with no garnish. Ribs have so much potential to be tasty and yum so why leave them boiled?No thank you .

Average drama
Well, I have no complaints about this drama as I knew this was not for me. Even my friends didn't recommend as they knew this is not my type of drama. But it was not so bad neither so good...This drama got such a big viewership internationally and maybe, it can surpass dramas like Goblin or Dots.
About the couple, I missed chemistry and felt lack of emotions . As a drama, I felt that this could be placed in the same class of itaewon class. So if you like that drama, go for it!!

The music is good ..could be added to your playlist. I don't know whether the psychological condition of the characters are portrayed medically correct . I felt a bit of artificiality in that.

Oh God this is drama which we were waiting for!
I can not enough explain how this drama is magnificent in every possible way. This drama is original and something new and refreshing even if theme is mental health and those dramas are usually very tough to watch. I cried on every episode and I am far and away from crybaby.
This drama should watch every parent to see how children are frigale beans and how every moment in their growth is important and that only child which get love and affection can grow and develop in the right way!
I hardly can wait till the next episode.

Good Enough
"" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.

The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.

Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)

So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)

The story loses its charm somewhat after 4th episode and again after 11 episode.you keep thinking or waiting some big event to happen but nothing happens. In the beginning it is showed as butterflies might be a big deal Thts why both brothers keep moving but turns out it was not that big deal.Also the story between Kang tae and Ko moon is also not soo exciting.It just seems pretty obvious what will happen next. Nothing to keep the audience on their toes and make them jump with excitement. Trill and excitement is what is missing in its okay not to be okay besides that story is also not very strong .there reasons aren‚Äôt that strong.

Great acting, great premise, bad execution, no real drama
While It's Okay to Not Be Okay started out with an intriguing premise and captivating first few episodes, the series stagnates around episode 5 and completely loses its luster by the end of episode 7, never to recover until the very end.

My biggest complaint is that it was hard to sympathize with the ML, Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun), who I found to be very whiny, mopey, and immature throughout, treating everyone around him with little to no respect. It was hard not to roll my eyes every time he grabbed the wrist of the FL, Ko Moon-young, which was A LOT.

Overall, I felt that there were many storylines that could have brought some much needed drama to the story, but the writer chose to center the drama around a very fickle romance that really didn't feel earned at all.

Great beginning, okay middle, draggy ending
I think everyone must have reviewed this show before it finished. When I started watching this show, I thought it was going to be great. Seo Yeo Ji was just a perfect fit to be Ko Mun Yeong. KSH seemed like a good foil to her in the beginning. However when they stopped fighting with each other and you could tell they were going to get together, the magic seemed to diminish.

The first third of the show was excellent. I'd give it a 10.

The next third of the show started to drag on, but it was still okay. About a 7-8.

The last third of the show really started to drag on and on. I could barely finish watching it. Probably took me as long to watch the last third as it did the first 2/3rds of the show. The Ko Mun Yeong mom arc was just a big nothingburger.

Why is Korea Sleeping On This Show? (Updated)
This show explores and fleshes out themes in ways different from what I‚Äôve seen in usual kdramas. It has many original concepts but still has that korean trademark chemistry between the leads that will give you the heart fuzzies.

In short, come for the romance but stay for the story. Also, Kim Soo Hyun is definitely not human... how can he still look so good after all this time?!!

Side note: this is my first time seeing Seo Ye Ji and I am blown away. She is so appealing and extremely good at portraying her character. Currently checking her other works just to see more of her and her acting prowess!!!

Why I love this show:
1. The character development of the leads and main supporting cast across the episodes is nothing short of amazing - each main and supporting character has depths that shine in different moments throughout the series.

2. The sets are beautifully made and the crew‚Äôs attention to detail is astounding.

3. The laughs and humor in this dramedy are well placed, feel natural, and let‚Äôs you laugh along. The serious moments are heavy enough to make you cry. The heartwarming moments are genuine and can make you both laugh and cry.

4. THE CHEMISTRY AMONG THE LEADS IS NEXT LEVEL!!! The filial chemistry among OJS, SYJ, and KSH is so good you‚Äôll be rooting for each of them until the end. The romantic chemistry between KSH and SYJ is explosive!!! Can they please just be happy together ?

5. After finishing the show, I read an op-ed explaining the nature of this show as a character driven story as opposed to a plot driven story. This helped me understand the POV of the writer and director's vision better and now I see that they, along with the cast and crew, executed it perfectly! There will be lots of room for theorizing how some events happened, but what I've come to learn is that it doesn't matter because it's not important to the characters on whom the the show revolves.

The show wraps up nicely and neatly, please watch and enjoy!

First Half is amazing, Second Half is draggy
IOTNBO has been the most talked-about drama of 2020 and for some maybe even the best drama of 2020. I am not one of these people and IOTNBO has been added into my list of the most disappointing dramas of 2020. There are good aspects of course but there are some bad aspects which have caused my rating to be so low.

The Good:
- The first half is amazing
- The psychology aspect is very well done and is blended into the story pretty well
- All the characters have motivations and aren't just one dimensional
- The Characters by themselves are interesting
- The story is interesting
- The MC's have great chemistry
- The Acting is really well done by all the cast especially Oh Jung Se and Seo Ye Ji
- The FL is interesting
- The OST is phenomenal

The Bad:
- The Drama falls flat in its second half and becomes unpleasant
- The Love story happens too fast and doesn't make sense
- The writing is the weakest point as they don't really string together all the great aspects very well and instead, it feels
really messy and confusing
- There really isn't a plot and instead its just random events that happen
- The drama is filled with cliche tropes and even though it does have interesting aspects (such as the psychology aspect)
it's mostly just an average Rom-Com
- All of the character development is really messy
- The FL mother being the murderer was really badly done and her whole character arc was not done very well
- The drama has many opportunities that it wastes

Conclusion: IOTNBO is not the worst drama in the world but it is disappointing when you see how much potential the drama has. IOTNBO could've been one of the best dramas of the last decade but it squanders a lot of its opportunity by adding unnecessary tropes and predictable plot twists. So for me, I would give IOTNBO a 6.5/10

A must watch!!
I don't usually watch dramas while they're airing because it's agonising having to wait a whole week for the next episode. However, I couldn't hold myself back from checking out this drama. The plot and casting really caught my attention and I wasn't disappointed when i started watching it.

Although the series mainly focusses on Kang Tae and Moonyoung, the supporting cast receives attention too with their own stories and scenes that makes the plot even more likeable. The story is unique but easy to get the gist of and perfect for people who are looking for a slow burn romance! You'll fall in love with each character as the drama progresses. I personally love when main characters develop in dramas because it keeps me wanting to watch more and 'It's Okay to Not Be Okay' has just that and more. Not only does this drama have a unique storyline but it also shares real life issues dealing with mental health and healing. It's a series viewers can both enjoy and learn from!

Each and every scene delivers stunning cinematography and smooth directory. I love the fact that the drama has small references from fairytales since Moonyoung is a story writer and it's probably part of the whole theme. Kim Soohyun and Seo Yeji deserve multiple acting awards because their emotional acting is on point! I have to also mention that the fashion of Seo Yeji's character is beautiful because she manages to pull off literally every outfit she wears. I also really love the OST, my personal faves are In Silence and Wake Up!

I just can't help but love this series!!

I was expecting more
I like the drama but it left me wanting.

In terms of acting, the believable one for me is Oh Jung Se as Sang Tae. I expected more from Soo Hyun acting. Ye Ji is a good actor, might look up more of her dramas. The supporting characters are good too, I enjoy the side stories. There's good comedic timing too. The actors just did not make me feel invested on their characters, I really did not feel the sincerity of it, I don't know how to explain it, that's just how I feel when I watched it.

The story is okay, I don't think the script really delve in the mental side of what I thought this drama is all about. The plot holes, the mother plot. It did not grab my attention as I hoped, the last episode is really nice though. What I did not like too much about it is like I feel there's confusion on what they want to show, if they want to show the realism or the fantasy of it, so I guess it's better to view this as a fairy tale story.

The OST is okay, there's one song that they play that really reminded me of the Jonas Brothers song.

Overall, the drama is good to watch, beautiful production and transitions. The drama is ok and many will like this kind of show, I guess it's not my taste.

Dissapointing
I was really, really excited for this one.
I'm a huge Kim Soohyun fan and I was counting down for him coming back. When I saw that he took on a new drama, I was so excited. But, I'm now at episode 13 and it's getting really boring for me.
First of all, the drama is getting hype for being about mental health but that isn't that prevalent to be honest. It's a love story between someone who works at a mental health facility and a someone who became 'difficult' because of her childhood. But, there's never a healing story of Munyeong. She just falls in love and kind of keeps the irritating attitude.
The only really mental health story is the one of Moon Sangtae because he has autism. But I feel like he is just there to make the love story 'cuter'.
I did like the stories of the patients. They were really interesting but there was never a focus on that.
Really hoped this would be better.

A masterpiece with a magical character
Wow! Get ready! This drama is something else! It hooked me right from the start, and then I was glued to my seat all the way through. This is one of those special shows that captures your heart and takes you on an emotional journey that leaves you changed when you are through. Special indeed!

The drama is like a dark, modern fairy tale. It has a magical quality to it in the way the story is told. The script was so incredibly well-written with every line of dialogue having meaning.

A lot of thought also went into the production with so much attention to detail in constructing the sets as well as how the scenes were shot. The OST also greatly enhanced this magical feel. All of these elements blended together beautifully to carry us away into this slightly disturbing yet very healing fairy tale.

Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji delivered powerhouse performances, and any time they were on screen together was completely captivating in so many different ways. Their chemistry was palpable. They run very hot and cold with each other which resulted in some incredibly intense moments as well as some deeply emotional ones.

This relationship is a bit disturbing in the beginning as these two clash. Their actions towards each other aren‚Äôt always that great. These are two very broken people. But they are drawn to each other, and those walls slowly start coming down between them.



It‚Äôs not a linear journey though, and the road is filled many bumps along the way. As they learn and grow in their relationship, healing begins to emerge. We experience a lot of joy and sadness with this couple, but it‚Äôs all worth it to watch these two hurting people face their demons and find comfort in each other. I was completely swept up in this amazing romance!



Seo Ye Ji was absolutely phenomenal as Moon Young. She owned this complex character and breathed so much life into her. Moon Young is a unique character in the drama landscape, particularly for a female lead.

Many times she feels quite dangerous as she doesn‚Äôt hold back and will take her anger out on those who wrong her. She‚Äôs impulsive and says what‚Äôs on her mind. Plus, when she sets her mind on something, she won‚Äôt back down. That includes her feelings for Gang Tae.



Her actions towards him are quite aggressive as she relentlessly pursues him. Definitely not the recommended way to initiate a relationship. Just reading that, Moon Young may sound like terrible person. But there is far more to her than that.

Underneath that powerful persona is a very hurt and damaged woman that has an incredibly traumatic past. Learning more about her, how her mind works, and watching her journey of growth was such a treat.



Gang Tae has his own deep-seated issues stemming from his past. He loves his brother dearly and has dedicated his life to taking care of him, but that comes with a cost. His brother has always came first since they were children, and he‚Äôs had to bury much of his pain in order to do what is best for Sang Tae.

That has taken an emotional toll on him over the years, and he has to unlearn some of his bad habits. His pain is quite raw to see, and it was evident that he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.

When Moon Young comes into his life, he becomes incredibly conflicted as he is forced to fight his feelings for her. It was heartbreaking to watch as he struggled with wanting to do what was best for his brother as well as just take some small enjoyment out of life for himself for a change. He had a lot of growing to do too.



There‚Äôs also Sang Tae who faces his own challenges stemming from his Autism as he struggles to understand people and their emotions. A trauma from his past has also made his and Gang Tae‚Äôs lives very difficult.

I was thrilled with how this character was handled. Many times in shows, characters with disorders like his are sort of relegated to being a token side character that just impacts the main character. Not so here! Sang Tae is written as a completely fleshed out character that has his own journey to go, is an integral part of the story, and is just as important in every way. Wonderful to see!

Oh Jung Se also really put in a terrific performance as Sang Tae. I was very impressed with him and just how much he brought this character to life and opened a window into his soul.



It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay has so many relationships to explore too. I already mentioned the one involving Gang Tae and Moon Young. One that is just as important though is that of the brothers.

Gang Tae and Sang Tae have a complex relationship that is in many ways frozen in time from when they were kids. The dynamic they have between them has remained the same since then.

They love each other dearly but have stayed in their respective roles without growth. This ultimately had a negative effect on their relationship and their lives which resulted in neither of them being able to live their best lives.

Growing as individuals and in the relationship becomes very important for them. I loved seeing how they cared for each other despite some severe challenges to the relationship. And watching them grow closer, understand each other more, and finally progress into a healthier relationship was wonderful.



I could go on and on about all of the amazing relationships featured in this drama. Sang Tae and Moon Young definitely have quite the interesting relationship with each other and is quite fun to watch.

Then we have a wide array of wonderful supporting characters that are explored. There are friendships, romance, parent/child relationships, and more. Suffice to say, everyone in this drama is important, has a story, and is connected to the overall narrative. It was beautifully done.





There‚Äôs even some mystery in this series as Moon Young‚Äôs past is slowly peeled back as well as the traumatic events from Gang Tae and Sang Tae‚Äôs childhood revealed. It added yet another nice layer to this multi-faceted story.



As you can see, It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay explores a host of mental health issues and complicated themes. I experienced so many different emotions watching this drama. So much raw pain is dealt with in this story.

Our characters are all very different from each other and have their own issues to deal with, but they all ultimately need the same thing‚Ä¶love and acceptance. Loneliness can be crippling, and that is shown very clearly here. Seeing this unlikely group come together and heal was such a treat. The concept of what a family is was explored in such a touching way.



It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay is one of those unique and special thought-provoking dramas that truly is a masterpiece. It tells a heart-wrenching yet beautiful story of growth and healing. The characters are flawed, but we come to understand them and root for their personal growth and happiness. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect to achieve that either. Love and acceptance can be found in imperfection. The message is clear and simple‚Ä¶It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay.‚ô°

A walk through life...
This is the first time I was watching an on-air kdrama, so perhaps I won't be able to recall details, but what I do remember is how I felt while watching it. Yes, it was an emotional roller coaster, re-experiencing life you may say!



I got frustrated by some's actions, while the same people made me so proud later on.
I cried tears of pain along with some characters, while later shedding tears of joy for them too.
I got disappointed at some at times, while ending up rooting for them eventually.
I laughed with them and at them, pitied them and regretted on their behalf too...

Meaning that this drama portrayed raw, vulnerable and flawed characters at their 'worst' who are in a journey towards their 'best' selves throughout the drama, while 'healing' the audience along with them in the process. Having said that, watching these episodes, it did't feel like someone was asking you to not cry, nor did it feel like they were crying with you, but simply being there next to you while you cried, patiently waiting. In fact, each episode felt like a therapy almost, with its life lessons, moral of the stories and the general atmosphere that it's being created.

This is when I have to mention the OSTs! They were so much more than just some random background music, that it felt like they are part of the story themselves, and belonged along those wonderful cinematography. Their soothing and peaceful characteristic further intensified simple emotions, while simply conveying complicated once.

Here comes the ACTING! The more I say the less it will be, truly! Though everyone was commendable, still allow me to focus on Moon Gang Tae aka Kim Soo Hyun specifically. What a performance! The way he embraced each and every detail of his character so meticulously, that his very gradual character development couldn't be any more convincing. The arc of those changes was so clear that you can recognise what stage the drama is in just by looking how sincere his smile is!

There's just so much meaning to each frame, so many stories and inspiration that can be gathered,
if not, you can just enjoy a beautiful story of a 'wounded' trio, chasing their happiness. Also as we walk through their life, we seem to re-familiarise with aspects of our own!


Ps. the 'fairy tales' narrated in the drama, are real gems!!!

A New KDrama Classic
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ok to Not Be OK‚Äù is nothing that I expected it to be. It‚Äôs a mix of psychological thriller, comedy, romance, and melodrama but with the theme of a beautifully told dark fairytale. There are no magical creatures or supernatural events, but there are 3 unique and memorable characters who make this story feel larger than life. Seo Ye Ji, Kim Soo Hyun, Oh Jung Se give brilliant performances. From the very first episode, when I still wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, all three had character introductions that were epic, and let me know right away that this drama would not disappoint. For all 16 episodes, I remained impressed. These three have such strong chemistry together that any flaws in the story were easily overlooked, and it just kept getting better with each episode.

I‚Äôll start my specific praise for the cast with See Ye Ji as Ko Moon Young. She is perfection in this role down to her flawless outfits and eye glitter. Her sinister smile, soft deep voice, and unapologetic confidence made her likable villainous demeanor seem effortless, but she is just as great at showing vulnerability and pain, and over the top silliness as well. Moon Young might be a controversial choice as a strong female lead, but from her very first scene, I knew she would become one of my all-time favorite KDrama characters. I want to be Ye Ji when I grow up and I‚Äôm already very grown! I also love the idea of a cynical children‚Äôs author. It‚Äôs as if this role was made just for her. I was not familiar with her as a lead before this drama, but now I‚Äôm definitely her fan. She is perfectly matched with Kim Soo Hyun, as Moon Gang Tae. I already loved him in ‚ÄúYou Who Came from the Stars‚Äù where he plays a similar poker-faced and responsible character matched with a strong and unpredictable sexy lead, but in this drama, he gets to show way more range (and be human lol). As Moon Gang Tae he is charming and heartbreaking. I think his matured boyish good looks make him also seem perfectly cast as a young man forced to be responsible at an early age, who is somewhat naive and over his head but also wise beyond his years. I also loved the contrast of him being unsophisticated while she was always fashion-forward and elegant. Their very first moments together are already exciting and super hot without anything happening but close talking and intense looks. I kept calling their specific chemistry ‚Äúsexy dysfunction‚Äù because in real life this super-empath and borderline sociopath match would be toxic AF, but in KDramaland they challenged each other exactly the way they needed to, and I loved rooting for them no matter what. Let‚Äôs also face the fact that they look gorgeous together. Maybe there were too many wrist grabs, but when they are done so well are there really too many? The love story drives this storyline for sure, in many ways, but it‚Äôs really the love story of a trio including Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Te. It‚Äôs hard for me to pick a real favorite out of the three but Oh Jung Se really gave a performance worthy of his own paragraph of praise for sure!

There are a lot of actors who have done a great job playing characters with disabilities or disorders, and I was afraid that his role would just be used to add cheesy melodrama, but I was so wrong. To not award him for this performance would be a serious crime. Sang Tae was the character most likely to make me cry for sure but he was also the character most likely to make me laugh literally out loud and cheer. The brother-bond with Gang Tae warmed and broke my heart so many times. His bonding, rivalry, and banter with Ko Moon Young were some of my favorite moments in the whole drama. In many ways, this character is the glue that makes this story so strong. With a cast this amazing it‚Äôs hard to pick a breakout favorite, but I think anyone who watches will agree that this performance is one of the best in a drama period.

Besides the Main Trio, the rest of the cast is also great, although at times easily overshadowed. One of my favorites, Kim Mi Kyung, is among the cast, and she is always great as some version of the best Mom. She‚Äôs also in another drama I started watching at the same time (‚ÄúWas Is Love?‚Äù) playing a very similar role and I‚Äôm still never tired of seeing her. I loved Gang Tae‚Äôs loyal BFF (so adorkable), The endearing Hospital Director, The Patients, Park Jin Joo being weird and quirky as usual, Gang Young Nam as the head nurse, as well as the amazing younger actors in the flashback scenes‚Ä¶ There are no weak links in the cast, and even seemingly minor characters are important to the story. Kim Joo Heon and Park Kyu Young were also characters I loved although I admit their storyline did feel a little too much like filler at certain points. It‚Äôs hard to say too much without giving something away but none of the problems I had with characters were based on performance. There was a great overall ensemble cast feel that was awesome and didn‚Äôt have to rely on dragging out love triangles or overblown rivalries. For a story with such a heavy fairytale feel it also felt very genuine.

I did give the story a 10 score because I loved it so much, but I admit that some parts could have been stronger. Some of the backstories, I felt, were revealed and resolved too easily. The story does focus more on relationships than details, and I was absolutely satisfied with that. Don‚Äôt get scared off by the psychiatric hospital setting if that‚Äôs not your thing, it‚Äôs more about the characters and their self-discovery, not treatment and many of those parts are relatable and inspiring. I also loved that every episode had a specific fairy tale theme. It was a great way to foreshadow some things without giving anything away. The direction was also so beautifully done, incorporating picturesque scenes, and storybook-style imagery. The direction helped tie all the various genre elements together so seamlessly. I also felt like great care was taken in how even minor scenes were shot. It‚Äôs the director who did ‚ÄúJealousy Incarnate‚Äù, an all-time rewatchable favorite of mine. The way animation was incorporated was so good too, and never overdone. The way the mystery was solved was underwhelming, but the actual ending episode was so moving, bringing earlier images and scenes full circle into the story (I loved the illustrations!). I was afraid that the end would be disappointing but it ended up being better than I even imagined it could be, while still being simple and true to the story. Every question I had wasn‚Äôt answered but the ones that mattered to me were, so everything felt resolved. I was definitely dehydrated from all the happy tears too.

Would I watch this again? Many times. The story is so well told, with characters I already miss, and it probably is a little more entertaining at the start knowing the whole story ahead of time. Since the mystery isn‚Äôt the strongest part of this drama nothing is really lost knowing what comes next, and I can enjoy certain performances in earlier scenes differently. There‚Äôs also plenty of rewindable moments with Soo Hyun and Ye Ji playing so well off of each other. This is one of those dramas that I will end up watching multiple times‚Ä¶ Like Sang Tae watching Dooly. (lol)

The only area I didn‚Äôt give a perfect 10 was music. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the music is great in general and well incorporated, but there was no memorable song that could justify a 10 from me, besides the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù hospital‚Äôs sing-along song which was cute.

Overall this drama easily has become one of my all-time KDrama favorites, which I would have never guessed from the cast and description. This drama definitely deserves its high ratings. If you‚Äôre looking for an original story without necessarily reinventing the drama-wheel, this one qualifies for sure. If you want to fall in love with characters and see them grow and evolve in a satisfying way this drama specializes in that. It‚Äôs not too dark or too lighthearted and has enough elements to please many different drama moods. I laughed and cried so much. I didn‚Äôt know eating porridge could be so emotional or that deer could be so hilarious. I love the themes of choosing your own happiness, defining your own family, and empowerment and freedom through self-expression and self-determination. This drama itself echoes Ko Moon Young‚Äôs perspective on fairytales‚Ä¶ they exist not as escapism but so we can face reality, and like a children‚Äôs fairytale book I wanted to read (or watch) it again as soon as it was done. I rarely give all 10s and this one came extremely close! This is definitely a new KDrama Classic.

Great acting by a blockbuster cast, led down by an underwhelming script.
Oh Jung Se and Seo Ye Ji nailed their roles spectacularly. The focus on mental illness was great but not developed strongly - especially KMY's ASPD - no diagnosis or treatment was even mentioned. Plot was slow and predictable, with not many surprises. The First leads had good chemistry, however, the pacing on of their relationship was too fast - leading to a burn out in the 2nd half of the series. Second leads could also have been developed even further - NJR, JS, LSI etc. Felt that many of these characters didn't really have a 'role' in plot.

Overall, comfortable to watch, great visuals, excellent acting but could have been so much more if the story was more developed and well rounded.

A beautiful K-drama that respectfully explores mental health
This genuinely might be one of the best K-dramas I've seen in a while. The chemistry between all the actors is immense, and that's not to put into question the pure acting ability each of them possessed. Every character in the drama felt genuine and authentic, and not at all forced or downright disrespectful to those who do have such disorders in reality. The romance was beautifully developed, and the relationships between all the characters blossomed in a way that seemed realistic and not rushed. The plotlines were well thought out with little to no plotholes that come to mind; in a way, the story comes full circle and has a fitting ending. Definitely a recommended watch, and arguably the best K-drama of 2020.

What a beautiful journey
So this is my second ever review. Usually I don't feel like I need to share my thoughts on the drama in review form, however this drama was such a journey so I thought that I would share my thoughts. I just want to say that this drama won‚Äôt be everyone's cup of tea, and that's okay. However I hope that in the future more dramas featuring mental health will be made.

Plot:
I will begin with what I loved about the drama. The character growth is probably what I loved the most, especially Moon Youngs growth from being an emotionless ""strong"" person to becoming a more vunerable and starting to feel emotions like emapathy and love. She came out of her shell and the journey to that is beautiful. All three main characters take steps to overcome their trauma with the help of professionals and each other. No matter how many bumps they had to overcome, and believe me there were quite a few, they managed to overcome them all. The whole drama really shined whenever they focused on the characters and the bond between them. The bond between the brothers really stood out, as well as Moon Youngs bond with both bothers. The main theme of the drama is mental health, and they managed to pretty decently depict mental illness in a respectable manner for the most part (minus the mom, but I will get into that later.) Almost no one in the hospital or outside of it was inheriantly evil or good, they were nuances to their characters which really hammered home the theme that: it's okay not to be okay. And as a side note I think I was really impressed by the way they told the story using fairytales and visual details to their advantage. Each episode was titled after a myth, fairytale or folklore, and by each episode's end a lesson was taught using the fairytale. Also the visual storytelling was wonderfully done, as visual details in clothes or hair or items was somehow linked to the fairytale being told. Also the aminations in some episodes *chefs kiss*.

Now my problems with the show: The storyline with the mom. I won‚Äôt spoil it but I felt that the storyline was quite cliche and just lazy writing. It was underdevoloped and I wished they would have left it out, since it didn't really fit into the theme. Also I wished they would have gone more into depth with the therapy plot, but that is just my personal preference, and the way they handled it wasn't bad per say just wanted a bit more depth.

All in all I enjoyed the plot even tho there were some mishaps here and there.

Acting/cast:
10/10. All of the cast did a fantastic job with potraying their characters. Especially Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye-Ji and Oh Jung Se. I am especially impressed by Oh jung se acting. He managed to potray someone with austic spectrum disorder in a very respectable and realistic manner I wanted to highlight that since I feel like he is underrated when compared to Ye-Ji and Soo Hyun. Both of which were absolutley fantastic in their own regard. They could convey so many emotions in their eyes, and my god the chemistry that they had was just amazing (so much sexual tension in those stares.) Seriously their chemistry is off the charts. The supporting cast was also lovley, they were all very natural in their acting. And an extra shoutout to the actor that played Jae Su he nailed the best friend and comic relief character. All in all hats off to the cast they did a fantastic job and was one of the main reasons I enjoyed the show as much as I did.

Music
Amazing. Just amazing. LOVE the ost in this show. Added a few of the songs to my playlist. Every song just fit perfectly into each scene. I am honestly impressed tht they manged to perfectly capture the feel of the show in the ost.

Rewatch value:
Will most definitely watch this masterpiece agian.

A REALISTIC FAIRYTALE
Yes, my review title might seem like an oxymoron, but it is the best way in which I can describe this drama. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, since I quite literally stumbled across it after watching a slew of subpar ‚Äòdrama classics‚Äô. The title intrigued me and I thought: ‚ÄúAlright, this may just be a complete waste of my time or one of the best decisions I have ever made.‚Äù And I‚Äôm so glad that it‚Äôs the latter.

First of all, I adore the format in which this drama is presented to us. Each episode is named after a fairytale of some sort and more often than not it mirrors what the episode is about. It‚Äôs stunningly shot to boot. The first meeting of Gang Tae and Mun Yeong, under those cherry blossoms straight up reminds me of a Disney movie. But don‚Äôt be fooled.

This drama is teetering on that beautiful line between realism and surrealism, by tastefully presenting and discussing themes surrounding mental health in a surrounding and with characters who still make you feel like you‚Äôre a part of their world. Our troublesome trio Gang Tae, Mun Yeong and Sang Tae form a bond that is seldom seen in dramas. A familial bond made through similar pain, understanding and experiences, since they are all outcasts in their own way.

I don‚Äôt have enough praise for the acting. Genuinely, these actors deserve global popularity and recognition for their work here. The way they work off of each other is beautiful to see. Oh Jun-se really blew me away with this role. He‚Äôs a really talented actor and I hope to see him in awesome projects like this one! Seo Ye-ji and Kim Soo-hyun don‚Äôt fall behind either. They are a bomb together, in the best possible way. I‚Äôve seen that Ye-ji is quite self conscious about her voice but I love it, and her. It takes a lot of talent to play a role so different from your personality so convincingly.

This drama is a really dark, twisted delight and I could relate to Mun Yeong more than I‚Äôd like to admit. In fact, there was one scene with her father that seemed like it was outright pulled from my life.

The soundtrack is also beautifully haunting and appropriate. Now for the cons, of which I only really have two. A big one would be the character of Mun Yeong‚Äôs mother and the way she was handled. I would‚Äôve preferred if she wasn‚Äôt even shown fully or if they wanted to show her then it would seem highly appropriate to have Mun Yeong deal with her primarily, instead of having Gang Tae be that resolving link. It was a nonsensical decision in writing which has, so far shown to be exceptional. It is a clunky blip in an otherwise tight storybook. I would‚Äôve also liked to see character development for other characters.

Alas, it is still an amazing body of work and has my GLOWING recommendation. We absolutely need more dramas like this.

very good for episode 1-5 and painful boring for the rest.
Episode 1-5 is very good.
Then suddenly I felt like everything change except the cast.
Its like they change the director, script writer and I almost thought they change the person who subbed!

Its okay to went downhill for a few episodes, but this is totaly extreme downhil.
As Indonesian I will say, keren banget awalnya dan abis itu boring abiss!!!

why? where's the consistency?
what happened?
too many unnecessary draggy scene.

let's not talk about almost not once person other than the cast seen. Hemat budget?
mungkin Kim So hyun budgetnya sudah mahal.

Anyway, of course all the actors acts are excellent.
Too bad thats almost the only thing good.

quite dissapointed.

Nothing can ever fill the void this show has left me with, in the most beautiful way possible.

Out of all the shows I‚Äôve watched, this has left me with the worst post-drama depression ever. I can‚Äôt describe or understand why exactly I am so invested in the characters, ESPECIALLY GANG TAE AND MUN YEONG. Ever since I finished it, my heart aches every time I think about the show. It's like a void that will never be filled. I love it so much and I really hope they somehow renew this for another season, although unlikely. The chemistry between the actors kills me, each scene they‚Äôre together hurts me even if it‚Äôs a happy one. I loved the magical realism and the little details they put into the plot, which just further enhanced the great acting of all the actors. If you‚Äôre planning to watch this, I recommend preparing yourself ‚Äôcause you‚Äôre gonna feel empty for a while after finishing it. Try to not miss anything and dedicate your full attention when watching it ‚Äì that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll enjoy it the most. I don‚Äôt think I have ever shipped a couple so much, the dynamics and their backstories and the way they healed through each other are just perfect. The tension and the stares during those sweet and intimate scenes are what really pushed me off the edge. And of course, the funniest faces and lines at the most unexpected moments. I am 100% sure that this will probably be my favorite k-drama forever, I got so lost in their world and I find myself going back to it every now and then. I find comfort in them and I‚Äôve gotten so used to it all. The familiarity you‚Äôll develop with the show is the best part of everything. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever be the same again, I love the way I feel whenever I watch/think about it, it makes me smile and cry at the same time. My greatest wish is for these two to work together on the same project again, even if it‚Äôs not for a season 2 of IOTNBO.

best drama<3333
so this is my first time writing a review because i really wanted to write one for my fave drama

all i can say is that this is the best drama of 2020 and possibly of all time idk but it's my fave drama since you really can't see these types of storylines in other shows. i thought it would be cliche because i see a lot of dramas with similar plots/synopsis like the ones where the leads heal each other's emotional scars and stuff like that. the thing about iotnbo that sets it apart from other shows is the way they delivered it idk but ye ji's character was really new. the trio's relationship is really wholesome aaaaaaaa they're so cute. i do have to say though that it should've been longer to explain some stuff. anyway seo ye ji kim soo hyun oh jung se best actors<33333

the reason why i'm giving it a perfect score is because it's better than most dramas but plot-wise, i think they missed out on some stuff.

Blows everything else I've seen out of the water - true masterpiece
I have to thank my friend for sending me the trailer of this show before it started. I initially had no desire to see this drama as I thought that the synopsis sounded like something I wouldn't be interesting. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see this. (I even got my husband on board to watch it with me and he fell in love with the show as well.) The music was haunting and Seo Ye Ji's voice was sexy as heck. I'm in. And I'll fully admit that this was so much better than I ever could have expected. The story is one of a kind. There is something for everyone in this show. Drama, Melo, Romance, Comedy, Mystery, and Healing. I laughed and I cried. There was so much heart in this drama - it was so well-written and well-acted. Watching the main trio heal from their trauma touched my heart so much, and I also loved the fairy tale backdrop for the show was well as the episodes themselves.

This was the first time I've watched Seo Ye Ji, but safe to say I am now a fan. She was simply gorgeous as Ko Mun Young. She had times where she was fierce and times where she showed innocence. The acting from all three leads was phenomenal. Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Tae completely stole the show so many times though - he may have been my favorite character of the entire show. All three of them acted their hearts out in this. They all had scenes that drew on my emotions and brought tears to my eyes.
I have to give props to the supporting cast as well. Everyone really did a phenomenal job with this show. I have nothing but praises for all of them.

I've said before that the OST has to be really outstanding for me to take notice because I'm not much on noticing music. This show had one of the best OSTs I've ever heard. (surpasses Goblin and Mr. Sunshine which had been my two previous mentions for best OST.) Janet Suh's In Silence (and I'm Your Psycho), Lee Sun Hyun's In Your Time, Elaine's Wake Up (opening credits), Ga Eun's Got You, Kim Feel's Hallelujah - some of the best tunes from the show.

Best of all, this has been one of the most satisfying endings of any show I've watched lately. It was more than I even hoped for. It was just beautiful all the way around. I've been through a string of great shows with lackluster endings, but this show brought its 'A game' for every episode right up until the final credits of the very last episode (and Netflix even treated us to a final credit blooper reel!)
This show is a definite re-watch.

Overhyped. Overrated
I don‚Äôt understand all the ravings it got from people here. I found the plot twists, character behavior and acting terrible and yes ridiculous. The ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù yelling at each other is ridiculously executed, no feelings, an ill attempt to sound romantic and comical and just contrived like watching a high school drama play. The male lead is supposedly the highest paid actor - oh wow! What a joke. For him to earn so much for such shallow, robotic acting? The female lead portrayal of an anti social is exaggerated, unrealistic and Overdone. This is an over hyped and overrated kdrama and probably rated bec the leads are celebrities. Don‚Äôt waste you time.

Mixture of K-Dramas that we have watched before!!
It feels like it was a mixture of K-dramas that we have watched before The love triangle or square we already watched in Crash landing on you. Also the rigid and blunt lead character of Ms ko was same like we watched as jang man wol in hotel de luna. The chemistry between the couple was same as it was in hotel de Luna. There the guy was trying to stop her from turning into a vengeful ghost and in its okay not to be okay Gang tae was trying to do the same ,trying to control Ms Ko moon.Also the connection from the childhood and tragic incident somehow reminds me of what‚Äôs wrong with secretary kim. So whole time the show kept reminding me of something that I already had watched before. I couldn‚Äôt find anything new besides the autistic brother twist. Also I believe the way they fell in love doesn‚Äôt make you go like they should be together,at many times I didn‚Äôt liked the chemistry or maybe it was written this way . It‚Äôs was just okay story .Also it was soo predictable. Doesn‚Äôt make you wanna got crazy for the next episode. Ending was also predictable.

CRY LIKE A RIVER
i don't know how many times a cried in this drama. Different emotions of crying.... happy tears, sad tears, empathy tears and all kinds of emotions.

and now i'm crying because the show is really over.

My Weekends will never be the same again without It's Okay to Not Be okay.

there are some parts of the story which did not have a clear answer but the ending and the final episode made me forget my questions and just enjoyed the ride with Gang Tae, Sang Tae and moon young.

i love this show so much and i can't believe that it is really over.

Oh Jung-se is so dang good.
It‚Äôs Okay to Not be Okay, wasn‚Äôt really my kind of story, and that‚Äôs okay. Most of the reason I kept watching was to follow the super long reddit threads. The show didn‚Äôt do anything wrong (actually I‚Äôd argue it did very few things wrong); it just never got me. Maybe binge watching would have made me more invested, or maybe it would‚Äôve made things 40 times worse. It‚Äôs not something that I could relate to, although I‚Äôm sure it will speak to a lot of people.

By far the most striking aspect of the show initially was the cinematography. The directing style was vivid, and the sets were beautiful. The tone is this consistent, creepy-ish, melancholy but hopeful vibe. It‚Äôs characterized by a quiet elegance that really works if you‚Äôre in the mood for it. The OST is really great and it fits well with everything else.

The slow plot movement is my real issue. The mysterious aspect of this show didn‚Äôt work for me, and I‚Äôve learned that I need more plot-driven stories. I was never excited to watch the next episode. Every episode could have been the last one, and I wouldn‚Äôt have minded. The ending is ultimately satisfying, but it still leaves some questions unanswered.

However, what this show lacks in plot movement, it makes up for in adorable characters that I loved watching. The whole supporting cast is hilarious, and although it isn‚Äôt exactly a comedy, it makes you laugh at the right moments. And it makes you cry too. The main leads never got my heart, but I still feel like I‚Äôve gone on a journey with these characters.

The Main Cast:

Kim Soo-hyun was the reason everybody started watching, and the man is really talented, I‚Äôll admit. He somehow always has me on his side, even when I couldn‚Äôt relate to him. The chemistry between him and Seo Ye-ji was really great too. I don‚Äôt have a lot to say about Seo Ye-ji, but I think she was well cast for this part.

For me, Oh Jung-se was the star of this show and the reason to keep watching. I had a huge soft spot for his character, and I thought he did an amazing job bringing Moon Sang-tae to life. You could see him really becoming Sang-tae in everything from his face to the way he held himself. I‚Äôm a new fan. I‚Äôll watch anything he does now.

Supporting Cast/Characters:

I really loved Jae-soo (Kang Gi-doong). I loved his character, and I thought the performance was great. I wish he got more of a spotlight in this story, but he stole the scenes he was in.

I always love Kim Mi-kyung, and I liked her here too. She‚Äôs the best mom.

Lee Sang-in (Kim Joo-heon) and Yoo Seung-jae (Park Jin-joo) made a great pair. Their scenes together and apart were always hilarious. I‚Äôve got my eye on Park Jin-joo now, and I hope she gets more prominent roles in the future.

The OK Hospital people were also a nice big family. Some standouts were Kim Chang-wan as the hospital director and patients Kan Pil-wong (Kim Ki-cheon) and Joo Jung-tae (Jung Jae-kwang).

Oh also the child actors were good. Yeah I don‚Äôt have anything bad to say here really. Great cast all around.

2020's best Korean drama & masterpiece bar none.
What can I say about this masterpiece that hasn't been said by many already? I'll do my best but I don't think I can fully give this drama the justice it deserves with my tiny review lol but I'll try, so here goes.

Everything about the drama was perfect, the acting, the story line, the setting, the characters, and especially the life lessons it taught us and the emotions it made us feel. I feel like we learned so much thru the 3 main characters:

Kangtae- It's okay to hide emotions when it's necessary to protect & look after someone who is loved. But never to the point that your own identity is lost & you don't know who you are anymore. Where being a robot, becomes your daily routine especially when there's feelings of obligation and guilt in your need to look after someone. It's better to be true to yourself, be honest with your feelings and those you love and never, never lose yourself because the most important thing is loving yourself and being happy.

Munyeong- It's okay to be a little psycho because it's your way of dealing with a traumatizing experience & protecting yourself. But, never let the pain of the past eat you up to the point of becoming too secluded or evil. It's always better to. turn the pain in to something productive to keep that light inside of you going abd be true to yourself. Be helping others find themselves, you can find yourself too + happiness.

Sangtae-It's okay to be different and want everyone's attention . But even if your different never give up on becoming stronger, better and learn how to look after yourself. It's never okay to demand way too much of someone because that can eat away at someone else's happiness. Strive to learn how to do things by yourself if it can be done to make yourself happy and those around you too. + family is not just blood but people who are loved by you. Ps. I think his growth was one of the best of the series, him letting his little brother go at the end????? *tears.

I felt so much thru the characters everything they experienced I did too.

All of the cast shone, I love how Seo Ye-Ji was able to turn her emotions of and on on a whim. She was so good as MY that I sometimes forgot I was watching a fictional character rather than an actual person. This was Kim Soo-Hyun's strongest role yet IMO. His crying scenes broke my heart so many times. And Oh Jung Se stole the show with his incredible acting, I forgot that he isn't actually autistic in real life. That's how good he was. He definitely deserves all the awards for this role.

The story could be quite dark at times esp with the murder of the Moon brother's mother and Munyeoung's emotional/physical abuse by her parents. BUT it also had this warmth to it, watching these characters stand up again and achieve their own much needed emotional growth and happiness was breathtaking. They all saved each other and helped one another heal. If it hadn't been for MunYeong the Moon Brother's wouldn't have healed from their past feelings of hatred, guilt, anger and obligation. If it hadn't been for the Moon Brothers MY wouldn't have known that she was worth being in a family and being happy. Because of each other past pain was forgotten and healing began.

Aside from the love story I think the other biggest, strongest point in the series was the love and bond between Sangtae and Kangtae. it was as equally important and we saw all their ups and downs. How they became healthy in the end to become stronger in the end and learn to live life separately in the end. The writers did an excellent job in telling these stories never missing a beat and making us feel everything.

The chemistry between the 3 main actors was amazing, I'd love to see them working together again. If it happens and it's soon then even better. The supporting cast was also amazing. I loved all the supporting characters they all had their merits and were equally important to the story and the main characters personal growth.

The soundtrack was amazing! Every song was picked perfectly and fir the tone of the scenes were it was used very well. I don't think there's a song I disliked in the OST.

Overall 10/10 I'd give this higher if I could because it deserves it. Will I be rewatching this??? You bet! One of my top favorite dramas for sure!

Phew this was long lmao. I guess I had a lot to say. But yeah, if you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favor and do. It's worth it.

Seeing Gang Tae smiling fills my heart with happiness.
Music : 100000/10 The OST correctly reflects this kdrama. I bet after ÏÇ¨Ïù¥ÏΩîÏßÄÎßå Í¥úÏ∞ÆÏïÑ ends the songs will send us to the story, emotions. Ìó§Ïù¥Ï¶à, Í∞¨ÍπÄ, AKMU and other artists thank you very much.
Rewatch value: I think 16 episodes is enough to close the action,because from episode to episode the plot is developing very well. Moreover one episode has more than 60 minutes. So far 8Ìôî Î∞©ÏÜ° has had the longest duration-1h 15min.46 seconds.
Overall, everyone this is the kdrama that we all have been waiting for. The drama that has been desired by many of us. Powerful romance, charming eyes, desire, psychological aspects, some funny scenes, and well performed characters! ‚ô•‚ô•

BEST KDRAMA of 2020
This is my first time writing a review.

I just want to say that i really love this show. The casts really did a good job portraying their roles especially Sang Tae, Moon Young and Gang Tae. The cinematography of this series is like a movie. Truly world class!



I'm just so proud that i watched this show while it's on air and reading all the comments here every week.




It's been a good ride!







Thank you IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY!

It's OK - or not - to be all over the place
Park JinJoo's character made an ominous statement: ""a developmentally challenged illustrator working with an emotionally challenged writer will either be a huge success or a colossal fiasco"".
The latter turned out to materialize.
The plot is a mess, and I highly praise the actors for being able to survive it.
Personally I hated the clothing of the FL, though I understand that other people may have loved it (apparently it's expen$ive stuff).
Not everything is a disaster, though. Here and there the author shows that she can - perhaps if she wants and/or perhaps with more experience - do good stuff. For instance, in the early episodes there were some interesting events, like the woman wanting the guy and thinking she is holding him in her hand. It was very well done.

A healing drama
Pros:
A healing drama for sure, it'll definitely be missed. Every single detail had so much dedication. I knew I'd like this drama but I didn't know it would be one of the best ones I've watched so far. Everyone who was involved made this one a masterpiece. This drama isn't for everyone but if you need some warmth in your heart you'll enjoy watching it. Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se had an amazing chemistry as the main trio. I've lost the count of how many times I smiled, laughed and cried during the episodes. Oh Jung Se deserves awards for his breathtaking acting, he was so perfect. OST, acting, cinematography, fashion, production: all on point so I fell in love instantly. They used a lot of transitions for the first half of the show, it was really cool. I also liked the way they showed the audience how was the world through the patient's own eyes. There were times I'd feel their pain and got emotional because it was too heartbreaking. The character development was superb. The haunted castle matched Mun Yeong's mood and they also incorporated the fairy tales well. I appreciate all those great pieces of advice: they gave us many motivational, warm, inspirational and realistic quotes. So many life lessons to think about. I had so much fun reading and making theories week after week, it was very entertaining. (SPOILER) I liked that they gave new perspectives to almost everyone. They could follow their path allowing themselves to be happy somehow. All those patients had new beginnings as well, they deserved it a lot. The long dreamed trip happened and it was amazing!

Cons (SPOILER):
I'd like to point out some things. Episodes 14-15 seemed like a roller coaster of things all happening at the same time. They didn't explain how her mom survived, so what really happened? All of it was her father's disturbed vision? If not how did she escape from the haunted castle?

Aside from this it was a special drama worth watching so I'd definitely recommend it! I will miss the trio and the drama itself, really. Cast, crew, writer, director they need to be praised for the beautiful and memorable work they have done ‚ô°

I enjoyed, the casts were amazing with their roles.
I hyped this drama too much? I really looked forward to this since it's been a while after YeJi's last drama. I was really okay with writer MunYoung, I love the side stories in every episode (especially the early ones). But I guess they lost track with the real plot of MunYoung's mom towards the end? I can't really say that it was rushed, but definitely not the Mom story I was expecting. I mean the depth, I was looking for something in depth with MunYoung's mom and how she turned out to be such.
Anyway, I guess they decided to focus more on the 'lovestory arc' with GangTae. With such, I guess that's where some 'explanatory time' for MunYoung's mom were lost. If everyone's gotten into the ship with MunYoung and GangTae, I'm totally fine with it. Just that I'm the type who wouldn't expect much from MunYoung-GangTae cause it was really established since the start that they will end up with each other no matter what. I was just really curious with the plot and circumstances leading to their healing. Saying that, I looked for much more meat in the psychology part of the plot.
But don't get me wrong, everyone did amazing, especially SangTae (Oh Jung Se)!

The masterpiece of 2020
What to start with?

This is perfection for me! This drama is one of those that didn't let me sleep. Amazing story, acting, OST, dialogues between the characters. There is nothing more. Everything is wonderful! I will miss the main trio very, very much.

Of course, it's not for everyone, like every drama. It's very different from other dramas. Chemistry among the main leads is no joke. If you don't like psychological series, just don't watch it (or watch it and you will start like psychological series: ') )

I will come back to this often and it will stay forever in my top 5 favorite dramas. ‚ô•

It's Okay for a Show to Be Overhyped
I did not start this drama right away for three reasons: (1) It was incredibly over-hyped (2) It sounded like some flimsy self-help drama with no real substance and (3) I was sick seeing romanticized psychiatric themes as plot tools.

Once I actually started the show, it completely blew through any doubt I may have had for starting it. I struggled with shortening this review because I practically had written an entire essay for why this show was amazing. If you don't want to read the full review, just read the very last paragraph.

The artistry ALONE is enough to enjoy the show and I found myself sucked in within literally the first 30 seconds due to the beautiful stop motion-like animation in the beginning and the enrapturing script. They used the FL's children's books as themes for each episode and echoed messages of books she had written or common fairytales (such as The Ugly Duckling) to depict the lessons the characters were learning in that particular episode. What I loved was that those lessons weren't too in-your-face and unnecessarily repeated to emphasize the genius of the writing; they were quietly woven into the story and addressed head-on for only a few scenes. I think rewatching this show would be so rewarding to explore the motifs and goals of these messages that likely would have been missed on a first watch.

Honestly, the character development is another reason on it's own as well. Though Mun-Yeong is such a captivating character and probably everyone's favorite, the center of all of this for me was Gang-Tae. Kim Soo Hyun did such a spectacular job with this character and clearly spent a lot of time thinking about Gang-Tae‚Äôs motivations. If you check out the BTS footage, he is excitedly talking with the director about where and how he should stand, how he should say a certain line and trying his best to stay calm around Ye Ji in order to act properly (major uwus). He is the experienced actor we needed to bring life to Gang-Tae.

Seo Ye Ji was the only one who I could have ever seen as Mun-Yeong. Her lower, raspy voice with her killer visuals and beautiful yet creepy smile made me fall in love with her and her character. Make no mistake, her character is deeply messed up. I don't know if anti-social personality disorder makes you have sociopathic tendencies like she does but it makes her character all the more compelling. Think of a witch standing at the edge of a forest adorned head-to-toe in the most luxurious clothing, piercing eyes painted with makeup and a smile as sharp as a knife. The typical kind-hearted, princess that can bring out the best in people is instead pushed aside as our second lead. What. A. Power. Move. This writer understands women and what they want and has created the ideal FL character for us from that understanding. ALSO HER FASHION?!?! She and Man Wol from Hotel Del Luna could have a full on fashion battle.

I‚Äôll be honest, when I saw the title and description, I thought it was going to be some flimsy self-help drama with romanticized psychiatry themes added for pure aesthetic. And I still do believe some of the mental disorders were breezed over or not 100% accurately portrayed, but considering it is a form of entertainment, any production with psychiatry themes is unlikely to be 100% accurate. Even the Korean title: ‚ÄúPsycho, but it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite seem very friendly towards those with mental disorders. But we could perhaps call it a step towards the right direction.

Oh Jung Se (second ML: Sang-Tae) said that he learned a lot while playing his role and spoke in interviews about what he had learned - namely that individuals do not ‚Äòsuffer‚Äô from autism, it is the way that they are born and they are as perceptive and deserving of respect as any other person. The writers could have used Sang-Tae's autism as an excuse to not give him character development, but they didn't and dove into making him a full-fledged character. I love Sang-Tae. I love him so much. The two brothers (Gang-Tae and Sang-Tae) are truly incomplete without each other and I would argue that the main couple of the show is also incomplete without him. If you watch the show you'll understand what I mean.

Incredible artistry and cinematography, well thought-out character development, a great plot with an unpredictable climax and oscar-worthy acting is how I would describe It's Okay Not to Be Okay. Whether you are looking for something healing, something romantic, something that takes a step towards depicting mental illness on screen in a slightly better way or just a good story, this show will deliver. Give it a go.

Strong opening but it all goes down-hill
*THE GOOD*

1) Excellent opening - after seeing a huge hype for this show and knowing the ML as Kim Soo Hyun, I was ready to stay invested in this one. The first few episodes did a real good job to pull you in. We get an unexpected Coraline-like storybook intro, setting the mood and backstory of the series. Although it took more than a few episodes for the show to connect with this, it was great foreshadowing for what's to come.

2) The FL entrance was fantastic! - her character was just gleaming of charisma and power. She was someone who's unafraid to speak their mind loudly, confidently go after what they want, and no one is able to stop them. More interestingly, we got to see very quickly, that even someone as strong and charismatic can be vulnerable to their own demons at night. I ended up binge watching the entire first half of the show purely because of how much I enjoyed her character.

3) Fairytale motifs & theming - unique to the show, each episode tries to connect its developing plot towards a message or lines from a fairytale story. This is a fun and flavorful touch. These references are often done as a background monologue with the voice and interpretation of the FL, which makes sense considering she is a writer in this drama setting. These ""monologues"" provided more opportunities for us to learn and understand her character, she always has a very distinctive way of interpreting things. And as we listen each episode, it's almost like we were a part of the drama casted as her fans, listening to her character telling the stories. These little motifs came a long way to push forward the whimsical mood the drama has. In fact... the entire drama almost felt like one big fairytale story.

4) Sang-Tae, the brother - his acting was very accurate and realistic coming from someone who dormed with an autistic person in the past. Specifically his facial expressions, when he was angry or scared or felt guilty, you could see the emotions and even the awkwardness from his face - the acting really was brilliant. Later on, we also see this character develop in various ways and the way that everything was done is believable. This was a difficult role and Mr. Oh Jung Se (name of the actual actor) nailed it!

*THE BAD*

1) The FL character changed completely? but also just made no sense - I was surprised no other reviews mentions this but there is something inconsistent about Moon Young's character. Perhaps it's just an oversight on my part but after her character visits the mental hospital, her character started to develop from being a strong, charismatic person to someone who just whines and nags all the time. In the beginning, we see her approaching Gang-Tae, every time expressing her desires to be with him. When he rejects her, she moves on and minds her own business. But later on, she just gives up her whole career almost to chase after this dude, essentially forcing him to be with her by taking advantage or manipulating his ill brother. Now, I understand that every person is vulnerable in some ways and she re-living her childhood traumas may have contributed to this but even so, her character development just felt unnatural. if she was that deeply traumatized, why would she ever go back to that place? In my opinion, a more appropriate plot would be that after seeing Gang-Tae pushing her away on episode 2-3, she should just be back in Seoul the next day to work her business. Even the way she talks changed! I actually confirmed the difference re-watching some of the first two episodes.

2) Slow burn is slow - the progression of this drama is... painfully slow. The entire drama is just a push and pull between the two leads, even after accepted each other, has these little fights and don't much other than to prolong the series. After 12 episodes of using the same cards, it just got old.

3) Out of the blue couple pairing and filters - this point kinda goes into the last one but for some reason, the CEO of the publishing company that managed Moon Young quits his position to pursue this random nurse in a mental institution (forgive me, she's not a random character) but the plot here just makes no sense. Despite having zero chemistry, these two pairing together also didn't add anything to the main plot. There was also an episode that focused two of the patients from institution ending up as a couple, but they again, do not add anything to the main story, I am just confused why so much focus are added to these side characters. The series could have easily done in 10 episodes otherwise.

4) Even more ridiculous, the return of a dead villain trope - So this is current arc I am watching (episode 13) and honestly at this point, it's really difficult to watch this. They are setting up the stage for clear showdown of our main characters fighting against this mother that supposedly was the one that murdered the ML's mother?! Like the plot just enter the ridiculous category and at this point, just wish the series would end.

*I will be editing this review after completing it* but in summary, the story is really disappointing for me. The only scenes worth watching being the first few bits.

Was promising, but ultimately fell flat and held onto surface level issues
As someone with a brother on the ASD spectrum and who works in healthcare, I had a lot of hope going in. I was recommended the drama by a friend who also has a brother with ASD, otherwise I wasn't too intrigued by the drama's trailer or plot.

The drama, while it isn't the most pretentious thing I've ever seen, fails to deliver a plot which viewers will find engaging. I appreciate its more toned down approach to look into healing and bring awareness to mental illnesses and disabilities like ASD, but I think it fails in all other departments. I also think the relationship feels extremely contrived and is too sudden for me to take it seriously, especially because it leans on toxic: why must these two end up together when they have so many issues they need to work on? Sure, there is understanding between the two, but I wish there was a more organic growth shown.

Given how long these episodes were, I thought we would see a richer look into the psyche of individual characters, but instead we got surface level pretentious-ness and some mediocre comedy. There was so much potential for these characters given the production and cast, but it all fell flat which is a shame. I did like Oh Jung Se's portrayal of ASD though, so I will have to give him that. I failed to find any other characters as endearing, except perhaps the female lead, although at times she felt like a contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian, and not really rooted in the feelings of a real person.

Also, the pacing of this drama is very off. Some episodes feel like pure filler, and the mystery in the drama is poorly placed. I even forgot there was a mystery, because it would take so many episodes to come back to it.

I thought the first few episodes were great but it went downhill from there. It's unfortunate but I cannot continue to waste more hours of my life on this disappointment, so I'll have to drop it at episode 11. It just isn't worth it for me.

This drama is not okay, actually it‚Äôs pretty bad.

This is it, this is the drama that was haunting me throughout this year. It was appearing in various lists and countdowns, it showed on My Drama List more that I can count and it was constantly in my recommended section on Netflix. So I‚Äôve finally decided to watch it. And honestly guys, I‚Äôm not impressed.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is beautifully filmed drama with an amazing cast. But this is just so not enough for me to call it the greatest drama of this year.
Let‚Äôs start from the goodies.

Cinematic
Not gonna lie, that was one of the most beautifully filmed drama that I‚Äôve watched. Both live action and animations were just stunning. Add to this beautiful sets and costumes and you have true eye candy of a series.

Acting
I‚Äôm gonna quickly brush past two leads and leave them for later. Because the true star here is Oh Jung Se playing Moon Sang Tae. I‚Äôve seen him before in Touch Your Heart, but here in It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay he shown his acting skills to the fullest. And the role he was given was very difficult and it was very easy to overdo it. That‚Äôs why I think that his win of this years Baeksang Award for the best supporting actor was fully deserved,

Music
Nothing to add here. Music was very fitting and memorable. I‚Äôm sure I have some songs on my playlist. Overall I can say that this drama is very ecstatically pleasing.
But now we get to the more problematic part.

The baddies

Acting
I said some good things about acting of Oh Jung Se and now let‚Äôs talk about main actors.
I‚Äôve already seen Kim Soo Hyun and Se Ye Ji in other dramas and I really don‚Äôt have anything against their acting. It‚Äôs just that they haven‚Äôt shown anything new here. I felt in some moments that Kim Soo Hyun is just playing again his character from My Love From the Stars. The spoke with the same monotonous voice with close to non facial expression. It may be the similarity of both roles but it still bothered me from the very beginning. It wasn‚Äôt too bothersome but in drama so praised and for drama with actors so well known, I guess it shouldn‚Äôt happen. I know that both actors didn‚Äôt have easy characters to play, but it just didn‚Äôt worked for me. Especially taking under consideration fact that I had so much problems with characters themselves.
With Se Ye Ji, I found her character so uninteresting that I can‚Äôt really say a lot about her acting.

Characters
Talking about it. I‚Äôve read many opinions defending Ko Moon Young for her behaviour. But for me that was just a show of toxic relationship and the way it ended it totally not understandable for me especially that their relationship for the most part was simply abusive. Amongst other things Ko Moon Young was blackmailing Moon Gang Tae using his brother but also threatening him to drive off the pier if he will not agree to spend the night with her. And at this point in my opinion her behaviour cannot be just simply justified by her sad past. And what really annoyed my at some point is that we were slowly being convinced that your past can be an excuse for the bad behaviour. Ko Moon Young was mistreated by her mother so not she can mistreat Gang Tae who should feel bad for her and support her all the way. This is straight up toxic relationship and shouldn‚Äôt be romanticised.

Plot
Or really lack thereof. I understand that really the relationship of the two main characters should be the plot but I think it‚Äôs just not enough. Of course there was some additional events, but they somehow just came and went away without really much impact on the action. And the pace was incredibly slow, and I think this was what really killed my interest in this series. I swear it felt as if some of the episodes consisted only with main characters staring themselves in the eyes in slow motion.

At the end I‚Äôve figured out that I just don‚Äôt care about the main characters. There was nothing about them to see them as sympathetic of even interesting. So I just simply didn‚Äôt care what happens to them. This series in my eyes was saved by great production and some background characters. Not enough for me to call it great drama.

A Good Drama‚Ä¶But Unfortunately Just Not My Cup of Tea ><
I was eager to watch this with thrill and excitement especially since it was dealing with psychological aspects and mental health!! Finally seeing Kim Soo Hyun back in action, I was overjoyed only to be underwhelmed by the end >< I really loved the first 6 episodes and was intrigued with how the story would unfold. But as the episodes went on‚Ä¶I felt less and less invested in this show and ending up getting bored. Honestly I wish I knew before hand how slow paced this drama was‚Ä¶slow burning shows are definitely not for me‚Ä¶you have to go into this with a lot of patience and focus especially if you are not one who likes these type of dramas!! A lot scenes felt way too excessive for my liking, and just dragged throughout the episodes where I was tempted to just watch it in fast forward mode. I personally dont think the episodes even needed to be this long and couldve made it more concise‚Ä¶

I think Ye Ji did a fantastic job in playing an antisocial personality disorder, however idk if I could find her character personally likable?? Not sure if she was suppose to be likable from the start or if we were suppose to empathize with her and grow to like her as she started to show character development. She was definitely amusing and I enjoyed her in the first few episodes‚Ä¶however the fact that she had manipulative and possessive traits really rubbed me the wrong way‚Ä¶like the stuff that came out of her mouth towards Gang Tae with no hesitation & how he just shrugged or laughed at it half of the time‚Ä¶im perplexed‚Ä¶those are not things that you should take lightly or in a joking matter?? And her having no problem just screaming what could be deemed as inappropriate in public situations is really unsettling‚Ä¶But I am glad that we got to see her grow by the end of the series; having emotions and caring for others besides herself and putting their needs before her own.

Their ‚Äúlove story‚Äù still has me not fully convinced because I cant figure out how or why it started?? It just seemed pretty rushed without any motives of why they fell for each other as kids and somehow that infatuation stayed with them all these years‚Ä¶Its easy to understand why their love grew for each other when their paths crossed again because they were each others safe haven, someone to understand them and give them support. They undoubtedly have amazing chemistry but I had just hoped for a more tangible idea and reasoning behind their attraction??

Gang Tae‚Äôs irrational behaviors half the time whenever it dealt with Moon Young became frustrating‚Ä¶.especially when he stayed to protect her‚Ä¶while checking up with Sang Tae via phone calls‚Ä¶.like what?? all three should've been together in order to make sure they are all safe especially when a dangerous person is out for them‚Ä¶The whole situation was a mess, the communication was nonexistent when there should've been more awareness and caution towards that situation. And I wish there was more detail about Moon Young's mother‚Ä¶I felt like theres still missing pieces to it that Im still pretty curious about but was never touched upon‚Ä¶

All and all, setting aside some of the cons for me, I do want to applaud some pros that I saw throughout the show that I really loved and appreciated!! The OST and overall aesthetics of the show were really beautiful and one of my favorite aspects to the drama, it really embodied the mood of the drama. The way the director/writer integrated the fairy tale story illustrations with thought provoking messages to further emphasize these serious topics but also keep it somewhat lighthearted I think created a nice balance. And like many others have said‚Ä¶but just to re-emphasize‚Ä¶Oh Jung Se‚Äôs portrayal of Sang Tae was ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!! To really understand and delve into his character and its accuracy was so natural and believable, he ended up being one of my favorite characters by the end of the show and really became the sole reason that kept me interested throughout these episodes! His maturity and growth as an individual and his mindset during the last half of the show was sooo heartwarming and beautiful. Im so proud of him and to see his journey of overcoming his trauma; he literally deserves the world and all the happiness. I also loved the Head Doctor of Ok Psychiatric Hospital, he was soo funny and just a great person!! He really cared about his patients and treated them like a family! Honestly everyone did a great job in their portrayals especially the actors/actresses that suffered through trauma or other mental illnesses and to see them tackle their traumas/issues. You can really empathize with each and every one of them and understand where they are coming from. And the ending was very sweet and beautiful, I LOVED IT!! The dialogue at the end wrapped up the story very nicely! Overall the story was good but its not something that gave me a lasting impression‚Ä¶

Could not stop whining!
I watched this drama as soon as it was out ... and what a disappointment.
I understand, due to its uniqueness, why lot of people liked it, though. And its approach on mental illness that is a trendy subject nowadays. But the story is lacking a lot, using FL's ASPD (Anti-Social Personality Disorder) and Moon Sang-tae (Gang-Tae‚Äôs older brother), Autism Spectrum Disorder as main sources for the plot. I absolutely loved Oh Jung-Se in his role, what a fabulous actor. He succeeded to portrait his character with Autism brilliantly. On the contrary, i did not like Seo Yae-Ji in her role. I found that the ASPD was not well conveyed, and her character ended up being a spoiled brat rather who acts recklessly and do not care about anyone but her, rather than a complex character with sociopath tendencies who would have had therapy and gone under medication for her personality disorder.
Finally, ML's character is this understanding and patient young man who raised his brother, feeling guilty about their past .... who ends up loving the FL as a freedom from the trap that his life is. Yet, it looks like more a Stockholm syndrome.

We understand that the FL and ML are safety pins for each other ... but are they, really ? The morale of the story is that 2 people who love each other can save each other ..... and in this specific story i did not like this fairy tale ending while the main plot was about realistic mental illness. Love can't treat ASPD ... and i felt that if you have to imagine the rest of their lives together ... it will be 2 lives completely ruined. Or was it the morale of the story ? That love can be this stupid sometimes, that people will ruin each other in name of Love ?
But again, i loved Sang Tae character and ending. While people with autism have a hard time to distinguish nuances, yet he succeeded to understand what his brother was lacking and wanted. As a big brother, he only wants to protect his young brother. His character is full of charms and emotions.

Now the fairy tale components and the outfits of Yae-Ji are both beautiful, but it was not enough to make me fall for the Main characters or the story overall. At the end, this drama just did not deliver for me !

A characters journey that touches the heart.
The premise of this show is something I would normally never watch. I mostly gravitate to dramas with a thick plot that evolves overtime and so I have been mostly watching Chinese historical dramas. I only started this drama out of pure boredom, the gorgeousness of the leads, and some reviewers claiming that they have explosive chemistry. I am a sucker for believable romance. I didn't really expect much and was ready to drop it after the first episode...........but boy was I wrong. It gave me everything I never knew I wanted.

It is a character-centric show. 98% of the characters get a moment to shine and have a story told from their life. All the stories were explored with great care and respect. No judgment or prejudice. This is especially important since the show include patients in a psychiatric hospital. They are shown as people who were shaped by their past experiences and have their own motiivation. There are none of the usual cardboard cut-outs who are only there to make the leads look good or move the plot in a certain direction and then forgotten the next episode. They are tangible people who makes the world of the drama that much more real and relatable. This exploration is most especially thorough for the three leads Moon-Young, Gang-Tae and Sang-Tae that by the end of the show they all felt like family. I have become absolutely invested in finding and giving them all the happiness they deserved and more. They are not some unreachable fictional characters but friends who have taught me so much about life and happiness. The writer did excellent work. The story might not have been perfect but at least she wrote some of the most amazing set of characters I have ever seen. However, this would not have worked so well if the actors didn't fully bring those characters to life.

All the actors were absolutely brilliant. Oh Jung Se, Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji really elevated their characters so much so that it's impossible to see anyone else play their roles. They are the dream team. They really transformed and lived their character's lives for 16 episodes. They all have excellent natural chemistry. The brothers truly felt like they have known each other their whole lives. The main couple is also so unbelievably made for each other. The first time I saw them together on one scene I just couldn't believe they exist. How are they even real? Everything fits. Everything match. Divine intervention definitely made these two people find each other. The rest of the cast were also outstanding. The casting director was certainly touched by magic. They managed to find actors who can believably express different aspects of their character. My feelings and thoughts for each character continuously underwent changes throughout the episodes. Just when I thought I figured them out, I'm pleasantly surprised to be wrong. This was especially effective due to the excellent production and direction.

The production took great care in making the world and characters look real through the setting, props, and clothes. The fairytale aspect was truly expressed with the continuous use of illustrated stories in conjunction with the plot for each episode. It truly enhanced and made the storytelling much more interesting. I want to get each of those books to read over and over again. Each clothes were used for a reason. Each OST were chosen and added to each scene for maximum effect. Each scene were also shot in a particular way to evoke a certain feeling, message, or symbolism. There are plenty of moments without dialogue. There are just so many little details that rewatching each episode is just as worthwhile as the first time.

There are still some kdrama tropes but they are mostly used with a proper build-up and reason. The most wonderful change is that everyone in this show chooses to talk to each other. Misunderstandings only occur for a moment and never dragged on for a couple of episodes. These talks produced some of the most thoughtful, evocative, and eye-opening conversations that relate to real life. Things that people have certainly thought about but not spoken out loud.

This show is all about presenting the heart of its characters. There is really no big evil villain to defeat (contrary to some opinion) or epic journey to unfold. Its plot have holes. The characters barely go anywhere. But still it takes the viewer through the journey of self-discovery about what is really important. It certainly helped me see myself in a new perspective.

I think it's best to start watching with no expectation. Hopefully.....you can be just as pleasantly surprised as I was with how much I have fallen in love with this show ‚ô°

I can't go on enough about how much I adored this drama. The premise, an autistic older brother being taken care of by his younger brother and their connection to a troubled author, had me curious.
Not only was the story beautiful, watching each character grow, mature, and *heal* but the actors were spectacular. I think that the drama would not have been nearly as fantastic without this cast - their dynamics and chemistry really perfected the scenes.
Seo Ye Ji was just as incredible as she has been in all the other dramas I've seen her in, but I was still very impressed by her wholehearted performance. Playing such an initially cold-hearted and stoic character is no easy feat that she pulled off perfectly.
Kim Soo Hyun made an exceptionally strong comeback with this drama being his first since coming back from the military. His acting brought tears to my eyes and induced goosebumps. He's also particularly beautiful, so win-win! :D
Oh Jung Se was also spectacular in his own right, though it was very odd to see him play such a unique character. Having 1st hand experience with autistic individuals, I can confidently say that he portrayed Moon Sang Tae masterfully. And he portrayed his growth in such a realistic and raw fashion - he too brought tears to my eyes numerous times.
Honestly, all the actors were absolute perfection, elevating this drama to the level of ""masterpiece.""

While the OST is really exquisite and the song placement is perfectly executed, the songs themselves are not my absolute, hands down, favorite ever. The songs are a bit eerie and sad, yet harmonious and calm (for the most part) - there's nothing objectively wrong with any of them, and the OST really is beautiful, but it's just not my 100% #1 favorite. Still exquisite though! ^-^

***SPOILER BELOW***
The only thing I do have a gripe about was how Ko Mun Young's mother survived that fall AND drowning to continue to terrorize Ko Mun Young 20 years later. I just have a really hard time buying this part of the plot. I think the writers were trying to mislead viewers to think the mother *couldn't* have survived for greater impact when we found out that indeed she did survive and she was right under their nose the whole time. But the medical and logical side of my brain is twitching at this plot device. :P
***END SPOILER****

Fortunately, the above-mentioned plot issue I have does not bring down the overall drama because everything else was so perfect. I will say though, be prepared for your mind to run wild with plot theories while watching the drama. There are so many clues, many of which are purposefully misleading where you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure it all out. Now that all the episodes are released, do yourself a favor and go ahead and dedicate about 18.5 hours to binge watch the entire thing!

Overall, It's Okay to Not Be Okay is not your typical drama - it's super quirky and the character's and their lives are very unique to this story. But it has so many things that the average viewer can sympathize with and it just overall pulls at your heartstrings (and the chemistry is ON POINT) - not just the main characters, but the equally well-written side characters and their stories too. You can't help but be enthralled by their stories and it's quirkiness. The love story between Ko Mun Young and Moon Gang Tae that developed through their own healing was real and stunning. And watching Moon Sang Tae's metamorphosis, going from being child-like to a true older brother and adult (while keeping his character true to his autism) was magnificent. And witnessing them all become a healed family was extraordinary.

I have already watched this drama about 3 times (I rewatched each episode at least twice while it was airing because I just couldn't get enough) and I will most definitely be rewatching it again. If you're not sure about watching, give the first 2 episodes a try - I'm confident that that's all it'll take to suck you in. ^-^

This drama is amazing not because of the main leads but because every episode is a life lesson itself .This drama showed me that how there can be deepest secrets and moral hidden even in children books. for example how in cinderella the step sisters even go as far as to cut their foot to fit it in the glass slipper this thing totally reflects how scary greed can be . But i don't think any child might have paid any attention to this. the thing that they see is how cinderella met prince and live happily ever after . So for whom this lesson was actually ? we call these books fairy tales but in actual they are life lessons . This drama tells you that children's books can also reflect the evil desires of people out there. So, if you think this is just a normal romance drama then you are totally wrong this drama will open your eyes.

SO, STOP THINKING AND JUST WATCH IT !!!!

Great first half
The first half of the series was interesting and addictive but the second half of the story was lazy and the writers tried to squeeze in as many tropes as possible. I assume the writers are trying to normalise mental health and encourage mental health discussions by making it as palatable to the general public as possible. Nevertheless, I enjoyed binge watching the series over the weekend and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent series to watch.
Pros
- Sang Tae. My favourite character in this series. A fully realised and inspiring character played with sensitivity.
- Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun. They really immersed themselves into their characters and I cried for their characters several times. And they are very good looking which enhanced my viewing experience. Good chemistry. Would have loved a few more kissing scenes.
- The OST.

Cons
- The villain. Unnecessary.
- side characters were more like plot devices. I want backstory.
- the unoriginal weepy mess in the second half. Why do Korean melodramas all have the same storyline?
- the depiction of KMY and MGT‚Äôs relationship/courtship is problematic to me. I say this based on my experience with someone with a personality disorder.

A Very Heart-warming Fairy Tale

I want to start my review by saying this is the very first time I‚Äôll be rating a drama with a perfect 10. I‚Äôve been watching dramas for 14 years and I‚Äôve never felt invested and addicted to one before.

The story-telling was very unique and the writing is so polished. It has a typical story-line with other kdramas but it used a creative way of story-telling. The incorporation of fairy tales in each episode was what made this drama distinct from others. This drama made me felt different emotions while watching; sad and crying from one scene then, laughing out loud at the next. There are also some scenes that made me scared like watching a horror movie.

All characters are perfectly casted. Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji has the best chemistry I‚Äôve seen from co-stars before. All their staring scenes from earlier episodes was just exploding with sexual tension (and, that‚Äôs just all from staring how much more from a kissing scene *wink*). KSH still have the power to break my heart just by crying, still showing that he‚Äôs still one of the best actors out there. SYJ showed a different side of her. I‚Äôve watched her other dramas and I‚Äôm glad that she‚Äôs being noticed now. I empathized with Moon Young and felt for her so much. Everytime Moon Young cries, I cry as well. This is her best work yet. And of course, our Sang Tae-oppa, Oh Jung Se shined in every scene he‚Äôs in. He was able to embody a character so pure and innocent and make me laugh and cry.

The ending was so beautiful and we‚Äôre able to see all 3 of them heal and be happy. They found family, friendship, love and learned to love themselves first. I felt like I‚Äôm with them as they go on with their journey.

Overall, this drama is just perfect. I will miss this drama. This drama will go down as one of my personal favorites. And, I hope to whomever watches this drama, may you heal with the characters as they heal from their own heartaches and traumas.

Relatability
It‚Äôs been almost 2 months since this show left me and it still resides deeply in me. I haven‚Äôt been able to move on to anything else. It‚Äôs not that the latest have been bad, my heart just keeps comparing them with this Kdrama and I keep thinking about whether the actors would nail the other roles.
You go through life searching for things that you can relate to so that you can form that special bond. Little did I know back in late June, when I was searching for Kdramas that deal with mental health, that I‚Äôd find one that would leave me absolute EMPTY when it left me. Back in June, I ended up having familial problems which deteriorated my mental health hence my search for one. I was pretty sad that no kdramas really fully focused on the effects parents had on a child‚Äôs mental health. I decided to randomly start IOTNBO since it had a 9.3 rating at the time. Best. Decision. Ever. The cinematography, OSTs, chemistry, acting, KO MUN YEONG <3 and more were just.... outstanding. Never have I seen a female lead so daring and honest. Never have I seen a Kdrama start off with beautiful animations. Never have I seen a Kdrama focus both on the autistic character and the sibling. I was so excited for the first time since TWOTM ended. I wasn‚Äôt fully fully hooked, but it was exciting enough to continue from the first episode. Now, what solidified it as my absolute favorite Kdrama despite flaws? Zombie kid. That story blewwwww my mind away since it described exactly what I felt. Warmth vs only fulfilling a child‚Äôs hunger. It displayed all my feelings and it got in touch with my inner child that hadn‚Äôt grown. The tears I cried ep 4-5 would‚Äôve been enough for me to bathe in (other episodes did too). Not only did it point out a child‚Äôs desire for warmth and love, but it did show how mothers too sacrifice everything to protect their children. I got to satisfy my sadness over feeling like I didn‚Äôt receive enough warmth and also open my eyes to the fact that parents also try their hardest to keep us protected and show love in different ways. From that point on, my mental health improved and my relationship with my parents was heading towards restoration. For that, I couldn‚Äôt thank this Kdrama enough.

On top of that, the ending episode was by far the most satisfying ending I‚Äôve ever seen. I felt healed despite the gross sobbing. Like I said, this Kdrama has some flaws, but it still overtook any flawless Kdrama out there for now. A 10/10 Kdrama doesn‚Äôt have to only be reserved for perfect stories. It‚Äôs also reserved for those that touched our hearts the most and made a change. I‚Äôd definitely love a special episode seeing my favorite characters. I miss them so much .

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay‚Äù‚Ä¶was okay
PLOT
This was very unique, the plot was really good. It has mystery, romance, mental health awareness. Felt like a Tim Burton movie, but kdrama edition and I love it. But‚Ä¶.it wasn‚Äôt the best. The actors did an amazing job, but the script‚Ä¶felt like something was missing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I loved it, just I expected a little bit more of it.
Trigger warning- child abuse
THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN OUR MAIN COUPLE(S)?
Both of the actors did an amazing job, you could really feel the ‚Äúlove‚Äù! I truly enjoyed the relationship. The chemistry was there and that‚Äôs great.
HOW IT ENDS*Mild Spoilers*
I liked the ending,it was very heartwarming. The end twist was good.Yes, I figured it out, but I usually do‚Ä¶so not mad about it!

I have conflicting feelings about this one. Obviously the drama is great, there is no denying that, but I'm a bit disappointed how predictable & cliche the 2 main elements of conflict/drama were and how much time they've wasted on them. (Oh no your mom, oh no my mom .. & reverse love triangle with autistic brother) Ultimately I'm happy how they resolved these things, but it was somewhat draggy both times. The first 4-5 episodes were absolutely top tier, it had one of the best openings that I've ever seen, but then the ball dropped quite a bit. I've heard the production team received many complaints about two scenes in episode 3 (what a great episode it was btw). They could have dialed things down a bit to avoid further controversy, oh well live filming is the worst :-)
The drama received praise for the authentic portrayal of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Yeah sure, the actor did a phenomenal job, way beyond what I have expected of him. (I did not like the actor before) The main problem is I don't like how every time a person with a major disability shows up on korean TV, they would make the actor keep bowing down perpetually. It's like they want to convey a message to the Korean audience, he has a disability, but he is extremely sorry, forgive him, he is bowing down so politely, all the time. Sure, people with this disorder would not meet your eyes in a conversation, but this whole bowing thing is at best stereotypical.

The acting performances were great, the leads were incredible. I have never thought that one day Kim Soohyun would show off the charts chemistry with any actress, but he was really awesome. I think the military did him good, his acting improved a lot, his performance in emotional scenes especially was hugely more convincing than before. I did not really know Seo Yeji before, but I have only praises for the actress. She reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence's best performances. (not Hunger Games). The supporting characters were all extraordinarily good as well, at first I was a bit miffed about seeing 2 out of 5 of my least favorite senior actors in the show, but I guess the casting was spot on, since I got used to them pretty quickly, as opposed to being being super annoyed seeing them in every other drama.

The story despite being a bit draggy at times is certainly above average, the writer successfully delivers on wholesomeness, healing & romance. Sure there are quite a few problems, such as the show could have deserved a lot more depth, it absolutely sucks if I try to judge it as a medical drama.
The comedy is off the charts good, although there was a lot less of it nearing the finale. I have been feeling a bit down lately and I had hard time laughing, I started to doubt whether I can still appreciate humor as I had before, but in this drama there were quite a few moments, when I ended up laughing out loud, or spitting tea onto the carpet, it was sensational and still bittersweet at times. The last episode was great too, thank God it was a sufficiently long happy ending, the kind that I like best, long, but not too long. There was even a major plot twist, that I should've seen coming, but ended up surprised.

Product placements have been becoming increasingly immersion breaking in recent years. This drama has many very clever barely noticeable placements, kudos for that writing interns, but good God those car ads were just too much. There are several scenes specifically purpose written, where we are shown how incredibly good the brakes are on that specific car brand & to top it off all the older unbranded cars kept breaking down.

The deer! The first time I heard the deer making that sound I was like OMG, what the hell is that, but after going on Youtube I had that TIL moment, yep deer can really make a sound almost identical to that. I've seen thousands of deer in my life, but I have never heard them making any crying sound like that, but it seems to be real. For more information check out this YT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAkgkyeHpOc

The audiovisuals were spot on of course. The OST had quite numerous tracks, it's nice when we don't hear the same song playing 6 times in every episode. There were some really cool lens flare effects, perhaps they used vintage lenses to film some of those bike riding scenes?

Overall 8.5/10 seems fair. This is the best 2020 drama that I've watched so far. I'm sure I will eventually watch it again and I might end up adjusting the score too, who knows. (I liked it a lot more than Crash Landing)

edit: 2020 is over, but thinking about it now I think Hospital Playlist is the better drama, though it's not nearly as fun..

edit2: I decided to up the score a little, nitpicking is fine and all, but this is really a great drama.. :-)

A healing journey with beautiful and realistically imperfect characters
I‚Äôm not sure if this is true for all but I found the characters very relatable in the way they struggled with heartaches and problems.

I really love the depth that the characters have (especially Sang Tae and Gang Tae). The main characters, in particular, were very realistically written. They struggled with conflicting emotions and thoughts, like we all do as regular humans. I love that the writers didn‚Äôt restrict the characters in a fixed/rigid way. That being said, there was also a lot of character development. I really enjoyed following their journey of growth and self discovery. The cast also had great chemistry and lovely portrayals of the characters.

Though there isn‚Äôt really a climax to this story, it was still really enjoyable and well paced. I usually have thoughts of dropping a drama halfway through but to my surprise this time, it didn‚Äôt happen. :)

Lastly, I really love that it addresses mental health and the title resonates throughout the drama that it‚Äôs okay to not be okay. I received a lot of healing along the way :‚Äô)

Over rated
I was so excited to watch because of the high rating, but it is totally a disappointment. Slow pace, kinda boring... There are many plot holes.

I love the main leads and their acting! They are both so very very good looking! The story is ...okay. It is kind of annoying to watch an adult acting like a spoil manipulating brat ...I get the she is suffering a disorder, but I still can't sit through it.

I also don't get who would let their children read the main lead's stories?! I get it that all of the fairy tales have pretty dark and gruesome origins. Some were even bizarre. Such stories include rape, incest, cannibalism, torture and other heinous crimes we can never dare mention to kids who dream of a better future. But what was acceptable to kids in the 1800s does not mean it is acceptable to kids now; there was no Child Abuse Law nor Child Labor Law back then‚Ä¶..Disney fairy tales are good for kids nowaday, in my opinion because their versions still deliver the core morals but in a more evolved psychological, relatable way.

Anyways, I guess it is still entertaining, but I guess I over hyped because of the high rating....I had to drop it half way through. I will finish it when I have nothing else to watch. I hope it gets better toward the end

The ambiance and music in this show is exceptional
It took me awhile to decide to watch this show because...IDK....it sounded so boring. Mental health themes are kind of meh. But I'm super glad I finally watched it! The lead actor and actress were really well suited to their roles. That actress has such a deep and sultry tone to her voice that a dark and jaded but beautiful character really fit her well. And the lead actor is for sure an android because no one's skin is that perfect even with 500 pounds of makeup piled on top. That kid is legit gorgeous...how is it mouth even formed like that, is it plastic surgery? He looks like a doll. They both look like dolls. But that sort of added to the aesthetic and gave the whole thing a live action Tim Burton type feel.

The story itself ended up actually being really engaging and meaningful. Although I wasn't super thrilled with the ""love cures mental illness"" eventual ending. I liked that the female lead character was broken and that the dude loved her in spite of it. I didn't really want her to be ""fixed"". But I'm aware happy-everything's-resolved endings are super typical in Kdramas, so I didn't expect much else. The two leads play so well off each other and every side-character was so well defined and engaging even down to the minor hospital patient characters. The whole thing was like some beautiful fever dream with gorgeous sets and costume design, really really exceptionally well done music, and almost dance-like flow from one scene to the next.

I would absolutely watch this show again and have added all of the soundtrack to my favorite K-Drama songs playlist (which is pretty rare for me, I usually find one or two I like in a K-drama but this one had SUCH well done themed music).

Had Great Ambitions, but Failed Them
This drama was a beautiful one in spite of all its glaring flaws.

Pros:
- It‚Äôs a bittersweet, heartwarming drama about healing, about outcasts coming together and finding a family in each other
- STUNNING aesthetics, beautiful costume design for Yeji, gorgeous animations, and overwhelmingly fabulous set.
- incredible acting. As expected of Seo Yeji and Kim Soohyun, but wonderful acting from all the supporting characters as well. Kwak-Dongyeon is forever memorable for his emotional speech in EP4-5, I think.
- interesting storyline and wonderful concept
- unique characters, depth, and nice character development with a side of psychology

Cons:
- bad writing. Bad writing. Bad writing. Sure, many scenes are amazing, but many others were really strange, cheesy, and awkward. Their meeting scene at the publishers? What even? It‚Äôs like they attempted to make it sound deep and romantic, but it fell flat and just sounded weird. Not the actor‚Äôs fault though, they did amazing work with what crap they occasionally got.
- can‚Äôt get over the fact that Moonyoung chased Gangtae so ruthlessly and he was so cruel to her. These little bits of their relationship are just kinda disturbing.
- plot holes abound! The hospital staff are conveniently incompetent, people just conveniently appear out of nowhere somehow, and things just happened to bend the laws of reality to make the plot work.
- weird, descend into shit towards the last 4-6 episodes. What?? What?? It was totally unnecessary and horribly thought out. Not only was this entire event completely avoidable if they just,,, called the police,,, it was weird as hell and didn‚Äôt make sense. Too jarring and not a proper twist, either. And it abandoned the themes of psychological healing for weird drama.

All in all, not a bad drama. I loved many parts of it. Other parts made me want to beat up a pillow. Watch for Seo Yeji‚Äôs beautiful makeup looks and a fun ride and you should be fine, though. But don‚Äôt expect too much depth or cohesive plot‚Äî they tried, but sadly, it didn‚Äôt work out.

I thought this drama was unique, I really liked the concept of using fairy tales to tell the actual story and I loved the relationship of Gang Tae and Mang Tae, we rarely see such dynamics in kdramas. The lead characters did not appeal to me; the male lead seemed a bit too ideal and the female lead's story was far too messy and complicated, I couldn't connect in anywhere. I didn‚Äôt like the plot and it felt like I was watching a fantasy drama, some of the things that happened in the drama were just ridiculous and the plot twist did not help in any way. The drama ended with so many unanswered questions. Overall I would recommend because it felt like a new concept of kdrama which I love.

Slow paced but watchable
I must admit, I went into this with high expectations. This drama received many awards and reviews on MDL is favorable so I was ready to binge, but it took me some time to get through this one.

What I liked:
-The cinematography was hands down some of the best I've seen...and in the beginning episodes, the transitions were unique.
-I loved the story-telling in each episode, it was a twist to some of the classics
-Sang Tae's character with autism-I has watched Touch Your Heart right before this and was impressed by the level of skill of Oh Jung Se could bring to the table...there was a different actor in Touch Your Heart that also had autism who did a fabulous job so I wondered if Oh Jung Se got pointers from him? At any rate, I like that he was a heartwarming character with many layers.
-I liked Ah Reum and Jung Tae story arc...I wished they would have expanded on it more ( As someone that's been in a mental institution myself, I know for a fact that patients can find love with each other and the fact that Jun Tae decided to heal instead of throwing all his hard work away was a testament to what people are willing to give up to overcome certain addictions to forge a better life in the future
-I also like the true bondage that PTSD can have on a person and the impact that war has on lives, I wished they would have explored this more too.

What I wished would change:

-The two leads did a good job, but I found myself wanting to skip whenever they were on the screen, it has nothing to do with the actors but the direction...the pacing was slow where it needed to be fast and fast where it needed to slow down.
-It's unrealistic for a patient that is on their death bed to stay at a psych hospital, I am not sure why it was written that way or if South Korean mental facilities are different but most mental hospitals only deal with the brain not anything else. Correct me if I am wrong here..
- I did enjoy Gang Tae and Sang Tae story but there was a lack in the FL character development in my opinion...the idea that love can change a person so drastically was unrealistic (like some suggested in other reviews) don't get me wrong, I thought she was an interesting...maybe even refreshing character, but there was something lacking there...I won't put spoilers though.

A Tale of Reality Inside Each Fairytales
This drama wouldn‚Äôt be amazing without every bits of it. From raw Fairytales stories, catchy illustrations, lively animations, suited OST, quoting dialogue, meaningful wardrobe and cinematography creating such impactful storyline to the acting and directing. With everything together it makes it a masterpiece. Every episode will always feel raw and will leave you with wonderment in life. Questions will arise and answers will be given. You will be healed.

This drama shows that though healing is possible with a strong support system. It starts with you ‚Äîloving your self.

I‚Äôm still overwhelmed with the drama that I can‚Äôt pen why it‚Äôs a must watch drama this year. Surely, I will rewatch this soon.

One of the best dramas I've ever watched
I really really love this drama. Everything about it was so beautiful, the story, acting, ost, animations, cinematography, EVERYTHING! I finished watching it just now so I think I'm being a bit too excited right now? Anyway this drama really made me go through so many emotions, and I felt so deeply about all the characters and their stories.
To me this story was about growth and I feel like they showed it in a very beautiful way that really touched my heart. The fairy tales told in the drama were also so good that I actually want to buy them all. Out of all of my favourite dramas this is probably the only one that didn't disappoint me even for a moment. The story was so well written that there was nothing left out at the end and it didn't feel even a little bit rushed. Even the story of the side characters didn't feel unnecessary or boring and it all made me think and reevaluate my views towards life and people.
All of the actors did a really wonderful job portraying their characters. I think Seo Yeji is my favourite. She was so perfect as Go Moon Young like this role was made for her. And I'm so impressed by Oh Jung Se's acting. It was so good and convincing and made me feel deeply for Moon Sangtae. Kim Soo Hyun was also really good. He was really good as Moon Gangtae. All the other actors also did a great job that they all left great impression on me. I really love all the characters especially the director of ok psychiatric hospital.
Another thing I really love about this drama is the ost. All of the songs sounds so good and fit the scenes they were played on perfectly and made them extra special.
The animations for the fairy tales were another thing that really captured my attention. And the illustrations for the fairy tales were really good as well.
I really enjoyed this drama and I know I will definitely watch this again. I'm seriously going to miss this drama.

Have you ever cried because a drama has ended?
I‚Äôm gonna keep this short and sweet. I have never watched an airing drama, ever. I usually can wait till its over to binge but IONTBO elicited a need from me that I haven‚Äôt found before while following a show.
The dialogue, the characters and overall cast performances were amazing enough but then there was music, there were animations, and there were visuals that were just to die for, double meaning intended.
I‚Äôm not gonna tell you what to expect as I believe going in with an open mind is the best way to enjoy all that this beautiful show has to offer, I‚Äôm just going to tell you to prepare some tissues and get ready for a story that will both touch your heart and leave you wanting more with each passing episode.

In summary, you need to watch this show.

It's Okay To Not Be Okay is one of the greatest k-drama's of all time. There is so much to love from the way it shows and deals with mental health and also to the characters own happiness. It is a masterpiece and everyone should watch it, It will move you so much that you won't be able to stop thinking about it. Thank you to everyone who worked on this drama and brought it into our lives. Kim Soo Hyun is such a great actor and to be honest this is the first of his dramas I've ever watched but I will definitely be watching more of his work after seeing his role as Moon Gang-tae. I didn't know he was such an amazing actor. Seo Ye Ji is such a strong woman and pulled of Ko Mun-yeong's character to perfection and beyond. She has such a nice voice and was astounding in this drama. Oh Jung Se deserves an award for the acting he did as his role of Moon Sang-tae, it mustn't have been a very easy character to pull off but he did it and it makes me proud that his acting will help people come to understand people like Moon Sang-tae. I will always love this drama. It's Okay To Not Be Okay for life!!!.

Words can't even describe it....
This is one of those rare and unique dramas that I think everyone should watch for many different reasons. Throughout I was on the edge of my seat wondering where this story was going to take me next. Unlike some dramas I've watched, I never felt that the story was dragging and it developed at a good pace so there was never a dull moment.

The dark and twisted storyline kept leading our characters through quite often traumatic experiences that were sometimes uncomfortable yet fascinating to watch. Also, this drama touched on many psychological issues that can sometimes be demonised in mainstream media, but in this case, I think they were portrayed well and helped give people more of an understanding on what everyday people may be going through. Normally I don't think a lot of lessons can be taken from kdramas, but in this case, this drama gave us the viewers some valuable lessons on life and family to reflect on.

The cast and characters were amazing and bounced off each other's energy leading to great on-screen chemistry. You can really feel the deep emotions the characters were experiencing that sometimes made me forget that I was watching a TV show. Don't worry though these often depressing emotions were well balanced with innocent and pure love that helped to added reality to this drama. Sometimes dramas can be guilty of making love within a drama a bit cheesy, but this drama was the complete opposite. The love that the characters showed (whether it was to a love interest or a family member) felt real and genuine. The blend of all these high and low emotions really helped add the level of complexity that is experienced in real-life to this drama.

Now stop reading the reviews and go watch this drama ‚Äì Don't miss out!!

Comfort Drama? Acknowledged!
I know, I know, this is a big and famous one. But who can say differently? Everything about this just fits perfectly, from acting over story up until scenery, editing, Music, ... I should stop, right? Most of us have seen and loved this one. If you haven't - hop on!

I really really liked the portrayal of different mental health issues and how they affect life and the people around us. As someone who struggles with those kind of things myself, this was so comforting yet eye opening to watch. I could shout the title of this drama from the rooftops, because it IS ok not to be ok - and the world should know. All of these actors deserve their own cathegory in the hall of fame - they make me feel like acting isn't merely a job they do, but a passion they pursue. Jo Yong really outdid herself while coming up with this story - creating a world that is scary, painful yet filled with beauty and compassion. Each characters individual charm, or lack thereof makes them relateable - I think all of us can relate to one or the other trait in some of those characters.

While my soul hurt while watching the characters struggle and wind to find their way through all different kind of struggles, it hurt even more letting this Drama go. My wish to not see a second season of this only testifies to not disappointing from beginning to the end.

I wish for all of us to experience lighthearted moments in our lifes, I hope we all get to gain strength from this and realize that all issues can be resolved, that we can rely on others and ask for help but mos importantly l I wish for every person to realize that it's ok not to be ok sometimes.

Hands down, this is part of one of THE best K-Dramas I've seen in the past decades
Honestly, I dunno how to start this without gushing. I've just finished watching this, and the emotions still linger for me. Let's face it, it's hard to find a new refreshing K-Drama that's out of the box, more so if you're one of the veteran K-Drama fans like me who have seen more than hundreds of plots and stories. So when you start watching a really good drama, it feels like you're finding a diamond in the sand. That's what it feels like for this drama, it's a hidden gem you wouldn't have expected to find. I have never given 10/10 in MDL ever. But this deserves it all the way.

The characters here are not your typical K-drama characters - far from it. But one which reflects a lot of the actual personalities we would be able to encounter in real life. It does not, however, give you that feeling that it's too close to your own reality thus you would still be reeled in by their stories.

In terms of story and plot, it is unconventional but not unique. What makes it stand-out is how the story is told - how it is given life on the screen through many perspectives, and how we can empathize with the people acting out each emotion on screen. Each episode you're given a balance of emotions high and low, and that's what made it hooking all the more. The storytelling for this drama is nothing short of brilliant, it gives viewers a take-away for life up until the end.

Speaking of emotions, a huge shoutout to the actors and the directors of this drama. The emotions they had to convey were very difficult. There are a lot of heavy scenes and it would not have been given justice if the acting and the directing for each scene weren't concise.

VFX, Coloring, Cinematography wise it was also very much a visual ride. A lot of character perspectives were brought to life in this drama because of how it was portrayed in each scene through thorough camera work. Everything was so aesthetically pleasing throughout the drama, it felt like watching a long lovely movie.

The OST is damn great, I won't say anything but just listen to it on Spotify. There's a curated list already ;)

In conclusion, please, if you have some time to spare, take the time to watch this drama. It is truly heartfelt and amazing, I wouldn't be surprised if the drama and the actors find more fame right after this. It would be very hard to top this on my personal list, so let's all hope we can keep finding hidden gems as bright as Its Okay To Not Be Okay in the future (or else I'll be stuck in a black hole of finding great K-dramas like these for years again!)

Amazing
IOTNBO has definitely made it onto my favorites list. I loved it so much. Originally, I wasn't going to watch this drama. I saw the trailer and I didn't really seem like something I would be into. Cut to two weeks later, I was browsing mdl's calendar to see what was playing on my birthday. This drama was the only thing appealing and logistically also the only one I could catch up with. Then I saw a video on IG of Mun-yeong yelling at a deer lol. I could no longer resist and binged the first eight episodes of the drama. I absolutely LOVED it.

My favorite theme of IOTNBO is healing. Seeing the main three characters gradually heal as well as the other patients just warmed my heart so much. Overall, the look, acting, characters, music, everything was perfect. I will definitely watch this drama again. Likely in the next two months or so. Short review since 200 people have already written ones before me.

Everything goes downhill after the haircut
It's a good show but it has some serious flaws. The production, style, OST and acting were on point.

The good:
- How they connected the dark fairytales with the ongoing events was original and gave the show a darkish fairytale atmosphere.
- The FL was indeed toxic but that's what I liked, Shows with anti-heros lead are my favorite and there's never enough of them, specially the FL, it's always the ML.
- Sang tae was really well written and acted.
- The comedy aspect was well written and made me laugh most of the time.
- The last episode was heart warming and didn't made me feel like I wasted my time.

The bad:
- The ML was too wooden, I don't know how KSH being the star that he is accepted a role meant for a newbie. I say it b/c I didn't know who he was when I watched and I barely noticed him beside his crying scenes nothing really stood out for me.
- The main plot twist and the resolution of the mystery was a hard miss, all over the place and didn't make sense. It's ok for a show to miss some plot here and there but this was the main mystery that was building from the start, they should've at least come up with something logical and try to explain the jarring potholes if nothing else.
- They dropped the gloomy fairytalish atmosphere in the second half for some reason and it became a classic melodrama-romance with comedy here and there.

It is a fun, emotional, mysterious, quirky roller coaster ride! It was perfect!
This drama is one of the best! It has it all... emotion, mystery, laughs, and quirkiness. It grabbed me at the beginning and held me captive till the end. It is now one I will watch yearly.

This show is about emotions and healing. If that is not what you want then it is not for you. I am not really into these kinds of show, but I have to say it was quite a surprise and I loved every bit of it!

Storyline - how do they come up with these stories? The detail and acting is phenomenal! The story was well written and well executed! I love the development of each character. The emotion felt real and you could relate with them. I put this drama off for a while now. I look back and think, ‚ÄúWhy?!‚Äù It is so good! I loved the fairy tales in it and how it went along with each episode. I loved watching the healing of everyone involved. It was a journey but well worth it. Much much MUCH better than any Hollywood movie or series!

Acting - Oh Jung Se did an amazing job! He is quite the actor! Kim Soon Hyun... when he cried I cried right with him. He knows how to pull you in and feel his pain as his character. On top of that.. man when he came out for pictures with his hair all done.. well I will just say he is a cutie!üòÅ Seo Ye Ji did a wonderful job also. She really is a good actress! The rest of the cast did a great job. I have seen a few of them in other dramas and really like them.

Music - I am so glad it is on Amazon. I am buying it! I love all the music in this drama. The quirky songs are my favorite.

Rewatch - YES! One of my top favorites! I highly recommend this drama.

A beautiful tale
It's a beautiful story.

Kudos to the author who was able to bring to us a meaningful story about healing and supporting each other. The direction was topnotch too and complemented the story.
I liked how the author used tales to support her story either by having the moral of these stories illustrating a point of the drama or by having the characters having their own take on these tales.

KSH has succeeded in coming back after 5 years of absence from the small screen. He was great as MGT and was able to offer a restrained performance that still touched our heartstrings and made us feel for the character.
It could have been a wooden performance had it been played by an actor with lesser acting skills.

SYJ was just great as KMY and I was pleasantly surprised by her performance. She cemented her place as one of my favorite actresses after her roles in Hwarang and Save Me -I liked her in Lawless Lawyer but the drama was sadly not up to notch.
SYJ was able to bring the craziness of KMY while being funny and endearing. I I can't imagine anyone else having her part. That's how good she was.

As OJS he waw superb in his impersonnation of MST -MGT's autistic brother. I was floored by how well he owned his character ; the mannerisms, the line delivery...
I saw this actor in Hot Stove League not long ago and his two characters are as different as night and day.

The side characters were also awesome. Be it the junior artist or the hospital patients.

Plus point : The chemistry between KSH and SYJ was sizzling and I'm hoping they'll act together again. They completed together physically but their pairing also worked well together in the acting department.


The music was very good and went well with the drama. My personnal favorite is Silent by Janett Suhh.

All in all, IONTNO is the great drama with great rewatch value imo because even though the mystery is unveiled, their is more more to the story (the characters' growth, the side characters stories,the lighthearted and heartwarming moments, the heartwrenching moments...)

AMAZING
I've heard people talking about this drama ever since it first released and I was excited to watch it because of seo yeaji (I first watched her in lawless lawyer) and I had no idea who kim soohyun was before watching this lmao. I held myself back from watching it until a week before the last episode and i binged watched everything before they released episode 15 and it was a roller coaster of emotions !

Oh jungse portrayed sangtae so so well he deserves many awards for his outstanding performance ! Seo yeaji i love her character so much in this !! and kim soohyun whose characteristics was the most normal out of the three of them also did an amazing job portraying gangtae. The character development in this show is very much noticable and i love how their traumas came from the same person and they overcame it together. They truly are the best trio. There were some loopholes in this drama but i didn't really mind it as it wasnt the main focus of it.

Overall a VERY GOOD drama and highly recommended. This drama does not lack in anything. i love it.

Impossible not to love this show
If this doesn‚Äôt touch your heart, I don‚Äôt know what will, because this is just one of the most beautiful dramas out there. Every second of it is amazing.
But truly, it‚Äôs impossible not to like every single character. Ko Moon Young is a difficult character to understand. She‚Äôs a well-known children‚Äôs book author who holds a very cold exterior. Everyone admires her, but she doesn‚Äôt genuinely have anyone in her life. And then there‚Äôs Moon Gang Tae, who is someone you think you understand, but the man can‚Äôt even figure himself out. He has worked in several hospitals, always moving to different places with his brother, Sang tae, both finding their own ways in escaping the past.
So we have two lonely people that are faking their way through life in order to keep the happiness of other people. Wait, isn‚Äôt that like every other k-drama?
Yes. BUT, everything about this drama is so different. There‚Äôs something about this one that just makes you so ridiculously happy. Everything was played out so perfectly. Every moment the main leads are together, you think something extremely bad will happen. Nothing was too predictable; this made the character development worth so much more. Every character is so special and beautiful in their own way. And put Moon young, Gang tae, and Sang tae together, they are the most beautiful trio.
But not just the main leads, every character makes this the picture-perfect drama. Whether they‚Äôre blood related, friends, old enemies, everyone is family in the end, and it‚Äôs just so heartwarming.
Not to mention how well the main leads go together. They complement each other very well, and there are countless unbearably cute moments.
Also, the scenery and the color in this show is a lovely bonus. If you like beautiful people in beautiful locations, absolutely gives this a watch!

This review may contain spoilers
A whole healing experience. Extremely artistic.
It's okay to not be okay is a whole new world. There's nothing like it. The concept, the characters,the script and the storyline everything is perfect. Even if I try I can't find one fault in anything.
It is ahead of it's time. A whole drama that shows mental disorders in such depth, has never been done so perfectly before.
This show made me realise how people who are specially abled bring such light into the world. It made me change so much. This show changed my perspectives on many things, even though I'm a psychology major it showed me many things which made me appreciate my subject alot more. I dont think any drama has moved me in this way.
The dialogues and the use of fairytales in every episode made me appreciate this drama alot. I enjoyed every episode, its like an art piece honestly.
The music in this show is definitely one of the best aspects, some osts are a little dissapointing but the English osts are too good! The intro music is hauntingly beautiful. Seriously the drama is on another level.
The acting of every single character, amazing. Especially moon sang tae, oh jung se played his character so well. I get goosebumps. Everytime.
I loved how strong ko moon yeong is, she is a female lead we will remember forever. Her wardrobe, her lines and her expressions, perfect.
In conclusion, this drama is a must watch. It will forever remain iconic and will surely change your life.

A Story About Healing
This is my first review on this site, but this show has been so great that I felt it was right to write a review.

PLOT:
This is not a story-driven show, so the plot is just enough to keep everything moving forward, but really it is not what this show is about, so if you like and need a complex plot, this won't be the show for you.

CHARACTERS/ACTING
The heart of the show is the three main characters, Moon Gang-Tae, Moon Sang-Tae, and Ko Mun-Yeong, and their experiences. Each character is vividly written and they all have incredible development during the show. Each is also played beautifully by Kim Soo Hyun, Oh Jung Se, and Seo Ye Ji. The acting and the characters are why this show is so captivating and so emotional (yes, get ready to cry, you will, its guaranteed). Every secondary character is also both well written and well acted.

MUSIC:
The OST is perfectly calibrated to the show, and many of the individual songs are quite lovely.

REWATCH VALUE:
Because this show is character driven, there is really no end to the times you can return to replay your favorite character moments.

Human Healing Drama
I am sure many has a lot of praises for the show, so I shall keep my review simple (or maybe not). Here are the reasons why I absolutely adore the show:

- Fantastic acting and chemistry. Nothing can beat the casting in this show.

- Beautiful character development for EVERY character. Despite the show being heavily character-driven, it never cease to capture my attention every single second.

- Attention to details. So many foreshadowings, parallels and easter eggs to make the whole watching experience more engaging.

- OSTs that are heartbreaking and haunting.

- Life lessons to take away. Many lines are quote-worthy.

- Magical mix of genres. It is impossible to classify this show in any genre because it incorporates ALL genres in its 16 episode run, from romance to psychological to comedy to family to thriller to fantasy. You name it they have it. Some may not like the spectrum but it was a refreshing and satisfying watch for myself.

Overall, it was an amzing ride with capable actors and well-thought out script and plot, leaving me super satisfied after the watch. Just be ready to ride the waves with the characters as I am sure you will be sucked right into the characters' stories and feel so much for them. I am so glad for finding this gem and it will take a special place in my heart for a long long time.

Should get 20 stars
There needs to be more stars so I can give this 20. Been watching Korean dramas since 2012 and this is the best drama I've ever watched. It realistically and sensitively deals with a person with unique abilities and those who care for him, as well as showing the humanity of various people with mental illness. Oh Jung Se was beyond fantastic as a man with higher-functioning autism. He rocked every physical and verbal quirk without making the character cartoonish or ridiculous. The story also touched on almost every facet of such a person (resistant to change, overly honest, excels in one area, and many more). I sincerely hope Oh Jung Se gets an award for this role.

There is much more to be said but that might spoil the show for those who have not seen it.
Excellent and NOT your grandma's typical K-drama.

BEST DRAMA EVER!!! PERIODT!!!!
OH MY GOSH. I cannot gush enough about this drama. I cried, I laughed, I loved, every single second of it. A must watch if you haven't already and a rewatch if you have. The whole cast is extremely gorgeous, the storyline is exciting and mysterious, the aesthetics on point, music: fabulous, productions: out of this world, but most importantly, the messages it sends are so wholesome, heartwarming, and healing. It's been such a joy to watch and I'm so glad this has become part of my life. This is the first drama I've watched that hasn't left me feeling empty after it's over but instead happy and whole.

A foundational story about self love and the importance of leaning on others
This was a roller-coaster ride of emotions, and one I will likely jump back into again. I came for the story, but stayed for the message and wonderful acting. Top notch kudos to everyone involved in this.

Okie dokie, lets get to it. This drama is likely not for everyone, and I struggled to get past the first couple episodes with a love/hate relationship for Ko Mun-yeong. There were certain elements that came off as highly manipulative and downright unhealthy between the two main leads, but it gets better later on. If you're looking for a healing message, character development, chemistry, and spot on acting then this is a one stop shop. It is also so aesthetically shot that it is a pleasure to watch. They were very meticulous about the appearance of the set, clothes, and angles/lighting. I got some Hotel Del Luna/IU vibes from Ko Mun-yoeng for sure.

The story, while I found it a little vague, was really propelled forward by the growing relationships between the characters. There are definitely some common tropes in here, but I easily overlooked them in favor of the messages sprinkled generously throughout. I would have liked some better explanations of a few happenings, but I was so focused on the emotions portrayed, I barely noticed the inconsistencies. I was thoroughly pulled in by everybody's acting and backstories. They really did a wonderful job at approaching parental abuse, denial, alcohol abuse, and ptsd. There were many other messages in here, and I honestly can't write about all of them, but I have such an appreciation for the healing part of this drama. It truly teaches it's okay to not be okay.

While there were many tropes throughout this (I can't stand the leave for your own good clich√©) they handled it so well, and portrayed the need to lean and help others in a heart touching way. It was beautiful. There are serious elements, but they do keep humor sprinkled in there with it to break up the monotony. I really could go on and on about the acting. It really shined in here and I have no complaints.

The OST is stunning. I will definitely listen to that on its own. There are some OST's that stand out, and this is one of them.

All in all, a drama with a beautiful message and damn good acting. I would recommend if you're looking for something character driven and emotionally provoking.

Added To My Top Ten
Genuinely the first thing I watched when I woke up Saturday/Sunday. I'm going to bee so empty without having something of quality of watch, since I do think that recently the quality of recent dramas has decreased, no drama has piqued my interest like this in a long time. The cast was simply amazing and gave sm depth so their characters I felt like the story was given their due and more. The storyline has 0.5 of a star off because of the mother plotline but I think since she was not central it made all the difference. AND ONE MORE THING TO RAVE ABOUT is the MUSIC !!!!! each and every song pulled on my heartstring like no other and is one of the most unforgettable playlists I have ever heard, I will most definitely keep up with Elaine and Janet suh.

If anyone is looking for a recommendation please try Flower Of Evil it's already shaping up to be special

One word - Incredible
This show isn‚Äôt for the faint hearted. It deals with mental health issues head on and if that‚Äôs not your cup of tea, then you should stay far away. In fact, some scenes were outright disturbing and scary but it somehow keeps you coming back for more.

Man what can I say about Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji, they were stellar. BUT Oh Jung Se, good gracious that man acted circles around them. He was SO freaking amazing as Sangtae that I was in awe of his acting.

Plot wise I think they did a great job with surprising the heck out of you. You think you know where the story is headed and then WHAM a truck hits out of nowhere. That‚Äôs what the final twist felt like.

Also, kudos to whoever designed Moonyoung‚Äôs wardrobe! Wow, just wow. Although I believe the woman can wear a gunnysack and still look beautiful!

All in all, It‚Äôs really okay to not be okay. And I love that message of the show.

Absolutely stunning!
I started watching this drama when it started airing. From the beginning until the end, throughout the weeks, I stayed curious. This series is SO addictive.

I want to talk about 3 main points in this story: The story itself, the characters and the music.

The story:
The story was so beautifully executed. It's about a woman haunted by her past and her family. The male lead and his brother are connected to her past. And it's mostly about overcoming your fears and growing to do what you want to do and not let the past ruin your future. The lessons in this story are so important and by adding different elements like illustrations, the autistic brother and a closed off, almost psychotic, woman.. you'll learn the lessons on the most beautiful and heartwarming way ever.
The mother of the female lead is absolutely haunting and psycho and the father of the female lead is someone you can somewhat have different feelings about.
The story kept me on my toes.. like constantly. It kept me wondering about the story and the story kept me guessing.

The story summarized in words: haunting, heartwarming, thrilling, heartwarming, stunning and funny.

The characters:
First of all, the actors are absolutely gorgeous! The male lead is so good in conveying the feelings of his character. You can sympathize with him and understand his actions which is important as a watcher. You can also understand why the male lead is so closed off with his feelings while watching the story evolve.
The female lead is freaking amazing! Not only is she gorgeous, snatched around the waist with an amazing style of fashion... She is absolutely hilarious and even though she's a bit crazy... She is also relatable. The actrice is very good at conveying the right emotions, loved it!
The brother of the male lead is autistic and haunted by his past. The actor does such a good job acting like an autistic person. Sometimes it was a bit too (with the stuttering.. I don't know if it's usually this much.. but I think they could've switched more between fluent sentences and stuttering or not finding the right words) but I guess they tried to show an heavily autistic person. However, the characteristics of an autistic person were well conveyed. The brother really added more to the sentiment. And I love that they are trying to show off more kinds of people. Everyone has their own struggles and things and that was so well portrayed in this drama.
The side characters were either funny, scary/creepy or just really sweet. Loved them all.

The music:
Absolutely amazing! I personally really like Puzzle from Yongzoo. All the music is either touching or well fitting into the story with a fantasy and mysterious kinda vibe. Which is logical since the female lead is a writer of fantasy children books. So well fitting!

I personally loved it. I would rewatch this story just to be able to watch it at once instead of waiting weekly. Also, the actors had such great chemistry.

Ps. I would honestly also just rewatch it for the female lead 'cause she is stunning, has amazing taste, she is funny and just... I could look at her face and fashion for hours.

ONE OF ITS KIND,MENTALLY HEALING,BEST KDRAMA I HAVE EVER WATCHED
First of all, this drama being based on the topic of mental health might be criticised a lot but nothing is perfect . Now i have never faced any trauma except being in depression but in this quarantine this is maybe the best thing that has happened to me . Also i really don;t understand the ratings on korea maybe its just that it is airing on netflix too but damn do they need to open their eyes to mental health.
Second of all lets get into the review !!
WOW . what pulled me into the drama even in the first episode is maybe the chemistry of the leads Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji . i mean they were just looking but it was instant chemistry with them on screen which peaked my interest from the beginning.and obviously from then on the chemistry kept exploding . The story from beginning to the end was so well portrayed with beautiful morals in each episode that makes you cry sometimes of happy or sad tears and cliffhanger that makes you so eager to watch the next episode
Yes there is a childhood trope but in this story i think this just fits in without being a cliche ,i fact that is what carries the story.
The satisfying thing is the cinematic parallels of the leads which is really ironic and beautiful and the most satisfying thing would be the character development !!?? like it was so good to watch the change of the characters after understanding how to face their fears and attain happiness . i loved that.
There isn't an episode that does not contain beautiful quotes on life
And the ending was golden one of the best endings in kdrama history
At the end i would like to say the acting done by all the actors was outstanding and made the show all the more real
Kim Soo Hyun was really amazing with the emotions he showed and the way he cried he made me cry too and i love him for that'
Seo Ye Ji was phenomenal , lets agree a lot of us have now fallen for her and will look forward to more from her ,she was amazing in her portrayal of Ko Mun Young and aspd, i fell in love with her acting an crying . i felt irreversible pain she cried her soul out for something she didn't do and i look forward to more from her
Oh Jung Se playing Sang Tae was the best decision ever he did amazing , i have seen him in many dramas but this was the best i have seen of him. Acting autistic wouldn't have been easy for him but he did a very good job .
all of the actors deserve daesang for such performance!!
AT last i suggest everyone to watch this drama to help you heal a little or maybe provide comfort to the lonely souls out there so that they can take the step of courage to attain happiness in these hard times . i am really so attached to it i am probably gonna rewatch it again a lot .

Grab a box of tissues and be prepared to be emotionally wrecked.
I may have cried non-stop from episodes nine to sixteen. I may be crying right now as I write this review. When I heard the plot of this show I was excited and nervous about what the outcome could be. It isn‚Äôt the first time that we have had healing romances in a Kdrama not to mention the backdrop being at a psychiatric hospital and people with mental illness. I was afraid that we would have ‚Äúlove‚Äù magically cure everything. I am proud to say that this drama did a really good job in its portrayal and the incorporation of these topics. This wasn‚Äôt a drama that glorified mental illnesses or romanticized it, but rather it explored how some mental illnesses you are born with and other can be a product of your environment. The intricacy of this story and they way they wove the tale made it worthwhile to watch the way our main trio evolved throughout these sixteen episodes. This drama may have one of the best story telling I have witnessed in a Kdrama in a long time. The little things always matter and connected so well. After every episode there were so many theories of what could and couldn‚Äôt be and I loved that this drama provided me with this because it really has been a long time since a Kdrama has done that for me.

This drama was so beautifully shot and the cinematography and symbolism behind everything was very polished. I was especially fond of the animations for the fairytales that were told and I loved the way they all connected to the story or theme of the episode. I enjoyed that these fairytales were all twisted and dark in some senses because it provided the life lessons that we needed. I will never forget when Moonyoung said she always makes her witches beautiful, as it is so often we see in society that the prettiest/shiniest things are not always good. If I had to pick my favorite tale from the bunch that were told it would be Zombie Boy with a special nod to the story told during the Father and the Two Sisters.

It goes without saying that the acting in this was superb especially that of our three leads. I was able to connect with each of the leads in different ways. I have always talked about how outstanding I have found Seo Yeji to be ever since I saw her in Save Me, it is therefore no surprise that her portrayal of Ko Moon Young was magnificent. Now, I do not know on a personal level what someone with antisocial personality disorder behaves like, but I think she did a good job showing us her interpretation. This is also by far the most attractive Kim Soo Hyun has ever looked to me and I always wanted to cry whenever he did. The person who I have a new found appreciation for though is Oh Jung Se. This is now the second drama I have completed with him and he did a phenomenal job of portraying someone on the autism spectrum. It didn‚Äôt feel like a mockery or exaggerated in the least. I want to watch more of him tbqh.

The soundtrack for this drama was sensational. I am not familiar with the curated or distributor, but I do know is that they did great with gathering the voices. I haven‚Äôt enjoyed an OST this much since Hotel Del Luna‚Äôs which is funny as that is a drama that this drama is always being compared to. The songs amplified the scenes to a level that would not have been achieved otherwise.

I strongly believe that I could go on and on (and I probably will on my podcast) about this drama because it is truly something special. I have always enjoyed found family tales and this drama is no different. Yes, Yeji and Soohyun have AMAZING chemistry, but it was more than that for me. I truly felt like I was going on a healing journey myself. Please don‚Äôt miss out on this drama, it is very highly recommended.

Omg. Best drama ever.
Wow. The acting was phenomenal. Every actor and actress deserves praise for their outstanding performance. The actors literally made all the characters in the story come to life. And wow, Oh Jung-se. His acting was so good. THIS MAN DESERVES A DAESANG. I literally bawled my eyes out in the last scene when Gang-tae and Sang-tae had their brother moment.
The OSTs in this drama were also super fitting to this drama. My personal favourite was Breathe by Sam Kim. I don't know how much I replayed the song. Probably like over 10000x. The song is just so soothing and it just fits the drama perfectly. I feel HEALED when I listen to this song. Another OST favourite of mine was PUZZLE by Youngzoo. When I was watching re-watching the music video after the drama ended, I TEARED UP. Remembering all the hardships that all the characters went through just pulled on my heartstrings.
I've re-watched each episode at least 2x. Watching it once is not enough :P HECK I'll probably re-watch it next year and the year after that. lol. This drama made my heart feel so warm. This truly was a human healing drama <3

This was amazing! The storyline, the visuals, the animation, costumes, music, and the acting.
Kim Soo Hyun (Moon Gang Tae) I love this actor, playing Gang Tae, Seo Ye Ji (Ko Moon Young) I need to watch more of, and Oh Jung Se (Moon Sang Tae) should all receive Awards for their acting. Oh, Jung Se was brilliant in the way he played his character, that was just freaking believable. I have never seen any actor play that part in a believable way. Much respect to Oh Jung Se! I have to go back and watch this in a continual way. I don't want to say too much about this drama, because you would need to see for yourself. Have an open mind when you do!

A lot of dramas have flaws and this one too has some flaws, but I wouldn't say it's anything huge. The drama didn't grab my attention immediately. It took me a few episodes to start taking interest in the drama.

The acting was wonderful. OJS did a wonderful job portraying a character with autism spectrum disorder. It's my first drama seeing SYJ in a main role so I wasn't sure about her acting and I have to say she did a great job as well. Her and KSH's chemistry was questionable at first, but later on I could feel it in their scenes. There were a few scenes near the end of the drama that teared me up a bit.
My first impression of Mun Yeong's character wasn't that great and thought I wouldn't feel anything regarding her character, but it changed later on. The supporting characters for the most part did a good job of fitting into the story and helping out the main characters to develop.
The one thing that does confuse me is MDL lists PGY as a main role character but she felt more like a support role character. Her character wasn't explored much and it seemed like the story mainly focused on KSH, OJS, and SYJ.

Story wise, I think the writer did a good job in showing these three characters develop their characters. They were able to heal and evolve. The relationship of the two brothers was fun to watch and how they both make better changes in their relationship. I'm glad that this drama focused on mental health as well and tried to give various messages to the audience with this story. However, this drama does become predictable eventually with the major events involving the main three characters. There was no anticipation left for me regarding these characters. The drama introduced the problems they were individually struggling with along with an unsolved mystery and near the end they revealed everything about that mystery. If you paid close attention to the details before the revelation, then you would have been able to solve the big mystery before they revealed it. So, I was not surprised at all. I was hoping they would answer the other minor questions people had while watching the drama. But I guess they didn't consider it important enough. They also left out a few things from some of the supporting characters which I wish I could know more about.
Overall, it's not a bad watch, interesting and funny as well.

BREATHTAKING EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER
It‚Äôs a great show. Amazing acting skills by everyone and a great story with plot twists. I cried at least ones in each episode, especially as the show progressed. I didn‚Äôt got tired at all and watched all episodes in three days, I truly didn‚Äôt want it to end. I will definitely miss it.
It talks about important stuff like mental health, disability and abuse.
It‚Äôs not just a love story is about family, and that‚Äôs what makes it one of the best Kdramas I have watched yet.
I really believe that nothing will top this in my heart at least for the next couple of months or maybe years, because isn‚Äôt stereotypical, it‚Äôs a punch in the guts.
An emotional roller coaster that will blow your mind.

Focus On More Than 1 Element In This Drama
Focus On More Than 1 Element: Romance, Healing, Mental Health, Novels Within a Novel, Mystery, Non-Traditional Family

The sum of the parts of this drama are just so good that regardless of the lapses of certain elements of the writing, it still deserves tons of praise.

My favorite part of this drama, hands down, was the 3-way relationship of the OTP and brother. The way they evolved had so much preciousness to it, it was unbelievable.

The 1 point deduction is for the part that everyone seems to be stuck on, that doesn't make sense in the *real* world but is fine for *la-la-land*, regarding the mystery. Plausible or not, this does not take away from all of the other parts that were done so well, to me, that I just cannot fathom deducting more than 1 point.

Lastly, you know a drama's story is well told when I bother to go to an online Korean marketplace to purchase the novels within this drama, that are written in Korean, to be sent to me here in the USA during a pandemic. Shelling out $170 for a fantasy author, Moonyoung & illustrator, Sang Tae's REAL work is nothing to sneeze at! I enjoyed them so much I was truly willing to invest.

I don't often give a rating above 8.5/10 but...
OVERALL
A drama about psychological healing that successfully combines comedy, drama, mystery and romance. Watch it, no ifs...but I guess keep it for later if you really, REALLY don't like characters with flaws.

THE STORY
I LOVE dramas that normalize mental health issues, so I was really hoping this one would be good. It did not disappoint. It's not really about psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric treatments per say. The drama is about accepting your psychological issues and thriving in live despite them. The Strengths: 1) the grabber in episode 1 is EPIC, probably the best start of a Korean drama I've ever seen, 2) the dip in gothic genre is extremely innovative for Kdramaland, and although the show doesn't completely go gothic, it's still cool, 3) there is literally NO loophole in this drama, it's so well-written everything that happens has a reason to be, 4) the clever use of fairy tales for symbolism and allegory is just AMAZING, 5) the characters have real and coherent character development, without going from 0 to 100 (they are imperfect from beginning to end, but still have improved), 6) the depiction of mental health issues was carefully researched and is appropriate (though not perfect), 7) the romance feels organic and natural (not forced by the plot at all). I feel like many Kdramas could learn from this one.

The Weaknesses: Really, the only thing that bothers me is that for around 2-3 episodes in the second half of the drama, things just feel a bit off. Maybe there's a slight decline in the overall coherence, maybe it's the acting (see below). It's very short-lived though! Another thing that may bother some (but not me): the romance isn't particularly fast-paced and there isn't a whole lot of skinship (aka kisses and more). It's still totally great!

THE ACTING
Great performance by the two leads, SYJ and KSH. I recently got to know Yeji through Save Me, and since then also watched Lawless Lawyer, and I got to say, she delivers every time. In this drama in particular, she blew my mind. She kind of overshadowed KSH's performance, and even the actor playing autistic Sang Tae (who was amazing too!). I think I have a girl crush haha The child actors were amazing (most of them are, don't know what they feed them), and some extras also grabbed my attention. The one downer in terms of acting comes in the second half of the drama. I won't say much more so I won't give anything away, but I feel like one person overacts WAY too much at the end of the drama, which almost ruined these 2-3 episodes for me.

THE MUSIC
Pretty cool, though nothing I felt compelled to add to my playlist by the end of the drama. I want to highlight the creepy tune that came in everytime our female lead did something psychopath-y. I loved it!

REWATCH VALUE
High, but I'm not sure it's very high? I shed too many tears in this drama to feel like watching it any time. It'll probably be for when I'm not too happy but not too sad - the perfect mood for it.

I honestly don't understand people who can give a bad rating. I'm sorry but really if you see this and give it a bad score, your taste is bad.

Personally I am a person of simple tastes and only from time to time I allow myself to see such psychological dramas (don't get me wrong, I love psychology but depending on how my mood can affect me a lot or not). But really this drama is one of the best I've ever seen in my sight.

The direction, the cinematography, the OST and the acting are wonderful. I really loved the chapters where the her protagonist's tale were recreated; I really cried a lot in those episodes.

To count more would be sacrilege. I think they are one of those series where you really don't have to spoilers yourself, you have to look at it as if you were the first time.

The only thing I can say is that it treats all kinds of psychiatric / psychological disorders in a very beautiful way. It really is the first time that I consider that Netflix took care of absolutely all the details.

Aww I love my happy endings! That finale makes up for all that long (very loooong) unnecessary noble idiocy shennanigans of ep 15 (I expected more from you writer-nim!) I initially thought, the story took out the bad guy too fast, but that satisfying finale makes up for it, oftentimes kdramas are caught up in their own twists and cliffhangers, then we'll just get 5 mins of happy times or none at all!

I've a soft spot for Kim Soo Hyun since loving him as Sam Dong in Dream High so I'm a bit let down that he is the straight guy here as Moon Gang Tae, as compared to meaty roles of Seo Ye Ji as Ko Mun Yeong or Oh Jung Se as Sang Tae. But when a drama is produced so well, you know you're in good hands.

A healing drama with fairytale elements and mysterious gothic feels, how did it all work so well? And for those who are curious, the psychological issues are tackled thoughtfully and there's nothing too depressing or graphic.

This drama might have catapulted Kim Soo Hyun, esp. Seo Ye Ji to more fame. I wanted to fall head over heels over the OTP (they look so good though and those kisses!), but maybe I expected more fire from KSH in some acting aspects (he remains the best crier though), and SYJ in the comedic aspect.

It's probably a blasphemy for IOTNBO fans, but
Sang Tae is the runaway best part of the drama for me. Oh Jung Se is a gem. That bromance is so heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. That scene when Sang Tae confronted Gang Tae about a painful 'icy' encounter between the brothers from the past. Drama GOLD.

Aside from the OTP role reversal, the story might be nothing new from starcrossed lovers, to ill fated brothers. But Jo Yong's writing make you care for all her characters, even the supporting ones. It was so satisfying to go through their growth, with each tear and each laugh. It all came full circle. The whole ensemble cast is precious. Kim Joo Heon as CEO Lee Sang In is a great discovery!

This is another drama that will now fall easily as one of the kdrama romcom classics. 2020 has been tough for all of us, and IONTBO came at the the right place at the right time, like the Moon-Ko family, telling us it's ok to not be ok.

HEALING IS A PROCESS!
For a 16 ep drama, everything tied together nicely. Sometimes you don't need to fully heal to keep moving forward. HEALING IS A PROCESS, not a magic trick where you suddenly feel all better just because a drama is ending etc.. What I liked about the ending was the ""going seperate road"" shot, because it did not mean it's the end, to me it meant they're just taking a different path, a different route to heal.

Acting was superb! Especially Oh Jung Se's role, that's a very hard role to pull for an entire 16 (nearly 1 hour each) episodes. I also have to applause Kim Soo-Hyun and Seo Ye Ji. I first watched KSH from Dream High(2011) and SYJ from Potato Star(2013) and I must say they really improved so so so much. ALSO THEIR CHEMISTRY, OH MY LIFE! <3 The multiple staring scenes were a little bit awks as they lasted a lil bit too long for me but goodness me their chemistry was seeping through my laptop screen LOL. Don't even get me started on their kiss scenes, wow just wow.

Overall, I give this drama a 8.5/10, 1.5 point off as I hoped for more but that is just me hehehe. If you look beyond the romance, I am sure you'll see a much bigger picture in regards to mental health issues. Yes, the drama may have overly exaggerated KMY's personality in the beginning BUT this is where character development comes in and you will be surprised what people can do irl. Anywho, I will miss the cast for sure. I hope they work together again. Til the next one <3

I loved it. Best series of year hands down!
The first thing I‚Äôm going to do is find out who the writer is and watch any other shows that he has written. This show is absolutely amazing. I have never watched anything like this that he has a vote such emotion. It literally had me crying and laughing at the same time. I don‚Äôt know who this person is that created it but they did it in such a way that the heartfelt moments are so touching and the cheerful moments are so natural and hilarious.

This show definitely encompasses healing, forgiveness, family, love, acceptance, friendship, trials, and finding your own path. just amazing. This is easily the best series of the year. For me this was not a hard thing to say at all. I watch so many dramas a day and during the week but I absolutely feel that this one is untouchable. It gives you an opportunity to learn from not only the older people but younger as well.

It absolutely embodies what loves really means.

Serious around two male siblings and a female. They have all been somewhat affected by an event in their past. This event ultimately has an impact on their life choices in the present as well as in the past. What you will get here is ‚Äúthe fight to move forward and overcome it all‚Äù and it‚Äôs beautiful.

There is no crazy ex-girlfriend. There‚Äôs no ridiculous love triangle. There is no stupid make up break up that last 40 eternity. There is no nonsense in this series. I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a good Hartfield series to watch or a romantic series or a series I have some mystery and it may be a little bit of thrill. Either way this one will satisfy all those needs.

The story was great. The acting was perfect. The music was great. I‚Äôm even considering locating the song for my ringtone. The rewatch value is definitely a big plus because it has so many moments that I have already gone back to look at the part again, And this was while I was still watching the series. The ending was beautiful. It gave the feeling of a new beginning. Oh the possibilities. I was sad that it was over. Overall 10 for me.

This drama shines like a black diamond
This drama is not your average K-drama with fluffy love, a rich alfa male that has some disease where the love of his life solves all his problems. No. This drama is touching, real and gives us an inside of a part of the world that most of us don't want to see.

STORY
This story revolves around an underdog Moon Gang Tae that has always been caring for his mentally disabled, autistic brother Sang Tae. Because of that, he lived his life around his brother and always put his brother before him. His brother is traumatised by the murder of their mother, but he can't cope with it which is why they always have to move around. They meet up with the beautiful Ko Mun Yeong, a writer, who suffers from antisocial personality disorder. She can't hold herself back, curses and does whatever she wants without thinking about the consequences. She wants Gang Tae to be her safety pin as well, and they both find out that they have a history together.
The story turns dark when it appears that the murderer of the mother of the Moon brothers is still alive and she leaves hints for them. Mun Yeong turns out to have a small heart as she wants to protect Gang Tae and Sang Tae, even if she has to offer up her own happiness.

Within the psychiatric hospital where Gang Tae works, we get to see glimpses of people with mental issues. Someone that is suffering from a trauma from war, someone who combats alcoholism, but also someone with dementia and multiple personality disorder. This is a part that we often don't want to see in our perfect world, and especially in Asia is a taboo. This drama gives us an inside of a reality that we need to see, and we need to try to understand these people and learn to respect these people.

MUSIC
The music is done fantastically. They made a variation on Paganini's La Campanella, and even Beethoven's F√ºr Elise if you listen closely. It is not easy to make good variations on these classical masterpieces, but as a classical musician, I approve. The darker moments were also enhanced by the music in a superb way. They really did their best and it paid off.

ACTING
Where do I start. First I want to start with the role that hit me the most. Moon Sang Tae was portrayed by Oh Jung Se, and he totally stole the spotlight. You might know him as the loser guy No Gyu Tae from When The Camellia Blooms (watch it! It's super good!). I know several people with severe autism, and he got it down. The way he walks with his head down, his hands and excessive scratching. I couldn't believe that I knew him from another drama and that he actually isn't autistic.
Seo Ye Ji is the actress that was perfect for this role. Her yelling, obsessiveness, everything was done in a way that made me believe that this was real. The way her eyes quivered, the pain in her heart, she portrayed her character like the queen that she is.
And lastly, Kim Soo Hyun. This role was made for him. Even when I watched You Who Came from the Stars, I felt like his roles shouldn't be the alfa male, but more like the soft underdog kind of roles. And I was right. I felt bad for him, I felt sad for him and I was frustrated that he didn't put himself first.

Overall, I don't write reviews often, but this was so beautiful that I had to write one. It was so beautiful, touching, realistic, and it just hit me that our society should start accepting people who are different. We help them, and don't judge them because we might not know their full story. And, we need to tell them that it's okay to not be okay.

Very interesting but the end could have been better
The story started getting boring when they reveal that her mom is that nurse. After acting so sane as a nurse she is suddenly revealed to be a lunatic? With what purpose was she acting as a nurse for those 20 years? Why did she reveal herself? To achieve what? Was she so confident that Moon Kang-Tae would stop being with her daughter if she threatens him? Or was she so confident that she will kill Moon Kang-Tae if he doesn't agree?
The whole plot around Do Hui-Jae/Park Haeng-Ja coming back to do something was unconvincing. Anyone who has observed Moon Kang-Tae and Ko Moon-Young know they were inseparable. Also Ko Moon-Young had a cold personality but she was never so insane as her mom. Her mom aka the nurse Park Haeng-Ja would have known it better afterall she is observing patients for so long now...

Thankfully our boy Moon Kang-Tae gets his wish fulfilled i.e. to travel around the country. Moon Sang-Tae got into a profession that suits him and he seems to happy now.

I wished Yoo Seung-Jae and Jo Jae-Soo got together. Both were cute and funny. Jo Jae-Soo was too busy taking care of his friend and I wish he finds his love and settles down.

They didn't properly reveal whether the last publication from Ko Moon-Young is a bestseller or not. From what I understood from Lee Sang-In and Nam Joo-Ri's conversation is that its not selling that good. Did Yoo Seung-Jae give back Do Hui-Jae's last work to her boss Lee Sang-In?

if Dr Oh Ji-Wang retires from the hospital then who will run it? His son is not ready yet.. it's better he stays there for sake of his patients.. Patient Joo Jung-Tae seems perfectly normal to me and i want him to get discharged soon so that he can stay with Lee A-Reum.

i think the older brother Moon Sang-Tae cuts short his travel to give the couple some time together. He might have observed both of them sleeping on each others shoulders during the night. I wish after this travel ends Moon Kang-Tae gets to attend the school of his choice and learn whatever he wants to learn. Poor boy has spent his whole life looking after his brother and trying to make ends meet. He has enormous patience to deal with his brother as well as the patients. No doubt why he is favorite caretaker for many..

A good and very unique drama
STORY: (full of spoilers)
The drama tells the story of two brothers who have to run away and move regularly to escape from a ""Butterfly"" who killed their mother. There are flashbacks to tell the youth of these two brothers. 20 years later, KT and ST meet a woman called MY. She is a strange woman with a strong quirky personality with family issues as her mother disappeared and she cut ties with her father who is in a psychiatric clinic with cancer. As she chases after KT because she wants him, the lives of these three people start to closely entangles. Then the truth is unveiled about the death of the mother of KT and ST. That she was killed by MY's mother and this mother who disappeared is in fact one of the nurse working in the clinic with KT. The nurse who revealed herself as the mother then tries to separate them.

The story was simple but told in a unique and mysterious manner using flashbacks and detailed hints and moments of contradicting semi revelations which allow us to have our own understanding and theory about what happened and who is the killer. This was subtly done with a good suspense and it kept me interested in the main plot. Then came the twist and the revelation. I have to say this twist looked a stunt for me. The drama which had a Tim Burtonesque atmosphere suddenly included a psycho killer completely hysterical. How could that lunatic who screams crazily for nothing have hiden her personality for 20 years in a psychiatric clinic? And if she managed to do it, what triggered her to change? I could accept she was alive, she was in hiding as a nurse, she wanted to watch her husband suffer... but why she went back to her black clothings and her crazy days to kill a poor patient in the clinic? Because he injured her daughter? Because she witnessed her daughter becoming ""normal"" and she could not stand it? Finally I just accepted this unclear reversal of matters and the return of the mother like a temporary stumbling block in the new life of our 3 main leads.

CHARACTERS/CAST:

The gallery of characters presented is the greatest part of this drama. The flashbacks gave a understanding of the personalities of the main leads and made them sympathetics. The sub plots with their own guest characters, events, outcome and lesson of life were very enjoyable and described great character developments.

- KT: The younger brother. His difficult childhood made the person he is : someone who suppressed himself to take care of his brother. He slowly learns to open himself, enjoy things and find a girl for himself. KSY was pretty decent in that role. Young KT and the kid actor were good also.
- ST : He is the older brother and for me he is the most interesting of the two. He has autism disorder and relies on his brother at first but he slowly develops autonomy and responsibility. He finally become a real older brother for both his younger brother and his new younger sister. He even leaves the house in the end to live his own life. OJS did a great job here.
- MY: I just loved her character and SYI nailed it as she portrayed that weird strong quirky woman perfectly. Even her clothes were meaning ful. One woman character who will become iconic in kdramaland. Amazing performance from SYJ and the little girl actress portraying MY was lovely too.
- Jae Su: Loved him for his loyalty and unwavering friendship for the two bother and his great dialogues with KT.
- Ju-Ri: I never hated her even at the beginning. She just looked a bit pathetic but she slowly showed her immature and cute side.
- See Sang In: I liked how loyal he was to MY. He is funny but also mature and reliable for the other people. He and Ju-Ri were cute in their own little almost romance
- Ju Ri's mom: the wise one and acting mother of the people in her house and for MY.
- Seung Jae : I pitied her for always being the victim of Sang In but she had her little vengeance in the end.
Plenty of charismatic, lovely or funny but always interesting characters: Dr Oh, his son, the two patients lovers, the mother who lost her daughter and of course KGD the son of the politician. It was good that the drama gave a nice closure to all of them.

MUSIC:
This drama has the best OST. Every song is nice to listen to. It contributed largely to the special atmosphere of the drama and to its success. Releasing some songs after they were aired in the drama was masterpiece.

REWATCH VALUE:
The story is a little bit too simple but I will gladly rewatch it for the numerous funny, cute, weird scenes with excellent dialogues and quotes.

OVERALL:
Having watched around 400 dramas I have to say this one is a very special drama. I would have called it perfect if the twist was slightly better explained. I totally recommend this drama for its weird, fun, quirky, heartwarming and very human characters and its many good lessons of life. I really loved the long journey of waiting and watching this every week end and also following and discussing this. Thanks to the actors and the crew who made this drama and to the fans. This drama has some flaws but overall it deserves a 10.

It brought me out of my drama slump this quarantine
....where do I even begin? This drama is amazing!!! It brought me out of my drama slump this quarantine. This is a perfect mix of comedy, romance, thriller, horror, ++ lots of drama and the most important thing is that it is very educational. Special mentions are given to the main cast: Kim SooHyun, Seo Yeji, and Oh JungSe for their incredible, awe-inspiring performances. This show truly gave me goosebumps; I felt emotional at times to the point that I'd reflect on my own life and my relationship with people. I loved the featured mental illnesses and how they portrayed it to us viewers, unapologetically, all real and raw. I honestly didn't know much about these psychological illnesses but this show gave us a glimpse of what people with mental illnesses (as well as the ppl around them) go through including their ""healing process.""

There's honestly so much more I want to say but I don't wanna lengthen my review as I have a lot of academic papers to finish and I am guilty for even finding time to write this short review HAHA!!! but if you're still unsure about watching this, THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND START WATCHING THIS BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE!

Perfect mixture of new, exciting, fun and beautiful
I really truly enjoyed watching this Drama.
I started it on a wimp since it was getting so much hype and I didn‚Äôt know what to watch, so I thought I‚Äôd give it a try.

I loved all of the actors and their performances. I think this might even be one of the few K-Dramas where I didn‚Äôt have to cringe at how they handled mental disorders. I absolutely fell in love with the lead couple.

Story wise: I loved the whole vibe this Drama gave off, with the children book drawings etc. Giving us a deeper view into the Leads mind. The story to me was absolutely new, nothing I‚Äôd seen before. Which made me actually anticipate what will happen next, even tho (sadly) to me the big reveal wasn‚Äôt all that big, since I‚Äôd kind of seen that coming. It was still really exciting to watch, made me laugh at times and hurt at other times.

If you need something interesting that‚Äôs maybe a little twisted, definitely watch this one, I for one was hooked with the first episode.

The reason I‚Äôm not giving it a full 10 is that to me it was still missing something at times. It just didn‚Äôt feel like a full 10.

The OST is also absolutely beautiful.

A show that's full of aesthetics !
Where should I start from ?
The show had me from the moment it started . There was never a single episode that felt dragged or stretched . Every scene had it's own essence.
Every character was written and portrayed so beautifully. Kudos to the writer. They created a masterpiece . I don't think I am gonna move on from this show soon . It has set the bars for other kdramas too hight for me.
The osts were mostly in English and I literally have them all downloaded the moment they released . They just blend with the scenes soo well.
The best thing about this show is that it's soo easy yet so heavy at the same time . The fairy tales in certain episodes just strike at your heart so hard that you may end up crying . It's a show where you laugh and cry at the same time .
KIM SOO HYUN he is soo beautiful and soooo talented that it hurts. The way he showed his vulnerability .... Hands down ! The best.
Ye Ji what an actress . Why didn't I know her before ? I can never imagine anybody else playing the role of Ko Mun Yeong and any body else shouting ""I LOVE YOU ! Why are you running away"" better than her . Her voice , her personality , her elegance , I swear she is my Lady Crush . She is gonna go far after this show.
Did I talk about their chemistry ? Well how do I sum it up ........ They put the scree on FIRE !
And last but absolutely not the least Sang Tae Oppa , He is my favourite . I just wanna hug him soo bad. He is like a pushie .
Please please don't sleep on this masterpiece and watch it . You will actually regret if not because you can't find another serial like this.

More than just your average Korean melodrama.
I really don't give out 10s easily but this drama has touched me and destroyed me emotionally in the best way possible. Not only was it a melodrama that made me cry tears of joy/sadness but it has challenged me psychologically, and really changed the way how I view life in general. TDLR, this is an emotional rollercoaster that will touch on mental health, childhood trauma, healing, acceptance, and self-love, and it is a rollercoaster that will be worth your time.

Story: I was really scared that this would be a very sad/sappy drama that would romanticize mental illnesses, but I was wrong and I'm glad it didn't turn out that way. Moon Young has antisocial personality disorder. Gang Tae is a caretaker, but inside he is truly depressed and has no sense of self worth. Despite their differences, they eventually learn how to accept each other while keeping each other accountable. The story follows Moon Young, Gang Tae, and Sang tae's path to healing; there are a lot of bumps and dents along the road, but it goes to tell you that the path to healing is not linear, it is a journey. There is tremendous character development that will leave you satisfied, it didn't feel forced or unnatural, it was just right and well paced. I think the story was very well thought out from destigmatizing mental health to small, materialistic things like costumes. I remember reading an article in which the stylist did a lot of research in outfits for every character (ex: Sang Tae wears a lot of stripes because those with autism prefer wearing patterns, nurses wear pastel colors in order to portray mental health facilities as a welcoming place) in order to truly reflect them. At first I was quite thrown off as to why the show chose to have Moon Young be an author for children's stories, but these stories play a very crucial role to the story. It really shows that you don't have to be a child to relate to the lessons these stories teach; they reflect the child like side of the main protagonists and how vulnerable they are. Overall, I was really satisfied, the story felt realistic, and had a good balance of comedy, seriousness, and wholesomeness.

Acting: I could never see this drama succeeding without Seo Ye Ji, Kim Soohyun, Oh Jung Se, and the other cast members. Every interaction in the show felt so genuine, every character had chemistry with one another. Seo Ye Ji has the charisma and charm to portray an 'antisocial' character, Kim Soohyun knows how to truly act , his facial expressions are always on point. I am most impressed with Oh Jung Se's portrayal of Sang Tae. As someone who has an autistic brother, he plays a very accurate portrayal of someone with autism and I really applaud him and the writers for bringing more awareness and understanding for those with autism. Sang Tae and Gang Tae's relationship has a very special place in my heart and I truly loved seeing them grow and overcome the challenges they faced together. One of my biggest pet peeves is when writers cast supporting characters who don't contribute anything and are just fillers. Every supporting character (Ju Ri, Director Lee, Jae Su, Dr. Oh, Ju Ri's mom, etc.) had a contribution to MY, ST, and GT's growth, as well as for the other support characters, whether it was negative or positive. I felt as if they also had their own journey to growth and healing, it was very nice to see supporting characters have an impact on the story and weren't just there for comedy relief and fluff.

I don't rewatch a lot of dramas but I would l can see myself watching this again to relive the emotional rollercoaster and jot down some quotes/dialogue that were really well written. This show will always have a special place to my heart as it really changed my perspective on life and my own self. I feel like regardless of who you are and your background, you can take a lot from this show while seeing the main characters find their own happiness.

Honestly amazing
I'll be honest, I put this drama off for a long time because I didn't think it would be that good. I heard a lot of good reviews but thought they were exaggerating... they weren't :)
The story is amazing. The little animations are super cute and nicely done, the little stories Ko Moon Young write are also good an interesting. The actual drama's storyline is unique and I haven't watched a kdrama with a similar one before. The storyline about mental health included all different types showing the good and the bad and it was really well done. The fact that the main characters themselves also had their own issues which you discover as the show goes on adds to the idea that everyone has their own problems but you can get through it, whether it be physical or mental. the only issue I had with the storyline was everyone telling Moon Gang Tae to look after his brother as though that's not what he's been doing his whole life, and thus had no life of his own. I understood, however, as many people didn't know his backstory as we, the viewers, did (his mother saying she had him to look after his brother and being killed early in their life). I actually got emotional in a lot of the episodes because the story of different patients got to me as did how relatable the problems some of the characters went through (though not on such a dramatic scale).
Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji's acting was incredible, I hadn't watched a drama with either of these factors so I wasn't sure how they would be but they were brilliant. They portrayed their character so well as did the supporting cast. those portraying characters with mental illnesses did exceptionally well, especially Oh Jung Se who played the brother, Moon Sang Tae, who had autism. Just to make this drama even more amazing, the soundtrack was incredibly fitting. I have saved a lot of the songs from this drama to my playlist because they're so good.
Overall this drama made me laugh and cry and I would 100% recommend this to anyone who asked for tv shows to watch.

Amazing acting
Wow this show. It‚Äôs the only k-drama that can catch my attention for the full 16 episodes and keep me wanting for more.

The acting is superb. Main actors were definitely completely suited for the role and i love the supporting characters just as much. They‚Äôre highly entertaining and great performers. Seo Ye Ji completely outdone herself. You watch her go from cold to flirty to obnoxious to raw and hurt to loving.

I just love how this show is comedic yet serious when it needs to. It explores serious mental health issues that are very real and does not hold back. It can be heart-wrenching to watch the conflicts at times and that‚Äôs the only thing that held me back from giving this a 10/10. Sometimes i feel the show can get a little too heavy for me.

This Attacked Me to My Core
When I first came across this on Netflix I don't know why but I felt attacked by the title. Even the leads said that they picked this show because of how jaw dropping the title is. Now why would I need to include this, I mean I'm reviewing the show not the title. So why on earth am I emphasizing how the very title of ""It's ok not to be ok"" attacked me on a personnel level. Well that is just the beginning my friend. Just the beginning of all the tears and laughs I felt after watching this series. This series is not only a great drama but a drama that attacks so many issues that people face. The idea that showing others that your vulnerable seems foreign to some. However, the leads in this drama broke down countless times after experiencing love, hate, and despair. Which I can now proudly say made me cry a waterfall as big as the eerie cannel. To be honest, I wouldn't have rated this so high if I only watched this for the emotion. Because when i said this was an emotional roller-coaster I meant that one moment I could be laughing my but off at the witty female lead. Or crying at the male leads suffering, which to be honest didn't faze me at first. Seo-Yi Ji's character is probably one of that baldest b's I've ever seen in my entire life. Aside from the fact that she legitamently has no filter, she attacks the male lead to the core which attacked me to the core. Now onto one of the things that attacked me the most which was mang-tae or gang-tae I can never remember which one. However, the older brother character made watching this series all the more worthwhile. As he is one of the most accurate portrayels of an autistic adult that I've ever seen in my life. To be honest, I didn't like him at first because of how posesive he was of his brother. However, overtime he matured and became more Independent which I loved in terms of character growth. I forgot the other girls name but the nurse got on my nerves at first but she grew on me good for her. And the crazy character who I will not say due to spoilers is one of the biggest plot armors I've ever encountered in my life. How on earth did that person survive? That is all my friend, watch this you will not regret all 16 hours of it. :) :D

The best KDrama of 2020
It‚Äôs hard to write reviews about shows you love, Thats why I‚Äôll keep it short:

What did I like about the show?
- amazing cinematography (reality & book illustrations)
- an extraordinary Cast (the casting director deserves a big raise)
- lovely characters (especially Sang Tae & Dr. Oh)
- versatile characters and their coping with own past
- well introduced patient stories
- acceptance of mental diseases
- a convincing healing story
- an exciting thriller aspect (let me speculate a lot)
- the unpatriotic dealing & respect for Korean War veterans
- the critics on society
- the symbolism of the show
- the call for acceptance
- the bonding of the brothers (the intense showdown gave me goosebumps & tears)
- perfect mix of humor, tragedy, family story, healing story & thriller
- the morals of each story inside the story
- the bonding of all characters (especially the brothers)
- the fact that you couldn‚Äôt dislike any character at all (in my case even the bad person)
- the music
- the conversations
- the slowly blooming love story
- the symbosis of a strong script & detailed director accomplishments
- the nature scenes
- the fine line between too less and too much (it felt realistic)
- the feeling to be completely satisfied after finishing each episode

What did I dislike about the show?
- nothing (that‚Äôs why I needed to rate 10/10)
- the feeling that I reached the peek of KDramaland of 2020 (it‚Äôs a strong year - who am I kidding?)

I can recommend the show whole heartily.

[MY ADVICE - SPOILER WARNING]
If you have issues with the fl think about her experiences in her most important years. Don‚Äôt believe the diagnosis of the talking people. It‚Äôs their assumption and not a medical fact. Try to understand the reasons for acting the way they do of every character and enjoy the mystical ride! Have fun, dear! ;)

Addictive and worth a ride!
I enjoyed this so much, now it's one of my top favourite dramas. The story, chemistry between the characters and development of their personalities and relationships were perfect. They're learning to overcome their fears and facing them together.
Everything for me was 10/10! I cried and laughed and mourned together with them. I really loved everyone's characters and acting, the fairy tales were so entertaining! I recommend to watch this if someone is still hesitating - it's totally worth the ride!

If you are reading this before watching IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY,you might find it bland because you don't know what I'm talking about,just like listening to its osts first before watching it,you might feel nothing but i'm saying after you watch this drama,you'll find yourself stuck and crying..It might not be the cup of tea for some of you,like me at first because I prefer RomCom dramas but this one,you'll really feel the connection at some point.

OH.......This might be my best kdrama as of now!!!I suddenly forgot all the dramas that I've seen that made me hard to move on :( especially those romcom that are very light and normal which you watch for entertainment but this one was very deep and need a deep understanding of the characters.Suddenly I felt that I'm so little compared to Moon Gang Tae :( The message of each episodes are also of value,i disagree to Moon Gang Tae when he said that Ku Mun Yeong is like an empty can because her books are really meaningful and deep.The writers are really brilliant,the actors especially Oh Jung Se!

The last drama which I've seen that is not a RomCom which became my favorite too was Memories of The Alhambra but I think I have a new favorite now.

Not to mention the plot twist that is very unpredictable and I'm just warning everyone at episode 13 and 14 because it's really creeeeppy!....Kim Bok Joo's coach is an excellent actress indeed!

A GENRE TO BE EXPLORED IN KDRAMA's
It's my first time writing a review so I'll directly get to the point. First off
Story - The summary of the drama sums up the plot overall. But the way the executed the storyline is what made this drama special. I know some people are against it because the drama does some injustice to other 3rd parties like they didn't explain how MY's mother escaped from the box. Except that there no flaws or plot holes in the story. It was a story where each one of them got healed on their own by getting inspired from the surrounding and experiences. And gradually explains how IT'S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY

Acting - When I heard that it's returning project of KSH I felt excited. Every one of the cast did a great job in carrying out there role. Even the supporting cast members did great as every episode was focused on at least one supporting character. The chemistry between KSH and SYJ was great and exceptional. They didn't need words to portray their emotions their expressions did it all and OJS pulled out great in portraying an autistic man.

Music - The OST'S were best suited for the drama. Many scenes would be incomplete without the OST'S they were like feather on the cap for this drama.

Re-watch value - There were many scenes which made me rewind at least 9-10 times because it was worth rewinding it. As everything cannot be understood in single watch. But there were many scenes which were worth re watching. Like the reaction of SYJ on seeing KSH abs , every interaction between Kang Gi Dong and KSH , the bickering between the Director and the art director and many more worth re watching. Over all it has a great re watch value. 10/10 would watch again

And now for closing up the review. I would like to praise the pre and post production team for their good cinematography which made every scene bright and beautiful to look at. Especially the transitions from one scene to other were great, the VFX and animation team which added more depth to the story narration and made the drama complete and finally SYJ makeup and dress team for selecting the best wardrobe and accessories which suited her personality in the drama. The Cinematography, wardrobe, transitions everything together gave an special aesthetic to the drama. Overall the hype for this drama wasn't in vain because the drama lived up to its hype which we can tell as it held the highest spot for MDL's ""Currently watching"" category and was in top 10 in Netflix in many countries constantly.
In short if you are still hesitating to watch it then just give it a go and watch yourself go on a rollercoaster ride of emotions along with the drama.

A beautiful but fast-paced exploration of trauma and the struggle towards everyday joy . . .

*My thoughts on the portrayals of trauma/abuse and 'red-flags' in a postnote at the end of this review*

The plot builds in layers. There is something for everyone:
1) murder mystery with serial killer/sociopathic type elements
2) romantic suspense, ‚Äòill-fated‚Äô love, childhood love, lots of protectiveness and rescuing from both genders
3) gothic fairytale/stylistic elements each ‚Äòchapter‚Äô or ‚Äòepisode‚Äô features a fairytale moral or theme
4) Patient of the week storylines

A minor complaint is that there were some 'excess' storylines with little impact/point, but I did not feel for one minute that there was any true wasted time.

What keeps you on the edge of your seat, is the excellent fast, pacing. This is not a ‚Äòquiet‚Äô drama with lots of pauses, and long lingering glances. For those who find character development and inner self progression boring, the second half of the drama may feel less exciting ‚Äì but for me it was actually the opposite. I got more excited/addicted as the episodes went on.

Many of the actors appear regularly in other popular dramas, but I was able to 'buy in' to their roles instantly from the three main leads to the patients in the hospital. I will also add the main couple had amazing romantic chemistry, naturalistic acting and physical ease with each other. I think this drama had some of the best romantic scenes I‚Äôve seen.

The music sets a great tone, though half point off for the opening credits being a bit bland. I've already re-watched certain scenes numerous times.

I grade on other criteria as well:

Complex Themes - 10
Finally! A drama that acknowledges nightmarish side of human nature and that the road to a good life does not necessarily lie with reconciliation but recognising you deserve and are capable of joy. Expressing emotions, especially vulnerable ones from traumatic life experiences, is the key to finding joy and meaning to live in a world that can be cruel.

Character Growth - 10
While all three main leads are very different on the outside, they all start the drama lost on the inside. Watching the journey, and struggle for something different was meaningful. These are not at all the same characters at the beginning as the end.

Complex roles for women and relationships - 8
Ko Moon-Young is a beautifully complex character: brash and loud and vulnerable all at once, and I liked the very complex feelings she had for her mother. Beyond that complicated relationship, however, the women do not have much overlapping plots or interactions, The rest of the women are caricatures from the loving, always cooking mother figure, to the quiet/shy but jealous friend.

Production design/cinematography - 10
The show deserves a 10 just for the creative way it portrays mental states and trauma. But on top of that, the cinematography is beautiful and the sets have high production values. You can hit pause at almost any point and each frame looks like a painting. Ko Moon-Young has a wonderful makeup/clothing/style concept as well which is just an added bonus.

----

Some thoughts on trauma and abuse portrayed in the show:

One big warning label with this show is that it normalises a lot of 'red flags' for romantic relationships. The truth is that if you were starting to date someone who displays the behaviours of any of the three main leads (aggressive anger, not taking no for an answer, inability to express emotion, inability to cope with day to day reality etc.) it would be best to just walk away. In real life, most people do not come to the realizations the 3 main leads do so late in life. It's what makes a good drama, but it's important to not live your own life by this.

In terms of realism, this drama uses a more stage play/stylized format to get to a deeper truth than many more 'gritty' realistic tv and movies. While the pace is not ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô, the pacing allows for many traumatic stories and many ways to overcome trauma in a way that sitting working through trauma quietly for hours of screen-time just can‚Äôt capture.

Many fictional portrayals of trauma and abuse function as exploitative, trauma porn - just endless hours of suffering and grief and no way out. Often those who inflict trauma/abuse are portrayed as either sociopathic serial killers or abusers who are actually good at heart and that you should forgive/reconcile.

This show does an excellent job of showing a huge spectrum of abuse and trauma situations from unintentional inflicted trauma to deliberate, vindictive harm. It does an excellent job of explaining that many of the worst traits in humans stem from the refusal to feel 'warmth' or simple, everyday joys. It shows how life experiences can lead a person to believe that they are undeserving of joy, incapable of feeling joy, or perhaps worst of all that you are too superior, too special to care about such silly things as joy.

It's okay to not be okay is a fucking masterpiece
This is, hands down, one of the best shows (not only amongst kdramas) I've ever seen. The acting was absolutely incredible, the plot was, in my opinion, very well thought out and the show as a whole was extremely heartwarming and moving. It was so refreshing to see this kind of thing in kdrama and I think, that all those mental illnesses and all the struggles the characters went through, were represented in an accurate way and were handled correctly. I have nothing bad to say about it and I urge everyone to watch it too.

Hands down, drama of the year (perhaps tied with Crash Landing On You though XD
I had high expectations because this is Kim Soo-hyun's long-awaited comeback after his military service, and let me just say the cast, the story, the production have all exceeded my initial expectations by many folds.

Story: It is marketed as a dark, healing drama from the start, but while the characters have a dark history and are working towards overcoming their trauma, the plot is full of lighthearted comedy both in the characters as well as the cinematography. Because the main character is a children's book writer, each episode is also centered around a fairy tale theme (and if none exists in the real world, the drama created a few very interesting fairy tales to fit the storyline too). Thus, the story is filled with references that will make you rethink what fairy tales are and what message they mean to convey. In particular, the fairy tale of the first episode really highlights what this drama is about -- learning to live with your most traumatic memories as a means of growing up. As a story about growth and healing, the character development is phenomenal... the script touches upon multiple concepts of self-identity and values, and the use of them as motifs driving the story progression was A+. While the villain is truly scary and bad and I usually hate villains, I just couldn't stop admiring how much the characters added to the story-telling. Everyone had a purpose -- no matter it was to drive the plot or to make us laugh -- and boy did we laugh, HARD.
Also, this is a masterpiece from the literary point of view -- as I said, the self-identity/values/worldview motifs that keep coming back really drive home what the scriptwriter wants to convey through this drama. Many funny lines / scenes in early episodes also keep on coming back in different shapes or forms, and the way the scriptwriter used them as comedic relief has me down on my knees.

Cast and cinematography: The lead characters AND the supporting characters all added flavor to the story, and everyone suited their role so well. I'm particularly a fan of the publisher duo -- they were so funny! (If you see Park Jin-joo in a drama, you know it's going to be hilarious). It was my first time watching Oh Jung-se (Moon Sang-tae) in a lead role, and his (as well as the child actor's) depiction of someone with ASD is really touching.
As the story is about fairy tales, the production really took a liberal approach in cute animations, outrageous special effects, as well as lens filters to create a ""story-within-a-story"" feel to the drama. The animated leads are so cute! Honestly, even if you aren't sold by the storyline or comedy (which I think you should XD), I would highly recommend this drama just for the acting and cinematography as well. The artistic value of this is BEST.

Music: Right music at the right spots; really adds to the drama. I would put the OST itself on replay. Enough said.
Rewatch value: Sooo many scenes that could become instant classics to be watched again and again. I look forward to when other kdramas start referencing It's Okay to Not Be Okay. It's going to be as meme-y as Secret Garden was 10 years ago I'M EXCITED.

TL;DR: It's a drama I would recommend you watch by yourself, with your fellow fangirl friends, with your significant other, with your family, with people at work... with everyone. Definitely something you could talk and rave about for the next few months (I know I will)

NOT YOUR TYPICAL ROMANCE
okay so it was surprisingly addictive...and beware this one here isn't your typical ""love story""
its the perfect example of ill fated relationship for both the leads but what matters most is how they became each other's support and healed through the whole process!
CAST
it was a beautiful journey from the very start with our badass female lead Seo Ye Ji, tbh it was love at first sight for me XD like she was so damn perfect...this role was literally made for her and i don't think anyone else would have been able to pull of the ICE QUEEN role better than her! her whole vulnerable side when shown would make you tear up and actually make you feel bad for her and makes you understand her so much better..and by the end you wouldn't not fall for her
i think Kim Soo Hyun performed pretty well as our male lead too tho i kinda not liked him that much but that's just because of my personal preference of male leads but yes according to how his character was planned to be and all the background story which made him the way he was, the role was pretty much understandable and perfect the way it was
i tbvh found Moon Sang Tae very very very annoying at first but not in bad sense it was just that i felt it was very very unfair for Gang Tae but by the end of it i loved every single one of them!
Oh Jung se literally made the character of Moon Sang Tae come alive! it all literally seemed so real that one would seriously go through a roller coaster of emotions throughout the series and have mood swings according to how the story was going!
MUSIC
i freaking loved it like it just tied everything together so damn well!
the whole playlist was made to perfection in my opinion and i don't think the drama would have pulled off its whole vibe without the music it had
go ahead and watch this drama if you are tired of watching cliche love stories and want something totally different that would leave with you with thousands of different emotions and major mood swings;)

VERY ADDICTING AND TUGS AT YOUR HEART-STRINGS!
This drama might not be for everyone, but for me, It was absolutely amazing, one of my top favorites!

It's different from the usual progression in dramas. Instead of going in the normal direction of a happy start, falling in love, the conflict between characters that throw you off guard then a happy ending, this drama portrays a much more dark route. Not everyone will like the more in-depth mentioning of mental illnesses and the dark and depressingness of this drama, but I'd recommend definitely giving it a try! It's really heart-touching (at least to me) and I was addicted to the second episode!

The main characters are absolutely amazing, and you will most definitely fall for them! They have a different feel than other drama main characters and they are portrayed amazingly! The main female (Moonyoung) is cold on the outside with a warm inside and the main male lead (Gangtae) is warm on the outside with a more walled up personality. The third main lead was also amazing might I add, he brought some amazing moments to the show. They all had bad memories that were intertwined and they protected each other throughout the drama. The three main leads were AMAZING, one of my favorite sets of main characters! The brotherhood between the two male leads will make you cry from how touching it is!

This drama brings a lot of emotions and I highly recommend this drama to anyone who is looking for something meaningful, and intriguing to watch! Plus, the ending is super cute and worth the watch!

I have to admit, this drama might not be for everyone. As I'm writing this review, I'm having a hard time gathering all my thoughts because this drama is very deep and I wasn't attentive enough to make an in-depth review.

Personally, at first, I wasn't that hooked; I was watching this drama every weekend because of the cast. Eventually, in the second half of the drama, it started becoming really interesting. I was more interested in seeing the 'main story' progress rather than seeing the romance and side plots. And that was something I did wrong. I suggest paying close attention to everything in the story because a lot of it is actually connected to one another.

I was initially a bit disappointed because, after much build-up, a few things I found were a bit anti-climactic. I was hungry for conflicts in the story, not knowing that this drama isn't about day to day problems but how you get through them. It's Okay Not to Be Okay is a drama that is unexpectedly heartwarming. This drama is so heartwarming, you can connect with it at a personal level. The story tackles a lot of different life crises in different perspectives and shows how one can cope up with it and overcome all obstacles with the help of people surrounding you.

I don't know about other people's thoughts, but I didn't like the romance elements at first. Everything else seemed more interesting than the romance, but eventually, I thought that the romance was necessary once a few things were revealed.

Now I'll just list down a few things that overwhelmingly stood out in the drama:

The cast: Wow, just wow! Acting in this drama is on point. I don't even have to explain this. I'm sure at least one of them will win a best acting award at the end-of-the-year film awards.

Life lessons: watching all episodes you'll realize that you can learn a lot from this drama. One thing that was mentioned in the drama that really hit me was ""The law of the total number of misfortunes. I heard we all have a set amount of happiness and misfortunes assigned to us. If their lives have been filled with misfortunes up till now, it means only happiness awaits them."".

Seo Ye Ji's Visuals: Okay, so I just wanted to put it out there. Seo Ye Ji is just out of this world beautiful. ( 8/10/2020) I now consider Seo Ye Ji's character, Ko Mun Yeong, the prettiest among all other female leads I've watched.

Sorry about the worthless review. I was just not attentive enough when I started watching this. But all in all, this is a really good drama.

One of the best dramas I've watched so far!
When I started watching ""It's Okay not to be Okay"" I didn't think I would get so obssessed over it like I did. I remember thinking that I would ""just watch two episodes"" and ended up finishing all the episodes that were available that same day. It was a real journey to see the development of each character and it was joyfull to see them grow so much.
I experienced so many feelings during these 16 episodes: I laughed, I cried, I got frustrated, scared, and at the end of each and every episode I was craving for more.
It brings up many things that I have never seen before on dramas. It brings up very realistic problems and it teaches us that it's okay to have some trouble during life, it's okay to not know how to deal with that problem right away, but also that we must not pretend it is not hurting us when it actually is.
I grew very fond of all the characters and it just made me happy to see them coming out of their shells, it made me happy to see them overcome their struggles, it made me happy to see them happy. I will definitly miss waiting for next episodes to come, and I will definitely recommend this drama to anyone who asks me.

And I must say: Oh Jung-se's acting was flawless, I became a fan after this.

What a breath of fresh air!
Watched a bunch of korean shows and most of them have typical romance with a plot that can easily be guessed.
Then comes this show, at first you think its going to be another typical romance story but then you soon realize its not. With cast of characters that almost all have their story told including supporting role characters, to topics that are tought provoking, to music that is perfectly matched and used, to the art that is so properly used to tell the stroy and give it depth, this show hits all the high notes.
Without runing too much, this show deals with mental health issues but it does it with a great balance, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, you got shocking moments and moments that you will love. It also has the one of the best final episodes I have seen in a tv show let alone Korean dramas. Every single character I was rooting for, every single character I loved.

If you have not watched it, what are you waiting for? ?

best korean drama of 2020, period.
""To make the people around me happy, I have to be happy first.‚Äô So being selfish isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. If it‚Äôs too hard, just think about your own happiness.‚Äù

Finally after so long I found another kdrama that stole my breath the second I started watching it. This hasn't happened since my fave kdrama came out (It's Okay That's Love) but the long wait was completely worth it.

The story in this drama is really well-thought, I can't complain about anything. I might be a bit biased but I don't care, I tend to rate things out of enjoyment and how it makes me feel and this gets a 10/10. For me it's 100% worth it from beginning to end, you can see the development of the characters throughout the series and even if I expected some of the plot twists, I still loved how the story developed. The concept of 'healing' kinda made me think about myself and could relate to most of what some characters where going through so in a way it was a healing show to me that gave me happiness whenever I watched it. As Sang-tae tries to remind his young brother; you belong to yourself and only yourself. I belong to myself. You can carry traumas for the longest and it's okay to be sad and to get hurt but you need to let go, being stuck on the past will never give you happiness. Everything depends on you. Such a beautiful lesson I got from watching this. Also, the relationship between the main trio felt so wholesome, they made me cry, laugh and get angry with them. An amount of feelings that gave me a rollercoaster ride every time. I'll always remember them.

Such a good comeback to the drama world from Kim Soo Hyun. I missed him in dramas more than I thought. Amazing acting from him and the rest of the cast. All of them deserve an award, especially, Oh Jung Se... his talent is beyond this world! Being able to interpret an autistic person in such a respectful way, kudos to him. I felt the brother's story and relationship close to home since I've grown up with an autistic family member and I know how hard it can be. Brilliant acting, just mesmerising.
And can't end this without mentioning the amazing OST. I already made a playlist that I keep on replaying and replaying all the time *chef's kiss*.

Congrats to the cast, director and screenwriter for such an amazing work, thank you for such a heartwarming experience.

I Am Not Okay That This Ended!!!
So this is one of the best Korean dramas I've ever seen. No joke. It's everything I could've ever wanted in a drama like this, in that niche of romance being mixed with other important topics. Mental health is now something to be discussed over in Korea, finally and its so wonderful! So to see an entire show dedicated to mental health discussions in various forms. Treating it with dignity and compassion, seeing these characters all heal their emotional wounds. It's very touching and heartbreaking as well as pretty thorough! We go from a son from a wealthy political candidate whom just wants to be seen, to a woman whose assumed a childlike state to cope with her past parents abuse, to an elderly man coping with severe ptsd from the war. Holy crap it was all such an amazing set of experiences to watch and see the growth of all these characters. They weren't even our main characters but it all still felt so fleshed out!

I want to touch upon the overall visuals of this series before going into the main characters/storyline. To put it upfront, they were spectacular. The animation style with the dark aesthetic, the intro sequence with the stop-motion and beautiful music. As well as Moon-Young's books style. It's all very Tim Burton esque and its soooooooo good man. Like its my favorite thing ever! There's also some use of black and white film footage that had me shook to the core as a film student!

So now we will move on to the characters. Moon-Young is my queen for real. The crushing is HARD lol. She's gorgeous, fierce with her literal throne, fashion sense and black nails. Even though I loved her, I wasn't sure if her character would be able to garner sympathy necessarily. Since she is so cold at the beginning and for a good chunk of the show. All of it makes total sense though as the story progresses and its not her fault at all. She's developed this anti-social personality to clearly cope with past trauma from her parents, whom are literal evil people. You're going to embody being a ""witch"" if its what people called you, including your own father! Once you understand that her character sometimes does these outlandish cruel seeming things to push people to be better in her own way, it all comes together. She's not just a piece of artwork to be groomed or long hair to be pulled! An interesting thing Moon-Young said during the series was that she hated flowers that fell apart petal by petal, she prefers ones like magnolias that fall all at once. Something interesting to think about looking back at her character development.

Now we're moving onto the brothers. Gang-Tae is also very beautiful, my bisexual a** was struggling during this series! He's kind-hearted and you feel deeply for his character from the start. He's flawed, but I thanked god for that because I didn't want a perfect character! Everyone needed to grow during this series. His brother Sang-Tae was an amazing representation of autism spectrum disorder. Their relationship as brothers was my favorite to watch throughout the show, not even the romance! It was so wholesome and I couldn't take it! When Sang hugs his brother and comforts him, that was beautiful and so hard to do with autism. He assumed his older brother role and it was just TEARS. Children do not have to be ""useful"" to their parents, they are their own person to love.

So like I said, I loved the individual patient storylines interlaced into the main story. Those were great. The main plot of the mystery surrounding our main characters pasts was fascinating too and didn't disappoint! Was it overly dramatic sometimes? Sure, but it was hella entertaining! I thought each main characters past was really well done and the mystery surrounding Moon-Young's mother was really solid too. Even the romance was pretty good! I liked seeing the love blossom from something she thought was necessary to something that was necessary for both of them to heal. The only storylines that I didn't care for was the side-couple nonsense. There was already so much good packed in that we didn't need that at all. Ju-Ri could've just been single and found her own happiness without a man. By the end though every character had developed so much and grown, ending with each of them finding their own individual happiness. It's such a good pay off and I swear I teared up every single episode. WATCH THIS SHOW! I wish I could relive it again!

Pin Point
This was on my PTWL list for a LOT longer than it should've been. I started watching it when it had already finished and put it on the back burner for my current shows, which I now completely regret! This show was INCREDIBLE! Everything from fashionable wardrobes to tear jerking acting was amazing. It wasn't clich√© or slow paced at all. There was one part I saw coming a mile away but it still had my mind blown to pieces. Moon Young is the definition of a cold and antisocial beauty, Gang Tae is everyone's cowardly hubby and Sang Tae had (honestly) the best autism actor of all time. All 3 rolled together made this master piece and I hope everyone who watches this knows... It's Okay To Not Be Okay.

P.S. When I first saw the cover I thought it was Mark Lee from NCT... so that was my main reason for wanting to watch it(other than the much deserved positive ratings) never judge a book by it's cover LMAO

BEAUTIFUL. VERY VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL.
‚ö†Ô∏è SUPER LONG REVIEW AHEAD ‚ö†Ô∏è

This drama got so much hype when it aired. There were so many spoilers, so many reviews, so many screenshots circulating around the social media. And I was planning to watch as soon as the last episode aired. However, the plot twist was spoiled to me since there were no spoiler warning on Instagram like here on MDL. My plan to watch got delayed and more delayed since I thought there was no point in watching when I knew the ending already.

But, after months and months after this drama ended, I knew I needed to watch this drama somehow. I was super happy when the news that Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun playing in a drama together came out, so I really needed to watch this drama. So... I watched it. And GOSH... it was BEAUTIFUL. It was beyond my expectations. I forgot the fact someone spoiled me the ending, because the plot twist didn‚Äôt really matter anymore. The story of Moon Young, Gang Tae, Sang Tae and all the protagonists were all that matters. It was beyond beautiful, it was spectacular, touching, healing, and was perfect. I don‚Äôt think I could move on from this drama so easily now. It‚Äôs been quite a while since I last saw this kind of romance drama - I think my last favorite was Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo. It‚Äôs something quite rare to see dramas with leads that have awesome chemistry like this, like they were meant for each other. Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun did that. They were perfect for each other.

The story. Whew, where do I begin? I was super intrigued after finishing Episode 1. It doesn‚Äôt normally happen to someone like me. I usually get quite bored on the first four to five episodes, but IOTNBO managed to break my stereotype upon the first half of dramas. I had to admit that I hated Ko Moon Young‚Äôs character at the beginning. She was annoying, self-centered and super loud. But I realized that it was the whole point of the title - Psycho, but it‚Äôs okay. As I watched the next episodes, I began to understand her. She grew up without love, and her doors to the outside world were shut closed by her mother. Next, onto Gang Tae. He devoted all his life to his autistic brother Sang Tae. He‚Äôs never happy, but always tell other he‚Äôs fine. But, when he met the psychotic Moon Young, his life changed. He began to feel real happiness, but he‚Äôs now stuck in a dilemma between his brother and the now called ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù, Moon Young. Every fairy tale book managed to wow me every time, it has the perfect portrayal of each episode. Very inspiring and entertaining.

Each and every character here is super lovable. Even the side characters are all so lovable. Despite being completely normal, I could somehow understand every patient in the psychiatric hospital. Odd, huh? The screenwriter managed to portray every characters beautifully. Their lines were so inspiring, and every scene was just very very memorable. Some dramas would just add in ‚ÄòHealing‚Äô as a tag and would fail in healing the viewers, but this drama really healed me. Doctor Oh Ji Wang, Sang Tae, Lee Sang In, Jae Su, Kwon Gi Do, Kang Sun Deok, Nam Ju Ri, Kang Eun Ja, Gan Pil Ong. These are the underrated side characters. I honestly forgot some of their names, but they left me in such a memorable impression. Their scenes were short, but memorable. Weird, but inspiring. Perfect.

What I really love about all the scenes in this drama is the balance. After heartfelt and tear jerking scenes came up, they brought Jae Su, Lee Sang In, Lee Seung Jin into the scene, making the viewers smile and laugh after tearing up. Their comedic side didn‚Äôt seem forced, it was natural and was really funny. Eventhough the main genre of this drama isn‚Äôt pure comedy, I didn‚Äôt expect myself to laugh this hard watching this drama.

The acting. Seo Ye Ji did a really really great job portraying Moon Young. Can the viewers even guess that she‚Äôs actually an introvert? She‚Äôs deeply immersed the role of Moon Young and as a viewer, I‚Äôm impressed. Super impressed. Kim Soo Hyun did a good job as always. I loved him since My Love From The Star, and as always, I‚Äôm in love after watching his drama. He‚Äôs so dreamy. Oh Jung Se, just WOWED me with his acting. It‚Äôs not easy to portray an adult with autism. But he aced the role. He made me cry a bucket of tears and just overall feel inspired. The life lessons I get were so many, I had to replay several scenes just to get a screenshot of the lines. :-P

The music. New, but fits well with the drama. It got the horror vibe, but some also sounds dreamy when it got to Moon Young and Sang Tae‚Äôs scenes. Super duper perfect!

Overall, I could give more than 10 out of 10. I would happily give 100 out of 10 because it was that good! If you‚Äôre looking for a romcom, with a hint of mystery and loads of life lessons, THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU. Kudos to all the screenwriter, directors, staffs, actors and actresses!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Beautiful storyline
This drama does not solely focus on love between a man and a woman. It's a story about relationships between people with mental issues, portrayed in the most realistic yet beautiful way possible. The brotherhood between Moon Sang Tae and Moon Kang Tae will make you laugh and cry, and it makes you think about your own relationship with family members because you sometimes will see yourself in the character of Kang Tae. Kang Tae, no matter how normal he looks, has his own mental issue and Ko Moon Young slowly heals him, just as he slowly heals her. The soundtracks are absolutely fantastic, all of them. I am enjoying the drama a lot and find it very refreshing among other predictable Korean romantic dramas.

so special!! please do not miss.
I think many people are turned off by the theme of the show.
The promotions looked little too intense for me and I wasn't sure that I wanted to watch it initially. But I am so glad I did. It is such a special show with lovely characters and a great story and surprisingly bright despite the subject matter.
I am not a serial kdrama watcher and this is only the second one I am watching as it is airing but I doubt there have been many other shows that have handled this storyline as sensitively and beautifully.
Watching Moon Sang Tae evolve into the adult he wants to be is so heartwarming especially in the recent episodes.
Sad that only 4 episodes are left but this one will definitely be worth more than a few rewatches.
For those still hesitating, please do not miss this show.

Better as a Movie
Hi all , I really liked this drama but I feel like it should've been a movie instead . I got so borred at most parts . Some events and characters ( seung jae , his best friend , ju ri , director's son , the other nurse ...)seemed unnecessary .
I honestly continued watching because of Seo ye ji's and Oh jung se's performances , amazing talents , I hope they win many awards.
Many scenes and senarios kept on being repeted , similarly, some questions were left unanswered such as :
-Where is patient Park ? How was the head nurse capable of discharging her in the first place ?only a doctor mainly the chief doctor or professor can make this decision .
-How did MY mother survive ?
-Why wasn't there an investigation on MY's father's death ?
-Why was he ( My's father) hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital instead of a neurosurgical department?
-Why is an alcoholic in a psychiatric hospital instead of a rehab center ?
-Did that girl give the manuscript of ""the witch of the west to sang in?
-Did MY's book become a success?
-Did MY decide to continue writing ? Did GT study and got into university ?
-Did Juri become the head nurse?
...etc)
As for the production , it was the worst that I've seen in any K-drama. The transitions were so swift instead of being smooth . Adding to that , there were these long pauses and awkward silences of the main characters looking at eachother blankly without at least an OST playing in the background (especially in the first episodes ) .
Again , Wardrobe was okay ( yes it could've been way better ) but the problematic part were the nails , horrible, especially the white nailpolish .
However , the chemistry between kim soo hyun and Seo ye ji is undeniable. Love them to bits . Hope they become a real couple , get married and have cute children. I also love the other couple of the alcoholic and the abused , they're extremely cute as well.
Overall and again , this should have been a movie directed by another PD with less insignificant characters .
I personally, wouldn't rewatch it .

BAEKSANG 2021, YOU HAVE THE WINNER HERE!!!
Gosh! I'm literally speechless. I finished this drama last night (August 09, 2020) and in this very morning, I still can't compose myself. I get that weird feeling like there's a hole in my heart and I don't know how to fill the void. Two months journey with It's Okay To Not Be Okay every weekend is one of the best moments I've ever had with a K-drama. I was crazy about this one and got too invested. While waiting for the next episodes, I kept rewatching the previous episodes like million times! I even memorized all the scripts! Damn! When they say this is a healing drama, yes, here I am, healed by It's Okay To Not Be Okay!

1. The production
PDnim and all the crews, you have my greatest appreciation! Hats off for the hard work because I can 100% sure that your almost 6 months of hard work, sleepless nights and sacrifices, it all pays off! PERIOD! This drama is an absolute gems and I believe it had already changed and touched so many souls. The editing is a top notch! Like, look at that cinematic 360-degree shot and the very smooth transition on the early episodes, ÎåÄÎ∞ï!!!

2. Story
Jo Yong writernim, you're indeed a genius! When I saw those parallelism on the drama, I was like: ""Wow! So the dots are connected now!"" and it was ÏßÑÏßú ÏßÑÏßú brilliant! Every episodes have a beautiful titles, beautiful morals and the titles perfectly encapsulate their whole stories. The character development is the main point. You can clearly see how they transform so beautifully.

3. Acting
There they are! The mighty Kim Soo Hyun, the versatile Oh Jung Se, the wonderful Seo Ye Ji: the trio is badass! Moon Gang Tae is for Kim Soo Hyun only. Moon Sang Tae is for Oh Jung Se only. Ko Mun Yeong is for Seo Ye Ji only. No one can do better than them. The quality of their acting are top tier. What makes me happy is that you can also see that all the casts were doing their best and 100% all out! Even the minor roles are doing their best! The old saying is true: when you work with a best partners in a perfect environment, that magic force will come to you and boost you. PS: If them three don't receive any awards in the near future, I riot!

4. Visual FX
I watched all the behind the scene-videos of It's Okay To Not Be Okay and I can tell the visual FX works like magic! The CGI is so perfect and looks very real! Look at the Cursed Castle. You almost can't tell that the whole building is all CGIed. I guess, all the upcoming drama have to learn from this one. It's Okay To Not Be Okay set the bar very high!

5. OST
OH MY GOD! The OST is very very very good! Like, all the songs are specially made for this drama, to support the story. I'm in love with all of the songs and even once made a cover of You're Cold by Heize. I need the album to be released on digital music platform soon!

NB: Have you felt so invested into the drama? That makes you watch it over and over again using 3 different languages? Have you felt the urge to learn Hangeul (or Korean language in general) just so you can watch the drama without the subtitles? Have you faced the fact that the OST keep ringing in your mind? Yes, I have.

Watch this drama and you will get what I get. Fingercrossed!

The Best Kdrama Released in 2020 so far
First off, the acting is flawless! Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye Ji and most especially Oh Jung-Se (yes give this man an award!) did a fantastic job on this. Even the supporting casts and minor characters and cameos were awesome too. The casting is definitely on point in this.

The animations also made this show even more vibrant. It was the animation at the very beginning of the show that made me decide I'll stick with this one until the end.

The story is poignantly beautiful. It really was a healing journey indeed. It's slow but sure of what it wants to deliver and portray. It tackled on and made us aware of some mental health issues. The characters all grew on me. I was rooting for all of them. I ugly cried when they cried (KSH and SYJ has a way of making me cry when they start crying). I laughed when they laughed. I was actually glad they didn't go all crazy thriller for the plot twist. It would've not given us the same heartwarming impact if it went on that route.

Overall, it was a great drama that will surely tug the heartstrings of its viewers.

insane beginning, but still one of my most favorite dramas of this year
My first reaction to this drama was exactly like ‚Äûuh, what the fuck is this?‚Äú I know I am really girly. My second reaction was very similar to my first, I am not sure but I think I said ‚Äûexcuse me, I am drinking coffee, why are you vomiting your food in front of me?‚Äú

Okay, jokes aside now. I was shocked and scared but also interested in it at the same time. And the male lead was so attractive that I couldn‚Äôt breathe, let‚Äôs be honest. You should know it.

This drama has meaningful story for every watcher, the meaning of this story can be different for everyone. For me, It‚Äôs okay to not be okay is about hardships and about looking for your own luck which sometimes can‚Äôt be easily find. Also there is included mental disorder which perfectly completes the story ‚Äì mainly because of this is described in correct way. I am glad the producers now include these things, it's important.

We have here characters who aren‚Äôt only people with no background (I am a person who totally loves stories where characters had an interesting development or maybe the past which changed them and is still in their hearts and minds), this is very well done especially because of the mental disorders, ambience of mental hospital and totally impressive story which will touch you, make you cry and scare you at the same time. The characters are telling us their stories the whole time, also we can have a look on stories of secondary characters and that's a thing I really like. Their lives aren‚Äôt nice at all ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the purpose, we should realise every person has his nightmares and we shouldn‚Äôt judge them because we are the same. Every person is afraid of something or someone.

Everyone can fool you in every time, we are humans and we should be humans. And if we are weak, let‚Äôs stick together. Maybe this is the thought I would like to highlight. Okay, I am starting to become psychologist, let‚Äôs change the topic, this is not good for me.

I cried, I was in shock, I had goosebumps, I love the story which scared me at first but in the end it gave me so much. The story is really thrilling, the story line can change in every second, it‚Äôs sometimes really unpredictable and I am living for it. So if you are looking for something you will not want to turn off, this drama is a perfect choice. It is a mature story, some things they won‚Äôt say to you like you are a totally dumb, you must to find out. I really apreciatte it, I was gluted of stories which are so easy, I wanted something more mature and this drama gave me exactly this.

Yes, there were plots which were easy to decipher them (can I even use this word? I am not national speaker so still I have problems with english), but that THING in one of the last episode. I won‚Äôt spoiler but I WAS SO SHOCKED, I KNOW I AM DUMB BUT I DIDN‚ÄôT EXPECT THIS TYPE OF TWIST, REALLY. EVERYTHING I WANT TO SAY. I AM SHOCKED. THIS WAS SCARY‚Ä¶ okay, shut up, just watch it!

The actors did amazing work. Kim Soo Hyun now, that‚Äôs one thing, I am obsessed with him, but I should take off my hat in front of everyone. I am amazed, I know nothing about acting but this‚Ä¶ in my opinion, if watcher is amazed, the actors really did good job. And chemistry between main leads... is that even possible?

Ending of this drama was perfect, it totally suited the situation although at first I was a little dissapointed but then the true light appeared, so don‚Äôt be dissapointed, there is no reason for this feeling at all.

So it‚Äôs clear I recommend this to you. This is definitely one of my favorite dramas of this year, I hesitated a quite long because I still wasn‚Äôt sure if I was ready for this drama but one day I said I had have to try it because it will be probably my cup of coffee. And I was right. Although it scared me at first and i was saying things like ‚Äûthis is insane, my dear, it is‚Äú, but the scenes from beginning‚Ä¶ just suits this story perfectly. It has a lot to offer, mainly because of the idea and thoughts which this story shares with us. Thank you so much for creating this. Go watch it, I believe you will love it!

And some fun fact at the end of this frickin weird review which I can‚Äôt probably call a review. But it‚Äôs okay.

I was thinking during 16 episodes who is that guy who appeared in episodes 3, 4 and 16. Really I was thinking about him for the whole time but I was too lazy for finding out who he was. When I was watching episode 16 and he appeared again, i stopped it and went on mydramalist to search. Then I finally found out that I had known him from Love In The Moonlight and I was so proud of myself that I really discovered this information right but then I realised something and started to yell at myself ""I CAN‚Äò BELIEVE I WAS SO DUMB BECAUSE I WAS TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH HIS ROLE IN LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT. HOW COULD I FORGET HIM?"" And according to my research he was acting in My id is a gangnam beauty which I watched too but I totally can‚Äôt recall which role he was playing there. I am laughing at my reactions now, be confused is refreshing sometimes.

I know you probably really enjoyed reading my opinion. You wasted your time on my crazy text. And now ‚Äì go watch It‚Äôs okay to not be okay, that‚Äôs a command.

A must watch for those who enjoy well-written characters and a satisfying ending!
I will try to keep this short:

The three main characters are extremely well-written and brilliantly acted. A special shout-out to Oh Jung Se for portraying MST so well and bringing life to the character! The side cast are also perfectly fit to their role and there are seriously 0 complaints in the acting department- the actors deserve all the praise.

The chemistry of the lead couple is amazing, but I would like to add that was sold me was the brilliant chemistry between the brothers. I enjoyed their storyline the most and loved seeing them grow and understand one another.

There are a lot of praises about this drama already and I will add on to say it deserves the praise it gets. However, one major issue not many seem to talk about is how problematic KMY's character is.

I am extremely sorry as this opinion may not be well-received by many but I think it is necessary to share. She seriously had many issues going on and I would have liked to see scenes where she actually receives therapy each time she went to the Hospital for other purposes. Many things she does are unforgivable but are brushed off by MGT as he accepts her personality and Seo Ye Jin plays her role with such charm that the audience does not seem to complain either. She is almost selfish at times as she is only nice to the man she loves and her brother.

In spite of what I mentioned, this show is worth watching for its gorgeous cinematography, the development of all the characters (mostly all), the OST and a well-rounded storyline.

NOT YOUR TYPICAL KDRAMA
This drama is undeniably one of the BEST dramas of 2020. I had set a lot of expectations from this drama not only because of the cast but also because this is Kim Soo Hyun's first drama since 2015 and I'm pleased to say, that I wasn't disappointed. There are many aspects that I really liked about this drama but if I were to narrow them down to my top 5, then they are as follows:

1. The Unique but Fitting Title: 'Psycho But its Okay' or 'Its okay Not to be Okay'is quite a catchy and an attention grabbing title, don't you think? But when you see the drama, you realise how apt it actually is. From the beginning till the end, the drama is trying to convince its viewers how we all have a past but in order to move on we must accept it and face it.
2. Captivating Script and the Overall Plot: Honestly, when I first saw the poster I thought this is going to be just like any other romantic kdrama where the leads meet, fall in love, go through a break up and then eventually get back together. But I was so wrong, the plot is completely different and unexpected but in a good way. I was never bored plus that major plot twist left me speechless.
3. Cast, Acting & their Chemistry: The casting was just perfect, couldn't have been better! All the actors did a fantastic job at the portrayal of their respective character especially Oh Jung Se. His portrayal of Moon Sang Tae, an autistic character on the specturm was just mind-blowing in the sense, it didn't seem fake or forced at all. Hats off to him.
4. Theme: This drama explores many themes such as Love, Family and Relationships. However, the major theme and the highlight of this drama is Mental Health. As we know, Mental Health is not a very common theme in kdramas so it's quite commendable how this drama portrays such a sensitive topic without stereotyping or romanticising it.
5. OST, BGM & Animation: All the OST's and the BGM featured in this drama were just amazing especially the song Wake Up by Elaine (I'm listening to it while typing this....haha). Plus, the animation in EP 1 and those short children's stories featured throughout the drama was just beautiful and so meaningful. I think of all the stories shown, my absolute favourite was 'The Boy Who Fed on Nightmares'.

However, there were four aspects that I personally wasn't a huge fan of and they are:

1. Pacing: I personally found myself enjoying the second half of the drama way more than the first half. But that doesn't mean that I didn't like it, I simply felt that the first few episodes were a little slow for my liking whereas during the second half I was constantly on the edge of my seat, curious to know what happens next.
2. Focus on Mental Health - This might just be me, but I wish the writers had focused a little more Mental Health and the relation between the brother rather than the romance between the leads.
3. Rushed Ending - Again, this might be just me, but for some reason that ending involving the Female lead's mother felt a little rushed for some reason. I personally felt like that whole part of the plot had a lot of potential and hence, many of us were coming up with possible theories but, it was nothing like that. I'm not going to elaborate further on this as I'm afraid I'll spoil the story. But those who've seen it will know what I mean.
4. Some Loose Ends (at least in my view) - I just finished the drama but I'm still confused about certain aspects such as: Why was the mother the way she was, How was she saved and Why did she disappear for so many years. Plus, why was the the Director of OK Hospital so obsessed with her, in the sense he didn't even know her personally. Now all of this means, either they didn't tie up all the loose ends or I simply didn't understand some parts of the story....lol.

But on the whole, this drama was just MARVELLOUS and was a pure delight to watch. Kudos to the entire cast and crew of IONTBO for creating such a beautiful series which is full of meaning and life lessons. And to those wondering whether to watch or not, please do check it out. I 'm sure you won't regret it.

Enjoy!

this drama truly is a masterpiece...
It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay is a healing romance that tells the story of a troubled health worker (Kim Soo Hyun) at a psychiatric hospital whose fate becomes intertwined with a writer (Seo Ye Ji) with Antisocial Personality Disorder as they fall in love.
Kim Soo Hyun plays Moon Gang Tae who is a health worker at a psychiatric hospital. His only family is his older Autistic brother who he has spent his life taking care of while neglecting his own needs. He silently struggles through life doing his best. His world is completely turned upside down though when Ko Moon Young blows into his life like a hurricane.
Seo Ye Ji is Ko Moon Young. She keeps the fact that she has Antisocial Personality Disorder hidden and has been able to become a successful children‚Äôs writer. She is cold, calculating, and a bit dangerous. She sets her sights on Gang Tae and sets in motion a complicated romance for the pair.
Then we have Oh Jung Sae as Moon Sang Tae. He is Gang Tae‚Äôs older brother. His Autism causes him to struggle understanding people and has brought challenges to him and Gang Tae. Even though Gang Tae tends to take care of him, Sang Tae is very loyal, independent, and also wants to do what he can to help Gang Tae too.

Wow! Get ready! This drama is something else! It hooked me right from the start, and then I was glued to my seat all the way through. This is one of those special shows that captures your heart and takes you on an emotional journey that leaves you changed when you are through. Special indeed! The drama is like a dark, modern fairy tale. It has a magical quality to it in the way the story is told. The script was so incredibly well-written with every line of dialogue having meaning.
A lot of thought also went into the production with so much attention to detail in constructing the sets as well as how the scenes were shot. The OST also greatly enhanced this magical feel. All of these elements blended together beautifully to carry us away into this slightly disturbing yet very healing fairy tale.

Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji delivered powerhouse performances, and any time they were on screen together was completely captivating in so many different ways. Their chemistry was palpable. They run very hot and cold with each other which resulted in some incredibly intense moments as well as some deeply emotional ones.
This relationship is a bit disturbing in the beginning as these two clash. Their actions towards each other aren‚Äôt always that great. These are two very broken people. But they are drawn to each other, and those walls slowly start coming down between them.
Our characters are all very different from each other and have their own issues to deal with, but they all ultimately need the same thing‚Ä¶love and acceptance. Loneliness can be crippling, and that is shown very clearly here. Seeing this unlikely group come together and heal was such a treat. The concept of what a family is was explored in such a touching way.

It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay is one of those unique and special thought-provoking dramas that truly is a masterpiece. It tells a heart-wrenching yet beautiful story of growth and healing. The characters are flawed, but we come to understand them and root for their personal growth and happiness. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect to achieve that either. Love and acceptance can be found in imperfection. The message is clear and simple‚Ä¶It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay.

Best drama 2020
I have never been so attached to a kdrama . For me this drama was more character driven than plot driven and the character development of each person is seriously done so well.
If your watching for the whole money plot twist you might be slightly disappointed but for me this drama was not about that but the healing process which is why i love it so much

The chemistry between kim soo hyun and seo yeji is literally out of this world for me they have the best kdrama chemistry ever and i am seriously parting the have another project together.

So yes i am giving this a solid ten
I am really going to miss the drama especially our trio

Best and Brilliant
I was watching this drama when it was on air. Waiting for each episode felt like a huge pain. I cried.. I laughed... I loved.. and I was scared, this drama was an emotional roller coaster for me. There were not main cast or supporting cast, each individual had their own sufferings and story. Everyone were main lead of their own life. I read some reviews in which people were talking about bad side of this drama and some of which I agree with but I haven't watched any drama or saw any character which is so perfect. This drama has my heart.
Just go for it .

One of the greatest Korean dramas ever made!
This drama didn't deliver a single lackluster scene. From the beginning to its end, all actors' phenomenal acting (especially the three main leads, Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se) plus the writer and director's (along with the staff) magnificent execution of the story made IOTNBO a top notch kdrama! For me, it became not just one of my favorite dramas of all, but my most favorite drama of all now (also THE KDrama of 2020!)

I have been closely monitoring this even before the cast weren't finalized at the time. As a huge KSH bias/fan, I looked forward to seeing this. He never fails to live up to my expectations with regards to his performance, even exceeding it more times than not. Plus this was his new drama after Producers in 2015.

As time passed, Oh Jung Se's casting was confirmed and made me looked forward to the drama more, as I have seen him from Marry Him If You Dare and he was awesome. Then when Seo Ye Ji, also got casted, I got curious as to how her chemistry with KSH will be. I admit I haven't watched any dramas or movies SYJ but I have watched her guesting in Running Man and Knowing Brothers. I also know her from Bigbang's Let's Not Fall In Love MV. Nevertheless, I know that she's a great actress, and I found it true as I watched her play Ko Mun Young. She was outstanding! Her acting is very praiseworthy, never felt short with KSH's or OJS's. There was someone on Twitter that said most viewers watched for KSH but fell for SYJ as well and vice versa. Well I can totally relate and is now a SYJ fan!

Going back, I know I might not give enough justice reviewing this drama. For me, IOTNBO is a very warm, sweet, heartbreaking, beautiful, magical, funny and 'weird' one. I laughed, I cried, my heart fluttered seeing KSH-SYJ couple, got heartbroken, depressed and 'healed'. It was 'weird' as it tackled issues rarely seen in dramas, specifically about mental disorder. They were bold enough to portray and tackle these issues sensibly and beautifully. It provided deep awareness. I for one suffer from depression and watching this made me reflect on my feelings and thoughts. I identified with most of the characters' problems and seeing as how they got to overcome it made me heal too. It felt like I was also comforted. The rooftop scene of KSH in episode 7 got me the most. It was remarkable!

There were a lot of noteworthy scenes or episodes where the acting for a heavy scene was just beyond perfect. Also the script is very well written, each line cleverly prepared, never losing the flow when revisiting the past for future use. It always leaves me in awe whenever I watch a scene 'paying homage' to its own, which I never see coming unfortunately, since I've been watching kdramas for a long time, but also grateful since they were presented wittily. IOTNBO deserves a lot of recognition!!! Highly recommended, guaranteed to leave you with warmth (like the type I get on a slice of life anime)!

Also the OST is amazing! My favorite was ÎÇòÎèÑ Î™®Î•¥Îäî ÎÖ∏Îûò (Hallelujah) & ÏïÑÏßÅ ÎÑàÏùò ÏãúÍ∞ÑÏóê ÏÇ¥ÏïÑ!

Despite the plot hole, everything else made up for it thus the 10/10 rating :)
Sadly, all good things come to an end :( To my escape from everything terrible that is currently happening in this world, no words can explain how truly grateful I am. I hope everyone who watched this gets to live by the things that they‚Äôve learned from this show, even if it‚Äôs just one thing. May it be accepting that we are weak and leaning on someone/asking for help is totally okay, reconciling broken relationship is possible, understanding before making a conclusion, continuously pursuing to be a dependable friend, or breaking the curse of your past for your future generations (healing) is not impossible. There are a whole lot of good things that can be picked up from this drama. I think a lot of people would be or were hesitant to watch this because it could look like two broken humans trying to fix each other. It is not entirely false but it is SO MUCH MORE than that. It highlighted the process of healing within oneself and overcoming the things we are afraid to face instead of running away. It started within themselves, their longing to start over again; they didn‚Äôt put their significant other first and decided to change for them. While I saw this drama slowly come to an end I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of 1Cor 13 4:7. LOVE IS PATIENT; When your loved one is struggling, healing does not happen overnight. This drama showed individuals who had personality issues due to the battles they are facing but the people around them, though sometimes failed, were patient and did not rush them to change. LOVE IS KIND; They showed the domino effect of being compassionate and understanding. Correcting their actions without condemning. LOVE IS NOT SELF-SEEKING; They did not love in order to benefit from it but because they needed each other. LOVE KEEPS NO RECORD OF WRONGS; They may have hurt them physically or have said harsh words out of spite but they did not use it against them. Instead it motivated them to re-think when problem arises (knife scene). LOVE DOES NOT DELIGHT IN EVIL BUT REJOICES WITH THE TRUTH; ST, MY, and KT were all living in darkness but they encouraged each other to see the truth. The truth that it is possible for them to overcome and face their fears. They made each other come to realization that running away does no good but instead they must come face to face with their trauma. Lastly, LOVE ALWAYS PROTECTS, TRUSTS, HOPES, AND PERSEVERES; I think anyone who had watched this would agree that the main characters displayed this love with each other especially during and after they re-discovered themselves. I hope you were healed and comforted just as I was :)

Are you looking for an interesting and different drama to watch? A drama that grows in you and could make you feel great once finished? If those are things that you are looking for, It‚Äôs Okay to Not be Okay is the one.

I was hesitated at the beginning but had zero regrets just after 5 minutes watching the very 1st episode.

This show not only has me laugh my heads off and cry a bucket at the same time but also leaves me many good messages and makes me heal emotionally.

Story
A one-of-a-kind storyline which creates very well character developments not only for the main casts but also for all the supporting ones. That leads to a balanced 16 episodes where you can cry, laugh, heal throughout the show.

Acting/Cast
Phenomenal acting, not only among the main leads but also among the supporting casts.
I had never watched a show where I just couldn‚Äôt find one character that I could not hate like in this show. Every character has their bad and good side and every obstacle/problem that each of them had was very well-explained, solved at the end. That very detail leaves you such a satisfying feeling once you complete watching it.

Music
Very well-chosen OST.
Catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics! What more can you possibly ask for?

Rewatch Value
I would definitely come back from time to time.
This show has many layers to unfold, many good messages to learn from.

Overal
10/10 of course

It lived up to the hype
I swore that I would never find a psychological thriller/romance/mental health drama that could come even close to being as good as ‚ÄúKill Me Heal Me‚Äù but this drama proved me wrong. I still say KMHM was a little better, but the acting in this drama really impressed me. Every single actor was did a really good job. Kim Soo Hyun really knows how to choose good dramas. He starred in ‚ÄúYou Who Came From The Stars‚Äù that was a big hit then went into the military. As soon as he came back he chose this drama and I‚Äôm certain it will be a huge success.

The storyline: The male lead is the sole caretaker for his autistic older brother that suffers from PTSD because he witnessed his mother‚Äôs murder. They move every year due to his brother‚Äôs meltdowns over his fear of the murderer finding him and killing him too. So they never really have time to make friends or date or get close to anyone. The male lead is a very kind and patient person that works at mental health hospitals. The female lead is a rude obnoxious writer that seems to have no feelings. Her father is at the hospital where the male lead works and after a series of run ins their lives become entangled.

You can tell a lot of money was invested in this. It‚Äôs definitely a big budget drama. The special effects and cinematography were top notch. The music was perfect for each scene and was quite moving.

For those looking for an action packed psychological thriller, you may be disappointed by the romance or the focus on mental health which slows things down a bit in some parts. This is a third mental health, a third murder mystery psychological thriller, and a third romantic comedy. It‚Äôs a package deal so go into it expecting all three genres to be rolled into one nice cohesive package. I personally loved how balanced it was. There was never too much of one thing, so it never got boring or predictable. You have a little murder mystery which gets you all nervous and worked up then would things would calm down with the push and pull of the romance. Then there would be the sadness from different characters lives or mental health issues and then the comedy would pop up and get you laughing. I really enjoyed the diversity of the drama.

One thing I disliked was how I felt about the female lead in the beginning. She was very selfish, arrogant, and rude. It took a good while before I liked her. But that‚Äôs how we are supposed to feel about her. Once you find out about her backstory and what she‚Äôs been through, you can sympathize with her and understand her better. And her character growth was phenomenal. In fact, every character in this drama has amazing character growth which gave it so much depth and made it more interesting.

And can I just say thank you to those in charge who decided to have real kisses in this drama and not the fake ones. It‚Äôs hard to believe in a romance with fake kisses or people that go to bed together or wake up together completely dressed like they‚Äôre about to walk out the door. Well there‚Äôs none of that here. It was very true to life which I believe enhanced the drama and made it more relatable.

Overall I loved this drama and can‚Äôt really find much to dislike about it. I wish the female lead was a little more likable, and the pace could have picked up a bit more in some areas. But no drama is perfect and those are just tiny things. Just take my advice and watch it. It‚Äôs really really good!

Cleverly Written, Produced and Edited
I came in expecting a story that's similar to It's Okay, That's Love due to the summary but It's Okay to Be Not Okay turned out to be a different drama since it has this mystery thriller vibe to it.

These are the reasons why I enjoyed this smart and creative drama to bits:

1. The drama makes use of the main settings to enrich the story that it was about to tell.
2. The cinematography and the editing of this drama is one of the BEST I have seen due to its creativity that made me laugh a lot and has more purposes other than for aesthetic purposes.
3. The animations are not overdone and the editing team has somehow found a way to make them organic.
4. The character development of this drama doesn't feel rushed and you'll find rooting yourself rooting for the main characters and it's satisfying to see the way their character arcs are concluded.
5. The individual stories of the patients have actually impacted the main story with their interaction with the main characters. Not only that, but they were also nicely tied in the end.
6. The dialogues are written in such a way that it alludes to the main characters without exactly specifying the names of the main characters.
7. It was interesting to see how they make use of different literary works as their episode headers. This was one of the few dramas that I actually paid attention to the title of the episode.
8. OSTs and background music are really good.

In regards to the acting and casting, this drama really did well and I won't comment anymore about the casts' acting since I was really satisfied.

Overall, this drama brought a lot of nostalgia due to its use of literary works that I've read when I was young and was glad that I was coerced to watch this drama. This drama will have a special place in my heart since it is one of the few dramas that me and my siblings watched at the same time.

Heart Warming Stories on Mental Health
I don't want to say much or spoil much so I'll continue with as little spoilers as possible. I hope that with this drama, mental health could be more accepted everywhere in the world where it can come off as a taboo topic.

OVERALL
I wished that I would have written this review right after I finished it, instead of waiting a couple of months. However, that would have been an even more biased review. This drama teared me up until the very last minute. I love how they didn‚Äôt try to make everything seem like it was okay and beautiful in the end. What made it beautiful was that they knew they could never get over it, but they can grow from it, move on, and be better. They spread their wings to leave what was always holding them back!

STORY
This is a drama that is told using fairy tales. Unlike other dramas where it uses one fairy tale, like ‚ÄúThe Little Mermaid‚Äù to foreshadow the story, they made up their own for the show. All these stories that are read in the drama are as deep as the drama itself.

The concept of love in this drama was beautiful and so unique. It captivated me because it was not about romanticizing love stories and because it did not solely focus on the main lead‚Äôs love. It was a story of love stories. It showed different types of love and told the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of love. It showed that love came in different forms and can evolve in different ways. The writers allowed us to see the raw aspects of a relationship such as the baggage we carry and how the people that surround us are a part of it too. The story isn‚Äôt just focused on one person. It shows you the support system in a relationship and how it‚Äôs not always involving two people. They made all the supporting casts and minor characters‚Äô relationships to be intermingled in a way that made sense and worthwhile to watch. We fall in love with all of them in different ways and they become more than just side characters.

It was an inspiring drama amidst the 2020 crap we were thrown. It was an inspiring drama that showed that we can overcome these psychological issues that have only started to come to light as of lately. It shows hope of finding yourself through the help of people around you. It speaks so much to those that fantasize about that light and not about the love story of finding that Mr. Right. Moon Young was just lucky to have found both.

ACTING/CAST/CHARACTERS
I have always enjoyed Seo Ye Ji‚Äôs acting and she is still able to blow me away as Ko Moon Young. Her character was hilarious at the beginning. I loved the little ‚Äúpsycho psycho‚Äù that was thrown in the background when she does something overboard. Sometimes I feel like Moon Young was the most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù one out of all of the characters. She has moments where she expresses weird habits and mood swings, but that was about it. I feel like they could have done more with her character or one that has a personality disorder, I don‚Äôt expect something dramatic, but I wished they showed more ways of how she treats it.

I have seen one of Kim Soo Hyun‚Äôs work, but as Moon Gang Tae, I am sold on the hype on this actor! Kim Soo Hyun is so good at crying. I cried at least 70% of the time that he cried on screen. The way he executes his scenes is so great. The way he breathes between words, how his eyes waver, and how he acts helpless and lost. All of it was delivered so well. He has improved, or this character allowed him to show his skills.

Oh Jung Se was phenomenal as Moon Sang Tae. He deserves so much attention was the lead in my heart for his performance and the way he moved me. Do I even need to say anything more? Without his character and the relationship of the brothers in here, it would not have held my attention for so long. So many of my favorite scenes involved the two brothers. I love how Sang Tae grew so much with the number of people that were willing to help him. It warmed my heart so much!

Honorable mentions to the directors, writers, all staff, casts, singers, and the special guest cast!

MUSIC
Guys‚Ä¶ this had such a stud list of OST singers. Kim Feel, Park Won, Lee Suhyun, Sam Kim, Heize, and Cheeze. The timing of the soundtracks and when they came in really aid in the feel of the drama. For example, Kwak Dong Yeon showed up in episode 3 and was imagining himself as being so free from his true reality. The way he smiled and laughed and then Kim Feel‚Äôs Hallelujah came on. Such a fitting song for a fitting moment in the drama. I realized I got the most emotional whenever Kim Feel‚Äôs song came on. It was like a key to unlock my tears.

RE-WATCH VALUE
I would re-watch this if I have the time to in the future. I do feel like it was a few episodes dragged out/included unnecessary fillers. They could have utilized those few moments to explain more of the mom‚Äôs story or Moon Young‚Äôs. There were some loopholes but none that I was too stressed out on.

A time for healing
Honestly one of the best korean dramas I've ever seen. Everything's a solid 10. It's rare to find k-dramas that deal with topics of mental health and this one did and excellent job. Plus the chemistry between the couple and the other characters in general it's amazing. It's been a couple of days since I finished it but I still feel empty on the inside. I got so emotionally attached to the characters that it's hard to let go of their story. Definently will rewatch it in the summer when I have time.

A Wonderful Story
I followed this drama a while back, and was thoroughly moved every episode until the last.

I watched this drama without any idea of the hype around it. Scrolling through Netflix, and it just released a few episodes back then. Kim Soo Hyun of course, was one of the more notable names when I saw it, and from the moment I heard the soundtrack, I was hooked.

I will try to make this review as vague as possible. Only to highlight the parts where it felt most alive.

PROS:

1. All the characters had an arc and one way or another, were interconnected. They were also with flaws. Very human. And I appreciate the moments where you are reminded that it takes time for a person to change. When their individual stories moved on to their next chapter, you feel wonderful knowing what they went through to get there.

2. The acting. I can not stress enough how wonderful the portrayal of the characters were. Especially on the part of Moon Sang-Tae. Others would argue otherwise, but I have watched a lot of shows and movies where they portrayed people who are mentally challenged and one of the more admirable portrayals was done by Oh Jung-Se. Kudos to him. And to Seo Ye-ji and Kim Soo Hyun who remained consistent and careful with their characters throughout the series.

3. The lessons. They use stories and weave them with the lessons each episode has. It is subtle in a way, and gives viewers a different perspective in an otherwise definite idea of what it is in every episode.

4. The OST. I loved it. It fit the series perfectly. From the low, melancholic tunes to the more upbeat and lovely sounds. The OST was well used, and set the tone of the series well. Kudos.

5. The relationships. You can't really hate one character. How they are related, how they interact, it's so beautifully human that you feel for each of them. You might get annoyed with one, but after taking a moment to understand their character, you begin to grow with them. As they mature, your view of them does too, and I find that an admirable trait of this series.

CONS:
1. Near the end, there were some lapses and events where you would double think, and say ""Huh""? But the overall show is wonderful in itself that you can overlook that.

It may not be the same for all, but this is the kind of series that you go through once and completely immerse yourself to have all the feelings. The story may sometimes appear absurd, but the way it was portrayed and the interaction between characters is wonderful to note. The acting made the story more lively, despite its dark undertones.

When I rewatched it, I focused more on other production related decisions that took away the magic of watching it for the first time. Some may find this series a go to whenever they feel like it, but for me, this series is an emotional experience. It's a one time immersion thing. You can go back, but the first impact will not be the same.

However, the love you will have for the characters and their stories will remain. And hopefully, the lessons that they do to. If one should watch this story, yes, you should, but be prepared for a ride of feels.

It's Okay Not to be Okay <3
I honestly loved this drama from the get go to the end. It's not often that dramas will show everything, the good and the bad and still make you understand that the bad moments or bad circunstances also bring growth! Every episode taught a lesson with a very heart aching touch in such a tender way that was very healing. I had written many words for this review, I wrote in depth about every character and I could just press down send to all of that, but I really think that the sensibility behind the drama deserves not for me to tell everybody in full disclosure, it needs to be seen regardless and with no heads up, so watch it! It's more than worth it!

This drama is a gem!
Despite there being some inconsistencies( *spoiler*:
moon young's mother was shown being dumped into a river while in a zipped up bag,how did she manage to get out? The actress who played younger ko moon young's mother and head nurse seem to be of different builds/heights so it doesn't reallymake sense for them to be the same person*spoiler*) IOTNBO totally delivered on the emotional front and teaching life lessons so well that I'm willing to overlook all of that stuff. The acting was also top notch, the characters felt so real and endearing.The osts are all such gems I'm totally gonna be replaying them for the next few weeks.I also really loved the way mental health and it's importance were treated /portrayed in such a positive light.

Annnnnnnnd those outfits!
What a fun ride this was! The dark mood and music made it really enjoyable, and all three leads showed us their masterful talents. I especially applaud Oh Jung Se for the hard work he put into his portrayal of Sang Tae. He is a talented and heartwarming actor. I also want to mention Kang Gi Doong's portrayal of Gang Tae's best friend and life raft in the lovely Jae Soo. He is a fantastic supporting actor in all his roles.

Much has already been said about the acting talents of our main couple. Of course, Kim Soo Hyun is always such a thoughtful actor. You can tell he works extremely hard. And I was blown away by Seo Ye Ji's outstanding performance as Ko Moon Young. The costume designer certainly deserves a ton of praise as well. Those outfits were a real highlight.

A few things weren't quiiiiiite there for me though, especially near the end of the show, which was a letdown after the first 75% was just about perfect. First, I felt that the big reveal around head nurse Park Haeng Ja was done a bit sloppily. If you found out that a killer was running your hospital, wouldn't you move a bit faster, call the authorities, protect Moon Young, and all the rest? This didn't seem to happen. Secondly, when Moon Young finds out about her mother and what she did to Sang Tae and Gang Tae's mom, her reaction seems not to match the shock and pain of knowing. I felt her first 'breakdown' episode after thinking that Park Ok Ran was her mother matched the intensity of the revelation much better. And the way in which she 'healed' after learning about her real mother didn't quite fit either. I was expecting her healing to involve those who care about her as a way of showing she can open up to people through her growth over the course of the show.

A couple other more minor criticisms I have are:
1. The storybook that Sang Tae and Moon Young were working on was so important throughout the process but after a while it faded to lesser status. I thought it would play a major part in both of their healing journeys.
2. The cute couple Sang In and Joo Ri had potential but never took off. It was frustrating to watch them.
3. Moon Young's relationship with her father (and mother) wasn't explored with enough depth. The flashbacks of the past were mostly just scary images of both of them. Was he truly an evil person? Does Moon Young find some kind of closure around their relationship?

Overall, this is great show. The moodiness serves it well and the acting is fantastic.

A beautiful drama
I heard about KSH many years back due to his character as Do Min Joon and knew he was a sensation back then.
But it was only 6 years later that i watched MLFTS and came to know how great of an actor he was. When i knew he was returning with a new healing drama that deals with mental issues, i was worried that the show might be a dark and boring one. Thankfully i was wrong. There were so many light hearted moments, meaningful dialogue and mesmerising animations in this show that captivated me from the first episode. Just one word to describe this drama - BEAUTIFUL.

Beautiful storytelling
What i absolutely loved about the script was how the writer had a message behind each episode. Whenever MY or GT started telling the stories with their deep, raspy voices, i could not take my eyes (and ears) off the screen. The animations that accompanied their voices were simply stunning. But the story that literally blew me away was MY‚Äôs final book - finding their real faces. I was so touched by how the writer could tie everything up so wonderfully and tell the most perfect story at the end, with such soothing visuals. I will definitely buy the book if there‚Äôs an english translated version.

Beautiful acting
A highlight of this drama is most definitely the leads‚Äô intricate acting that can tug at your heartstrings. I lost count of the number of times i felt so frustrated with GT for being too soft towards ST and not giving him a chance to grow and be more independent. Every time ST gets upset with GT, my heart just breaks thinking about how tough life must have been for him his whole life. The most memorable scene for me was when GT was at the rooftop with JS, talking about his mum when he started tearing. I remembered looking at his sorrowful eyes and wondering how anyone could have such deep and beautiful eyes. His acting at that scene made me realise he really was just a small boy who wasn‚Äôt given a chance to grow up properly. And not to forget how he had a mental breakdown at the hospital. My heart ached looking at him trembling and seeking forgiveness. All in all, KSH is such a gorgeous actor with the ability to hook you with his emotions.
ST was also brilliant at portraying a character with autism. His stuttering, facial expressions and hand gestures were all so on point. I love all his scenes with GT and MY.
Kudos to SYJ for being able to showcase MY‚Äôs warm and humane side despite having to portray her arrogance and bulldozing traits as well. The scene where she was strangled by her father was epic. That look on her face and the tears in her eyes. Brilliant.

Beautiful ending
The last episode is simply the best. I couldn‚Äôt believe how everything was wrapped up so nicely and despite having some unanswered questions, none of that mattered anymore. No words can describe how much i loved the ending. The last scene left me with buckets of tears and made me realise how far the characters have come since the first episode. I felt like i was on this healing journey with them.

Beautiful music
Lastly, the soundtracks in this drama left a deep impression on me. I love them all, especially In Your Time by Lee Suhyun.

As with every drama, there were still some parts which i hoped could have been better. I didn‚Äôt quite like that the leads met each other when they were young, and also the mother plot line. However, as this is a character driven story as many have pointed out, i still loved the main storyline that focuses on the growth of the characters.

I have learnt a lot watching this drama and you would too.

Beautiful
Honestly I could spend hours talking about this drama but there is one word that sums it up perfectly and that is BEAUTIFUL. The whole story right from beginning to end is so beautiful and magical. There are only a very small handful of dramas that exist in the world that have that element of true magic and beauty and this is one of them. From the three main characters stories to the patients in the hospital, all their stories touched me to the point I shed both sad and happy tears for each of them.

As for the cast, well they couldn't have got better actors if they tried. The three main leads absolutely smashed it and made the characters what they were. I think it is incredibly hard to create a masterpiece unless the actors are spot on and make the character themselves which is exactly what they did. As for the the side characters in the hospital, both staff and patients well they were insane and they portrayed the roles as if they were actually them characters.

It is very easy to make the main characters come across as superior and take the centre stage constantly even when the focus is on another characters story but I think they balanced it out well. Yes, the story is obviously about the three main characters and their journey and development together so the focus is on them but when the story is about other characters too, IOTNBO perfectly balances it. And the final story that Moon Young wrote proves that. It included the story of the two patients that they helped move on and live a better life and honestly when they read out the story I shed a few happy tears because they were saying that without these people that they helped then they wouldn't have been able to help themselves either and it's true. I just loved that they brought in the other characters at the end and showed that by helping others you really can help yourself too.

The music and intro is so good. I could never skip the intro and when the music came in at certain points and just fit the scenes perfectly, honestly it added so much more depth to the story and acting (which was already amazing). They used several different songs repeatedly but it didn't feel like they were being overplayed or used at the wrong points, they were placed accordingly and it worked that way.

The re-watch value has to be a 10 because of how amazing it is. I just can't explain how much emotion this drama gave me. I felt for each and every character in many different ways and although I myself have struggled with mental health it still opened my eyes up to the different forms it comes in and how it can affect many different people in many different ways. I just found the story so touching and it was done so cleverly and thoughtfully that I think I could watch this drama over and over again and would still get all the depth and emotion ever time. Many dramas fail to do that even if they're amazing. Dramas tend to give you the feelings and excitement etc. the first time and you might want to re-watch it again but the next time might not excite you as much, especially if you watch it quite soon after. IOTNBO is the opposite, no matter how many times you watch it, every plot and every character still will make you feel something and probably something new each time on top of that too.

Obviously credit goes to all the cast because they pulled off a phenomenal show due to their insane acting skills and the three main cast made it what it is but I also want to credit some of the support actors. Specifically, Kwak Dong Yeon who played the patient Kwon Gi Do and also Kang Ji Doong who played Gang Tae's friend/ older brother Jo Jae Soo. That's not to say that I don't find every single character and actor amazing because I think the characters and cast couldn't have been better if they tried. It's just that I think these characters really touched my heart. The patient who's father thought he was so dumb that he didn't deserve to be his son and he beat him, locked him up etc. and then his mum loved him so much that to protect him she tried to keep him away from the family and pretend that she was disappointed and didn't love him. He saw through it though and actually he felt so much better after being able to speak openly about how he was treated, I just thought he deserved so much love and attention and the actor pulled it off perfectly. He deserves so much recognition for that role. Then there's the friend who was always there for the two brothers, looked after them, listened to them, protected them etc. and in return he always had to move around and never settle and he felt that he was only being given half of what he was giving them. Despite all he felt he still stuck by them and loved them endlessly like a brother would and the final episode where Gang Tae told him that without him, he wouldn't have been able to cope half as much as he did and that he needed him in his life, it felt like all this pain he'd felt that time had been eased and he realised that although Gang Tae never said how much he valued him, he valued him so much that words couldn't explain it. I just think that his character is amazing and once again it isn't an easy role to act so I just think that the actor did an incredible job.

I have so much more to say but honestly no time to and it'll go on forever so I think for now I have said enough

Best of 2020
Despite everything going on around the world in 2020, the drama community has been fortunate and blessed with dare I say one of the best dramas of 2020.

This is what a good drama is, it is thrilling, engaging and explores a complex issue seamlessly. I loved how they used fairy tales to explain some really difficult and complex issues, just be sure to know you will not look at fairy tales the same way.

I am sure you may have read a lot of reviews on this drama, I will tell you to just start this drama and you will not regret it.
Go with an open mind and an open heart and most importantly have fun XD

The 2020 Drama we've been waiting for
I think this is maybe my favorite drama that aired in 2020 so far. It's rad because there actually are a bunch of great dramas this year. Typically I wouldn't even hesitate to say any drama with KSH is my fave, but just all around this drama really hit the marks for me.

Story: Okay, so the plot really isn't anything special. There are a lot of common KDrama tropes and I would be amiss to not acknowledge that. BUT I think the writing was really good. For me, story is broken down into two categories: plot and dialogue/character interactions. So in this regard, IOTNBO is pretty meh plot wise but has FANTASTIC dialogue (which really relies on how well the actors pull it off and they totally did so it works). The story for me really revolves around character interactions and character development. The one thing that makes the plot go from boring to meh for me is that everything seems to have a purpose. Also, I really loved the three main characters. While the romance is good, that's not what had me coming back every week. I came back to watch Sang Tae and Gang Tae and Mun Yeong grow and develop as a family. I don't think anyone was really 'cured', which a lot of people were concerned about. Mun Yeong was kind of a b***h before, and at the end she's still a b***h, just a happier b***h. Same goes for the other two; they're always going to be some level of f***ked up. They fight and argue like a real family too! Not some perfect 2012 drama ending here where everyone is all lovey dovey and dusted with morning dew.

Acting/Cast: Over the last few years, I honestly kind of forgot why KSH was my o.g. drama daddy. But lordy, lordy he's back and all those emotions I had are resurfacing. Tbh, it's not even because he's physically that attractive to me personally, but his acting skills just get me going. So much talent in one person should be illegal. Honestly the highlight of my weekend is when he ugly cries so that I can also ugly cry and release all the emotions I've pent up during quarantine. I've never finished a drama with SYJ as a lead (I dropped Moorim School) but now with getting introduced to Woo Do Hwan, I'm all hyped to watch Save Me. Also, my bisexual ass was in love with her this whole drama. Most of the time I fall for the male leads cause they do be a snacc, but honestly if I had to choose between KSH and SYJ in this drama you'd really be tearing at my heart strings. But hands down, Oh Jung Se was my unexpected star of the show. My mom has worked with kids on the spectrum my whole life. It is so fantastic to see a good representation of someone and e honestly did such a great job. I'm a really big pusher for LGBT actors playing LGBT character, or asian actors playing asian characters, etc. The same holds true I think for characters on the spectrum, BUT I'm really grateful for his fantastic portrayal. He it the glue in the story. Without Sang Tae Oppa, or Oh Jung Se really, I think I would rate this drama an 8.5.

Music: The OSTs fit the theme but none were really my taste in music.

Rewatch: I've already started rewatching T_T I'm not ready to say goodbye...

TLDR; I've stopped rating dramas quite as high the more I watch. The acting is great, the writing is great, it has great cinematography, the production value is great, it just hits in all of the right places. I know that romcoms or hyped dramas with big name actors are not for everyone. But this drama is honestly top tier for my personal preferences, which is why I'm rating it so high.

NOT FOR EVERYONE!
This is a drama that revolves around three individuals who suffer because of their traumas from the past. This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health. I really enjoyed the animations that were incorporated into the film which made it unique as compared to the other kdramas.

What I loved most about this drama was the cast and character development. Kim soo hyun is famous for his works and this drama really showcases his talent. Each emotion was portrayed in a way that we felt the emotions with him. The sadness, happiness could be seen just by looking at his eyes. It's my first time seeing Oh Jung-se in a drama and all I have to say is wow, he's acting was remarkable. One of the hardest roles was given to him and he nailed it to perfection. The behaviour of a person with autism is a hard role to achieve but he brought that character to life. Seo ye jin was also a great addition to the cast, she fitted the role of being a strong female lead who acted cold to everyone but all she really wanted was someone by her side. The rest of the cast also perfected their respective roles.

At first, Oh jung se's character was a little annoying because he kept causing tantrums, refeused to accept son ye jin and didn't allow kim soo hyun to live his life his way. But by the end of the drama he became a strength to his brother (kim soo hyun) and helped to bring the main leads together. Kim soo hyuns's character at the start of the drama didn't know how to live his life, he kept living just for his brother and didn't even think about the things he wanted to do but Son ye jin's entrance helped him to learn to live life to the fullest. Son ye jin at the beginning did not acknowledge other people's feelings but by the end she became more compassionate and kinder to others.

Like every other drama, there are flaws but to me they are not noticeable enough to point them out. The relationship between the main leads at the start seemed toxic to me as the male lead had to oblige to all of the female lead's wishes. Also the female lead wouldn't leave the male lead no matter how many times the male lead asked her to. I am happy that at the end her behaviour changed so that she gave equal importance to the male lead's wishes.

Also the OST wake up was one of my favourites in the drama. I listened to it even after the show ended. This is not your flowery, lovey dovey kdrama fairy tale. This is a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes the concept of childhood friends meeting again and can stand a little bit of toxic relationships.

A TRUE MASTERPIECE !
(I'm a year late in writing this review but, I had to do it. So bear with me)
It's Okay To Not Be Okay is a drama that will stick with you for a long time even after you've finished watching it. Sure it's not our typical boy meets girl, fall in love, etc. kinda story. It is more than that, and there lies its beauty. It involves themes we often don't come across in many dramas and mainly focuses on the development of the main characters. They are people that have been through hell. (So much that we wish nobody goes through.) But that's what makes them what they are. The best part? They're all in it together as a team.
A very special shout-out to my most favorite character, Sang Tae, played by Oh Jung Se- he was outstanding. Kim Soo Hyun was wonderful as always and nailed his role. The only other drama I watched of Seo Ye Ji was Hwarang but, I don't remember her so well from it. Here, I can't think of a better actress to play Ko Mun Young. She slayed it. The way she brought out the many shades in her character was impressive. The rest were just as great.
My most favorite part of the drama was the stories written by Mun Young. They may come off as just normal fairy tales but the morals behind each of them were so touching and, they were in some way related to the characters.
It's Okay To Not Be Okay is one of its kind but, there is a teeny tiny possibility that not everyone will appreciate it because it is not a light-hearted drama that everybody can enjoy. But that shouldn't stop you from exploring it. If you're hesitating to watch it, go for it. I'm sure you'll be hooked in no time.

P.S. - Initially, I started watching this drama when it was airing but got invested in another that I failed to keep up with this and eventually put it on hold for more than a year. I feel so guilty for doing that because this gem was right under my nose and, I failed to see it. (Don't be like me)

Happy Viewing! :)

This drama is so beautiful and perfect!
I actually never planned to watch this drama as I'm not really a fan of Korean dramas (I prefer Chinese dramas). I thought it would be those clich√© dramas where I can probably predict what will happen next, but it isn't! There are so many plot twist that makes you shock every episode. I also fell in love with the characters, the story and the songs played throughout the drama. I even cried as I was watching this :( The actors were so amazing, everything felt real and you can see in their eyes how great they are at portraying their character. I love that this drama is not just your typically romantic drama, but it tackles the character's mental health/issues that most people also have in reality. I think what makes this drama so good is that a lot of people can relate to each of the characters. The main leads, Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji, have an amazing chemistry!!! When I watched the behind the scenes, they were so comfortable with each other and I was happy to find out that they were actually in the same agency!!!

Masterpiece
I may be a bit biased because I really loved it, to the point that I asked myself if this drama was just made for me!!!!!! Jokes a part I think this drama is really well made, to the point that even who dislike it has to admit it, because in my opinion there's really nothing to not like here, but I know that not everyone could like it, opinions and preferences are different for everyone and this drama is not an easy walk. The story, the major plot is the journey the characters has to go through to find themselves, then there's the thriller side and of course they intertwine as puzzle's pieces.
The characters are deeply scarred and they live their lives as aftermath of that, they become addicted to the behavior they started having because of their own traumas, misunderstandings and mistakes. They're judged for their surface and marked as what they're not. With the encounter of the three leads their lives start to change and their journey becomes even more tortuous, because sometimes getting better it's harder than staying still, they have to face not only their past but them selves too. It goes deep into their fears, insecurities, secrets and scaring moments of their lives and you can see how they're struggling to come out, you don't understand them until you get to know them and feel their pain too, I think it makes people think about lots of things, as struggling with their problems, with their past, with mental illness, mental disorders , judging..
The cast was amazing, their acting skills are amazing, not only the leads but all the cast, but yeah I found the leads out of this world, I fell in love with SYJ as soon as I heard her voice and when I saw her I was astonished, the way she portrayed KMY was perfect, every little gesture, I think her character is really charismatic, even if she appears as ""crazy"" it takes a very little time to understand that it's not all as it appears. SYJ expressed her emotions really well, making you questioning everything you just believed KMY was and wanting to get to know her better. KSH was really amazing too, he looked like a puppy in the drama, a worn out puppy, exhausted and tired of what life was serving him, MGT was locked up to a life he thought he had to do, in a behavior he thought he had to have, I think his journey was the most difficult one. Just watching him you could understand the pain. OJS was special, portraying MST he showed us the problems and the difficulties someone who suffer of autism has, he was really innocent and in his innocence he shows us so much maturity and truth about life, he deeply moved me, he did a really good job.
It's not only the story and the cast that made IOTNBO an amazing drama, but also the visual and the music, (with visual I mean directing, scenography, costumes etc..). The visual was beyond perfection and the music too, when I was watching it I was really captivated by how beautiful it was on screen and the music was perfectly put in it, the music too expressed the moments really well, as soon you heard the notes you understand, you start feeling.
I liked the fairy tale way to narrate the story and I liked the fairy tales too (I brought two of them!), you heard the stories and then see how they are reflected in their life, and also in real life, I think this is one of the reason why I liked this drama so much, in some of them even if not in the same way I reflected my self.
The thriller plot is great too, but being an healing drama you give more attention to other things but as every thriller you want to find out what happened, you want to know why MST is so traumatized about ""nabi"" the so scaring butterflies.

I purposely kept pushing It's Okay Not To Be Okay to the side because I knew I'd have to mentally prepare to watch it. I had heard so many people saying they cried while watching and with a title like It's Okay Not To Be Okay, I knew I'd cry too.
When I was first watching this I thought it wasn't that bad. No tears were even starting to form while watching each episode. I thought, what was everyone talking about? Then I got a couple more episodes in and I started to understand. I started to get more and more emotional with each episode I watched. Thank goodness they included comedy to lighten the mood.
There is a big twist in that happens and I was shocked when it did. Afterwards I got upset because I should have seen it coming.
This show is one that will be moving to everyone. Even more so if you've gone through something yourself. I've had a couple situations where I was able to relate to the characters so I was crying like crazy at some parts. I think they did a great job showing different mental health issues and how to deal with them.
A huge applause to the actors in this show! The fact that they don't even have to say anything and I can feel the emotion they're expressing is so impressive. The facial expressions were spot on.
I highly suggest for everyone to watch this! Just make sure you have some tissues nearby.

Hotel Del Luna type vibe
Likes: Kim Soo Hyun. When you see someone that cute, that broken, it brings out your inner noona. Seo Yeji as the unabashed FL and her amazingly low seductive voice. Their chemi. Those kisses. The dark storybook element. Oh Jung Se's terrific performance as KSH's autistic brother. THE DEER. I don't know how they thought of putting that Deer into the story, but I can tell you, it cracked me up EVERY. TIME.

Dislikes: Have you seen SYJ's waist in that pink dress? You have? Good. Please tell me what happened in that scene because I was too busy wondering if SYJ was human.

What I loved about this drama was the FL's brazen personality and unabashed pursuit of the ML. It was refreshing to see that. It was so much fun watching KSH's reactions to SYJs unfiltered flirtiness. Their chemistry was great. They also had a great chemistry with OJS who did a great job acting as the autistic brother. The relationship between the brothers is a complicated one and had many layers that I found touching and heartbreaking, The dynamic between SYJ and OJS added the comedic moments that I enjoyed. I also liked how the drama dealt with mental health, specifically KSH's emotional struggle to balance his guilt, reality, and his own feelings.

I don't know if it's because both dramas were created by Studio Dragon, but the vibe of this drama is very similar to Hotel Del Luna. There's this sort of haunting darkness and I really loved how they weaved the dark children's books through out the story. I wished though there was some more skinship between the leads. Darn Deer! eeeeeeOWWoo

Lovely from beginning to end!
Incredible script and great cast and good production. Solid performance by all the actors.
There were times I really felt the chills run over my spine and times when the tears ran over my face. Besides the great build up, the comedy written in the dialogues had me laughing out loud many times. Really one of the best dramas of 2020. You will not be disappointed. I really liked it. Now I'm curious what other projects the writer has done and what she might do in the future.

P.S. The actor playing Ssang-tae, Oh Jung Se has done an phenomenal job. The way he portrayed the mannerisms is absolutely spot on! A complete change from his role in 'When the Camelia blooms'. It completely changed the view I had of him as an actor.

Warm My Heart
I love the cast chemistry make me laugh and cry with them. Big applause for Oh Jung Se !!
Since this is Kim Soo Hyun drama i have big expectation and i'm so satisfied

I love the final episode OST :)

Animation in each episode make it more interesting. The story somehow is predictable but that's not a big problem it's still a roller coster ride (which is typicall K-Drama ) you can laugh in beginning and cry in the end episode
So far for me this is the best K-Drama in 2020.

I will recommend this drama

Really good healing drama
This drama was just awesome from start till the end! Loved how the main characters grew with each other and learned to really love themselves and the people around them.

Even the side characters were very interesting and were all thoroughly developed.

The drama had funny elements to it and really, really touching moments as well where you literally can't help but have tears roll down your cheeks.

The main characters matched so well and you know they have good chemistry when you wish they are an actual couple in real life.

I have nothing bad to say about this drama as it had it all!

this drama will get you hooked
everything about this drama was fantastic but it will not be everyone's taste as it's not your typical kdrama. I personally like this drama because the female lead was strong and I'm tired of the continuous naive and foolish female role but despite her being strong, she was a bit toxic/ crazy but that made me enjoy the story even more. The casting was picked by God's hand, I especially like the male lead's brother acting the most. This series is a rom-com but it also a bit dark which makes it more realistic, even the side characters were perfect in acting their role and you will never got bored of this drama. I 100 percent recommend this

A beautiful and refreshing story on trauma, mental health, and the healing journey.
As someone who enjoys intense, action-packed dramas, I would say It's Okay to Not Be Okay (IOTNBO) conveyed a completely different message and feel - in a good way. However, it's definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend it to a K-drama newbie as there are many nuances that can make the drama seem ""too slow"" or ""boring."" There are also common K-drama themes embedded throughout the drama, so it's not something completely new - but the genre and storyline are what separate this piece from the others.

This drama shows what trauma (and healing) is like through the perspective of three characters - Moon Gang Tae, Moon Sang Tae, and Ko Mun Yeong. All three characters struggled with their own inner demons throughout the show and eventually conquered it through their relationships with each other. It's a raw and emotional perspective of trauma, and displays the truths of how difficult it can be to really overcome your past pains and struggles. I truly enjoyed watching every character develop and grow into who they were meant to be, alongside one another. I did have questions I wanted answers to - specifically about Ko Mun Yeong's mother - but they ultimately didn't affect the closing of the drama. The story came to a good end, with no strings left untied.

The acting was superb, especially Oh Jung-Se who played as Moon Sang-Tae. There were many scenes he played that made me emotional beyond belief - it was so hard to detach from his character, even after the drama ended. Seo Ye-Ji and Kim Soo Hyun are obviously masters at their art as well; their chemistry was off the charts and they definitely lived up to the hype!

Music was a 10/10. But I AM a Heize fan, so I might be biased there. ;^)

All in all, I'd say this drama was a refreshing piece. It's heavy, but not TOO heavy - so you can definitely enjoy it and even rewatch it if you wish. There were definitely great takeaways, and it has a soft spot in my heart.

Wow just wow
Now usually I don‚Äôt usually like watching these kind of dramas, which is why I was a little hesitant to watch this at first because I usually get bored easily, but after seeing how much hype this got I decided to give it a go. Gotta say it was definitely worth the hype. Once I watched the first episode I was absolutely in love with this show. If a show is done right then even if it was a non interesting subject it could be very interesting. I loved this show from beginning to end and would recommend it to everyone. The acting was amazing, the soundtrack was amazing and the show is just aesthetically pleasing.

Quality narration, quality story and quality acting.
First of all, the subject of the series is very beautiful and different. The theme of love in classic Korean dramas is not the main issue here. So the drama doesn't just make you a regular love story. It blends this narrative with love while slowly showing behind the scenes of two beautiful brother relationship and past events. The way the story is set up, the quality of the production and the great performance of the actors are worth watching this series. The general mood of the drama and Seo Yea-Ji's beauty and acting were one of the things that got me most tied to the drama. We're used to seeing female characters a bit more passive and monotonous than male characters in Korean dramas. But the main female character in this series is a dominant, very different and interesting character. I can say that my favorite series is this series for now.

How is the mother alive?
I loved this drama but my one complaint is that the writer never tied up the storyline about the mother. Did MY‚Äôs father kill her mother or was that just a hallucination the father had because of his brain cancer? For me that was the only loose end. The acting was stellar and I would like to see the leads paired again. They had great chemistry!

The actor who portrayed Sang Tae really deserves an award for his acting. This was a really difficult role to portray and he did it beautifully. I loved his Declaration of Independence at the end. It was heartwarming and beautiful. I laughed out loud during this drama and cried more than I would like to admit.

It's Okay To Be An Emotional Mess After Watching This
It‚Äôs Okay To Not Be Okay has everything I love and seek out in dramas and in stories generally: Deeply flawed characters, a cold, fashionable female character, who pretends to have no feelings, a slow-burn enemies to lovers storyline, complex, lovable side-characters, a beautiful, emotional OST, a magnificent, mysterious cursed house, gorgeous costumes, emotional slo-mo scenes and deep meaning.
And it gave me something else I didn‚Äôt expect: A main character that I could relate to and that made me think about the way I‚Äôm living my own life.

My older sister is not autistic. But she has a lot of issues. She doesn‚Äôt work, is plagued with depression and panic attacks and when she‚Äôs upset, she acts like a child, throwing a fit, locking herself in, screaming and crying. It‚Äôs very hard to calm her down.

My parents never told me that the reason they had me, was so I could take care of her. But sometimes I think that is kind of what it has turned into. I live with my sister now and have to deal with her fits. Sometimes, I feel like I will have to live with her for the rest of my life because she will be lost without me. And it‚Äôs burdening. But she is also safe for me because as long as I have to live with her, I don‚Äôt have to go out into the scary world. In a way, we are both holding each other back, just like Sang Tae and Gang Tae.
It‚Äôs Okay To Not Be Okay left me feeling ready to spread my wings and find my own happiness.

I loved the way this drama deals with mental illness, trauma and disability. It was very tasteful and hopeful. At first, I thought the residents of the hospital would only have very minor roles. I was pleasantly surprised when we learned about each of their stories. Despite touching upon some dark subjects and being at parts gloomy, the drama never drags you down. I never felt bad by the end of an episode, because it somehow manages to always maintain a positive atmosphere - even when there's a sad or tense cliffhanger.
The way different fairytales are woven into the story is a wonderful idea and very well executed. I also really enjoyed the non-linear storytelling. Of course the fairytale theme is also reflected in the production design - which is nothing short of marvelous, the cursed castle being my favorite set. Ko Moon Young standing on her balcony in her white nightgown, walking down the big staircase or writing in the huge gloomy study... every scene in the Cursed Castle is so aesthetically pleasing, underlined by the hauntingly beautiful OST.

The acting of the whole cast is outstanding. Especially Kim Soo Hyun ‚Äòs and Seo Ye Ji‚Äôs portrayal of their characters deeply touched me. I watched this after Seo Ye Ji‚Äôs scandals came to light but it didn‚Äôt influence my enjoyment of the drama and her role at all. I absolutely adore her in this role. Whether or not the scandals are true, she is a brilliant actress and the perfect fit for the role of Ko Moon Young.

I think one of the things that touched me most ‚Äì and I imagine will touch most people, is that Gang Tae loves Moon Young for who she really is ‚Äì with all her flaws, cruel sides and unreasonable outbursts. I think we all have some darker sides and mean streaks, and we feel like we cannot show these if we want to be loved. Seeing this incredibly flawed character being accepted and loved the way she is, made me very emotional.

Up to episode 13, I would‚Äôve given this a perfect 10/10 score. But then I found the plot twist with the true identity of Ko Moon Young‚Äôs mother a bit much. To be honest, I would‚Äôve preferred it if her mother had been dead and truly haunting them. The scenes where Ko Moon Young has sleep paralysis and sees her mother‚Äôs corpse, are absolutely genius in a ‚ÄúThe Haunting of Hill House‚Äù kind of way and I would've loved to see the drama go a bit further down that lane. Her mother was also written as too evil, in my opinion. She is the only character that is completely black and white with no humanity to her, which was a bit of a disappointment after 12 episodes full of very three-dimensional and complex characters. I'm not a big fan of pure evil villains - I find them way more interesting when we see some reasons why they became like this.
Nevertheless, this will go on the list of my all-time favorite dramas. And I knew it would be so by the end of the first episode.

It was absolutely brilliant and touched me deeply. I enjoyed every moment of these wounded, lost characters finding their way to each other and finding their happiness. During the montage of their trip with the camping van I cried like a baby.

PS: Moon Gang Tae showing up for the photoshoot with his hair gelled back had me literally scream out-loud. What a gorgeous man.

An absolutely phenomenal viewing experience.
Personally, I love shows that explore mental health and human psychology, so that on its own was already a good enough hook for me. However, I think what completely sold me was the aesthetic value of IOTNBO. In terms of cinematography, I thought that the shot transitions were incredibly well done; in particular, the ones that stuck with me were 1) the manic episode of a patient in either episode 3/4, 2) the scenes where we had young Moon Young, Kang Tae and Sang Tae film with the adult versions of the three main characters. Accompanied by an overall amazing OST, the entire production of IOTNBO is an artful masterpiece.

Script was super well-written - there were a lot of thought provoking statements scattered across the entire show, and I felt that each scene was so thought out and significant to the plot. I want to give kudos to the author for having been able to keep me on my toes every weekend. I was always excited for the next episode to come out, so I think it's safe to say that my weekends will never be the same again after watching this show. One more thing that I guess falls under the script category would be the lessons that can be derived especially from the stories written by our female lead, Go Moon Young. Although the fairy tales were really short, I thought that they were relatable and carried such deep meanings.

Another beautiful thing about IOTNBO was the costumes and sets. I greatly admire the costume director's attention to detail when it came to dressing the characters. When you have a chance, you should check out the online articles talking about what how she came up with the concepts behind each character's costumes. I harbor the same feeling for the set designers - my two favorite sets of IOTNBO were the dining room and kitchen in the Cursed Castle, and Director Oh's office in OK Hospital. I thought they were both very charming and I loved the color palettes for and the knick-knacks that they had in each room.

Now for the actors and the characters they play. In general, I thought that all the characters had depth and that they were very lovable. Some of the supporting cast also made things a lot more lighthearted knowing the fact that IOTNBO was a show with some pretty heavy themes (honorable mentions to Ahjumma, Director Oh, Head Nurse Park, Joo Ri, Sang In, Seung Jae and Jae Su). However, I think for this essay of a review, I will focus on the character development of the three main characters of IOTNBO.

Seo Ye Ji as Go Moon Young was out of this world. Cold and unable to overcome the demons of her past, Moon Young grew up having feared her mother her entire life. Despite that, Moon Young was incredibly perceptive and was able to see through people, almost always doing the right things for those around her. I'm glad that as the episodes progressed and Moon Young learned to be more empathetic, she gradually began to understand what it means to love and be loved. I couldn't imagine another actress who would've done Go Moon Young justice.

Kim Soo Hyun also did a really good job with Kang Tae, and I liked how after being so lonely for so long, and having to fend for himself and his brother, he learned to open up and lean on others as the series goes on. I think throughout this whole show, Kang Tae was the character who had to take on the most emotional burden. But since his default is to protect those around him, he ends up neglecting himself. Towards the end of the show, he learned to face his problems head on, and also started putting himself first.

Our final main lead was Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Tae, and man did he nail the role. There are so many nuances to Sang Tae's character, and the fact that Oh Jung Se was able to capture all of it was amazing. Sang Tae's character development was the most prominent and heartwarming. and the way I like to see it is that while Moon Young and Kang Tae's development was like an upward curving arc, Sang Tae's development was more step-wise. He sort of takes in everything and processes the information, and then applying whatever he has learned to his life. Sang Tae learning that blood does not equal family, and understanding that overcoming his trauma will help him protect his loved ones, moved me beyond comprehension.

All in all, I think that IOTNBO was a cinematic genius. With many scenes that sort of made me sit back and think about what was going on, I was granted the opportunity to make open-ended assumptions and references to other scenes. I really enjoyed talking to my friends about the drama while watching it, having discussions about the mental health themes and applying the lessons I learned from the drama in my own life. A very important takeaway that I got from the drama was also that most problems in life aren't as big as we think they are. We just have to gain the courage to look them in the eye, and take the steps necessary to overcome them.

Worth Watching All The Way
This drama touches many subjects and it has just reached one of my top dramas that I will think of when people ask me about my favorite. There are psychological subjects they touch on for health and they really hit home sometimes. The show connects with you on an emotional level. Also the female lead has such a bold character it makes it so enjoyable. The chemistry between the leads is one of my faves I've seen so far. i highly recommend people to watch this drama because it has story, humor, and touches on real life problems. It's not just a fantasy world where everyone is happy. It's real.

ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS: MUST WATCH
LOVE THIS SHOW!!!
The Netflix has to add TRIGGER WARNING to this as it will trigger a lot of people and in ways, one wouldn't expect.
I am going to write reviews to individual episodes so my review here will be shorter and doesn't contain spoiler.
I have been watching the show with a friend and I generally share with her my thoughts after every episode and she suggested I write it as a review. She said after reading my thoughts, she could connect things better in the episode so giving my first ever try in writing individual episode review.

This show is heavy so I can only watch 1 episode per day. It feels like I went to therapy for an hour and I am processing all the emotions after. Everyone, literally everyone from all the supporting cast to lead actors to folks who wrote dialogue and director and writer: DAMN!!!! such AMAZING job..
All have done such amazing acting and the emotions portrayed are on point. There should be more shows like this in all languages so that it reaches to many people and creates awareness about mental illness and wellbeing.

How diseases like hypertension, blood sugar and all needs medicine and also lifestyle changes to keep under control, this shows portrays along with medical professional help, environment/family/friends we grow up around have huge influence in how we can all heal.

Most shows which talks about mental illness usually don't show the illness per-se but these folks have done amazing job in-terms of showing how people suffering from mental illness ""see"" the world and ""feel"" or understand different emotions.

Such a positive message about healing is possible and we need to find our crew and stick to it and we can do it!
Fighting <3

'It's okay to not be okay' - A drama that will pull at your heartstrings and make you FEEL.
This is my first review ever! I just finished the last episode of 'It's okay to not be okay'. What can I say, it was a perfect ending for characters who went through quite a rough ride that is their lives.

I felt very blessed, happy and warmth to be able to witness this wonderful story. All the actors, director, scriptwriter and staff involved did a fantastic job which left me to keep wanting for more.

Don't hesitate and go watch it. It will make you feel, the good, the bad and everything in between.

There are so many good and outstanding moments that I don't know where to start.

I felt like the three main characters lived their whole life trapped, chained to the ground and unable to break free. Through their interactions and character development, they were able to break free from shackles that can't be seen with the eyes.

These are the main messages that I will takeaway with me:

- You are not responsible for other people's actions, especially family members.

- You are not stuck in the life you have always known even if you firmly believe so.

- You have the right to love and be loved.

- You have the right to be happy and know that you also bring happiness to other people. As one character said: 'To make the people around me happy, I have to be happy first. So being selfish isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. If it‚Äôs too hard, just think about your own happiness.'

- Everyone on Earth needs approval, especially from family members.

- Having mental health problems does not make you inferior. Happiness may require a few more twists and turns but it is not impossible.

- You don't have to be alone if you feel lonely.

- The bond that exist between you and your loved ones is the strongest (even stronger than Hulk). So believe in that bond and lean on each other.

- Be patient towards each other and communicate.

Overall this drama taught me that we can heal each other. We don't have to feel trapped, we can find keys together to set ourselves free.

A perfected ribbon of words, acting and production that winds it's way into your heart
I've watched every episode atleast once, reviewed several episodes and read almost 17 thousand messages about this drama. It is perfection. This story turns a mirror and magically reflects a portion of each viewer's life and I found myself, especially towards the latter half, letting an emotional tide wash over me, fill me and then had the ability to let a few memories and emotions wash away. If you watch it, be prepared to have an emotional journey all the way to the end. As far as acting, the entire cast deserves credit and there is not enough space allowed for a dissertation on each. Each person in a roll became that roll and blurred my viewing lines as to where the acting began and the person portraying the roll ended. The absolutely worst part of ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" is the fact that it ended but now, I'll now watch it again, slowly, and crawl over the details first missed.

A drama worth watching for its very unique and beautiful plot
This is the first time I cried a lot over a happy ending. The drama tackles a unique topic about mental health and it does not focus solely on the main characters. There are other side stories as well.

Mental illness is a very crucial circumstance that some of us face and it's an unfortunate thing that one has to suffer. It is a topic that everyone should take seriously because it is not easy for those who have it.

One thing for sure... You will never regret watching this drama because it has a very good plot or I should say the best compared to other dramas where mental health is the problem.

For me I think that the main point of this drama is the title itself... IT'S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY. For those who have mental health issues--- It's not your fault that you have it. It is okay not to be okay. You will eventually overcome it. Don't give up and don't dwell on the past. Move on, keep going. ~For those those who don't face such thing--- It's okay not to be okay. You suffer as well, endure it and don't be afraid to let it out. Cry and don't hold it in.

It's okay not to be okay--- for all of us. Do not be afraid to express yourself because only you can find a way if you do it. You can shout, scream, curse and cry. Let it all out and find someone to lean on. Show how you really feel. We are all human; expected to not always be fine. We are not alone, we shouldn't be. Find someone who can help. Find someone to lean on-- don't be shy. It is fine to not be fine. IT'S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY.

You're not some robot without a heart. Some metal that's so effin' hard to bend. Some ghost- unseen and others should be afraid of.

You're a human. You have a heart so you get hurt. You're like a glass that can be broken when not taken care of. You are an existent being who breathes the same air and so you should be seen, you should be acknowledged for who you are and be helped when you're in need.

Loved it
Just finished watching this Kdrama. It is just wow. It is a different kind of story and I really liked it. I liked the story, the cast, acting and the OST. It is about people who are not okay and tells us that it is okay not to be okay! All the lead characters have their personal shortcomings and a painful past. It is a roller coaster ride of sadness, love and funny moments. It shows us what it means to be a family.
Seo Ye Ji is fantastic in her portrayal of Ko Mun-yeong. I loved seeing her anti social character. Kim Soo Hyun has always been an amazing artist and his chemistry with Seo Ye Ji in this drama is great. Oh Jung Se as the older brother was too good . Supporting actors also did a wonderful job. Overall it is a nice drama and you should really give it a try.

Be prepared to laugh, cry and think for days....
This show is thought-provoking, funny, sad, real, light-hearted, intense, romantic, has great family values, is respectful of mental health issues and brings much needed perspective to an important topic.

Costumes - spectacular, Acting - Amazing - by entire cast , Script - soooo many good lines.... Enough well placed, well used comedic breaks to make sure you stay mentally safe - and adds to the rewatch value...

There are so many themes to follow and many have been addressed in the other reviews. I have found myself making up alternate names for this show, not that It's Okay not to Be Okay is bad, it is just that many themes resonate. Some that come to mind: ""Love Yourself to love others"", ""Sang Tae defeat the butterflies"", ""Gang Tae's Hyung"" , ""The village that raised Gang-tae"".. ""Saving Min Yeung and Gang Tae"". etc...

It'd Be A Full Lifeless Drama Without Sang Tae's Character
¬´Warning : Viewers discretion is very advised in this drama. Bad traits from FL, it should only be an entertainment & any of her character's behaviour should not be glorified or followed.¬ª

I came watching this drama without any expectations at all. Despite all the hype from last year, I knew it from the trailer & synopsis that it's gonna be a 'hit or miss' kinda drama. I would rate it a ""Miss"". Why?

1)I'll be honest, the overall plotline & premise is not that appealing for me, I don't know but I felt that this drama is lifeless. The ONLY thing that carried out this drama is Moon Sang Tae's character. He's literally a ball full of sweet & happiness. This drama would be much better if all of the side characters got more spotlight and each mental healths problems that every characters had in this drama were brought up & addressed properly.

2.)The background story between the mainleads (Gang Tae, Sang Tae & Moon Young) in the lake is lifeless too. I didn't felt any connections just like another drama ex : ""Kill Me Heal Me"" or even ""What's Up Secretary Kim"" 's background stories. It was pointless. The writers only wanted to show the connections between the characters and the impact was not successful for me.

3.)Instant chemistry between Moon Young & Gang Tae, BUT despite all the skinships scenes, it's also lifeless. I was like ""Damn, that was fast. It's hot but meh"". I felt like their relationship is actually not healthy and overly complicated. I resembled their relationship like Joker & Harley Queen/Beauty & the Beast's. I know that we can't blame love as it's not something that we can control. But mainleads desire & obsession towards each other is not healthy at all. Even tho it's 'crazy', I agree that they can't live without each other. They had their own demons that no one would be able to handle it other than themselves. Nevertheless, I REALLY HOPE that all the viewers will be wise enough to tell that it's not something you can follow.

4.)Satisfying last two episodes but I had this complicated feelings on the aftermath. Despite the 'rainbow' ending, I still feel that this drama still had this dark shadows lurking over the characters. Well, if you think abt it, the catchphrase lived up to its name ""In the end, It's okay to not be okay""

5.)Endless plot holes here and there. The biggest one would be Moon Young's mother character. Her background story & PoV should be more addressed. I already anticipated the twist, but unfortunately the writers misplaced the last conflict in the last three episodes, so it felt rushed out in the end. We didn't get to know her character's full story. It was actually the most interesting & promising plot line for me. It'd be much better if this drama cuts out unnecessary scenes in the middle of this drama & decided to pull off this plot line sooner.

6.)(Spoiler alert) The scene between Gang Tae, Moon Young & the patient couple outside the hospital really triggered me. How can Gang Tae fell for Moon Young's manipulative behaviour and forgot that one of his patient is an alcoholic who tried his best to stop his addiction more importantly, how can he woke up not telling his brother where he was, and not paying attention to his patients that already went out? It's a good thing that the guy is a responsible person. I can't imagine if he actually ran with his girlfriend. Sigh, Gang Tae is actually not professional at all. I'm disappointed in that scene.

Things I wanted to applaud :

1.)Cinematography (No doubt, hands down to the production team making beautiful shots with great lightning set & angle)

2.)Costumes : I ADORE all of Moon Young's wardrobe. But I often think ""Damn, how big is her wardrobe?"" She literally always changed clothes for every occasions. It's a eye candy for the viewers (like Hotel De Luna).

3.)The act: 10/10. Special shout out for Oh Jung Se for bringing out Moon Sang Tae's character alive. I even forgot that it's an act, you'll see every single details that he brought on his body language. Top notched acts!

4.)Heartfelt moments between the mainleads & side characters. The trio mainleads are indeed flawed characters with tragic past & fate. But I'm glad the production team brought the whole family idea. They are not perfect but together they can 'defy' the world.
‚óèSang Tae (the oldest/hyung, often misunderstood but he's the 'wisest' of all, kind hearted & full of forgiveness & hope),
‚óèGang Tae (The backbone/pillar of the family, trying his best to be selfless-pressed his own desires & emotions),
‚óèMoon Young (Their nightmare & their salvation. Very flawed but tried to change for herself & her family).

5.)Values & Quotes. Damn this drama is like straight out of novels. It's full of quotes and lessons to be learned. They are warm and heartfelt. I love quotes from Moon Young ""You have to face your nightmares & fears to know happiness & strength, as you're a child that will not grow up if you decided to erase those painful memories"". I also love how they connected the storyline in each episode with different fairy tale. It worked and it made me wanted to make my own fairy tale..

Values : Love yourself, believe in other people esp your own family-lean on them if it's unbearable, face your demons and strive for happiness from it & yeah I agree with It's okay to not be okay, don't linger on the past but don't forget it. Eventually in the end, all things will resolve on their own.

Conclusion : Watch it! Despite my criticisms towards this drama, but I recommended for you to watch. I can't deny of the show stealer of this drama : the trio mainleads chemistry and Moon Sang Tae's sweet character. You'll cry, you'll laugh, it's a roller coaster full of feels. It's not a perfect drama but it's worth your time. Enjoy the ride and tell me what's the moral story from this story?

Would rate it : 7,5/10. ‚ù§

The Best Show on Earth - Its Okay not to be Okay
This is a beautifully written and if you let it‚Äîit will change your life. It's Okay Not To Be Okay has touched a deep, deep place within my soul. This book is filled with hope and truth but not in a ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù way but in an authentic way with so much heart and even grit. This kdrama has quite a lot of cliches but still some of them are really good. It‚Äôs okay to not be okay is one of those few dramas that keeps you hooked and has a completely different setting rather than the ordinary romantic dramas. The show captures each point beautifully and keeps you wanting more. This show is not your regular kdrama. It has something different about it (in a good way) that makes it one of my favorites. Each episode has a theme based on a fairy tale or fable and I just love how by the end of the episode everything that has happened ties back into that story providing so much food for thought. The pacing of this drama is amazing and just right. Each character is given enough time and scenes to fully demonstrate their development and growth. A 1hr 25 min episode goes so fast that before you realise it the episode is nearly finished leaving you crying out for more!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND this drama!

Wonderful, Unique and Deserving
For me, this is the best drama in 2020 so far. It does what it promises to do, tackling psychological issues and bringing healing to the viewers. The acting are top notch, and the chemistry between the leads are undeniable. And don't get me started on the music, it's perfect. The lead understand's their character very well and portrays them in a believable and unique fashion. If anything, the weakest part of this drama is probably the story regarding MY's mother.

It's been a long time since I have such a feeling after watching a korean drama. The last was probably ""Goblin"". And the best thing is even the simplest of scene or actions are capable of bringing the feels to the viewers. Overall, I loved every moment of watching this drama. Come learn some valuable life lessons and be healed emotionally by the end of the drama.

The Power of Healing
""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""

This line from ""Rocky Balboa"" seemed to ring loudly in my mind as this series concluded for me. Indeed, no one goes through life unscathed, and some take even greater lumps than most. However, no matter what we've suffered, it's perseverance that matters most. Not giving up. Always push on.

To my mind, K-dramas are dominating the television airwaves. While I have watched a few bad ones, most have been anywhere from great to superb. ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" certainly fits the ""superb"" bill for me.

As several reviewers have already mentioned, this is a very unique series that deals with the mental and emotional suffering that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. Perhaps that is what makes the series so relatable as well as profound with the central question: when do people finally acquire the courage to take responsibility for their own lives?

For so many people in this world, we blame our parents for our misfortunes and our sufferings. Why didn't they love us more? Why did they mistreat us? Where was that unconditional love we were supposed to be showered with?

Unfortunately, the answers we tell ourselves are filled with as many lies as the questions we come up with. Perhaps we weren't worthy of that love. Perhaps we simply weren't good enough. No matter what answers we contrive in an attempt to ""makes sense of it all"" we, too often, play the victim.

Gang-Tae is a caregiver at a local mental hospital. His body is riddled with scars given to him by patients who have lashed out at him. However, his physical scars pale in comparison to his emotional ones. In short, he truly believes he is not worth loving.

Sang-Tae is Gang-Tae's older brother with fairly severe autism. He suffers from a moment in the past when he was present for his mother's murder. The murderer threatens to kill him should he ever tell anyone about it. So scarred by the event, Gang-Tae placates his brother by making sure to move every autumn of every year. He somehow wants to be free of his burden.

Ko-Muen Young is a woman who was touted as a princess by her mother; someone who is head-and-shoulders above everyone else. And people should be treated with disdain and contempt for being so beneath her. This is a woman who has no idea how to interact with people. She had no filter, and therefore, speaks her mind and her feelings, both good and bad. She is a little girl desperately wanting someone to love her.

The irony is that all three characters, in some way, shape or form, represent some of the most common fears and desires of every single person on this planet: to be worthy of love, to be relieved of our fears and burdens, and to simply be loved for who we are.

The series masterfully navigates how all three characters are able to find peace with themselves, and perhaps, even some joy culminating in a last episode that will have you smiling and crying at the same time.

Yes, it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to fall. It is okay to be knocked down. It is not okay to give up and stay down. Everyone must find the courage to get up and keep going. That is the series' central message.

The performances in this series are top-notch all the way around. However, accolades must truly be given to Jeong-Se Oh (Sang-tae) who turns in a performance that easily rivals Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" In fact, to my mind, Jeong-Se Oh's performance surpasses it. He is truly deserving of any awards he might acquire for one of the best acting performances seen in a long time.

This series has almost everything: a mystery, laugh-out-loud moments, heartfelt moments, cringeworthy moments, and plenty of relatable moments, depending on who you are.

I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It should almost be required viewing. For perhaps, you might find some ""healing moments"" of your own as you watch this show, and be presented with the question: will you blame others for your problems? Or will you find the courage to begin living your own life?

A beautiful fairytale with characters you will learn to love like family
This drama is a roller coaster ride of emotions. You will find yourself crying, smiling and swooning over the chemistry these actors have. I think everyone will find a connection with the characters in this drama. At times it will be Kang Tae other times Moon Yong and sometimes Sang Tae or even the Patients. The love these brothers have for one another is just heart warming. It will move you to tears. The love story between the leads is just as sweet. The chemistry there is on another level. I have never seen this kind of chemistry in a kdrama. It‚Äôs just electric. And the kiss scenes are not disappointing at all. You will be amazed by this wonderful couple. This drama focuses on character development. They will grow so much along their journey that you can‚Äôt help but fall in love with them. For me especially Moon Yong is such a lovable character. You may find yourself wondering what is so lovable about her in the beginning but you will fall for her as you get to know her on this journey.

The story is intriguing and you will find yourself wondering at every episode what will happen next. How will things turn out? Are they going to heal their wounds?

This drama will teach you that we all have problems and issues in our lives and life is cruel sometimes but the important thing is that you find something that‚Äôs keeps you going. Cause even if everything seems dark and cold. It‚Äôs only the end if the end is happy. Let‚Äôs work together and push trough it till we find our Happy End and let‚Äôs remember in our journey to the end that Its Okay Not To Be Okay.

simply amazing
I can't even begin to describe how much I adore this drama! From the characters, to the story, to the cinematography, everything about this drama is amazing and addicting (thus why it took me less than 2 days to finish it).
It has an intriguing plotline, an AMAZING cast, good twists and it will have you swooning in a minute and crying in the next, so it is completely understandable as to why it has so many good reviews and so much hype. To anyone who is still questioning themselves on whether or not to watch this, you most certainly should!

One of My Favorites
I'd heard a lot about this drama and it had been on my radar for quite a while. I loved every minute of each episode I watched. I loved seeing all the characters grow in their own way. In the first episode Mun-Yeong was cold and emotionless and seemingly didn't care about anything. In truth she was sad and lonely and suffered from a lot of darkness.

But as the series went on, she began to show her true self and in the end was able to break free from the darkness. Seo Ye-Ji gave a great performance as Mun-Yeong.

Kim Soo Hyun, one of my favorite actors also gave a wonderful performance as Gang-Tae. Gang-Tae was a young man who had spent all his time running away along with his brother Sang-Tae. He'd always prioritized his brother and shut himself out to feeling anything for anyone else. I loved seeing him let his walls down as the series went on and he realized he didn't need to live for Sang-Tae and finally started living for himself. He realized that he belonged to himself. I also loved how his relationship with Mun-Yeong grew.

I also loved Sang-Tae. Though he was autistic, he still showed he cared for and loved those around him. He protected Gang-Tae and Mun-Yeong when he needed to and I was so proud when he stopped being afraid of the things from his past and found his true calling in the end.

Another thing I loved was the implementation of Mun-Yeong's stories in the episodes. I loved seeing the illustrations and thought they were a cute touch.

The supporting cast was also wonderful. Each of them all grew in their own ways.

Perhaps my favorite thing about this drama was its theme of family. Gang-Tae and Sang-Tae had lost their mom (which Sang-Tae was witness to seeing resulting in his trauma) and Mun-Yeong had suffered her own trauma as a result of her upbringing. But the three of them were able to overcome those traumas and become their own family.

This was a show about healing and letting go of the past and learning that it's ok to not be ok.

I loved this drama and would definitely would watch it again. Definitely one of my favorites.

Masterpiece
From the first minute I knew it‚Äôll be a 10/10 drama. It was something new and I knew that I‚Äôll like it. It was a journey about self-discovery, healing, loving yourself, accepting you for who you are, overcoming your past and demons, loving others and helping them.

I really liked the fairy tale thingy and how it was included in everything not just because Ko Moon Young is a writer. It was more like ‚Äòreality‚Äô than a fairytale. I also like how KMY approached the topic of fairytales and explained the moral of them in a different perspective. I applaud the actors for their splendid work! They did a great job in portraying their part, especially OJS. I‚Äôm not really familiar of him, but his acting was impressive, whenever I saw him acting as MST I think if it was a real person who has autism spectrum disorder is acting. I had to stop and search about him cuz he wasn‚Äôt just acting, it was so real. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôll get a lot of awards for this.

And the music/OST just hits differently, every song played was perfect for the scene they were played for. My favorite is In Silence cuz it really hits close to home. I‚Äôm addicted to it!

I learned a lot of things from this drama and it opened my eyes about thing I‚Äôve been avoiding, there are a lot of scenes and quotes in IONTBO I enjoyed, especially the scene where MGT said ‚Äú I love you. I love you, Ko Moon Young. Yaaahh I said I love you! ‚Äú lol it was funny how he is now in her place and she‚Äôs the one receiving it.

‚ÄòFamily is not about blood. ‚Äô
‚ÄòThe bystander is worse than the abuser.‚Äô
‚ÄòJust because you‚Äôre the parent doesn‚Äôt mean I belong to you nor does it mean I‚Äôm obligated to give you my organ, especially after what you‚Äôve done.‚Äô
‚ÄòStandup for yourself‚Äô
‚ÄòFight your demons, don‚Äôt let them hold you back.‚Äô
‚ÄòKiss, don‚Äôt fight.‚Äô *wink wink*

Overall, every actor‚Äòs part was breathtaking and done professionally. It‚Äôs refreshing watching a drama that‚Äôs so different from the usual dramas, especially one that talks about our society and addresses a lot of issues beside mental health. Thanks a lot to the writer, director, producer, actors ( main, support and guest) and everyone for producing this amazing drama!

Stop What You're Doing And Watch This Immediately!
Hands down the best k-dramas I've ever seen. It's the only k drama that I have ever watch where all the actors completely nail the acting! Like no one disappoints, the acting is stellar and chemistry is unparalleled. This drama is one of kind. Kim So Hyun and Seo Yi Ji have raised the bar in terms of what chemistry is. I can guarantee you find any male leads and female leads that mesh as well as they do. Can't forget Oh Jung Se either his acting will honestly blow you away. Everyone will blow you away! Legendary without a doubt, to everyone who watches k dramas and to those that don't this drama is a must watch for sure!

It was definitely different. I loved the atmosphere of this drama, the creepiness of the cursed castle, the creepiness of the fairy tales, the creepiness of the culprit. I loved the relationship among the main three, the love they had for each other, the fact that each of them had his or her own flaws, that they all made mistakes they needed to take responsibility for, it made them feel 3D. I loved the cinematography, the costumes - wow, Ko Moon Young‚Äôs dresses were really something, just wow! - and the music, too, the main song was so catchy! And I loved all the patients in the psychiatric hospital, I loved that the writers went that extra length to give them all their own personalities and stories, that they weren‚Äôt just props.

What I cared little about was the relationship between Ko Moon Young‚Äôs publisher and the young nurse, that one didn‚Äôt really click with me. I also didn‚Äôt like how the publisher treated his assistant. Sure, the girl knew how to use her young looks to her advantage but that didn‚Äôt justify his behavior towards her.

Overall, an excellent drama that I can highly recommend.

Simple yet beautiful.
Not your typical complicated storyline, this show showed us how things can get so beautiful when you don't expect it at all.
One thing that I think is so important is how to accept yourself how you are and try not to change it for others. Kangtae fell for Moonyoung when she was the most antisocial person he had known, but still, he fell for her. Why? Because he saw her scars and how she suffers when she's alone. He didn't fall in love with her money or her fashion. He loved how Moonyoung was fragile despite acting so strong.
The dialogues were so precious. I guess every episode of this show had a different message.
The acting was 1000/10. I mean, just by looking at their eyes you could easily understand how they felt at that moment.
The only thing that made me score the story 9.5, was Moonyoung's mother that I think it was kinda illogical but I'm glad they weren't too sticked on that storyline.
Overall, enjoyed it so much.

Socializing
This drama is not for everyone. It won't sounds good but it's for those people who understands deep thoughts, meaning of hidden concept or whatever. This drama shows how you will connect with different people who aren't normal or have different characteristics. But I'd highly recommend to watch and I'm sure it's worthy to watch. As a Kim Soo Hyun fan you have to watch this and Seo Ye Ji also nailed it in this drama. It's a great comeback for Kim Soo Hyun. If you're fickle minded then it may feel boring to you. But it won't be waste I hope so.

Near perfect drama
It's quite hard to put into words just how excellent in every way, this drama is.
Screen writer Jo Yong and director Park Shin Woo really nailed it, together with a cast who so eloquently brought their characters to life.
Gang-tae, who becomes a care giver at the OK Psychiatric Hospital, seems completely balanced and together, but has closed off the life he shares with his autistic older brother, Sang-tae. Moon-young, a children's author, is totally self absorbed, feisty and used to getting what she wants.
The meeting of these characters and the journey they embark on, played out in the drama, to understanding themselves and others, feels like a dark fairy tale at times, however it is very real. Their emotional stories and those of the hospital patients, are both very funny and moving.
I especially liked a guest appearance by Kwak Dong Yeon as patient Kwon Gi Do, who had me reaching for tissues.
A favourite actress, Kim Mi Kyung, plays Kang Soon Deok (Joo-ri's mother) so well; she was actually a linchpin, to me.
There were no clich√©s that  I can think of at all and no overly sentimental scenes either. It was actually adult in its presentation and very honest.
A scene in the final episode, shows how grown ups should be portrayed in a relationship... it can be done.
Every actor was great, but for me, Oh Jung-se deserves an award for his perfect portrayal of Sang-tae. He made the character very central, important and one that evolved possibly more than any other.
This is one of those rare dramas that I cannot imagine anyone saying they did not like it at all.
I am going to miss this so much and will definitely watch again.

Beautiful Heartache
AMAZING!!!!!! Incredible plotline and actors!! Each character had his/her own role in the story that was critical. It was such a pleasure to see all the characters grow and develop to their best self. It is rare to see the lead characters so dynamic. Typically, it's one character healing another. My favorite aspect is that they all healed and loved each other. It's so amazing how another broken person is able to be fixed by someone else who is also weak and damaged. I also really really love the depth this drama went into mental health. This is a touchy topic especially in Asian country. For a Korean drama to really explore the consequences of mental issues, it is really touching and beautiful. I can guarantee smiles as well as teary eyes. This drama does not disappoint. HIGHLY recommend.

Something different from the usual
It‚Äôs okay to not be okay goes beyond what‚Äôs ‚Äú normal ‚Äù and accepted by society, it shows characters developments and human ignorance to an educated level I never seen before in a kdrama, I‚Äôve watched a lot of kdramas and they somehow just don‚Äôt show mental health problems as they should be and that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs okay not to be okay stray from it and actually shows a more realistic side of it, in simple words I think this is the best serie I‚Äôve ever watched so far.... The episodes were so charming till the point it made me want for the episode to never end, it‚Äôs okay to not be okay indeed exceeded my expectations.

note to self: you know the serie is good when 1 hour feels like 10 minutes

Give this a try!!You won't regret it.
I know that this drama is not your cup of tea, this is a ""HEALING DRAMA"" so please do not compare it to other Korean series with different concept/genre.

What convinces me to watch this is because of the title, In this world, we pretend to be ok although deep inside we are not OK, sometimes as we seek help other might think we are just exaggerating things, another reason is the storyline, this is a healing drama so I just give it try. I also watched this because of Kim Soo Hyun, but I ended up being a fan of the other main lead Seo YeJi and Oh Jung-Se because their acting is really out of this world. I am going to miss the Trio!!

The moral lesson here is to accept to ourself that sometimes we weak and we need to lean each other to become stronger, another thing is to be polite to other people we deal every day because you never know what are they going through, this drama also tackles mental health and about autism awareness.

Overall this drama is beyond my expectation 100/10, although the plot is simple, not all about the romance about the female and male lead, it is well balanced from the romance of the 2 main lead, family-oriented(blood-related or not), comedy, suspense, and thriller could also be here, also there is a life lesson that we can carry on forever.

A beautiful heartache
I love a show where I am so engrossed in the alternate universe it has created, and‚Äîwhen I‚Äôm done‚Äîleaves me in awe of the team of people who have created it.

The score is perfection. It reminds me of my favorite regency pieces while seamlessly interweaving modern pop and it plays the balance game so well. Furthermore, when there was no BG music was even more notable. This drama goes off the beaten path so often and with the skill that is only mastered in the way a team of experts with freedom could.

While it diverges from the norm with the score, it also announces its uniqueness in the first episode by mixing mediums of animation, claymation, and beautiful wardrobe. You‚Äôre not immersed into an alternate reality: In fact, the characters‚Äô world is identical to yours. Yes, they believe in love and there‚Äôs sadness, but the power of the mind is its own character as much as it is IRL, and rightfully so.

I was most uncomfortable by the treatment of people with social and emotional disorders. Let me be clear though: It wasn‚Äôt ham-fisted, haphazard, or even irresponsibly done. As someone who frequently discusses these treatments in her line of work, I am always √ºber conscious of characters portrayals when those characters are on the fringes of society due to no fault of their own, and kudos to this show for its very deliberate effort to be responsible. Oh Jung-Se is perfect in his role as a brother with autism spectrum disorder, and he acts only in a way that he (and maybe Lee Kyu-Hyung!!!!) could.

Though, all the actors deserve their props. Every Adam‚Äôs apple and unfocused peripheral hand was in character, and these actors have superb control over their vessels to perform as they did for this show. This cannot be done without an amazing team, and so, everyone involved in the making of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Okay...‚Äù deserves 10 stars.

Hands down the best beginning to a drama I've ever seen, but ended a little flat.
I decided to watch this drama as the leading couple was too powerful to pass up. I also saw the interesting mental health theme and thought it would be something akin to My Ahjussi and Hotel Del Luna. Obviously, I was really excited because I've been waiting for the next masterpiece that will challenge My Ahjussi and oh boy did the beginning deliver.

Story - 9/10
I just want to say that if this drama didn't begin the way it did, I would've given the story a 7.5/10 maybe 8/10. The first few episodes formed, what I believed, to be the strongest start of any Kdrama ever. The introduction of complex mental health issues and the enchanting presence of Ko Mun Yeong really captivated and hooked me; I was practically longing for each next episode. The early middle episodes (for lack of a better phrase) managed to maintain that momentum, and I truly believed that this level of quality would be maintained through to the end. However, it was the introduction of a particular story line that, like every other Kdrama, meant the two leads had an intertwined childhood and therefore they would have an ill-fated relationship. This, to me, kinda felt lazy?
For such a great start I felt that they had to introduce something that completely blindsides the average Kdrama user. My problem with it is that, with my favourite Kdramas, I don't think of them as a Korean Drama - rather I think of it as a piece of art. This sort of predictable and overused childhood trope makes this a typical drama.
My next problem with the last few episodes is the somewhat disappointing way the mental health issues were handled. I don't mean that they offended people, but rather the exploration of it wasn't deep enough. Sure, they took brief looks at issues like PTSD, but I don't think they explored the mental health issues behind the two leads enough. In the end, it seemed like the children's stories just explained and scratched the issues in uninteresting exposition. To me, there were too many situations where someone says something profound and suddenly the person listening realises what is wrong with their life.

Cast - 10/10
Not much to write about with cast. Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji were amazing. Many scenes were honestly Oscar-worthy, and they both had immense screen presence (especially Seo Ye Ji). Kim Joo Hun was charming and I really look forward to him in Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol. Oh Jung Se was also amazing and he had some very impactful moments. He also had some very on-the-nose moments that were a bit too profound and enlightening that seemed like lazy writing more than anything. Overall an amazing performance from the cast and I'm sure many awards will be handed out for them.

Music - 10/10
Very story and tonally fitting music. Some of the songs really amplified the scenes itself. I feel as though the music gave the drama a certain tone that is really distinct from anything I have ever heard before. It's hard to put into words - it has a creepy vibe, but you always feel there is warmth close or somewhere, which really fits with this drama!

Conclusion - 9.5/10 Overall
I definitely recommend this drama. This drama has landed comfortably as one of my second favourite dramas, and a re-watch will be warranted sometime in the future! If you want a tear-jerker, there are some scenes that will make you cry - although I didn't cry myself. If you want to just admire the lead couple, then this drama is perfect for you. If you want to feel a little more enlightened about life, then this drama is perfect for you too!

Introducing Reality Through Fantasy
Best drama! It's more than a kdrama, it's a life lesson that will change your perspective towards the people around you. Best acting, best production, best soundtracks, best cinematography, best animation, and the most amazing thing about this drama is the writing!

Story - Such a genius story about reality that is delivered smoothly through fairy tale stories. You will realize another perspective of some famous fairytale stories and how it relates to our everyday life.

Acting/Cast - No more questioning, we will be dazzled by the main leads visual, plus their acting is daesang worthy. Many people commented about how they have to win an award for their acting in this drama. They could make the viewers cry with them unconsciously.

Music - All the OSTs are amazing and some of them have that spooky vibes melody. All of them are good that people can't choose which OST of this drama is the best. The same goes with me.

Rewatch Value - To be honest, I am not that type of person who like to rewatch a drama/show. Maybe I could rewatch a show after some years later. But this drama made me rewatch it even when the show is still airing. Because there's a lot of details which I probably missed before and I feel like I have to absorb every emotions and lessons from each episode.

Just Watch It!
Seriously, I would recommend not even reading reviews and just dive in to form your own opinions of this drama. If you're into melodrama, badass leads, female chasing the male first, darker stories, found family and a side of comedy, then I 100% recommend this kdrama.

Story: I feel like I've read a few reviews/comments from people saying that this dragged or was overrated but I loved the story and never skipped. It was a unique melodrama that honestly had me crying way too much. I found myself completely invested in the storylines and characters and this has become one of my all time favourite kdramas. Obviously, if you're looking for a light fluffy drama, then this isn't for you. But if you're into deep/4D characters, with even deeper stories, then look no further.

Acting/Cast: Wouldn't change a thing. The casting was perfect and the acting was truly amazing. And the chemistry was incredible. The ML and FL had some of the best chemistry I've ever seen.

Music: LOVED the soundtrack! It was so good and I found the songs getting stuck in my head.

Rewatch Value: an 8 is high for me when it comes to the rewatch value of a kdrama! I rarely rewatch anything but this is a drama I would definitely want to rewatch in the future.

Overall: WATCH IT! I hesitated with watching this for a year until I ran out of things to watch and finally decided to give it a go. I don't regret it at all.

GOOD, DESERVING OF PRAISE BUT NOT THAT MUCH
I really don't know how to even write a review for this drama. The first half of the show was amazing, suspicious, tense ish,. The second half of the show was just.... absolute disappointment
The only reason I didn't drop it was for the main lead and just to see how it will end

OUTFITS
I loved the female lead's outfits, some of them. Some of her outfits were outrageous terrible. But anyways she's got good charisma and was lowkey giving me female lead from graceful family type vibes

STORY
Story was interesting at the first few episodes then the story just poofed into the air. Most dissapointing thing in the show was the mother. There was no background or motive for her mother acting like and killing for the most petty reason ever. It's quite unbelievable but on a good note the first episodes were really good and made you wonder what happened

CASTING/ACTING
I loved all the cast. It was perfect. Male lead can really cry but other than that nothing impressive. The brother was such as a sweetheart but lowkey annoying at the same time. His character was done beyond perfection

CHARACTERS
Loved all the characters. male lead was really bugging me sometimes but i love him despite. The female assistant is so damn cuteeeee. And the girl that has a crush on male lead is quite pathetic but that's just my brutal opinion

MUSIC
I dont remember anything so... idk

REWATCH VALUE
I will probably never watch this again cause the show got really tiring but anyways I never end up re watching a lot of kdramas

OVERALL
It was okay. First half gets a 8.5. Second half gets a -2.5

My favorite K-Drama
My first impression was that they looked good on the poster, so, okay - i will watch it.

But after watching the first episode I was already in love... i simply loved everything on this, the plot, the actors, everything was incredible and I am thankful for being able to watch such an incredible tv series from South Korea, considering I'm Brazilian and It's quite new for me (thanks, Netflix).

For me was quite a lesson about mental health, family and love. I consider this a MUST watch!!!

I really can't get over how good this drama was. The story and the OST were both amazing but was amazed me the most was the characters, they chose just the right actors and they portrayed the characters amazingly well that I can't think of any other actors who would have this same chemistry that the 3 leads had.

The story was very intresting because it's not your everyday kdrama story, all 3 leads are hurting inside due to past trauma. The characters really stand out in this show. I loved how they added a flair of horror and thriller into the story with certain aspects like the whole person humming in the hospital and also Mun Yeongs mum being introduced and let me say this, I have never been so shocked in my life for a reveal like that becasue you would not expect it to be the head nurse who looked really kind and also looked nothing like the mom we see in the flashback scenes.

First of with Gang Tae, I really enjoyed his character becasue on the outside he was a was character but on the inside he was hurting a lot. For 20 years Gang Tae had to look after his autistic brother by moving from place to place and changing workplace just so they can live a decent life. When Gang Tae was a child I felt sorry for him because he got neglected as a child because his mom having to look after Sang Tae. When he finally starts to open up and take off his mask after meeting Mun Yeong, you could say that the time that was paused for him has finally resumed and he can start to emjoy his life again. This is also my second drama seeing Kim Soo Hyun act since 'My love froma star' which was my second ever drama so yeah its been a long time and I really loved seeing him in a drama again.

Mun Yeong was such an amazing character, she was so complex yet so simple at the same time. We first see her as a cold hearted person who doesn't know how to love and is wanting love from someone because she's been alone for her whole life since 20 years ago. We start to see glimses of how shes really living in episode 4 when she has a nightmare and Gang Tae found her and hugged her to clam her down and this event really showed us and Gang Tae how much Mun Yeong is suffering and how much help she needs. When she was a child, she got the exact opposite to Gang Tae and recieved too much love to the point you could call it obssesive love from her mother as she was shaping Mun Yeong to her liking. When she met Gang Tae as a child we could see the realy Mun Yeong as a child but then when we thought it was okay, her mom stopped her from metting him so she couldn't change. Something I loved about Mun Yeong was how much she accepted Sang Tae who had autism and became his bestfriend. I know that it's hard to handle someone with a autism like Sang Tae and could emphasise on both ends. I saw Seo Ye Ji in 'Lawless Lawyer' and I didn't know she had this side to her so I will definetly watch more of her dramas for sure.

Both Mun Yeong and Gang Tae had amazing chemistry as they were opposites and they went hand in hand since they brought out the hidden side of eachother. Thier romance was really heartwarming to watch because they had to face many obstacles and they jumped them all and at the end of the finish line there was a happy ending.

Now with Sang Tae's characters, he made this drama seem that much more real. He was such a pleasure to watch and had such amazing character development. He went from saying he owns Gang Tae and noone can have him to saying that Gang Tae belongs to Gang Tae which it was probably really hard for him to accept that reality but after seeing his brothers smiling face when he was asleep he realised this it was his real happy face looked like and he couldn't help but admire it. This scene really made me tear up becasue this was the scene that made Sang Tae realise how beautiful his brothers realy smiling face looks like. When we first see Sang Tae, we see him as a persone who wasn't independent and needed people to help him but near the end when he got over his fear of butterflies her gained his independence and ever left his family to go work on illistrations which showed us how much he grew up.

These 3 leads were amazing to watch as the trio had such amazing chemistry and I cant think of another trio in a Kdrama that are better than these 3. I will really miss watching this drama and I will for sure rewatch it in the future to relive the joy I got from watching it.

The OST was very good as we got OSTs from Heize which is always amazing to see and also the OST 'In Silence' and 'Im Your Pyscho' By Jannet Suhh were amazing, she really pulled it out of the bag in this drama.

If your looking for a warmhearted healing melodrama with amazing acting and an amazing cast then i reccomend this drama becasue it will really make you lose ypur thoughts on the real world and focus entirely on the Drama becasue it will really make you forget your thoughts on the real world and focus entirely on the Drama's world.

The memories issues are the best in this drama
The slow way that episodes goes, helps us to suffer together with the characters. I was a little surprised with the more than 60 minutes in the drama and sometimes it is not necessary to transcend more than this to show us the plot. But this is not a big problem, because they know how to involve us in the pain/love/friendship scenes with the different stories.
The remarkable part in this drama is when they present us how our memory from childhood can trick or fragment us in the present. The traumas and the sadness part in this show was realistic and sensible one. In my opinion, this helps us to understand how relationships are diverse, how these issues are complex and how this can affect humans in many ways. It was a good form to introduce how it's not helpful to judge others when we don't know how difficult it is to lead with traumas and with an internal struggle all the time.

In my opinion it was the best drama this year.

WOW
Just an absolute masterpiece of a show. Loved the cast, the acting, the relationships among all the characters, the chemistry of the two main leads, the brilliant OST, and one of the best female leads EVER!
The chemistry between the leads was off the charts, and also Oh Jung Se was just perfect as the elder brother, who slowly understands the meaning of being an older brother, and the fact that he can be one too, regardless of his autism which he initially thought of as a hindrance in this role. He learns to stand on his own feet and the leads sail off in their own lives to discover new things together.
This show was heartfelt, and the story perfectly depicted the three main characters and a period in their lives when they discovered painful memories and combed through them together, creating a new family in the process.
Just a really lovely show. I have seen it twice already.

The visuals are immaculate
I'll be honest; I would've watched this drama even if it had a mediocre plot because Seo Ye Ji (Ko Moon Young) and Kim Soo Hyun (Moon Gang Tae) are so good-looking. I enjoyed the chemistry a lot. The story was actually pretty good too. I loved how they used fairytale books to help tell the story; it was very aesthetic. I also liked how mental illness was the main focus, which brings to light the mental struggles that people deal with every day. One negative about this drama is that at one point, I was pretty far into the drama, but at the same time, I didn't feel a connection with the characters at all; they still felt distant. I would not rewatch this, but there are some scenes that are definitely worth rewatching.

Great series and OST.

Oh Jung Se was such a revelation. After watching him, I cannot imagine any other actor potraying his role. For me, he totally carried this series to success
First time to watch a drama with Seo Ye ji. She's soooo pretty! love her smile.... Can't wait to see more of her

Last saw Kim Soo Hyun when he made a cameo for CLOY. Compared to My love from the Stars, this series showcased his acting chops even more

I also enjoyed how the writer ties up the fairy tales to real life situation. And although, I enjoyed it, wouldn't be rewatching it. Rather, would download their OST

Artistic, Therapeutic, Beautiful Drama
A drama with artistic & therapeutic themes that scream at you through it's painfully real characters and their complicated stories. It's Okay to Not Be Okay is a beautifully orchestrated drama with fresh, creative characters that come alive as they each learn what it means to truly love themselves and each other and in this way they find healing and happiness alongside each other.

One of my favorite quotes of the entire drama, ""Hurtful, painful memories. Only those with such memories buried in their hearts can become stronger, more passionate, and emotionally flexible. And only those can attain happiness.""

I have to say, wholly impressed by our cast and their acting abilities. There were many friendly faces for me in this drama, actors & actresses that I have already seen and liked, but even still, I was shocked at the level of talent that was portrayed. Kim Soo Hyun as Moon Gang Tae, had such a gentle, nurturing aura as he tirelessly gives and gives to those around him; supports everyone with very little support in return. But his character held such silent power and strength as well, which made him so appealing. Moon Gang Tae's care for/relationship with his brother made me tear up constantly. Seo Ye Ji as Ko Moon Young is fierce and wild. It is no overstatement to say that she commands the screen with her presence. I loved watching her sly demeanor and quick wit run wild, especially as she interacted with Gang Tae; her unabashed confidence and aggressive pursuit of him (and his body lol) was hilarious at times and also made for some extremely captivating romantic moments. You could feel the chemistry between Gang Tae & Moon Young even as Gang Tae was wise to be cautious of interacting with our admittedly unpredictable, sometimes dangerous Moon Young. My first drama with Seo Ye Ji and I hope to be seeing more of her! And now this brings me to Moon Sang Tae played by Oh Jung Se. *STANDING OVATION* Wow. The way he portrayed Sang Tae's mannerisms, his posture, his speech, every movement of his hands and glance of his eyes was exceptional. I think a lesser actor could have very easily over or under emphasized some of Sang Tae's persona but Oh Jung Se had the perfect balance. I loved that Sang Tae was an an integral part of the drama throughout, that he wasn't cast aside when emotions and drama heated up between our main couple, but rather he became the rock that both Gang Tae & Moon Young needed; Sang Tae, the one that everyone thought was the weakest, rose up and became the strongest for all of them.

Moving on from the cast, (although all were amazing I don't have it in me to write for each) I have to say the dialogue in It's Okay to Not Be Okay was very strongly and creatively written. Every interaction between the cast was meaningful and either strengthened relationships or corresponded with the overarching storyline. The stories in Ko Moon Young's books were so disturbingly captivating and had such hard truth to them, not to mention the illustrations in the books was breathtakingly creepy. I am so glad they put so much emphasis on her books as her fairytales were ways of seeing into her mind and understanding why her character was so twisted. I have to say the psychological aspect to this drama was definitely the most intriguing part, and there was a depth and heaviness to many of the emotional scenes because that is where the mind leads us sometimes, to dark and heavy places. But the momentum and the chemistry between the characters kept things exciting and kept me feeling renewed because even when characters had to go through some really intense and difficult internal struggles, they rarely had to go through them alone; and afterwards, they arose stronger and braver than they were before.

I will probably edit this review as I want to add more as I have so much more left to say; but in the event that I don't, I strongly recommend this drama if you enjoy the psychological aspect of things, mental health, things of that nature. The romance also heavily drives the drama and the one between Kim Soo Hyun & Seo Ye Ji's characters is quite thrilling and entertaining. Personally, I loved every minute of this drama and am crushed that I have finished it. Between my laughing, giggling, crying, wailing, grinning, and beaming, this drama solidified itself as one of my all times favorites and thus has landed on my Favorite K-Drama's List.

AN ALMOST PERFECT DRAMA
IOTNBO will be one of the most well-made kdramas of all time.. from acting to cast to the direction and story everything was very detailed..
this drama put forward the hidden talent that is seo yeji.. she looks very petite but comes off very powerful as ko moon young.. she is now one of my favourites.. after her i liked oh jung se as moon sang-tae.. he had the best and most natural character development out of the 3 main characters and the actor did an amazing job.. kim soo hyun was also good as moon gang-tae and i loved his chemistry with seoyeji.. the trio hand great chemistry together and their combination scenes were a treat to watch..

what i liked about the drama-
1. SEO YE JI as KO MOON YOUNG. no matter how much i say it wont be enough to describe how amazing she was in this drama.. i love her voice and smile..
2. THE TRIO
3. LEE SANGIN AND JAESOO. they stayed with MY and GT without expecting anything back.. the best human beings out there..
4. DIRECTION, STORY, CINEMATOGRAPHY
5. THE FAIRY TALES. i loved how they narate an episode or the inner torment of a character through a fairy tale. it was unique.
6. ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DRAMA.
7. CHILD ACTORS. THEY WERE ALSO GOOD. the actress playing young MY is very pretty..
8. LAST EPISODE. all's well that ends well. this drama has one of the best ending.. not rushed at all and every character had closure.

what i dilike about the drama
1. THE MYSTERY AND REVELATION OF THE MOTHER.. this almost destroyed everything good about the show.. this was so flawed that it overshadowed some good scenes in episodes that gave importance to the mother and her mystery. due to some episodes trying to create the mystery i couldn't enjoy good scenes. my mind got occupied with the mystery.
there is no proper explanation on how the mother survived or how exactly she managed to fake a normal life for almost 20 years.. she is too creepy and psychotic to act normal for 20 years and fool and manipulate everyone around her including experienced doctors.. this is the reason why the show couldn't be a 10 on 10..
2. somewhere in the middle nothing major happens in the show and the character growth also gets stagnant but thats just for a short period.
3. sometimes i couldn't understand the emotions of the characters and got distracted by the extravagant set and camera work and wardrobes..

the last episode was so satisfying that at the end we dont remember the flaws of the drama and only the good things stay with us.

Wholesome, different, unconventional, interesting and a much-needed drama.
I was skeptical at first, but I started the drama because of my love for the character played by Seo Ye Ji in ‚ÄúSave Me‚Äù. Then, I thought she was such a great actress. However, in this drama she exceeded the general expectations and showed how versatile and equally good can she become to portray a character so realistically.
This drama touches a very sensitive topic and that is mental health. Unfortunately, it is still a taboo here in this era. However, I am very glad that this drama broke barriers and showed various kind of situations and problems which actually exist in this world but is often misunderstood and misinterpreted. The plot was very carefully constructed. Developments were shown in a very synchronized manner, beautifully.
None of the characters were out of place. When I say ‚Äònone‚Äô, I mean none of the characters in the drama were there, just for the sake of being there. Everybody had a story, everybody had an equally important role to play. The planning and the execution were on point. Moreover, the direction of the drama was unique and fresh.
Kim Soo Hyun played his part really well. He was seamless and was absolutely impeccable, when showing emotions. He did a great job portraying the character.
Oh Jung Se did a phenomenal job. I first saw him in ‚ÄúWhen the Camellia Blooms‚Äù, but here he just stretched his acting spectrum to a great length. He studied his character very well and the efforts showed itself on-screen beautifully. Even in still photographs he completely owned the character.
The cameo by Kwak Dong Yeon was very effective and can also be comprehended as a very important turning point in the story. Though it was a cameo, he left a very strong impression on me as a viewer through his perfect sketch of the character.
Overall, the character development was drastic, but in a good direction. Props to the actors for pulling off such a concept flawlessly.
On the other hand, I felt like few characters were driven by their insecurities and that made them act selfishly more than once. However, opinions are subjective so few things were there which I thought could have been toned down a bit.
The setting was a countryside. The easy, no-city-rush, freedom and care was shown in great detail. The gothic, vintage and fairytale vibe added to the charm. The cinematography and editing were great. The acting was so on point by all the actors who took part in the drama. The outfits as explained by their team were carefully designed for each character and their respective situations and it really showed the efforts they put in. I looked forward to the development of the drama and the storyline and I am absolutely satisfied.
This drama made me ride a rollercoaster of emotions, be it warmth, curiosity, compassion, sadness or happiness. It is just so well-made. Moreover, I am definitely going to remember this drama and the things I learned from it.

Throughout the drama you'll see people are experiencing some or other problems in their respective life,this is drama will tell how people heal themselves and face their problems.mental illness is a issue which no one can talk about because on that bases the society judges you but this drama by it's title only told us that IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY.In everyone life their is moment when you need someone support or you want some to stay by your side and that's okay humans are weak.Some times to overcome your fear ask for help:)
1.Animations and illustrations in 1st episodes and also the in other is praiseworthy. The screenwriter and director did a great job i should say.
2.The romance between leads was perfectly balance

6.The mystery they came kept till end which will make you excited to watch next episode.
7.This drama's rating were not give fairly by AGB nislen i hope you don't judge it on that this wasn't a family drama this drama need s a lot more of understanding.
8.The plot was presented beautifully by the director.
9.Every episode has a story which will be too intense to understand.
10.The cold hearted Moon Young aka Seo Yea Ji will impress you with her selfish , arrogant and rude behaviour yet want to be person with emotions around Gang Tae n Sang Tae. Moon Young mother gave a terrible past that's why she became cold hearted but still she is a warm hearted who just acts cold to stay strong.
11. Gang Tae aka Kim Soo Hyun tried to discover himself. He was always tied up responsibility of taking care of his brother.he was called a coward by Moon Young but he still tries protects his love ones.

Since no one has reviewed this master piece, i guess i should take the wheel and tell people that how good this drama is cause boi are you missing out. I am writing this review on the second last episode (yes i couldn't contain my love for this drama)

Story: Ahh where do i start?????? LIKE AWESOME. The story is everything. Its so different and unique. Shines the light differently on mental health issues. I love how they show different mental disorders and each patients background stories. The characters like dont even make me start on how much i love each and every character especially meonyong. I love her character and also sangtae.

Acting/cast: do i even have to tell you that this cast is superior? I think we all that. Seo Yeji and Kim Soohyun nailed every aspect of their character and also Oh Jungse like he perfectly executed the most complex character in the whole story and i feel like he doesnt get credit for it.

Music: dude the best osts after goblin and scarlet heart (sorry lmao) the best music. Love it

Rewatch value: i could 1000% rewatch it no matter what. I am watching this with my mom and she literally told me that she wants to watch it again.

Overall: its a gem. Please watch it. There was not one episode that disappointed me or bored me. The rhyme of the drama was impeccable like you dont feel tired. Each episode was exciting to watch and the chemistry between the main leads... oof dont, it came hard and fast. Like you can feel their chemistry in your bones. This is one of the best kdrama in the history of kdrama no scratch that dramas! Pls watch it. I know u wouldnt regret it (well its up to your taste too)

Byee

I wanted to like this drama so bad. It got so much hype, and I did like the initial episodes, so maybe someday I'll go back and finish it.

But.

Right now, I just can't get over how manipulative she is, and how he still falls in love with her despite that. Yes, she has trauma; yes, she has a unique personality; but everyone treats those things like those are excuses to allow her to bully him into loving her. This kind of romance just isn't for me. With what everyone said about it, I thought it would be better. But little bits of creative ""storybook"" touches and the rep for mental health wasn't enough to make me feel okay with how the main couple started off.

But who knows, maybe someday I'll finish it and feel differently.

This is a good drama, but not the best drama
When I watch the first episode, this drama really interesting, i have a high expectation because KSH and SYJ is really exelent actor/actress, when i know it's about psychology and mental health, i became really excited, because one of my favorite drama is It's Okay That's Love and kill me heal me, which is have the similar genre.

When I watch, i think i can learn something about psychology, yeah my bad. Because this drama not really much talk about psychology and mental health, i got disappointed. There's too much focus with romance. Yeah, i know, maybe there's many people who like it and enjoyed, but i got little bit disappointed because mental health not really talk in this drama.

I just can only watch for 15 episode, because i think there's nothing too much to see in episode 16.

I know this drama have a great responses, many people who liked this drama. I know, this is a good drama, because little bit talk about mental health and the actor/actress have really great acting skill. The music too, i really like the ost who sang by Suhyun - Akmu.

If you wanna watch this drama, it's okay, go watch it! Maybe you like it, right?
Because this is a good drama. But, not the best for korean drama :)

best kdrama this year
honestly when this drama first started airing and i read the description, i thought i wasn‚Äôt gonna like it. oh how wrong i was. from the very first few seconds i was drawn in, which doesn‚Äôt happen very often. everything about it is just so intriguing: the opening, the osts, the cinematography, the acting and so on. i‚Äôm not sure i can find the right words to explain this drama to be honest.

the characters aren‚Äôt perfect and are flawed. munyoung is snappy and loud, and says whatever she wants without caring about others. she feels like a second lead bitch sometimes. gangtae can be a hypocrite - telling others to not act impulsively but doing it himself. sangtae has his selfish and immature moments. however, it is because of these imperfections that make them so realistic and relatable. they aren‚Äôt perfect people just because they‚Äôre main leads. at times you dislike them, and you wonder why they do certain things. but i think that‚Äôs the beauty of it. we aren‚Äôt supposed to love them at all times. just like in reality, we can‚Äôt approve of everything someone does. we aren‚Äôt supposed to instantly like the characters, or like every single thing they do.

a few of the relationships in this drama can be seen as toxic. munyoung forces her way into gangtae‚Äôs life and wants him no matter what. the two brothers, gangtae and sangtae are both toxic to each other. sangtae is selfish and tends to only do things that he wants, and gangtae wishes he didn‚Äôt have to look after his brother his whole life.

the character development is one of the best i‚Äôve seen, especially munyoung. throughout the drama you can progressively see her development. from her fashion sense to her expressions. in the beginning, she overdresses, which is a sort of defence mechanism for her to feel secure. throughout the drama she starts to wear more ‚Äústandard‚Äù clothes, however they‚Äôre still very ko munyoung. she starts to smile more and generally looks happier. she doesn‚Äôt act on impulse as much, and doesn‚Äôt get as frustrated. thanks to both gangtae and sangtae, she learns to deal with her emotions better. she didn‚Äôt change into a completely new person, that would‚Äôve been unrealistic. we get to see her gradual development. she‚Äôs still ko munyeong, just a better version

gangtae also became a lot happier. he learnt to accept his brother more and that it‚Äôs okay to be someone people lean on and need. instead of suppressing his emotions, he fought with his brother and let his feelings out, which is something he would never have done before. thanks to munyoung, he realised it‚Äôs okay to want to have fun and not be succumbed to taking care of his brother all the time. sangtae became more mature and started acting like an actual older brother to gangtae. he started being someone gangtae could lean on, instead of it always being the other way round. he stopped feeding into his selfish needs and became an older brother to both gangtae and munyeong. seeing them become a little family is one of the best things about the drama. the development of juri and sangin was also nice to see.

i also loved the development of juri and munyeong‚Äôs relationship.

another thing i love about this drama is how all the relationships seem to connect. most characters have some sort of relationship with another character. they all care about each other and are there for one another. it‚Äôs nice to see

jaesu is also an amazing friend to gangtae, and so is sangin to munyoung. both of them have stayed by GT and MY‚Äôs side for years.

the acting is superb. they are all superb actors and deserve all the awards. when they cry you cry, when they smile you smile. the casting to me is perfect.

the osts are beautiful and really set the atmosphere. even the transitions. the music is just so great and perfect for each scene.

the cinematography is amazing. you could probably screenshot any scene and it‚Äôd be beautiful.

this is a pretty rare drama imo. there are plenty of reasons why you should watch it. for me, it‚Äôs the best drama this year and one of the best ever. just watch it

Boring for the most part
I honestly think this drama is overhyped. Like yeah the premise is really clever and refreshing but what more is there to it? The storytelling is really boring, the characters are unique but not interesting and the overall, nothing about 3/4 of the drama is gripping. I only started to enjoy it from episode 14 onwards but even then, I wouldn't say that I loved it. Yes, I love some aspects of it like the synergy between Ko Munyeong and the brothers and I was really impressed by the acting of most characters but overall, it was boring. It took me half a year to finish it. I would recommend it to someone that wants a refreshing premise and storyline but not because it's particularly interesting or gripping in any way. Lastly, the whole thing about her mother coming back to life with a different face? I mean, come on we're not 5.

Beautiful, Heart-warming, and Satisfying
The very first thing that pushed me to watch this drama is the story. I love a good drama that tackles about mental health as I am someone who lives with a family member who has a Bipolar Disorder. It is never easy to be with that family member as he is emotionally and verbally abusive.


This drama gave me the courage to speak up about the things he did to me and my siblings. I can relate to Ko Moon Young in that part where her mom treated her like an object, like an ongoing work in progress, like a masterpiece that when it fails, it is easily discarded. It felt really exhausting. I'm happy that this drama helped me a little with overcoming that trauma I got from that family member.


Moving on to the story, I rated this 9.5/10 because I think, it is almost perfectly done. From the charater-driven story type to the close to reality characters, It can easily capture the hearts of the viewers. What I think made this a little dissapointing was the story behind the mother's return to the trio's lives. But I think I can understand why they didn't dig more into it as this drama focuses more on the healing of the characters rather than the mystery. I am just a little disappointed because I grew a lot curious about the mother's story. I also like how each episode title is a title of a fairy tale. They did a pretty good job in connecting different fairy tales to this drama. This drama made us realize that people with mental disorders don't deserve to be ostracized just because they are different. In fact, what they deserve is our understanding, love and acceptance. I also love how this drama taught us to not forget our bad memories that still haunt us until now, instead it taught us to face our fears and overcome them, in that way, we can grow and become genuinely happy.


About the Acting, what I can say is they did a really good job in portraying their characters. Kim Soo Hyun never fails to make me cry. Come on! Give this man an acting award already! Oh Jung Se did a great job portraying as someone who has autism. I just love how he truly cares about Kang Tae and how he tries to act like a responsible older brother to Kang Tae. He deserves another acting award at Baeksang!!! Seo Ye Ji, she's the one I loved the most in this series. Her character development was the best for me. It was neither lacking nor was it exaggerating. I'm so happy that the writer didn't try to magically cure her like other dramas. I like how she learned to be a nicer person while still having ASPD. Even the supporting characters' stories moved me, I especially cried for the mother with the black scarf who lost her child due to an accident.


I rate the music 10/10 because it totally added to the feels of this drama.

Rewatch value for this is 10/10. I think this is perfect to watch whenever I'm feeling down and needed someone to tell me that It's Okay To Not Be Okay. See what I did there? lol

My Overall Rating for this drama is 10/10. Although this drama isn't perfect, it has many flaws like most of the dramas out there, but I still believe that this drama deserves the best ratings it could get.

If I could rate this drama more than 10, I‚Äôd do that.
As a fan of Kim Soo Hyun, I waited eagerly for months for his great comeback. At the same time, I was also anxious because so many of his contemporaries have had rather underwhelming returns and was afraid to be disappointed once again. However, I‚Äôm happy to say the drama not only lived up to my expectations but exceeded it.

The story was unique, twisted and complex. There were many arcs within the drama, some brought tears to my eyes and others incredibly heartwarming, with the occasional comic scene thrown into the mix. Character development of the 3 leads was excellent. One aspect of note is the portrayal of a character with special needs and the burden it puts on family members. So often characters such as Sang-Tae are either treated as a child/ someone to be pitied/ some kind of prodigy. As if their stories are not worth telling if they‚Äôre perfectly ordinary. I love how they showed his struggles and irrational fears while also focusing on his desire to be a good older brother and ambition to be an illustrator. Likewise, it was interesting to see the impact it had on Gang-tae in his childhood and how his character grew over the course of the series. Moon Young was the final piece of the puzzle. I loved the brotherhood/ friendship between the 3 main characters. They really did feel like a family.

Acting was very good all around. But particularly of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji. Also their chemistry was palpable. I loved each and every interaction of theirs, be it romantic or otherwise.

The music was fun and enjoyable and fit well with the mood.

Rewatch value is low. But only because I don‚Äôt think I would feel the same level of excitement and anticipation watching this the second time round.

This drama kept me engrossed and eagerly waiting for the next episode to air. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This is easily one of the best dramas I‚Äôve watched all year.

It was a beautiful journey
First of all, i just like to say that this Series is not for everyone. I know everyone has different tastes especially in dramas. Aside from being a HUMAN HEALING DRAMA, this show is a character driven kind of drama. You have to immerse yourself in the drama to fully understand and go through the process of healing while watching the show.


STORY - I really love the story. It's unique and refreshing how the writer used many fairy tale and folk tales references and combined all those stories into one. It's so brilliant.

ACTING - Now let's talk about the performances for the Actors.

Immediately after watching episode 1, you will be amazed already of Oh Jung Seng's performance. It really is a role of a lifetime. He is so effective as Moon Sang Tae. I cry on most of his scenes with Gang Tae. He exceeded everyone's expectations and he will definitely get many awards from this show.

Seo Ye Ji's role is also very challenging. She is phenomenal as Moon Young. I cannot think of anyone who can do this role as perfect as her.

Supporting Roles from the younger casts, CEO, Juri, SEung Jae, Jaesu, Director, the OK staff and patients. Everyone had amazing perfomances.

Now for my bias, Kim Soo Hyun.... I have to be honest, as a fan of KSH, i really did not understand at first why he chose this project. Maybe i was used to A list actors to work with more known and award winning directors and writers. After his last drama The Producers in 2015 and military enlistment in 2017, i was really waiting for his comeback and has high expectations on the first project he'll work on. THANK GOD, he chose It's Okay to Not Be Okay. He really took time in reading many scripts and he really wants to challenge himself. His role is not as flashy or flamboyant as Moon Young and Sang Tae.... What makes his performance a stand out was the fact that his character wasn't a stand out. SYJ and OJS, being such amazing actors themselves could have easily stole the limelight from KSH. Moon Gang Tae's character was less explosive and more contemplative. His role is very deep and requires consistency. Many of his emotions must be conveyed using his eyes alone. and he did it perfectly. His crying scenes have different emotions and meanings especially his breakdown scene on episode 9. It felt like he poured his heart and soul on that scene and the audience felt it. The fact that KSH was able to get rave reviews for his performance both internationally and locally, and many people became a huge fan of Moon Gang Tae's character.... and lastly, that KSH was able to showcase such amazing and brilliant acting range for a role that's quite a challenge... that's really IMPRESSIVE and not all actors would be able to accomplish that.. I'm just happy that KSH is a risk taker and took this risk and not doing the usual OPPA dramas.


CINEMATOGRAPHY/MUSICAL SCORING/EDITING -
We have to commend the cinematographer of this show. WOW. just WOW! the camera shots are so perfect. i love how the cinematographer used different techniques. It was so effective. Same as the editing. I love the transitions from one scene to another. Not just the cool transitions but just the regular transitions where musical scoring is used to properly connect one scene from another.

OVERALL - this show will be one of my all time favorites. I have to admit that i expected more from the mother's plot. maybe because i watch too many crime dramas and i wanted more explanation how the mother survived or what really happened. I guess i overthought and had watched too many theory videos that i forgot what the show was all about. Thank you to the Finale episode""FINDING THE REAL FACE"". My take on the mother's plot is very simple. The mother survived and whatever stories we saw from the father's POV and MY's are not really accurate since the father had brain injury and even had major surgery for that, and MY was too young and grew with too much trauma to remember everything and just remembered the trauma she experienced during her childhood. Once the ""Finding the Real Face"" story was told, everything made sense to me that this drama is not about MY's mother. It's about the journey of Moon Young, Sang Tae and Gang Tae. From episode 1 to 16 we saw their character developments and how they were healed in the process of knowing each other. There might be an evil witch who took their real faces, but like in any fairy tale, there will always be a happy ending.

I have to say that this drama has one of the best finales and most satisfying endings I've ever watched. I don't know how many times i cried watching all episodes but one thing is for sure , i learned so much from this drama. I immersed myself in the show and this show really healed me to overcome some of the trauma and regrets i have in my life. The title itself is such a meaningful and powerful phrase that ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"". Here are some of the lessons i learned from this drama.

- Family is Beyond Blood Relations
- Fight for your Happiness
- Don't Make Rash Decisions
- Don't Judge a book by its cover
- Confront your Trauma
- Remember Good Memories
- Speak Up for Yourself
- Reach Out for Help
- It's Better to Kiss than Fight

""When you're tired get some rest. When your sad, go ahead and cry. It's okay to do that.""

Damn, there so many life learning quotes in this show.

I felt like i was also riding in the camping van when the show ended. It really is a great and amazing journey. Thank you OKAY Family! Thank you IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY.

It was good until the last couple episodes :///
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, it kind of breaks my heart to give this drama 9 stars instead of 10 stars, but I honestly think it was a TAD bit overrated. I do admit that in the very first episode of this drama, I was HOOKED by the female lead and especially the autistic brother of the male lead. I hadn‚Äôt seen those types of characters in Korean dramas before, and I was loving every minute of the drama. I think the characters were beautifully developed in this drama, and it is definitely a huge plus. I have to say that the author and the director both are artistic geniuses who managed to put together the most compelling storyline, beautiful soundtrack, and relatable characters. I was this close to declaring this drama as my #1 favorite drama ever‚Ä¶ until we got to the last few episodes. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am a huge fan of violence (in a non weird way, lol. I‚Äôm a big fan of shows like the walking dead and the horror movie genre in general), but I cannot for the life of me watch a romance with violent themes without hating every minute of it. Let me say this once and hopefully never again: Romance and violence do not and should not mix. So you will now understand my incredible frustration when the drama I had grown to adore decided to out of nowhere drop a story arc with a psychotic murderous mother who showed up out of nowhere and started drugging everyone up. It took me a lot of self coaxing to get myself to finish the drama, but I was incredibly frustrated (for extremely personal reasons, I do admit) with the drama at that point. In my defense, the arc where the mother decided to set up this whole conspiracy to teach Ko Moon Yeong a lesson or whatever was incredibly unrealistic and very out of nowhere. Despite the terrible couple episodes, I have to say that the drama was beautifully concluded and got me to shed some tears at the end. The last few episodes did seem to lose their sense of direction a little bit, but they wrapped it up nicely. I hadn‚Äôt yet said anything about the soundtrack, which was freaking awesome, by the way. Some of the songs that were played in the drama fit the mood perfectly. I could use some sadder, more emotional tracks, though. I‚Äôd overall recommend this, since the beautiful storytelling and character development more than made up for everything else.

My bias is Kim Soo Hyun since dream high, I like his acting here, especially when he cries, like he didn't care what happened to his face, he just sad and wanna cry. He looks genuine and innocent in this drama.

Seo Ye Ji, she is so pretty and fashionable, a bit crazy but she has a gentle heart in this drama. I love her, since Lawless Lawyer.

KSH & SYJ have a great chemistry as a couple. Beside those 2, KSH big brother who has autism really did important role in this drama. he did a great acting, and makes me forget that he's just acting. wonderful!

The story has plot twist in last episodes, and it shook me, I felt the thrill.

Message of this drama is really good, it taught us to be more consider about mental health.

What disappoints me was the ending, I feel it's too rushed and not all the mystery answered at the end.

Best Kdrama I've Ever Watched
This is one of the most touching and additives dramas I have ever seen!!! IT IS A MUST WATCH!!!

Story:
Although it may be somewhat slow-paced, the story is original and amazing, it had the perfect balance of drama, romance, and comedy. It also had an inspiring message which everyone should hear.

Acting:
The actors were all superb and were the perfect fit for the roles as well as each other. You can really tell the actors poured their hearts into perfectly-becoming their characters and making sure the story was perfectly represented.

Music:
the music complemented the story and specific scenes really well, they even threw in a few popular k-pop songs in the background too.

Rewatch Value:
This is definitely a story you can rewatch, even if you already know everything that happened, you will still be able to enjoy this kdrama a lot. I already plan on watching this again very soon to make sure it is always fresh in my memory.

When I first watched the first episode of this drama I was wow!!! From the intro up to the last second of the first episode it was so amazing!!! In fact when I finished watching the first episode I immediately looked for the next one lol. It was only then that I found out it was shown on Netflix, I was really happy because that means rather than waiting for almost 1 day for the subbed version, I can watch it an hour after its airing in SoKor.

What captivated me most when I watched this one was the character of Seo Ye Ji, Ko Mun Young. For some reason, I find her character very relatable. I really really love love love her acting here. She really brought the character to life. From her fashion sense to her dark humor, everything was perfect. And of course, don't get me started with her chemistry with Kim Soo Hyun. Wow just wow!!! They both really outdone themselves here.

But to tell you honestly, in terms of acting skills I was really taken aback by Oh Jung Se who plays Moon Sang Tae. I first watched him in the drama When the Camellia Blooms in which he won an award for his acting, but his acting skills here in IOTNBO is really on another level. He played the character of Sang Tae well, from the way he talks to the mannerism, it really seems legit. I'd even go as far as saying he deserves a Daesang Award for his acting here.

I love watching dark, mysterious and dramas that tackle psychological issues, that's why I think I was also drawn into this drama. Aside from learning things about the different psychological issues, it's really nice that we also learn how do they heal from their wounds. It's really satisfying to see the characters grow as a person which was something I loved in this drama. Not only the leads, but even the supporting characters grew from their old selves (Well except from MY's mom). They went out of their comfort zones and lived a better life. This drama is really one of the dramas that has a satisfying ending. I'll truly miss this one.

The only thing I didn't really understand from this drama is how the hell did KMY's mom survived what happened to her. She freaking bled a lot and was thrown at the bottom of a lake. How the heck do you live from that? I guess we will never know the answer to that lol.

Anyways, wishing everyone the best. I appreciate the effort of everyone involved in making this drama. Despite the fears of COVID19 you didn't backed down and gave everyone something good to look forward to in these trying times so kudos to you all!!!!

A good drama with a compelling story and beautiful visuals.
""It's Okay Not To Be Okay"" was a beautiful surprise that appeared on my Netflix recommended. When I went to watch it, I didn't know much about the plot, I just knew that had Kim Soo-Hyun and Seo Yea-Ji as the main leads and that it had mental illness and fairytales in the mix. But as you can tell by my rating, I was pleasantly surprise by this spooky fairytale.

This drama is a blend of romance, drama, comedy and a bit of mystery and is very character driven, so if you come here to watch a lighthearted romcom, you are definitely in the wrong place, as this drama dives in on character development and is all about their healing and growth.

We follow Moon Gang-Tae, who is Healthcare Assistant who works with psychiatric patients and as to move around a lot because of is older brother Moon Sang-Tae, who has autism. He ends up meeting children's book writer Ko Moon-Young, who, because of her traumatic childhood, grew to have a very toxic behavior. And between all the bickering and cute moments, they end up falling in love. There's a whole mystery sub-plot in this drama, that honestly it was quite disappointing and it didn't had much to the story, honestly it felt like it was only added to create more unnecessary drama. Sparkled in between like chocolate chips, there was the stories of some of the patients of the psychiatric facility, where we learn more about their mental illnesses and their journey to overcome them.

I honestly never felt more relatable to a character in my life, I don¬¥t know if it was because we have the same job, or because, like him, I learned how to conceal my feeling, principly while I'm working but also outside work, were I always feel the need to take care of other, so in a way I understood Gang-Tae a little bit. Moon-Young, although a love her, I need to admit that her behavior in the beginning of the drama was quite toxic and shouldn't be glorified, but I love that throughout the drama, she started to change for the better with the help of the two brothers. And obviously I had to talk about that character, that for me stole the show, and that was Sang-Tae, I'm not one to cry, but in some of Sang-Tae's scenes i just couldn't stop myself from bawling my eyes out, and I can't say this enough but Oh Jung-Se was brilliant on his portrayal of Sang-Tae.

I think the best part about this drama is the visuals, I've never seen such a beautifully shot drama, the whole concept was so well done, I loved the spooky fairytale concept and the animations sprinkled across the episodes. I just can't stress this enough, this drama is gorgeous to look at, complemented by the beautiful OST, (honestly I've already added most of them to my playlist). I loved that they composed original instrumental music to fill the ambient, besides the typical OST. Also I need to make a special mention of this drama's intro, i never skipped it once, and beside the visuals and the music, i really liked that depending on the episodes mood (happy or sad) the saturation of the images would change: more colorful for happy episodes, less colorful for sad ones. I don't know if I was the only one who noticed that, but nonetheless was a very cool small detail.

Will I watch this drama again? Probably, I really liked the overall drama and the concept, and I see myself watching it again in the future. If i recommend it? Yes, if you looking for a character driven drama with a different concept.
Thank you Netflix for putting this gorgeous drama on my way!

This is so bad I want to give it a 0 but I can't so I'm giving it a 1
This is without a doubt the worst drama I have ever watched.
Dear lord I cannot believe people enjoyed this! Do they think that good-looking people should just get away with the absolute worst behaviour!

Pros
- some great costumes
- The FLs house is an amazing set
- Music is good
- Allegory's a interesting

Cons
- The portrayal of every mental health issue in this is terrible at best and damaging at worst
- why would I want to watch a narcissist get everything she wants while acting terribly to everyone around her. (I know the excuse is a tough childhood, but seriously does that excuse everything! - to quote Jake Perolta ""Cool motive, still murder"") Her actions are often inexcusable.
- The male lead is a covert narcissist too. He is obviously not well mentally either, the chip on his shoulder should have crushed him to death already.
- The leads knew each other as kids trope is weak
- the plot is dumb, a villian getting surgery to look like someone else is a lame Bond film plot.

A new benchmark for KDramaland
From the moment the intro begins you know what to expect from this show - an unusual fairytale that's quirky, sophisticated, stylised, dark and melancholic. Leave if it isn't for you, but if you stay YOU ARE IN FOR A DELIGHTFUL TREAT!

Casting the three main actors - Seo Ye Ji, Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se - had to be the best thing to happen to this drama. Ko Moon Young and Moon Sang Tae could have easily become caricatures, but the restrain each actor showed was commendable.

Kudos to the director and writer for never once using the mental patients for comic relief. Everyone had a solid story but their healing process never stole focus from the main characters. On the contrary, they added to the very satisfying finale episode, which is perhaps the best in any TV show ever. The editing, OST, illustrations and, most of all, WRITING was top notch!

This hungry caterpillar chomped it's way through every corner of my heart, wrapped itself in a warm cocoon of giggles & tears, and emerged as the most glorious butterfly, whose dazzling colours are sure to stun all!

It's a beautiful, well written and perfectly performed drama
I had very hig expectation for this drama and even so it managed to be better than what i expected. The plot line is beautiful and painful and has no loose ends. Most characters are pretty complex and the actors perform them really well.
It is a story that makes you understand yourself better and allows you to feel things without it being toi sirious all the time. Humor and drama are perfectly balanced and it is enjoyable and intense at the same time.
Might just b
e my new favorite drama. Will definetly rewatch.

Masterpiece of Emotions
I don't even know where to start with this review or if my words would do this drama justice...

From the start, the prologue was unexpected for a K-drama which was fascinating in itself. I was completely in awe of the cinematography and unique scene transitions this drama offered; the visuals were mind-blowing. I'm still not over it. So let me start by saying thank you to the behind the scenes staff and crew for this amazingly beautiful drama that we were graced with. The execution of the story from beginning to the end was perfection. I was able to connect from the start and fully immersed as a viewer that it was extremely difficult to pull away from once the drama ended. The fairy tales that were woven into the plot was such a breath of fresh air and the way it was carried out to pull it's viewers in completely was incredible.

The cast line-up was flawless. I honestly cannot see any other actors/actresses pulling this off the way they did. It almost felt like this script was written especially for them. Seo Yea Ji and Oh Jung Se may have had more colorful roles in this drama but Kim Soo Hyun's role was a really difficult one and the three played off each other so well. To be honest, if it was anyone else was in Gang Tae's role I truly believe that the actor would have been overshadowed by the other two eccentric characters. As another viewer stated, ""KSH is remarkable because he took a traditionally obscure role and made it stand out in the midst of phenomenal acting by his costars."" This trio needs a standing ovation!

Each episode of this drama was set out with a purpose and it delivered each time. I have never watched a drama where I find myself hysterically laughing and a second later I am in tears, at times I am so emotionally overwhelmed that I am crying because I am so happy - I cannot emphasize enough how special this drama is.

I want to make a point that this drama is character driven and not plot driven so if you keep this in mind, there will be no doubt you will be head-over-heels in love with this drama as I am. To be upfront, there was one big thing that bothered me or so I thought at the time. However, the way the drama was set-up and carried out it made that one big thing become absolutely insignificant to me by the next episode and did not ruin my initial thoughts or feels on the drama as a whole in the slightest - this is commendable.

Without spoiling the drama, I am just going to wrap this review up with how these characters will be staying with me for a very long time. There are so many valuable lessons throughout this drama and never once it felt forced onto viewers, more like a gentle nudge to remind us all of what's genuinely important.

Let me not forget - this drama had the BEST FINAL EPISODE IN K-DRAMA HISTORY!! I'm thinking it will be a while before another drama can top this last episode. It was wholesome in ways I cannot describe. You will have to watch it to experience it yourself.

I hope you give it a go. I, for one, was absolutely obsessed!

It's iconic, not mainstream
Crying over spilled milk is no use, but sometimes feelings are hard to suppress and you end up bawling your eyes out like a child. Well, this Kdrama was similar to that experience but in a good way because it was the first time I ever cried over fictional characters and how well written this series was. Episodes one and two focuses on introducing the main characters by showing the audience their differences in personalities which is the fun part seeing them go from bickering to tolerating to loving one another. Then, the patients from the OK Psychiatric Hospital are welcomed on stage sharing the series with the main cast and you will honestly fall in love with them all. Although there are some scenes which make you want to grit your teeth and point fingers at the characters, everyone goes at their own paces and matures towards the end of the series making it all worth it. The pacing is not too slow or too fast either!

I knew I was sold with this series when the third episode made me swallow back tears because of the powerful emotions expressed and anecdotes they teach ranging from loving yourself, letting go of the past, forgiving others, and being selfish for your own happiness. Also, no spoilers, but whenever something happened to the main cast or patients, the director and scriptwriter were geniuses for shifting back and forth using the present and past characters as a reflection to show how far they have gotten. Deep down everyone is still a child even though we all grew up physically and it isn't bad to cry, whine, make mistakes or say, ""I'm not okay"", and that's what this series teaches us about.

When parents fail at parenting miserably and their children were left broken
A psychopath mother wanted to groom her daughter into another her while the father remained a bystander. What a messed-up family. I dropped this once halftime in the first episode, so when I decided to pick it back up, I skipped episode one and watched the second episode instead. I'm glad I did. From then on, I loved every obsessive antics Moon Young has done to get Gang Tae's attention. Ridiculously hilarious. Some might hate MY for being rude, unreasonable, among other things, but I just can't bring myself to hate her. When I look in her eyes, all I see is a very lonely little girl in need of love. Those eyes of hers are so expressive. Seo Ye Ji as Moon Young was perfect. She expressed everything that needed to be conveyed to the audience through her eyes. Needless to say, it was the same for Soohyun. Oh Jung Se as Sang Tae was outstanding. If there is one thing I would have wanted to change was the tragedy regarding Moon Young's mother. It was unnecessary that she was still alive to bring conflict to our leads. It would have been enough drama when she was revealed as the murderer of GT's mother. They should have followed MY's father's story, how he killed and discarded the body. The head nurse should have just been an obsessive fan of some sort. But despite that, I love the show overall. I also loved how it was wrapped up. That Sangtae has finally was able to let go of Gangtae. It was a good watch. Bonus are the hot hot hot kiss scenes. That's what's a kiss should be. Every kdrama should learn from this. (and HPL)

Best Kdrama!
This drama was so special! The characters were different than how Kdramas usually are. It‚Äôs nice to see a Kdrama talk about people who are on the spectrum in a good way. It showed we all have strengths and weaknesses and how people can help support each other. As for the female and male leads chemistry was off the charts. How can two people be so beautiful? The three main actors acting was so good, as well as the entire cast. The OST was also so beautifully done. After watching It‚Äôs okay to not be okay, I have watched Seo Ye Ji‚Äôs other work, she is an amazing actress. Will have to re-watch until, hopefully a second season is made.

The story keeps on going well till the end which i loved as i have seen in many KDrama the love story ruins the main plot.
Seo ye ji and oh Sung Tae has done fabulous acting.
I just loved the way everything has portrayed so well.
The music is also good and the cinematography is excellent.

Mental Health
Never a topic for a story was more relevant now than mental health!
I didn't know what to expect from this kdrama by watching the trailer. I was not really into the mystical part of it, so i almost didn't watch it. The fact that this kdrama is actually about mental health and has barely any real mystical elements to it, it's absolutely brillant! From a direction pov it's brillant! All those massive Tim Burton stories vibe are genius! i would buy all those short stories book's!! ALL OF THEM!!

Seo Ye Ji is crazy good! Talk about powerful female leads! THIS IS IT! She is everything! Ofc i already knew the fabulous and incredible Kim Soo Hyun, he is always flawless with his acting and he does emotional scenes really really well(!!), but what i wasn't expecting was the role of a career from Oh Jung Se!! Pretty much all the times i ended up sobbing like a baby (and there was several) were because of scenes related to his character. He nailed it! I was often an emotional reck watching him act. Adorable and heartbreaking. Super compelling!

I am honestly speechless! This is what i consider a perfect kdrama! A good balance between love, family, friends, work, trauma and the importance of mental health and dealing with your past. Perfect! I don't say this often, but the rewatch value is 10! I would totally rewatch it!

DEFINITELY OVERHYPED!! AND CALLING IT A HUMAN HEALING DRAMA IS VERY FAR FETCHED
First, of all the toxic relationship throughout the initial episodes is hard to ignore. Yes, the main leads are eye candy for most of the people and the drama has top tier OSTs, very good chemistry and aesthetics but it doesn't cover up a lot of the irrational things that happened throughout the drama.

The female lead is made too dramatic to be a children's book writer. She has several mental health issues but she recovered overnight when the male lead decided to love and live in with her. No consultation or treatment from psychologists or psychiatrists for someone who is suffering from mental problems for years. How ridiculous?? They never made it a point to highlight that she needed to visit a doctor and no a lover can't do that work. She has issues herself but she is the one teaching the patients at the hospital. Exactly why??

Also, the fact she used to dress like she is about to walk on the ramp of New York fashion week is the most ridiculous of all. Her publishing house went bankrupted, she was living in a rural area, her employees were barely getting salary, eating at subway because there's no food at home. What nonsense was going on?? In which world a children's book writer does these things?

A rather foolish and very dramatic portrayal of mental health I would say and the way they romanticised it was a major let down.

Masterpiece
Wow! I am so impressed by this drama. It is a masterpiece. What a great production, from the writing, directing, acting, special effects, and costume to cinematography, every aspect of this production is superb.

Phenomenal acting of the three main leads, Seo Ye Ji, Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se, and all of the supporting casts did a great job. The chemistry between the two Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun is amazing.

This drama makes you feel hopeful and inspired. Truly a ‚Äúhuman healing drama‚Äù. One of the best dramas I‚Äôve watched.

Timely and Healing drama
Beautiful masterpiece drama!!!

This gonna be the best drama of 2020. I've never seen any korean dramas like this. This drama deserved the hype and deserves more hype, recognition and awards. The story, acting, OST and cinematography are so perfect. I like the character development of the main and supporting characters. The acting of Kim Soo Hyun, Oh Jung Se, Seo Ye Ji and the supporting actors and actresses are excellent. They give matchless acting on their roles. This drama has so many life lessons and it mainly talks about mental health . Words are not enough to describe this superb masterpiece. You won't regret watching it. :)))

INDEED, A HUMAN HEALING DRAMA ‚ú®
Just want to say how wonderful this drama is.

1. .PLOT:
Superb ‚ù§ Love their Fairy tales!! So cute and effort animations. Each eps has fairy tale that has takeaways. It really amazed me the way their Fairy tale is such a heartwarming story that makes an eye opener for us. Love the deep message of the story!

Im also thankful for this drama for raising Mental Health Awareness. Truly, people really needs to know what mental health is to fight the stigma, how a person is really going through in such situations and how it is important for people with mental disorder to have family or someone by their side who will truly love, care and understand them as much as they needed it.
10/10. Love how they justify in the end that after all ""Gang Tae is for Gang Tae"" and how ""Finding the real face"" concluded. Superb!!!

2 . SCRIPT:
Love their dialogues!!!! You will obtain life lessons and words to ponder with their lines!! ‚ù§‚ù§

3. CASTS:
Fantastic casting!! Each and everyone in this drama is needed to make a beautiful portrait.
Love how the humor of the show balance with their emotional scenes. Such fun to watch all of them. Esp the #MmM trio!!! They are so funny and their touching scenes! So thankful for this drama that finally Seo Ye Ji is gaining much attention as much as before which she truly deserves. Love also Seo Ye Ji & Kim Soo Hyun chemistry!!

4. CGI: Wonderful!!! Seems like a true fairy tale. So effort.‚ù§

5. OST's: So perfect! Love to hear their ost. Esp ""Lighting up your world"" which seems like a music video of the 3 leads.

Fun, heartwarming, eye opener. Definitely one of the best drama! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

May not be everyone's cup of Tea
If you ask me to recommend a drama, Me, recommending
would be based on my closeness to that person. This drama makes you feel things that you won't dare to feel in your daily life and most people don't neither generally embrace these emotions not understand them, tbh.

A very very well written plot and fabulous plot points and twists. Won't say that this drama is adorned with cliffhanger but this story grows on you, makes you want to know more and as per louisa may alcott, that is the success of a writer.

Acting is fabulous.. specially the character Sang-Tae stole the show (i can't stop if i start so i won't)start. I have Kim so hyun better but Seo ye ji, she never stops to surprise me. The growth that she shows with each new show is immense. Damn..

Music is good too.. it did it's job of making the series more lovable.. specially the score ""In silence, no one answers"" makes you feel different stuff in different scenes, i.e. pretty versatile.

My rewatch value is low because I'm not much of a re-watcher.

Overall, Go for It, only if you are ready to embrace it.

Best Kdrama I've Watched
I've watched up to a total of 70+ dramas and I have to say that this must be my number 1. I kept watching ever since the drama premiered up until the last episode. And now that the drama ended, honestly, I feel slightly empty and I am not ready to move on. First of all, the best part of this drama is the character development. If you watch the interviews and press conferences they kept emphasizing that this drama should be a ""human healing"" drama. And truth be told, the healing journey of the characters were portrayed beautifully and was also wrapped up perfectly. And we could see the development not only in their personalities but in their relationship with each other as well. This goes to the second point of the interesting depths of the characters, particularly the main 3, Gangtae, Sangtae, and Moonyoung. Most Kdramas have 2D characters and they do not go in-depth towards the layers of the characters. However, this drama gave such fresh new characters, particularly for Munyeong and Sangtae. Munyeong is not the typical ""weak, feminine"" female character that a lot of kdrama characters have and she has so much more layers other than her ""antisocial"" personality. She also dresses very well. Sangtae is an autistic character and we also don't see this a lot in other dramas. This drama successfully brought onto the kdrama scene new characters and topics such as mental health that are rarely highlighted.
The second point is the emotional delivery. Throughout the drama, I felt like my heart was ripped apart and then mended and then ripped apart again. I honestly do not know how many times I have cried when watching it. I could feel the emotions of the characters and their pain and that is why it was very easy for me to cry along with them. Moreover, I found myself relating to their pains which makes it more emotionally engaging. I feel like the traumas and the pain these characters have would somewhat be relatable to most people.
The third point is the casting and the acting. I gave it a 10/10 because I sincerely could not imagine other actors taking the role of Gangtae, Sangtae, and Moonyoung. I don't think I have to say a lot about Kim Soo Hyun. He is a talented actor and very very handsome. Although in the beginning, his acting could be seen as rather flat, but as the drama goes on, we get to see why he didn't show many expressions and we also get to see more emotional delivery and dynamics in his acting. Seo Ye Ji is the perfect Ko Mun Yeong. I am honestly speechless with her portrayal of Ko Mun Yeong because she played her perfectly. Her expressions and how she delivers her lines successfully demonstrates Munyeong's bulldozer personality. She was also able to portray Munyeong's personal pains which made my heart break real bad. I feel like she really understands Ko Mun Yeong inside out and therefore she was able to play Munyeong flawlessly. Lastly, but definitely not the least, Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Tae is just phenomenal. You just 100% believe that he is autistic and sometimes when I watch their behind the scenes or interviews I kind of get shocked that he is not really autistic. Even his small gestures with his fingers and his eyes really brought Sangtae to life.
When talking about casting, we have to take into consideration the chemistry between the actors. Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji's chemistry is out of this world. I don't know if it is because they are great actors or if it's because they look alike that made their chemistry so phenomenal. They both were able to portray that they were really in love and makes you want to really root them that they actually are in real life. Honestly, they are also the ultimate visual couple. I really couldn't stop being in awe of their beauty when watching. Moreover, the chemistry between the three main actors was also amazing. You really could see that they are a genuine family.
Overall, every episode was perfect and beautiful. The director also was able to deliver aesthetic scenes which makes it enjoyable to watch. The OSTs are also beautiful, it gets stuck in my head but it's not on Spotify yet so I'm sad. The only one lacking point of this drama (SPOILER) is the lack of explanation of Munyeong's mom which I thought could be written better. But after analyzing it and after watching the best drama ending ever, I've settled with that it was not important. The explanation was not important for Munyeong because she just wants to forget her completely and thus maybe that is why we shouldn't be bothered either. Oh and honestly I think Jaesu kind of deserved better. He was so loyal but I feel like he was always taken for granted. I also gave the rewatch value 10/10 because even after 3 days since the finale, I am still rewatching clips and is already planning to rewatch it. OH and one of the best things should be the witty references to the previous episodes in ep 15 and 16 such as the deer and the saranghae part.

I never leave a review, but this show deserves it.
Just the fact that they went in and dealt with mental health issues so beautifully is an amazing start already. Pair that with some of the best of acting I've seen, and a great script and the recipe is this amazing work of art.
There were unexpected twists and beautiful character growth. This show grabs you from the get go and doesn't let go.
I will say it's not for everyone,it does deal with very heavy issues, but it truly does it in such a beautiful way.
The amount of detail in this show is also very good and the attention paid tp the mental health problems is done well.
I loved this drama from begining to end, and it's one i will be re watching for sure.

She's hella toxic
Well, the drama had a really good story, I really like the main male character, but Muyeong is just too shitty... She does whatever she whants, have really problematic actions and even so Gangtae was falling in love with her... If it was the opposite, the guy doing all those kinds of things I think more people would also find it problematic. The turning point for me to drop it was that he was falling in love with her, even if she was hella abusive with him and even used his brother to manipulate him. If the story continued and they helped each other to heal themselves and just be friends I would like the plot, but Gangtae falling in love with her was the end of it for me hahahhah

Great Series
Great Writers, Great Actors, Great plot-line... The filming locations and sites used have been wonderful to the story line... Thoroughly enjoying this show... I laugh and cry with them... Only seen 10 episodes so far but I've loved each and every one of them ... The show gets better each week and episode... The main character actors (Ms Ko and Gang Tae) are incredible and talented... The actress that plays Ms. Ko is absolutely ravishing and gorgeous... Her wonderful extensive wardrobe enhances upon her visual beauty... She comes across as intense as she plays this complicated person with deep psychological issues/problems... The actor that plays Gang Tae is also a gifted and talented actor... He too is able to bring and define his feeling to the viewer...Great job...

a singular and unique story, interpreted by magnificient actors
it's okay to not be okay has to be one of the most unique and well interpreted dramas out there. the story is compelling, discussing important topics such as mental health, and the actors did a fantastic job at displaying the struggles and emotions of these complicated characters. each episode will get you to cry, laugh, shiver and smile.

the direction of the drama is also really unique, the atmosphere is one of a kind. no episode will get you bored. on the contrary, you won't be able to suppress your need to click on ""next episode"" hahaha! the twists and discoveries, the resentment and the heartache, the brotherhood and the love,,, every emotion is portrayed so powerfully.

oh sung jae's performance as moon sang tae is absolutely mind-blowing, and kim soohyun as well as seo yeji's chemistry and internal struggle was remarkably played.

overall, this drama is really special. it deals with hard topics, and manages to portray the universe of psychiatric hospitals in a non stereotypical way. it's 100% worth the watch, but get the tissues ready!! <3

well developed characters that portray mental trauma in different scenarios
I'm glad I jumped on this train while this drama still has hype because the content is truly something. The first thing that stood out to me was the title. Mental health and overcoming the past are the two most important themes in this drama, but the way they were handled by the writers is really remarkable. Just about anyone can pick out a character that relates or speaks to them because they were created so realistically and they are so humanely flawed that anyone can resonate with at least one character. In one way or another they are struggling to deal with traumas from their pasts and they are all crippled because of it. I'm pleased that the writers committed to the theme and the episodes were very in-depth when it came to dealing with mental health. This drama provided so many scenarios that showcased the many different types of trauma, and executed it in a way that goes straight to the heart and leaves you breathless.

The leads, as well as the others are so well developed. This is my first Kim So Hyun drama, and I'm so impressed with the range and raw emotion he was able to show through this role. I'll definitely be checking out his other works in the future. Oh Jung Sae as Sang-tae was amazing. His portrayal of an autistic adult deserves an award and I mean it. Gang-tae's relationship with his brother was so pure and wholesome. I smiled a lot during this because of them. Munyeong was truly something. She reminded me so much of myself. This wasn't just a love story about two broken people fixing each other, but a tale that teaches us to not only remember our past but to overcome it. After all, the past shapes who we become. For ""if you can't overcome it, you'll always be a kid whose soul never grows.""

Rewatch value is strong. I'll definitely watch this again in the future. Definitely recommend. 10/10.

How do we look upon ourselves and allow us to grow?
What captured me about this dramas was several things.

* The beautiful story of how many broken humans still can heal and mend their shattered beings through love.
* The amazing portrait of a autistic human we get to watch - what skillful acting. Wow!
* The way these children's story books integrated with the story
* The lesson we all can learn from about not merely look to the first appearance of people we meet.
(most people are so much more than what first meets the eye).

Of course there were many other things I loved about this drama. Small details of various importance. Like the fact that as a swede I liked the fact that instead of driving a Kia the main characters drove a Volvo. :)

Anyhow... In my book this is without a doubt one of the best dramas of 2020.

this is an amazing drama. dont give up in the beginning, be patient!
I already loved Kim Soo Hyun because of secretly, greatly and my love from the star. so I already had high expectations. but what I wanted to say was that this drama is absolutely amazing and will bring tears and laughter. every episode includes a small story which surprisingly were amazing and held strong morals. I promise that once you watch the first and second episodes you will get sucked in. So please be patient during the first and second because they are necessary in order to understand why the characters are the way they are and looking back at it, they are necessary in order to show the entirety of the character development. (and there's a lot). anyway, this is an amazing drama so please give it a chance <3

'A Suspense filled with Mystery and Thriller Drama'
I have watched this drama completely . The actress SEO YE-JI and actor KIM SOO-HYUN acting were perfect for their role . The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist. Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching. The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. Really there is no need to find any error. I randomly chose to watch this drama. But I found it amazing so I continued watching . The more episodes I watched , it became more and more thriller. As many episodes I went ,there were suspenses. At some time the story had a mystery which was solved at last. Make sure to watch this drama .

Drama makes you realize that IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY!

This drama is such a perfect project in my own opinion there is no wrong on it.

I will began with the actors all of them performed their roles with a great acting and the chemistry between them is unbelievable, they make me feel l like I am live in the story with them and feel all the feelings with them crying or smiling & warmth they are the main reason of the drama success they deserve all the awards in the world.

The characters development one of the best things that I like in this drama !

The story Carry many morals and life lessons and make me realize many feelings I don't know how to feel it, every scene has it's moral I know it's just a drama but it left a great effect on me and change my look to many things.

I love the ending very much and so happy for them because they found what they search for I think that was impossible to hapend but in the end it happened and the happenies fall our hearts.

this drama makes me so emotional and crying too much and feel painful but in the end I keep crying but with a big smile on my face they were tears of pride.

The ost and Animation two of the most beautiful things in the drama and added a lot of beauty to it.


I want to thank them to make this great drama and healing our hearts..

You will never regret watching this!

~Note: This is my first review so I'm sorry if it's a bit messy :'D

LIFE LESSONS (WE ALL NEED THESE)
Can we just take a moment to give the author, the actors, the editors and the directors of the show a freaking round of applause like they fucking deserve that shit
this is what you call out of the box
this what you call refreshing (it was so good) (this was a fucking meal and that's on period)
all the other reviews have pointed out the obvious points about the show but let me highlight the life lessons (courtesy of @ Rjei27) (read her review for more info, it is part of the top two

LESSONS LEARNT FROM THIS SHOW
-Family is Beyond Blood Relations
- Fight for your Happiness
- Don't Make Rash Decisions
-Don't Let Your Anger get The Best of You
- Don't Judge a book by its cover
- Confront your Trauma
- Remember Good Memories
- Speak Up for Yourself

Amazing!!
Story: 10/10
I personally really enjoyed the show, and it is one of my favourite shows now. The storyline was very creative and easy to follow: there's always things that'll keep you on the edge of your seat so that you won't get bored.

Acting/Cast: 10/10
The acting was amazingly good; it was super impressive, especially considering all the different emotions that the leads had to portray throughout the show. The leads' acting was great, I was constantly able to see the emotion that they were portraying, overall they connected very well and the cast was very well picked.

Music: 8/10
I'm not really the type of person to pay attention to the music in any show, but from when I did pay attention to the music I would say that it definitely contributed to the overall feel that you'd get from each scene.

Rewatch Value: 8.5/10
I would definitely rewatch this show, but it wouldn't be for a while; I'd wait until I forgot most of the surprises and storyline, so that I could experience the surprise all over again.

Who cares about destiny? if a drama shows up when you need it, you call that destiny.
First off this drama is healing and finding. I had dropped this drama, however, I‚Äôm glad that I resumed watching it a couple of days back. It took me on a journey to the past and every scene in this drama was so Relatable to me. I liked the way this drama Revealed the pain and suffering of the characters, and how they overcame them. Because some time we also lose our true / real faces since we don't have to courage to find our happiness.

I highly recommend this drama because It has a story that most of us need to see and learn from it.

One amazing journey!
The description for this drama doesn't really do it justice.

What sounds like a simple premise is actually an in-depth look at child abuse/childhood trauma and how holding onto that pain shapes our identities as adults.

The casting was immaculate. Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se's constantly fluctuating relationship had me laughing one second and awwing the next. Kim Soo Hyun's Gang Tae was a perfect balance, not only as their reluctant guardian and protector but as the viewer's way into the story. When he was stoic and driven, we felt it; when he was angry, we felt it; when he was opening up emotionally, we felt it.

I guess some people could see the more over the top characters or storylines as negatives, but I personally loved them and thought every twist and turn fit well into the modern-day dark fairytale the show's universe was set in.

This isn't the first drama to touch on darker themes, but I felt like ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" hit it out of the park in terms of execution in ways other shows could only dream of. This is a drama I will never forget, with characters I fell in love with, played by actors who inhabited their roles 100%. You won't regret watching this show!

Must Watch 2020 Drama
This drama is simply beautiful. Amazing and very well thought plot. So much life lessons. This is a breath of fresh air especially that you don't see dramas tackling mental illness.

We are humans. We feel emotions. And we're certainly not an empty can. This drama shows nobody is perfect and we all have weaknesses. Humans have flaws and that's what makes us human.

I felt the emotions of the characters and I could empathize with them at some point. One of the characteristics of a great drama is that it should be able to get the message across and make the viewers feel their emotions. This was a very wholesome and heart wrenching drama. The execution, the cast, the OST, the filming was really wonderful. The cast did a really great job in bringing the characters to life.

Hauntingly Beautiful
I was waiting for the show to air on Netflix in my region for a couple of months now. It just got added this week so I binge-watched it in a couple of days (which I now absolutely regret, so I started rewatching it at a slower pace).

I have been personally dealing with depression half of my life, and I've come a long way, however, this show managed to open old wounds that I've ignored and in a way, make me realize that I need to heal as opposed to just living in a numb state of mind.

The main characters have all done an outstanding job at their roles. Kim Soo Hyun as the loving, caring brother, who bottles everything up, Ye Ji as the writer that can't connect to or seem to process her feelings and lastly, Oh Jung Se with his beautiful portrayal of someone with Autism. The stories and the messages they entail are where the beauty lies. I also absolutely loved the Tim Burton type of animation incorporated into most of the episodes. The cinematography was marvelous.

I finished watching the show yesterday morning and I've had a lump in my throat ever since. It gave me all the feels, from sadness to being frustrated/ angry to weeping like a babe to pure happiness. And although there was one revelation at the beginning of episode 15 that felt anticlimactic, it was so trivial to me because the story and the focus on the emotional healing was what made the show, so it really didn't bother me as I considered it a side thing.

I don't think I'll be getting over this show anytime soon, and I recommend watching it at a slower pace and not binging in order to appreciate the shows beauty in the smallest details.

Quirky but grows into wholesomeness
I really didn't know what to expect going into this drama, but I came out presently surprised.

All of the characters were interesting and my favourite would have to be Sang-tae. He is the sweetest man. I thought the actor did such a great job playing his part. I was very impressed. There were quite a few scenes with him where I cried or was close to crying.

I also liked Mun-yeong - she was obviously troubled by her past, but her character was like nothing I'd seen before so it was refreshing to watch.

Gang-tae - ugh, my baby! Like his brother, he is also very sweet, and very handsome too XD. I liked the relationship he shared with his brother and how he encouraged Mun-yeong to get along with Sang-tae and become his friend. Sang-tae and Mun-yeong's bond became so pure and wholesome.

The story was definitely interesting although it may have seemed a little slow in the beginning. To begin with I was like, ""this girl is CrAZy!"" But as the story progressed, we understood her unique and obscure nature. At the same, we also saw her grow as a person - becoming more warm as she and Gang-tae began to love each other, and also just how she was with Sang-tae.

I don't know if this was meant to be obvious/was obvious to everyone else, but I had a suspicion of the nurse who turned out to be Mun-yeong's mother. Especially when she was getting close to Sang-tae. Once it was revealed that she was Mun-yeong's mother, it all made sense with her father and the patient who went to Mun-yeong's house to wish her a happy birthday. Also, that actress just has a scary look about her. I don't know, I just got a vibe.

I still don't understand her reason for killing Gang-tae and Sang-tae's mother, like she is just an evil bitch! Their mother was only showing concern for Mun-yeong but that butterfly crazy lady did NOT like it, so she killed her!? I guess if you're a psychopath that's what you're going to do, but my God that is horrific.

The music was definitely interesting for this show, but I liked the quirky vibe - it went so well.

No specific spoilers
First let‚Äôs start with the portrayal of Koreans or Korean women rather as sexual beings,the fact that Koreans are the most conservative people and they made a drama like this showing emotions and sexual desire is amazing to witness. Shows that they are people too and there is no shame in desiring something. I like those parts a lot. It wasn‚Äôt anything slutty,it‚Äôs just how we humans are built.

Secondly,I loved how Sangtae grew as a character,as someone who has an autistic family member,witnessing some of their characteristics in Sangtae made my heart feel at ease. They are people too and living with a disability shouldn‚Äôt define their entire being. The portrayal of him being able to associate peoples feelings made my heart flutter especially when he was taking care of Munyeong,and he could tell what she was feeling.

Thirdly a new side of koreans dealing with mental illness. I won‚Äôt get too much into it but we all know it‚Äôs something they overlook.

Fourthly the relationship between Gantae and Munyeong is so complex but beautiful. They have good chemistry. They evoked feelings of loneliness and longing I didn‚Äôt know I had.

Lastly I honestly recommend this drama. It‚Äôs amazing. Please go watch it if you haven‚Äôt. I tried not to put any spoilers. The ending was so beautiful. The way Sangtae found his own path made me cry. I loved the way the characters kept developing,they weren‚Äôt stagnant. The supporting cast also didn‚Äôt feel like the supporting cast,the way they also developed without actually relying on the main characters was beautiful to see. I wish I hadn‚Äôt watched this drama because I want to experience it again with fresh new eyes.

MY FAVOURITE DRAMA EVER!!!
It's Okay to Not Be Okay it by far my favourite drama I've ever watched. Where should I even begin explaining.

First of all, the Characters: This isn't your typical the boy gets the pretty girl story, here the girl Ko Munyeong is a savage, speaks her mind type who gets whatever she wants no matter what, even if she has to kill. The male protagonist, Moon Gang Tae, is a unique character, he has quite some childhood trauma so he's able to hide his feelings very easily, he's also one of the few people who isn't scared of Ko Munyeong. Moon Sangtae is Gangtae's elder brother who has an autism problem, he acts like a child and has a fear of butterflies due to some circumstances.

Next the acting: Kim Soohyun and Seo Yeji have GREAT chemistry and can tackle such hard roles. Oh Jungse probably has the hardest character to portray in this drama but he executed it very well.

Finally the story: The story is full of twists and turns and includes a mystery, and romance part of it, the story is so well written that I can't get enough of it. It's also really unbelievable how 2 of the main characters even fall in love in the first place. IT'S VERY REWATCHABLE! I know that I'm not speaking for only myself but a lot of people watching that they are not ready to let this drama go when it finished.

A drama with it's highs and lows
I watched this show based on friend's recommendation with expectation of good drama. This show does shed light on mental challenges different set of people face in their lives, as story progress the show focuses on each character reasons for their difficulties but glosses over the importance of self healing instead rely on dramatic external factors for healing.

Acting wise, all 3 leads are good, it is oh jung-se (moon sang-tae) who manage to made me tear up a little. Cinematography, children book stories and family bond among all 3 leads are USP of this show; there is plenty of character development for the leads but i am not convinced on the progress.

K-drama has just had the most dramatic shift in history
Okay, that might be too much but for me it is.

Now, what to say...I have A LOT to say about this drama.

The storyline is one of the best I‚Äôve seen in Korean Drama history. Though, mental/psychological/psychiatrical stories have been made before but this drama truly dug deep into its theme. I applaud the writers for creating such a masterpiece and laying out the plot very well. To be honest, a mix of the usual cliche stories we often see are still in the drama but tweaked so‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry‚Äîdamn well that it wasn‚Äôt boring to watch. I like how exactly connected the title of the episodes are not only with Gang Tae and Moon Yeong but even with the extended stories of the supporting roles at the hospital. It‚Äôs very much clear how well the whole plot has been thought out, wonderful job!

The characters were beyond amazing. Their stories were all complete. All characters (at least those that matters) have their background stories and I like how well they were written. Starting from their mental/psychological needs to how they got it and how they were able to overcome it. I‚Äôd say that the characters were completely and perfectly sculpted. Each character has a reason why they are in the drama. And I also like how the friends surrounding the three of them never pulled them down but waited and kept on encouraging and supporting them no matter what. Kdrama writers...please take notes.

The whole series is full of symbolisms and contrasting ideas and I LOVE IT! The butterfly, the red shoes, the long hair, the scars, the bandages, the drawings‚Äîliterally oozing with symbolisms that I made it a game to find them while watching. And then the contrasting ideas: the butterfly could be both a symbol for being psycho or a cure; the fact that Sang Tae was considered the liability but most of the time his words give the greatest realization to Gang Tae; the fact that Gang Tae was so good with his job‚Äîcontrolling/appeasing people with mental/psychological/emotional needs‚Äîbut he‚Äôs in complete turmoil; the fact that Moon Yeong helped a lot of people overcome and pick themselves up when she‚Äôs the most broken one; and a lot more.

Cinematography! Wow just wow. I don‚Äôt know much but just the way it‚Äôs different from other dramas already deserve an acknowledgement from me. The transitions of the scenes are almost peculiar but it‚Äôs so fun. I also like how they actually show what each person is feeling or thinking in actual representations. At first I thought it has horror but then realized that they just wanted to let us see inside, and that‚Äôs really cool.

Need I say more about the cast? Sublime! Kim Soo Hyun has always been good, so that Ïù∏Ï†ï! Oh Jung Se truly truly did such a good job portraying a person with autism. But the most I‚Äôm impressed with is Seo Ye Ji, I‚Äôve always liked her, but I get to like her even more; I cannot imagine her not acting as Moon Yeong, she‚Äôs PERFECT for the role!

My last thoughts would be regarding Sang Tae and Gang Tae. As a person with a sister with special needs too, I‚Äôve been continuously affected and touched by most of the scenes between brothers, especially about ‚ÄúMoon Gang Tae is for Moon Gang Tae‚Äù...this feeling is inevitable and yes it‚Äôs not easy to overcome and I like how that‚Äôs the final scene; that everyone is their own and that it takes time to understand and accept. I also like how in the whole series, no unnecessary scenes where Sang Tae gets bullied by extras just for the sake of making a point that he‚Äôs different or just to say that he‚Äôs being discriminated and looked down upon. We don‚Äôt need that and I‚Äôm thankful for that writers.

Truly amazing drama. Will definitely be watching it again soon just so I could see what I missed before.

Master piece!
Strong storytelling, i love how they put all the pieces together and slowly develop the characters. It make the audience emerging with protagonists. The emotional engagement is absolutely beautiful. The order, the pace, the acting are meticulous. I would rate 12/10. I never watch any drama or movie with this kind of theme, the bromance, the love they have for each other are just really touching. I can put myself into their shoes by watching this whole series. Fabulous. Everyone acting skills are on point, especially KimSooHyun(main male cast), OhJungSe(the brother) and ParkGyuYoung are particularly good. I am totally astonished by it. I never expect they can be that good, all the tiny details and facial expressions are excellent. All the characters are really realistic, very 3d, the dilemma in life, the selfishness, the conflicts, what they experience shape who they are, their personality, their identities. The interactions and conversations between characters are interesting to watch.

Oh jung se did such an amazing job with his character in the play; Moon sang tea. His acting details were captivating. Sang tea was the purest and warm hearted. He was my comfort character while watching the drama. (‡πë‚Ä¢ ‡ºù ‚Ä¢‡πë)Àñ‚ô° Õé

Moon gang tea was fully able to heal from his childhood trauma and the feeling of being born for moon sang tea through the enchanting stories of kim moon young and healing other people as a caregiver. It was touching to see Gang tea and kim moon young both able to heal eachother.

A drama you keep in mind for a long time.
If you haven‚Äôt watched this drama I suggest you do it. It will be a roller coaster of emotions. This is one of those dramas you keep in mind for a long time.

It has been a really long time since i watched a good drama without having to skip some parts and very visually pleasing. The storyline was simple yet the actors made it even more interesting and watchable.

1. Ko Moon Young is now on my top favorite actress list. She appears very mysterious, serious and with a great sense of fashion. I‚Äôm tall and slim like her which gave some cool ideas about outfits I could wear. She appears tough but deep inside she is very soft and sensitive wanting to receive unconditional love. Despite the fact her mom wanted for Ko Moon to be just like herself, an evil, selfish, killer but Ko Moon became the best version of herself because she is now surrounded with love and a has a new family to lean on.

2.About artistic and design part I‚Äôm speechless. The colors in every scene, i mean everything is so detailed and aesthetically pleasing. The gothic aesthetic mixed with modern its so beautiful. Ko Moon Young‚Äôs inside part of the house Is a place I would like to explore. If i ever encounter an old 100 year old building or older ugh just let me be there living my fantasy.

3. Psychological. The story tells us how not everything we see or hear appears to be like that. People are very good at hiding their emotions and true feelings at some point but not for long. It‚Äôs the fear of rejection, low self esteem perhaps a goal they have to achieve, that makes them to lie. You can‚Äôt lie your true self and you know it. The more you do it the more hurt you‚Äôll get. So it‚Äôs better to speak the truth when you feel ready.

I could rewatch this drama anytime it‚Äôs so visually pleasing, especially Ko Moon Young scenes. Her fashion is always on point. You don‚Äôt get to see people dressed up like in everyday life so it‚Äôs exiting. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lot‚Äôs of Love

Korea needs to make more series like this
issues about mental health are pretty known nowadays, yet not everyone is brave enough to bring the issue to a movie or drama, and this one did and also did a very good job. it has a not-so-mainstream heroine, everyone has flaws here. i know korea also has dramas that bring the same topic like ""it's okay that's love"", and more, but we still need more of these to also educate people to be aware of mental health. that everyone has a story behind every action they did.

the acting? no need to question that since we know that kim soo hyun and seo ye ji are both a very talented actors and have a really good chemistry here. the other actors also did a good job, but my favorite is oh jung se. he did an amazing job playing an autistic character.

thumbs up for everyone who made this drama possible!!!

I may be biased with this review but how can I not be? Everything was perfect.
I always have been a fan of Kim Soo Hyun ever since I saw how a good actor he is in ""Moon Embracing the Sun"". This was his first drama after he got out of enlistment and I can dare say that he picked the right one. Well, he first had a cameo at ""Hotel Del Luna"" but that is another story. He is a great actor, I knew that all along and this drama highlighted it more. Seo Ye Ji has always been good so imagine my excitement when I found out they were in a project together. Add Oh Jung Se to the mix and we have one of the greatest trios we will love in KDramaland.

On to the story: ""It's okay not to be okay"" depicts the ways of how people cope with their inner selves. The title even suggests that it's okay to not be strong all the time. That everyone is broken, the only difference would be how we show it to the world. Gang Tae and Moon Young had the perfect chemistry but for me Sang Tae stole the show. Sang Tae gave the show its heart. He was the trio's glue. Gang Tae always thought unconsciously that his brother was a burden but the thing is his brother can sense what he's feeling. It's ironic that a person who seems like the broken one in front of the world is actually the one who understands what the ""normal people"" are going through.

Don't let me start with the OST. The songs are all perfect and it had retention. That's one of the criteria when I watch a drama, the songs should always hold meaning and that it should stick with me. Stick meaning that whenever I would hear the particular song, I would immediately think of the drama fondly.

The fairy tales for children made for the drama, which was ""penned"" by Moon Young's character also was perfect. I really enjoyed watching this drama and this is easily one of my fave 2020 KDramas.

Connects to Audience
First off I would like to say this drama connection to everyone and all audience. Like the drama says, ""its okay to not be okay"". Your life is not perfect, you will fall and fail, but its okay. Anyways, I enjoyed the drama so much, I've been rewatching over and over. Each time I rewatch it, I learn something new.

This drama is not a waste of your time, in fact, its the opposite, its so worth your 16 hour of life. You will not regret watching it. Its one of the best K-drama that I've seen for such a long time.

Worth the watch
Excellent drama to watch, had everything from funny moments to sadness. Real life issues when having to deal with people who have mental illness. Fear of nightmare coming to life. Dealing with how to respond to people you love, and got hurt by you or others in the past and present. Both leads chemistry was perfect. Both acted 100 , shows how well they have grown as actors and actress. Older brothers takes the drama to a whole other level. Excellent, excellent acting. First time watching him in a drama. Should be all year best actor award winner. The drama had a good flow within each episode and next to follow. Didn‚Äôt have any annoying people or storyline. Well written and well produced.

When you're not sure whether you should smile or cry
I felt like this is a great drama and often I wasn't sure myself how to react to scenes. Some were particularly sad, but still the next second I felt like smiling. Tragedy and humour are not far away from each other, I guess this is clearly here.

Furthermore I felt like the conflicts were often reasonable, it was interesting to watch and though I'm not an expert to judge people acting I still felt impressed. Especially regarding Moon/Mun Sang-tae.

The characters moreover changed significantly over the show and character development is certainly portrait well - and I felt like it's a good decision not to make up with everyone or run away for no reason. During the last episodes when Kang-tae consulted Oh Ji-wang I started thinking ""drama characters should more often consult others to avoid ridiculous impulsive acts"". Certainly I didn't agree on everything, but all over it was rather reasonable and the characters actually learned how to react to the things they had to face.

Therefore it's a story about how to love yourself, how to rely on others and how to become independent. That's rather clear. In addition it's about family. What's family? How can you become family? ... And it's fine to not be an adult in all kind of aspects.

Still I was rather surprised that you can become a caretaker without proper education, but well, it wasn't clearly mentioned either (but I mean they were on the run since Kang-tae turned 12...).
What disturbs me slightly is again the villain (similar to ""My love from another star""). Certainly because this a drama about mental issues one could argue ""she's nuts anyway"", but what's her point for murder? It was pretty weak in my opinion. Furthermore I don't think she had much of a reason to disappear either after her husband got hospitalized. I mean, she had the chance to monitor Moon-young even better if she didn't pretend to be dead. Therefore I'm not that convinced about these.

The romance was rather persistent and certainly cute to watch. They even switched roles regarding ""hunter"" and ""prey"" in the end - but well, even an unlikely romance can be the perfect match in the end.

They way they arranged the scenes were a showoff, especially at the beginning, later on I didn't notice it as much anymore, but I liked how they linked different scenes at the beginning.

Last but not least I think it's a good thing to address the topic itself in a drama. I can imagine it's not a likely topic in South Korea or East Asia in general, furthermore disabled people don't show up as much in dramas, at least not to this extend. So it's good to watch these two brothers finding their way - and how difficult it often must've been for them to continue. At the same time I like it that they mentioned child abuse - KDramas often made me feel like it's normal for parents to hit their children for all sort of reasons though I find that horrible. This behaviour wasn't justified here though, but instead the talked about the consequences.

All in all ""Saikojiman gwaechanha"" is worth watching. It worth watching all of these rather different characters struggling and finding their way in the long run.

As close to 'perfect' as you can get
You can go on an entire journey in the course of watching this drama. I went through a transformation because of this show. Each week I watched I felt more and more connected to every character. From the main three leads down to the guest stars. Everyone had a story that was worth telling and learning from and relating to. From just seeing the trailer earlier this year, I was interested, but by the end of episode one I knew it was different and knew I would love it, though as each week went on I fell more and more in love with the show and everything about it.
It's not been too long since I've gotten into the kdrama world but thus far only a few dramas have made me feel even close to what this show made me feel and frankly, this is now my number one drama as of today. There have been comparisons to other shows but I can assure you there is no other show that breaks the mold of what you think may happen quite like this one. From the acting, to directing, the cinematography, the wardrobe, the score and soundtrack...the execution was nearly perfect. And I don't use the word 'perfect' lightly. I will say if you focus on the characters and their journey, you will not be disappointed.
It's all about their journey from pain into happiness, each one broken and shattered and needing the others and their connection to each other find the solace of knowing what it is to truly be a family in every sense of the word. There are moments of joy, moments of terror, moments of bliss, moments of grief...so many emotions and we are all going through them together. Each moment was worth it because the road it led them on reached a destination that made all the pain worth it.
A good metaphorical phrase to describe it is 'you can't appreciate the sun if you never know what rain is.' To appreciate any kind of happiness you really do have to go through the darkness to reach the light, and when that light comes you will know that the struggle through the dark really did make it worth it, you earned the right to be happy. It was said this was a 'healing drama', and to me it is absolutely that. Not just for the characters, but as a viewer, as well.

beautiful, mindblowing, amazing
first of all, i just want to say that this kdrama is not one i would normally go towards but i LOVED it !! so much !! the plot was heavy but the plot didn't feel heavy or get boring in the middle which is normally what happens in plot heavy dramas, it was beautiful, i felt all emotions, i felt happy, sad, angry, it was just all in all mindblowing. the writing, the cinematography, the characters, the acting EVERYTHING. there was so much meaning, it was written beautifully and every single character had so much depth, including the side characters which was great to see. i loved the settings, i loved how every single character had a part in the drama and they each had a meaningful story which we got to see. we were shown the patients stories and why they were in there and it was just so mind opening. the representation of each mental illness was beautiful.


i also loved seeing the development every character had, especially our main characters. the relationship development between sangtae and gangtae was so beautiful and meaningful, i cried so much for them both. the found family too
however the reason i didn't give it a full 10 stars was because, at the beginning, it was very confusing and boring, it was hard to get into until around episode 4. also, the ending was a bit of a let down, i wish we saw more from the ending, i'm glad we got to see the patients ending especially pilwong, jungtae, areum and gi-do but i wish we saw more for the other characters endings for example, i wish we got to see how the publishing company was after the release of the last book, i wanted to see more for jaesu and seungjae. i feel as though the ending was a bit rushed to be completely honest but it still was an amazing and beautiful drama that deserves all the hype it got. i genuinely don't think there'll ever be a kdrama like this again

Terrific acting but boring and filled with plot holes in the second half
Likes:
1. The greatest part of this drama is the wonderful story about Sangtae and Gangtae. Esp the fantastic performance of Oh Jung Se. I loved the progress of the brothers, from being bitter and holding past grudges, to letting it all out and starting to have honest communication. To finally realizing they need to support each other. Sangtae belongs to Sangtae. Gangtae belongs to Gangtae. But they are brothers.
2. More than the romance between Munyeong and Gangtae, i loved how the three became their own family. How Munyeong learned to open up and start feeling for other people. Loved the messages of her fairytales.
4. Also loved Juri's mom and Dir Oh.

Dislikes:
1. Lots of boring episodes and scenes that i fast forwarded some of them.
2. Lots of plot holes. Like how did The brothers survive on their own for 20 years? Where and when did they meet Jaesu? With both parents gone, who took care of Munyeong growing up?
3. Nurse Park turning out to be Munyeong's mom doesnt make sense. They teased this twist so much but ended in just 1 or 2 episodes without sufficient explanation on how she survived or backstory why she turned psycho.
4. The reveal of younger Do Hui Jae's face was disappointing. For all the mystery surrounding her face and for all the talk about Munyeong's dad falling with love with her because she was beautiful, i was expecting a super elegant and gorgeous looking lady but she was not.
4. The stories of the patients didnt leave a lasting impression on me, except for the old guy and Kwak Dong Yeon's cameo. They could have totally removed the patients stories and the drama can still survive. There were unnecessary characters or underutilized characters. Juri and Ceo Lee were relegated to just a secondary love line when they could have better storylines. Seungjae seemed more like comic relief. I was interested in Jaesu and his story. Why he ended up following the brothers around and where he gets his money to be able to open his own businesses. Instead Jaesu only shows up to be Sangtae's babysitter or when Gangtae needs a shoulder.

Rating: 8.5/10

Masterpiece
Plot/story: The story is like Grimm‚Äôs fairy tales with light drama. Deep but not too deep. It‚Äôs like a book for adults who loved fairytales as a child. Reality will slap you with truths but you will learn from it. Or if you are going through something, this might help you. This drama is like your much-needed warm hug when you‚Äôre feeling down.

Acting: I can‚Äôt say much about their acting because they were all great. Amazing. Even if you might find some annoying characters you‚Äôd still love them at the end of the drama. They serve their purpose. KSH cried more than SYJ, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good thing for some but his eyes are like faucet that never runs out of water. Same goes for me. I love family dramas because it‚Äôs my weakness and this drama has so much warmth, love and kindness that you wish you have in your life. Character development of every character is just well~executed, except for the villain. ?

Music: Not memorable enough for me but the graphics are perfect. Cinematography is just magnificent.

Rewatch Value: I don‚Äôt rewatch dramas that much but if I may feel down or sad, I might rewatch this. This drama is something that you want to recommend to everyone who‚Äôs struggling or to someone you‚Äôre close with, like your family and best friends.

Overall: I have nothing much to complain except for the main female lead make up when sleeping and the real story of her mother. However, it didn‚Äôt make me dislike the drama. I might wonder about it but the execution of how they got their happy ending is satisfying for me. Kudos to all the actors, directors, producers, screenwriters and the rest of the crew. This drama is an art.

Fairy tale about healing journey
""Psycho but it's okay"" tackles issues such as mental health disorders. And it does it pretty well. In a world where mental disorders may look as ""weird"" ""crazy"" etc this drama does a great job at showing that it's okay! It's just an illness and that with the help of others and your own courage to heal you will be okay!

To be honest except the stunning visuals i didn't like it that much at the start. Maybe because thee female lead was acting like the type of male leads i don't like. And i kept forgetting that she is ill too. The ""forced"" romance didn't come at me at first too. Later though I started to like them and see that they were meant for each other because both needed help, and both received it though each other.
It was a very healing story and i liked the small sub-character's stories too. The darkness that surrounded the characters and how they were fighting with that darkness. However I was expecting much more from the ""big reveal"" and the last episode. Maybe because it was building up really intensefully throughout the drama and after all that build up the revelation, the big secret wasn't as big and special as it may have seemed. Maybe it was just because my expectations soared too high in the sky. Same with the ending. But it was a quite satisfying and healing one. Plus i think it is not my place to judge the pain that all these characters had. Because each and every person's pain is big and it is not to be ever compared.

As i said, i think this is a character driven story. The interesting characters were really charming and enchanting. Starting with Moon Young and Kang Tae ending with the patients in the OK hospital.
A character that really had an impact on me was Sang Tae and his growth. Autism is an illness too and a really hard one to be portrayed in a drama, but the actor did an amazing job. Sang Tae's growth was really something I enjoyed a lot. He also said a lot of wise words! Even naive and innocent with a mind of 8 year old, sang tae could see through a lot and say things that grown-ups may have not noticed because of overthinking :) . I was also surprised at the actor Kim Joon Hwon who played the president of publishing company Lee Sang In. He was really different here so at first i didn't even notice that it's the same actor who played doctor Park Min Gook in Romantic Doctor 2. I also really like Kim Chang Wan who played director of the OK hospital Oh Jee Wang. He is a great singer and i love how they used his songs in here too. Also his character was very wise and i loved each word he said :) Of course there is also Kim Min Young who is as always the best mom :)

Music was very enchanting especially the opening theme and the opening scenes :) though i couldn't make much sense of the English lyrics xD
Of course Go Moon Young's wardrobe is something to look forward too.
The cinematography is stunning.

For me the highlight of this drama were the fairy tales, the drawings and animations. :) That is what i liked the most in this drama. :)

....""So don't forget it and overcome it. Only the ones who overcome have the right to be happy. If you don't, then you will become a child who can never grow up""....

What i liked:
Fairy tales, Cinematography, healing, side characters with their illnesses, Hospital director, the castle aesthetics, Sang tae.
What i didn't like:
mostly the problems were because i expected too much from this story :) It had such a strong start that my expectations flew into space lol :)

If you are hesitating to watch it or not i suggest to try it a little then decide :) It has a nice share of comedy and suspense so you might not be bored :) Plus the nice messages :) so it will definitely go to my list of dramas with good messages :)

I won't recover from this probably
I watched this because Netflix would not stop recommending it to me. And let me tell you, weeks later I am still thinking about this drama (and listening to the OST from it). The acting is superb, the story is entertaining, and the theme of the show really hits home. Also can we talk about the FL's outfits...iconic. I think what I really appreciated about this drama though was it's uniqueness. Yes, it's a romance. But beyond that it brings into discussion so many other topics surrounding mental health and the importance of family and it's done in a way that feels both interesting and almost a little edgy but also comforting. I realize that doesn't exactly make sense since it implies a contrast, but I think this show manages to do just that. As a viewer I was invested in all the characters (not just there for the main couple like I sometimes am). Also it's a surprisingly pretty show visually to watch, weaving animation into the storyline. However, this show is not like other dramas. It is deep and it does feel a little dark sometimes. It's one of those shows you watch and end up thinking about beyond ""wow that was cute"". It's kind of a masterpiece, but I think you need to be in the right mood to watch it and appreciate it.

Would I rewatch? Probably
Would I recommend? Definitely

I'm a vegetarian and I'm fully against animal violence, but,...
SOMEBODY PLEASE GET RID OF THAT DEER
(just take him to a national reservation or sth)
otherwise the drama was great, loved it

it seems this has to have at least 500 characters, so let's do it...
I really liked the story, it was original and the creators were not afraid to deal with some topics, that are quite controversial. It was fun but also realistic, the drama really showed that 'it's okay to not be okay', and that's what I really appreciated. Both Seo Yea-ji and Kim Soo-hyun were PERFECT, no complaints at all. The others were great too, but these two, especially Yea-ji were just born for their roles. Oh Jung-se was irreplaceable too. Jang Young-nam was a big surprise, didn't expect it at all.
I don't have much more to say, only because it was so good that I don't know how to describe it. Maybe just one tiny complaint: I've seen Moon Gang-tae cry way too many times, they made him suffer too much, it breaks my heart. Apart from those parts, I could watch it over and over again.

I had only one problem with this drama: THAT DAMN DEER (and Moon Gang-tae crying)

Absolutely loved this series, however, with one issue
First off, I have never written a review on this website before, however, I felt the need to with this one. I will not do a traditional break down of what I thought about the individual parts of the show including cast, music, story, etc... Although I did love the music especially in this drama, and my being a fan of KSY did make this story more enjoyable. However, I will say that it takes more than just the actors to make me watch to the end, and I finished this drama in a solid 2-3 days. Back to the point, if you clicked on this review to see my one issue this would be it:

I was kind of disappointed with the way they dispatched the main antagonist. There was an incredible build up to the revelation of who the main villain of the story actually was. You were always told about her, but you didn't get a face until a ways into the show itself. That being said, the payoff was underwhelming. Moon Young's mother was made out to be this cruel and manipulative villain that would stop at nothing to get what she wants. She always gets her way and has even escaped death to do so, but in her first main physical altercation with the protagonists, she gets arrested. This person who could barely be described as human due to her lack of emotion or understanding of love and warmth was dealt with an episode or two after she was revealed. I simply can't forget how quickly I got over the impact of her character. It felt like she was always a presence throughout the show, this creepy shadow over your shoulder, but then she just disappeared. I don't mean that her creepiness vanished when her real face was revealed, but it vanished when I realized that she simply wasn't as strong and manipulative as I thought she was because she made a mistake the first time she tried to do something after she revealed herself.

I know this is a drawn on review, but I felt the need to share my opinion. In all honesty, it was just a disappointing moment in an otherwise incredible series. I quickly got over it once the story started focusing on a difference aspect, but that also sort of saddens me. The last few scenes with her character had little impact on me because of how rushed it felt. I do still, however, recommend this show if it is the type of stuff you're comfortable with. It isn't for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed and many other people did as well.

Earnest tearjerker despite some issues
I don't think I've ever watched a show before where the majority of episodes made me cry, but this is it. This was my first Kdrama, since I've been trying to diversify the Cdrama-heavy landscape of my Asian drama watching, so I had no idea what I was getting into. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself really invested in this story and the characters, both laughing out loud and crying ugly tears at turns.

Now, this show is touted as one that pioneers discussion around mental health issues. Is it that groundbreaking? Not really, at least not in the world of international media. I admire the show's efforts to define medical terms, to show that therapy is necessary and important, and to humanize people with mental health issues (e.g. PTSD, alcoholism, autism). However, there's still many issues with its portrayals of the world of mental health care. The show is still often in danger of perpetuating stereotypes about various mental health issues/disorders, and there are times when I feel the healthcare workers in the show, including Doctor Oh, behaved problematically, unprofessionally and were sometimes straight-up unethical. There were important themes that were introduced but not well-explored, like those of addiction, and the long painful process that therapy often is. Nonetheless, I think a show like this is important to have in East Asia, where mental health is still a taboo subject - and hey, it's hard to find a show even in Western media that accurately portrays mental health issues and the therapy process.

On its own, this show is a fantastic and authentic portrayal of healing from trauma, and finding your own identity despite seemingly pre-determining forces. Ko Moon-young has a mother who I would describe as deeply narcissistic - she sees her daughter as an extension of herself, and did her darndest to suppress Moon-young's emotional growth during her childhood (this dynamic kind of reminded me of Ms. Havisham and Estella from Great Expectations?). Gang-tae has spent his whole life as his brother Sang-tae's keeper, an unhealthy situation that's exacerbated by them becoming orphans at a young age. I really loved seeing these three characters form and grow genuine relationships with each other, as well as their conflicts that often went to fraught, and even vicious places. Concerning the romance between Moon-young and Gang-Tae, I was pretty worried it would be a toxic relationship framed as a romantic one - and oh man it's toxic at the start! - but the show was surprisingly good at showing its evolution into a mutually healing relationship. There were parts that were a bit cheesy and felt hastily thrown together - but it's fine, I'll take it. Sang-Tae is great, and his character arc is so rewarding. He's kind of a character stereotype of the autistic man with an idetic memory and savant-like abilities, but the show handles him with such tenderness and grace. Oh Jung-Se is fantastic at bringing out this character's vulnerability, warmth, and moments of genuine strength. In fact all three of these actors are excellent and I admire their willingness to take their character moments to raw and uncomfortable places many times during this show.

(By the way, I loved Ko Moon-young's fashion, especially her witchy wardrobe at the beginning. I liked that her clothes became lighter and less ostentatious as the show progressed, but I did miss those dark witchy dresses.)

Generally I loved how grounded and human most of the characters were in this show. They all make mistakes and sometimes even have crippling flaws, but ultimately mean well in their own way. I ended up sympathizing with characters I didn't even expect to care about, like Sang-in, who was kind of a buffoon in the beginning, or Joo-ri, who just seemed like the third corner of a love triangle at first. Even characters I dismissed as irrelevant wankers turned out to have vulnerabilities and completely understandable motivations.

Even if the mental health themes were thoroughly explored, there were other really interesting recurring themes that the show explored really well. Food as proxy for emotional warmth is recurring motif, and reflects how characters like Ko Moon-young accept care from others even if they can't verbally express the need. There's also a theme of stories and fairy tales as ways of communicating with the world about life. Another big theme is parenthood - there are lots of parents in this show, and for the most part they all approach parenthood in the best way they know how. We go from the grounded and loving parenting style from Joo-ri's mother, to the flawed but well-meaning style of the two brothers, to the deeply toxic and domineering style of Moon-young's mother Do Hui-jae. I especially appreciated that with respect to Sang-tae and Gang-tae's mother, we can see how much Gang-tae was hurt by her investment of energy in Sang-tae over him, but also how in retrospect she really loved him just as much and tried to be a good parent to him as well. If I were to expand on this theme I would have had the show explore the psychology of Do Hui-jae's narcissism and how that realized itself in her parenting.

This brings me to what I think is the biggest flaw of the show *SPOILERS AHEAD*

So I liked when Do Hui-jae was just this spectre who cast a shadow over the three main characters' lives - I liked the choice to not reveal her face for most of the show, which made her scenes that much more eerie. That way, she was more of a symbol for the amorphous nature of trauma and how it can shape your life without explicitly being present. But the moment she became a real person and became this typical horror villain who laughs maniacally, she was so much harder to take seriously. I waited for the show to add some complexity to her like they did with other characters, but unfortunately that did not happen. In a show that features such complex, human characters, Do Hui-jae just didn't fit in. The final arc where she shows up, messes up Sang-tae's painting and has a final showdown with the three mains felt like an aberration on the rest of the much more grounded story. The fairly high quality of the other episodes makes this much more frustrating - I probably would have rated this show a 9 or even a 10 if not for this set of three episodes. I wish the writers had found a way to make her presence remain ambiguous, or to make her a more nuanced character, but I guess we can't have everything.

But nonetheless this is great and moving show that comes across and authentic and earnest, and I definitely wouldn't be against watching it again.

Beautiful.
An imperfectly beautiful modern fairy tale. From the episode introduction, to FL's voice, to ML's acting prowess, to SangTae, to the community they moved into. Everything. This drama made me a crying mess on more ways than one. Very relatable glimpse at grey areas, trauma, ptsd, trust issues and love, with lots of light hearted moments in between.

It has all the best bits. (Apart from the second half, because that's where Korean drama fuck things up, by making every disappoint you in the second half. Anyway end-rant/)

something was missing for me?
This drama was pretty good. It touched on a lot of different perspectives you don't normally see. It was definitely interesting and I liked the unique personalities going on. The actors also did an amazing job. The actor for Sang-Tae was so great. He made me believe that he was the character and that he wasn't acting. The child actors for Sang-Tae and Gang-Tae were also great.

I would like to mention that a lot of times dramas are ended in a weird and unsatisfying way. I won't spoil anything, but just saying the ending was satisfying and it is one of the best last episodes I've ever seen.

Even though this drama was really good and made me cry the most, for some reason it didn't make me want to finish it. When I watch one of the episodes, I'm always super immersed, but when it's time to watch another one, I almost don't want to. All of the episodes were good, but some part of me didn't want to continue, even though there were only a couple episodes left. Of course, in the end I pulled through. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a chance you might lose interest and that the show isn't that bingeable (unless you want to go through an emotional wreck). I'm not sure.... I can't pinpoint what it was.

Yes, I didn't really want to finish it, but I still really liked the drama. There was good character development, the music was good and a lot of the supporting roles' stories were included, all of which I liked very much. I would definitely recommend watching it, since the show was well thought out and had a good story.

Something about the show just wasn't for me.

Heartwarming and Best Korean Drama
Since 2019...I have following Korean Drama deeply and I have watched many Korean Drama but It's okay to be okay is one best best korean Dramas I have ever seen till date. This drama is on another level because of beautiful story line, best dialogues, narrating the story, director and cast give full efforts to this drama.

Interesting FACT: The screen writer Jo Yong said the plot and storyline inspired by her real life love someone.
(No spoilers for reviews)

Right from the first episode, I was pulled in and I really didn't want it to end. This drama for those who love dark romantic, motivate, psychological dramas. I don't right any character name Or anything related to drama. This series gives you roller coaster ride to your emotions, curiosity from the beginning where you could not to stop in between instead you will keep waiting for the next episode to watch. When I have completed this drama, it effects that healed my soul somewhere... I am really really... Thank You to all members, cast, director and specially screen writer Jo Yong for healing my soul and many souls around the world.

I know the Trailer is not so convincing but definitely is a must watch!
Would definitely have to say my favourite drama of all time. I do not think there are many many dramas like this especially addressing mental health. I'm the type of person to only watch Romantic Comedies because isn't life already sad enough? haha. For some reason I had a good feeling that this drama is going to be a very nice drama. Just like most people I also judge a drama by its trailer however when I watched the trailer I thought it was going to be just a very sad drama that's the main reason why I put back on watching it. However scrolling through Instagram I saw a few clippings of the show and I realise that the atmosphere of this drama throughout the whole show is not sad and there are different emotions actually involved, like humour and I think that is why this show is so amazing as to how they address different problems that the characters face and the weakness of the characters but at the same time there is humour in world which doesn't make you feel so sad. I think when making a movie or a show having a good set of characters with a strong background is very hard to do however this show nailed it with having three main roles with very different personalities tackling their own issues and just growing not physically but mentally as they progress. I think this show has given great importance to every small detail like cinematography, choice of OST, the clothes used to set the character etc which really adds great value. From not only prioritising perfecting and casting the main characters but the side characters too. Adding minute details like Sharing the illustrations written by Ko Moon-young which can often be connected to one of the three main roles and sometimes to life itself, helps understand the character further in depth.

Coming to the characters further. Ko Moon-young a children's book author who is seen to be a very cool hearted person when at the beginning when you see flashbacks of her childhood it would be common to find it hard to understand her character because she didn't have emotions of an ordinary child and so at first I did find it strange but but then I realise that's just how she was brought up by her mother. She was taught not to feel emotions and when later on she meets Moon Gang-tae she slowly understands different emotions and feels the warmth and love that she had never received when she was a child.

Moon Gang-tae the younger brother who is an employee at a psychiatric hospital. Now Moon Gang-tae is a person who has suppressed all his emotions because I am very young age she has been taking care of his brother and he feels like he needs to be the adult to be able to take good care of him. In this process he's never been Will to live a carefree childhood as his mom made him responsible for his brother and to take good care of him and along the way he was a child he did feel that his mom never love them enough and only loved his elder brother were the case was that she just gave him the extra love for his condition. This really hampers Moon Gang-tae's character as all his life he's only been protecting and taking care care of his elder brother and no one was really protecting and taking care of him because he lost his parents at a very early age. Moon Gang-tae's character progresses as later on he opens up more abhor emotions and allows Ko Moon-young to take care of him.

Saving the best character for the last, Moon Sang-tae (Moon Gang-tae's autistic elder brother). At the beginning of the show Moon Sang-tae is a very dependent character who finds it hard to read others emotions and understand non family relationships due to his condition. However, as the show progresses, this character grows and learns to accept Ko Moon-young as family and determined to protect his family and follow his dream of becoming an illustrator. Seeing this massive change in character and how he later takes care not only on Moon Gang-tae but of Ko Moon-young too is enough to make a grown man cry. I also have to mention Lee Kyu-sung who plays as Moon Gang-tae in the show did a fabulous job.

Not everyone will like this series because it isnt a typical korean drama, it worked us through different kinds of mental disorder and ways to overcome them.
It is not fictional, or supernatural it is more of a healing drama, and for people who have suffered or are still suffering from someone kind of mental disorder will be able to relate on many levels to this drama, it shows that everyone can change, everyone can heal if you just have the right person or persons by your side.....
My sister isn't a kdrama fan like me, but this particular one she was heads over hills for. It a drama worth all time if you just open you mind to something new

Got me hooked!
I'm glad I decided to watch this series because the story line is superb, the acting is great, the on-screen chemistry between all actors are awesome, and even though the story is a bit dark but they mixed it with enough humor, romance, and ""healing"" in it which make this drama such a treat to watch.

The lead actress plays her character incredibly well and all those dresses she got to wear are to go psycho for ?

There are few surprises in this drama that you didnt really see coming but some how it worked well.

All in all, this ""helping each other to heal"" drama is definitely my favorite Korean by far of 2020.

This is probably the first time I'm actually going to review a drama but that's because it is just THAT GOOD! Or perhaps as someone already wrote in the reviews boooy what a journey it has been!!! The story starts off with not so usual plot line but with each episode you get to see even more unusual (for the kdrama world) yet very real life struggles and good yet also troubled people trying to help in these matters. In each episode we get to laugh a little bit, dream a little bit and cry a little bit. If you watch this drama you cannot simply remain neutral or fantasize about a favorite actor/actress and be done the drama the moment it end. There are too many different stories and morals, presented by the very best acting by every single one of the cast. In addition the music and the sets are so good.. This kdrama is simply like nothing I've seen so far and I hope the cast and the production team get as much awards as they can for it.

such a healing drama
The thing about this drama is, every character is so fleshed out and the plot and character development is so well done and natural that it's believable. Like for example, if you watched the first two episodes and then skipped to the final couple episodes, the characters are SO drastically different that it's almost unbelievable, but the thing is that the writers did such a good job with this slow build that the characters' development is organic.
I'm absolutely in love with the story, it's about two broken souls finding healing and love through each other. It touched on topics that I'm not used to in kdrama.
Also WOW! Seo Yea-Ji and Kim Soo-Hyun are the most attractive and good-looking pair I've ever seen, their beauty is out of the world.

The Plot is simply amazing!
I can easily say that this drama is definitely one of my favorites! The story line, the OST, the actors, the camera work EVERYTHING is perfect. It's crazy how in just one episode you can feel sadness, then happiness and then anger. There were moments when I literally laughed while crying. I personaly thing that the drama is about mental healt, but the way everything is presented to you is just unique. There is friendship, there is sibling relationship and there is LOVE. It's also shown how important is the role of a parent in the child's life. The love between the main characters is strong, but also full of obstacles that the characters go throug together.
The acting is perfect, the actors can make you feel everything you are supposed to feel. Most of all i want to mention the great acting of Oh Jung Se who plays the brother of Kim Soo Hyun's character.
The OST is beautiful, i still listen to a lot of the songs.
And finally, my favorite part is THE BOOKS. The books which the female lead writes. I'm going to buy them for sure. They really made me cry because you can feel her pain in every story. And also, the way she interprents old and well known fairy tales is really diffrent, which i really like.
I can say so much more things about this brilliant drama but I'll stop here. Overall i just want to say, if you wonder whether it's worth taking the time to watch it, then stop wondering, IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT!

Wow this story is so deep
I could not stop watching.... the acting, the storyline etc everything was well thought out. I had my moments of tears, happiness and hope. I‚Äôm so happy I finally sat down to watch this. If you‚Äôre looking for the usually soft romantic plot, this is not it. This is a realistic and true story of a brother who gave all to take care of his brother, story of the mentally ill and story of love that was fought hard to keep. The love of a community, how everyone took care of each other. How the I‚Äôll-love of a mother can be tragic etc. this story has it all.

Extremely well written and unique
I have watched many many kdramas and out of all of them this one is my most favorite. Literally everything about this drama is perfect from acting to story to OSTs to cinematography. Most people who do not like this drama, they don't like it because they fail to understand the deeper meaning behind almost everything in this drama. This is not a typical romcom type drama with a crazy plot or a lot of plot twists. This drama is meant to address mental health issues and it does a very good job at doing so. The character development of all the characters in this drama (even the side characters) was flawless, which made me attached to all the characters. The OSTs fit the scenes so perfectly that they did not seem awkward or unnecessary at all. I cannot praise the acting in this drama enough because it was amazing. I don't think anyone else could have portrayed the roles of Gangtae, Sangtae, and Moonyoung as beautifully as Kim Soohyun, Oh Jungse, and Seo Yeji. Many people like to judge the plot twist in this drama but that plot twist is left up to interpretation and has a valid explanation that is related to mental health in general. I know that a lot of people think that this drama romanticized mental illness but I personally feel like they humanized individuals with mental illnesses as there is still a huge stigma associated with having a mental illness in many cultures (Korean culture being one of them). Overall, I think this drama was just amazing and it deserves the hype it got.

If u haven't watched it yet... What you waiting for??
This is the best drama you gonna watch ever, every single detail was on point, The Casting, The acting, The Story, The music and The coustumes every thing.. The casting- Sang-tae Gang-tae and Ko-Mun-Yeong i can never belive that they were acting there it was so good so clean and i bet my leg no one could have played these character except the real cast... I could recommend everyone to watch this drama because its really healing, and everyone could relate too maybe some point of there life... The music- It is so refreshing i love the playlist and my fav songs were Breath and The Silence. The coustums were also on point like seo-ye-ji (ko-mun-yeong) she can really put in anything and look drop dead ....

I want to talk about how the team made every single detail so carefully for example at first ep Ko-Mun-Yeong had black nailpolish then it turned light green and then at last white thta means when she had her trama and the fear she had black then slowly she got her family who made her forget the past n then the nailpolish turned white... And there are many more which r carefully detailed...

You can never watch a better drama than this go for it.. its the best Drama you will ever see in your life...~~~~~

A heartfelt, fun, moving drama.
There are shows that have the golden trifecta of excellent writing*, directing and acting. A show can still be good with two of the three, but the best shows will always stand out in all three areas. And this show not only excelled at all three but brought so much more to the table.

Here are some of the things that make this show even a step above the rest--

1. Characters that have so much depth and have real emotional arcs. Each of the three main characters has real depth and real growth throughout the series. (Sang Tae is an absolute stand out, one of my favorite characters and performances in years.) The characters are imperfect--at times good and bad, at times kind and cruel, at times cold and vulnerable. They slowly learn and grow from their interactions with each other and with others around them, and at the end of the show you almost can't believe how far they've come since the first episode. And this isn't just for the main characters, there is growth and arcs for almost every side character as well.

2. The timely focus on mental illness. All our main characters struggle with mental issues and trauma. Also the show explores a variety of mental illnesses in many wonderful side characters who also have growth and attention. It doesn't shy away from the scary and ugly side of mental illness, but also handles each character with a lot of understanding and compassion.

3. The unique tone and color of the show . So many dramas have good storylines and directing and acting, but they lack a certain cohesion in the visual storytelling. This show had such a distinct and unique flavor. I wish more k dramas would put in the extra effort to establish that.

4. Romance that enhances rather than dominates the story. Something I really loved about this show that you don't see in romantic shows is how the characters grew from and interacted with so many of the other side characters. It wasn't just the main couple having all of the dramatic moments or always being the one to help or rescue the other, each of our main trio had a whole cadre of people they opened up to, learned from and got help and support from. It was really wonderful and realistic, and made the sweet romance all the more beautiful. I would argue that the relationship between all three of the leads was the real main romance of this show, and it makes it so much more meaningful.

5. Great balance of light and dark. There were times each episode I laughed out loud. Times I sighed. And times I wept. The pacing was perfect--they were able to seamlessly switch from lighthearted and fun to serious and deep. You really get a little bit of everything with this show.

This show really felt like a breath of fresh air in what's becoming a somewhat stale K drama scene lately, especially in romantic dramas. One of the best shows of the year, by far. Will remember this one for a long while.

*There was one storyline that was very sloppily resolved. I knocked a half point from the story for that, but it almost seems like there's something there (actor scheduling conflict, etc) that messed that up because the writing for the rest of the drama is near perfect. It's also not really that important to the main character arcs. It's just strange and confusing, though, and I'm still scratching my head about what lead the writing to go so wrong there. I only affects maybe half to one episode and not even all that much. It's just a weird blip in an otherwise really wonderful show.

A must watch
I was not part of the hype train when I started, I saw the high rating and decided to give it a shot.

To be honest on the first episode I thought about dropping it because I hate shows where the main actor/actress is being a total asshole for no specific reason, but I stayed and watched a few more episodes and I damn, I'm happy that I did.

### Casting

I think that the acting in this drama was amazing, the story is not something totally original or so ground-breaking, but the acting is the thing that kept you invested in the characters and their story.

I don't think that there is not even one of the main or support cast that I have something bad to say for his/her acting ability.

Only props to all of them, truly enjoyable to watch them play!

### Story

While the story is not something original it felt fresh and was a joy to invest your time and forget about everything.

The only issue I had was with the mother story arc and how was handled by the end, it felt poorly constructed and rushed, but hey, it can't be all perfect.

Other than that the story flowed really well and was really amazing to experience.

The comedy in this show was on point as well as the drama aspect of it, it mashed really well and it's not very often than I can burst laughing in one moment and cry in another one.

### Re-watch

I've reached it least 2-3 times already and specific scenes more than 10 times.

### Overall

I haven't watched too many shows, but I consider this to be at the top 3 for me at the moment.

So I highly recommend it!

Worth the sleepless nights of binging
""It's Okay Not to Be Okay"", these words didn't really mean much to me until I watched this drama. I always thought of these as just another word of pity, nothing special. Which has now changed, because now it carries a story of a lifetime for me. It has become just so many things to me, that I find it difficult to express in words.
This show is one of those rare shows that leaves an empty void in my heart after it's over. I rarely get emotional over shows, since I know, for a matter of fact, that they are fiction, they lack a taste of realism, there are no happy endings because there never was a start, to begin with. But man, this story hit me like a train, it touched every emotional corner in my heart that I forgot once existed. I can't describe in words just how great and amazing of an adventure it was for me to sit and binge this show. A rollercoaster of emotions and a journey of emotional learning.

The chemistry of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Yea Ji is phenomenal. I can't believe just how well they both fit into their characters like they're are specifically made for them and their phenomenal acting tops it off. The Eyes scene from Episode 1 gave me goosebumps. Their expressions, body language, everything was perfect. I just can't believe this wasn't real, and it was just fiction. Oh Jung Se nailed his role as Moon Sang Tae, which I believe was one of the most challenging roles in the entire drama. The way in which he portrayed the character was sheer magic. Every character in this drama fit perfectly with each other like a jigsaw puzzle.

It is said that storytelling is an art, and not everyone can do it. And Park Shin-woo is definitely a master of it. Everything about this show is perfect, the OST, cinematography, acting, scriptwriting, the chemistry between characters. The consistency of the characters and the emotional buildup were perfect. This drama picks up a very interesting way to portray trauma, people, and how it impacts their lives, and this sets them apart from the rest. Whoever came up with the fairy tale idea deserves an award. It was beautifully portrayed and well connected with the overall story. The final story - Finding the Real Face, sums everything up perfectly. I love how no character was ignored or forgotten. Someone's trauma is not more or less important than someone else's trauma everyone has their own story to tell and the journey they must travel to face and overcome their fears to grow.

""So don't forget any of it. Remember it all and overcome it. If you don't overcome it, you'll always be a kid whose soul will never grow.""

I feel this drama feels so much different from my general troupe because it hits home. I can relate to everything said here on various levels. Trying to face my traumas from behind, cover them up with petty lies to feel at peace. Always be running away from them. Trying to fill this emptiness with distractions.

This show really is 10/10 worthy. Keeps you interested every episode. I think the curiosity is there constantly because we want to know the backstory of the characters and why they are the way they are. The journey and growth and how they're healing from their pain and past was very well written.

The visual is no jokes we have 2 very very beautiful actor/actress. The fashion is just eyecandy overload. The OST is also a masterpiece. You know a good drama when you hear the OST it's honestly amazing.

Best of all is the story idea, it's very different from any other. One character being a carer in a mental hospital and another is a book author. We're not seeing the boring same old rich, hot & smart guy and weak poor pretty girl that gets protected by male lead kind of story. Both character are very real and their struggles are relatable. The 2 leads are very equal in helping each other through.

It's a must watch!

One of my best kdrama!!!
This drama is one of the drama that will get to my top 1 fave! It makes me more fall in love with Kim Soo-Hyun! I really love the concept of the story, it was my first time I saw this drama that is more of mental health and people working on a mental hospital...You will never regret this! Both Seo Ye ji and Kim Soo- Hyun are one of my best couple! They are really a perfect chemistry! I don't have nothing any word to say! Each episode made me want to continue on watching... The drama also will help us to improve our mental health since mostly in this generation, people are experience depression and anxiety. They will give ""Words of Wisdom"" to us.
This drama also has a little bit of horror. Kinda look like hotel del luna style hehe but not entirely.
Their acting skills are pretty good! It gives me different emotions!
I love also the OST! Everytime I hear this, my heart ache huuhuh
After watching the entire episode I keep rewatching all my favorite scenes!
The ending is a happy ending! Don't worry about it :)

A magical dark fairy tale with so many heart warming moments
10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean Romantic Drama television Series with 16, 70-85 minute episodes. Alternate title is ‚ÄúPsycho but It‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun) and Moon Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) are two brothers who have lived a difficult and unsettled life trying to outrun the horror of their past. Gang-tae is the younger brother but was told before his mother‚Äôs untimely death that he should take care of his autistic older brother. who has autism. Sang-tae is the older brother but significant autism leads him to being child like, innocent and honest to a fault. As a younger child, Sang-tae witnessed his mother's murder which left him traumatized and, for some reason, terrified of butterflies. Gang-Tae is a care giver in psychiatric wards and has been able to move from hospital to hospital as they move around. at every place they settle in. Ko Moon-young (Seo Yea-ji), writes dark fairy tales which are inspired by horrific events in her past and an overbearing and abusive mother. She is invited to teach at the psychiatric ward because her books have special appeal for those struggling with their own psychological demons. Circumstances lead the three to the town where they all grew up and when their paths overlap Moon-young is drawn to the quiet compassionate and devastatingly handsome Gae-tae. Moon-young is extremely beautiful but unapproachable as some have indicated she has antisocial personality disorder. Those who irritate or seek to harm Moon-young are likely rto experience her wrath and her manager spends significant time and money cleaning up Moon-young‚Äôs many social blunders. What Moon-young wants she usually gets and she begins to relentlessly pursue Gang-tae. The two seem like oil and water but are actually more like ying and yang. Can they solve the mysteries of the past and grow a love pure enough to heal both?

I am really glad it is ok to not be ok because I certainly wasn‚Äôt when this ended. I so loved the main characters that letting it go was like leaving old friends. It was such a wonderful and masterful story that was a little like ‚ÄúThe Adam‚Äôs Family‚Äù, ‚ÄúRainman‚Äù, dark fairy tales, and A Series of Unfortunate Events‚Äù mixed together and birthed something with elements from all yet uniquely its own. The backdrop of the mental hospital was fascinating because there were patients struggling with a wide range of mental health challenges. The honesty, compassion and courage the disorders were presented with spoke strongly to the message that we do not always have to be okay. The two brothers and the way they had their weaknesses yet leaned on each other through a rough and lonely childhood as orphans was very heart warming. Moon-young proved to be a lot less heartless than her exterior portrayed and was the missing key for the duo to become a trio and develop into a true family. The acting was amazing and the music, costume and sets were beautiful. I will watch this again and highly recommend this wonderful series. I would not change a single thing.

Great but with some very questionable moments
Out of all the k-dramas, this is perhaps the one I see online with the most memes and fan videos. It's hyped up a lot, and after watching it, I can see why. But I could also see why a lot of people find it a contentious show. Let's start off with the good stuff first.

I think the show explores autism powerfully and beautifully. And also in a very real and human way. Having to look after an autistic brother from a very young age isn't something anyone can do without fatigue, and the show is really good in showing us how Kim Soo-Hyun's character sometimes suffers from privately wanting more. I think his acting, and particularly Oh Jung-Se's were just great. There's also some really beautiful character moments dealing with loneliness, seeking companionship and love, and how sometimes something as simple as sharing dinner with someone else can feel special. The show is really lovely in that sense, accentuated by a blend of songs that correctly fit the tone of the show and various scenes.

Seo Yea-Ji is undoubtedly the highlight of the show but the things that make her character are also some of the more troubling aspects of the show. I cannot imagine a real-life scenario where her behaviour would be construed as anything other than dangerous sexual harassment. This show normalises stalking behaviour without any consequence (she gets the guy!) to the point where Seo Yea-Ji's character is able to kidnap an autistic man just to make Kim Soo-Hyun's character come and live with her. There's no reprisal for this behaviour. It's brushed aside. He even makes her breakfast the next morning. There's no recognition on her part that this is not a way to behave.

The ending didn't sit well with me. The show repeatedly brought them together and then split them apart without any real tension. We knew how it would end. Whilst the scenes were still enjoyable to watch, it was very predictable.

A beautiful disaster with a happy ending
I love how raw the emotions are portrayed in this drama and although some of these emotions were heavy and ugly, they were still able to effectively translate it into something the viewers can relate and sympathize with. The main cast is amazing here, they have undeniable chemistry and just made the story seem like the viewers are with them in their journey together - especially loved how they incorporated themes of different fairytales.

What I found anticlimatic was the supposed-to-be final revelation for the resolution to happen, it just didn't sit well with me and felt a bit sloppy and far-fetched, though it still was a surprise.

Nonetheless, the main plot of this drama which is highly grounded on the mental headspace of an individual was effectively portrayed and conveyed. This might fall a little heavy on those dealing with issues but the title says it all: ""It's Okay to Not be Okay"".

This is also quite a pure story of different kinds of love from different types of broken people, and I think that, by itself, is worth the watch.

Hands Down Best Drama of 2020
I haven‚Äôt been this excited for a drama in so long. I mean, Seo Yeji AND Kim Soohyun in one drama?? My eyes were glued to the screen. I LOVE Munyeong. In the beginning, she was definitely selfish, but I just love how dominate she was. And her outfits??? THE SERVE!! I also liked how Gangtae rejected Juri early on. They didn‚Äôt waste anytime on silly love triangle stuff!! The side characters were all so great in their own ways. Juri‚Äôs mom <333 No words just admiration and love for her.

I loved how they incorporated fairy tale elements & life lessons throughout the drama. Munyeong‚Äôs last book made me cry so much since she added stories of the patients in the book. Speaking of crying, I was literally sobbing every during episode. When Sangtae said he was saving money so that he could buy Gangtae a camping car,, The story behind the Mangtae doll,, Or when the director bought the patient a new pair of shoes so he could walk out his ""door"".. I lost it. Tears, tears & even more tears!

This drama was great but definitely not perfect. I‚Äôm still confused about Munyeong's mom being alive because I thought her dad got rid of her body in the ocean?? but maybe his memory was wrong. I also wish Munyeong got help for her childhood trauma. Instead, they kind of made it seem like love fixed/healed everything??

Overall, I love this drama so much. I appreciate how they brought attention to mental health issues. The plot was something different and exciting. Also, the character development?? We love to see it!! I‚Äôm so so glad that everyone got their happy ending, even the patients. They really deserved it :,) I got really attached to this drama and will definitely miss seeing Seo Yeji on my screen.

A Masterpiece(some quotes from show included as spoilers)
‚ùû???? ??? ?????? ????? ??? ?????? ???? ???? ??? ??? ????? ???? ????? ??? ????? ??????? ?? ???? ?????????‚ùû
tl;dr:- Absolute masterpiece, I will not be able to forget this in my life.


The last time I spent these many words on a series review was 4-5 years ago when I was still doing my masters in IIT Bombay, or maybe in my first year of Ph.D. I always put it to lack of time, but now I realize you make time to pen your thoughts down if something really moves you. It is your own way of trying to hold on to the moments in the show, and your own way of letting go and moving on.

Let me begin by stating I put this show in the pantheons of animated shows like Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Steins; gate in the emotional roller coaster and healing it provided me. But unlike those two shows I cannot guarantee the same feelings would be felt by most people. Literally all the people around me and my wife who have already watched this show had either dropped it midway or felt it was ""okay"". But it is precisely due to this reason anecdotal evidence is not considered a good evidence in a debate, because statistically in forums like IMDb and this one the show is an extremely popular and highly rated one. It also has received a lot of awards in Korea. So all I can do in this review is prepare you for what to expect and leave the rest to the reader.

??? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ???? ????? ?? ?? ??? ???????? ?????? ???? ????. ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ???? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??‚ùú? ???????. ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ? ????? ???? ????? ?????????, ??? ????? ???? ?? ???? ?? ?????? ??.

This line from a youtube comment on one of the show's songs, sums up what I believe about the show.

The story is of how three people, two brothers, one autistic and one who has cared for him since childhood and a girl whose troubled childhood makes her not know what warmth of a family is. She has anti-social personality disorder and writes twisted fairy tales, which are best sellers, but they are actually calls for help and her way of communicating with the world to tell it not to do the things to the kids which were done with her. They have an ill-fated connection from the past and the story is about how they find their own ways to heal and free themselves from their shackles.

This drama has run into some criticisms from various politically correct sections of the society, because the actions of the girl, who in the initial episodes, are questionable. But the thing is in real life you are never politically correct all of the time, you have done questionable things that you regret after you grow and realize what you have done is wrong. This story is about that. A story where everybody does the right thing all the time is a story not of humans but robots, and frankly extremely boring. The story revolved entirely around how the characters come to these realizations about their flaws and become the best versions of themselves. Such character driven story lines are in general slow-burn, and if this was like that, it would have still been a very good series and not a masterpiece.

A good series gives you a few moments to remember across it's entire run, a great series might give you one every episode. Mind you a moment need not be a climax, it can be as mundane as seeing the montage of a camping trip , but it is something that you want to watch over and over again. A masterpiece will have many many such moments, such that you want to watch it over and over again while you wish to forget it completely so that you can start watching it in an empty mind. This one in it's later episodes(from episode 10 almost) has so many such moments that we sometimes marveled at how on earth one can write in such a manner.

Which brings me to the background score and cinematography. The score has 14-15 songs , and each of which packs a power in it's own right, I remember almost all of the songs because of the ""moments"" they were fit to, some of them even went on to win awards in Korea and deservedly so, Among all the K Dramas I have watched not a single one comes even close to this in it's OSTs. And starting from the close up shots of the faces to the wide angle eagle eye shots the cinematography is beautiful. The transitions, the surrealism to fairy tale world and I can just go on, I thought Run On was beautifully shot, but this just takes one step further, it is a movie quality production.

And now the acting, Park Min Young was my favourite Korean actress till date, but Seo Ye Ji is another level altogether, as such Korean actors have an insanely high level of acting chops but she takes it to a different level. And the scariest part is she is not even the best actor in the show!!. Oh Jung Se who played the autistic brother was out of this world, in fact having seen him in another drama before I could scarcely believe it was him. The male lead Kim Soo Hyun was good too but these two were unreal, and that's why they heavily featured in the awards in Korea as well.

The supporting cast was equally great and the writers gave everyone time to shine and complete their story. It was a comprehensive ending hinting at new beginnings for everybody. Each character served a purpose and not just comic relief, I have seen people talk about how the story is weak etc, but such intertwined character driven stories are incredibly difficult to handle and here the writers handled it will elegance.

This brings me to the treatment of autism and mental health aspect . It may not be perfect , but in my limited experience of seeing 2 patients closely , one in the autism spectrum and the other having depression I can vouch the portrayal was so real it gave me goosebumps. The innocent simplicity of the autistic brother was endearing and without giving away much I can say he was the MVP of the show. Quotes like the last one from him hit way too close to home, reminding me of how we complicate things when we become adults and forget how simply we can lead our life.

‚ùû?‚Äô?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ????, ?? ? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ????.‚ùû
Now to talk about a premise which I have found rarely in the shows I have watched about mental health, everybody deals with what happens with the person who has mental health, but no one ever thinks about the trials the caregiver has to go through to support the ill person. The person feels trapped and unless someone is there for them as well, possibly can become a victim of mental health. Having seen the caregiver's lives in first person as well, the way the show tackles this struck a chord with me and probably was my favourite aspect. It treated it with such gentleness and care that I cannot imagine it being treated better in any form of media.

‚ùû??? ????? ???? ?? ?????? ??? ???????. ??? ???? ??? ???? ??? ????? ????, ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ???? ???? ??.‚ùû
And finally, its about the healing. Healing starts with taking the first step. While what the show shows may not be perfect but it's okay to get lost in the 18 hours of utopia where there was hope beyond the despair. When this show was ending my wife and I were saying how we should have watched this when we were physically together to wrap ourselves together in the warm blanket that is this show. After the end we could not wipe the smile off our phases while feeling sad about it having ended.

Well, now this love letter to the show is getting over too, maybe it is time to move on and find other such gems in K Drama world. Even half as good would do.

Since the first episode, I've been pulled over and didn't really want to end the episode. I like the fact that they not only showed Sang Tae (the autistic older brother) as an extra character, I especially liked the growth they showed in his character which kind of helped Kim Soo-Hyun's personality grow as well. The relationship between the three of them literally gave me all the emotions, from happiness, adoration (especially when Moon Young and Sang Tae uses to argue kindly), sadness, etc. Big brother's personality growth and realization and trying to act like Big Brother have crazy happy I cry many times. I don't even need to really talk about the amazing chemistry between Kim Soo-Hyun and Seo Ye-ji, but I will because it was so perfect. They both were cute together and every scene they were in showed off their amazing acting skills. Although every drama has a cute scene between the main couple, the small cute scenes between this couple were very different and special because of the characters they portrayed.
They fit in well with their roles, Kim Soo-Hyun has been a gentle yet powerful carer who literally perfected from his demeanor to the way he delivered the dialogues. Same goes for Seo Ye-J's Ko Moon Young, she was so elegant but brave that I loved it. Also, her clothes and styling on this show deserve an award, there wasn't a single outfit she didn't wear. There are a lot of shows that have female leads dressed in amazing clothes but the thing that made me love her character and this show in general, even more than that, is how they explained why they dressed so much and justified it as a coping mechanism, that was really something special. I loved all the stories they did on that show and they were so different from anything I've heard, I swear if it actually came out I'd go buy it now. Right from the start, the relationship between the two brothers has been really commendable, and the actor who plays Sang-Tae really deserves an award for his acting on this show. All in all, it was a great and unique show that everyone should watch. You might think it's a pretty heavy show but it's actually a perfect balance and I guarantee it will make your heart happy and warm in the end and you'll cry happy tears for sure, many times if you're like me haha.

Beautiful from beginning to end
One of the most beautiful dramas that I've ever watched, both literally and figuratively.

The characters are all so lovable and realistic ‚Äî and your heart hurts for every single one of them, even the side characters that get featured for a few episodes. The thing about their character development is that it's just all so NATURAL, and it comes from the small, everyday interactions that we see between them. And to add to that, the drama did an amazing job giving everyone growth and yet maintaining their personalities throughout it.

The plot was amazing and not a single episode was unnecessary. For a drama that handles such heavy topics, IOTNBO made me shed ugly tears or laugh out loud in all the right places. It's also super refreshing to just have a plot that flows naturally, uninterrupted by dumb drama tropes like noble idiocy and miscommunications.

There's a main plot point in the backstory about MY's mother that have left some people questioning and saying that the writers left out a decent explanation ‚Äî while I understand that, it's really not a problem with me for this one big reason: it's really not the point. What matters is that the characters WERE scarred and used by people in their past, and regardless of what exact form their past comes to haunt them, they're finding ways to heal together.

With that being said, I still enjoyed the first half of the drama better ‚Äî before the mom sub-plot, because it felt much more emotional when their pasts felt like a dark cloud hanging over all of them. The latter half didn't quite have the same gut punch.

Still, the entire vibe of the drama is just beautiful, especially the transitions in the earlier episodes. Throughout all sixteen episodes though, the aesthetic remained consistent and everything, from the OST to Seo Yi-Ji's wardrobe (!!!) was top-notch.

This drama and its actors deserve all the Baeksang awards ‚Äî ESPECIALLY Oh Jung-Se.

Healing drama that's done right
Ahh this is my first review, but I felt like I had to write one to tell others about how incredible of a drama It's Okay To Not Be Okay is ;)
---STORY---
The plot itself is a breakthrough for kdramas and Korea. I feel like Korea being the country that it is has this huge stigma against mental health. It's at the point where treatment for mental health is frowned upon and discouraged. IOTNBO tackles this issue as its priority. Ko Moon Young and Moon Gang Tae both suffer from trauma that they experienced as kids. As they brace onto each other, they grow together, healing each other out of their wounds. I won't say more about the plot except for the fact that it's touching and relatable.

I also want to touch on the picture books. I thought that it was very interesting how they incorporated these picture books into the lives of the characters. I don't think that I've seen another kdrama with an element like this. I also really enjoyed to art within the picture books. They were so beautiful that they actually got published :)

---ACTING/CAST---
This was Kim Soo Hyun's first project after being discharged from the military. All I'm gonna say is that he both picked a great project and delivered it with perfection. The way he acts, you can feel every emotion. I've seen Seo Yeji in Lawless Lawyer and I thought that she did a great job with that badass character. In IOTNBO, she once again portrays a character that is far from your typical cute, helpless female lead. The charisma she exudes-- she was literally made to play KMY. Lastly, we have Oh Jung Se for his portrayal of Moon Sang Tae. His acting was very realistic and touching to watch. Prior to IOTNBO, I had not heard of Oh Jung Se. Luckily, I now know of his abilities as an actor and I will definitely be checking out his other projects! The supporting actors also did great with their roles.

---MUSIC---
The music fit so well with the vibe of the drama. Not only does it fit with the drama, the songs themselves are high quality songs that are easily playlist worthy. I also wanted to add that I got so excited when Wake Up played as it was a sign that KMY was about to pull something crazy XD

---REWATCH---
This is definitely a drama that I would rewatch when I'm bored or in need for something healing.

---FINAL THOUGHTS---
This drama had a lot of hype surrounding it. I won't lie, I was a bit hesitant to starting it as we all know that there have been several dramas that are very overhyped. However, with that said, I was blown away by IOTNBO. The way the drama handles the heavy topics so well really amazed me. This is hands-down one of the best kdramas that I've watched.

If you're debating whether or not you're going to pick this up, just start it! I'm well aware that IOTNBO is not everyone's taste, but if you're in need for any drama to watch-- especially a healing drama-- try IOTNBO. You most likely won't regret it!

Amazing story, and amazing actors
This is the first k-drama I've ever seen, but it took me a while to get into it. I admit that it took until episode 6 to actually be interested but once I did, I was completely hooked. First of all, I'd like to highlight the acting. I've rarely seen such good acting, and everyone in the cast conveyed emotions perfectly, making me attached to every character and feel for every single one of them. I love that they incorporated fairy tales to tell the drama's story, it was brilliant, original and interesting. Gang-tae and Sang-tae's melted my heart and the actors played the brothers perfectly. I would definitely re-watch, I recommend it to everyone!

Interesting and On-the-Edge Drama
I was initially attracted to watch this drama by the title ""It's Okay to Not be Okay."" From the title, I expected this drama to be something I would get in my heart, and I wasn't disappointed in this aspect, where it has been a emotional rollercoaster, and there were a lot of areas and scenes where I connected and sobbed my heart out to. Nevertheless, there was this area that was missing, and I spent a lot of time thinking of what exactly was not fulfilling after watching this drama. At this time, I am still not completely sure what I was looking for that is missing, but here are some of my thoughts about the drama.

~ THE STORY AND NARRATIVE ~

The story is tagged as a psychological, comedy, romance, drama, and family. Nevertheless, it ranges slightly into 'horror' and 'detective' theme. Overall, the plot is pretty on-the-edge but predictable at the same time. Ever since the two characters travelled all to Ok psychiatric ward, it was easy to predict the story line and ending. Additionally, the story isn't very romantic in any way; in fact, it deeply involves the mental health theme and recovery. I have seen a lot of people mentioning that this drama was very 'healing,' and I agree, but before watching this, it would be nice to know that there were a lot of dark scenes and heart wrenching themes, not exactly the 'healing' we have in mind. Back to the romance part, the relationships seemed to revolve more around dependence rather than love 'love,' which some people may agree and disagree to.

~ THE CHARACTERS ~

I will be honest; although I am in fact a person that is very involved in the mental health field, I found it very hard to connect with the characters most of the time. There are times where I did not get how exactly they felt, especially with Ko Moon Young's antisocial personality disorder. I actually took some time researching more about this particular personality disorder to try to understand the situation a bit better, but at this point, I'm still questioning how an antisocial personality disorder person is capable of truly 'loving' someone. I suppose the word 'love' is very subjective, and speaking of which, I am not very convinced of the romantic love between the two main characters because I felt that they simply bonding during this traumatic time, but then again, who am I to say? Back to the point, because I had a hard time connecting to the characters, it was slightly difficult to continue the drama.

As for the acting, although I have seen reviews praising about the chemistry between the two main leads, I felt that the chemistry and romance were all a bit forced. Sure, the conversation flowed (based upon the script) and they did have some sort of connection, but both of them just seemed so independent in a way. Either way, I'm not quite sure if it was exactly the acting or if it was the personality of the characters. I have to really say that the actors themselves portrayed the characters super well!

~ THEMES ~

MENTAL HEALTH: Other than the hard-to-understand-themes, there were a lot of common themes with loneliness and happiness that really hit deep for me. This is a drama that covers a lot of common thoughts we have, which drew a lot of emotions and heart breaking moments, where some are happy ones and some are sad ones. The drama really covered a lot about denial, avoidance, and seeking support in terms of each character's development; it was amazing to see how each character progressed, too.

FAIRY-TALES: With the female lead being a fairytale writing, it shouldn't come as a surprise that there are stories and stories and stories with hidden meanings behind each one. The drama itself has 16 episodes, slightly separated into 16 fairy-tale stories that goes along with it. I personally always loved reading twisted fairytales and fairytales that have hidden meanings, and in this drama, they take it to a new level, where the female lead completely take the moral of every fairytale into a darker and 'realistic' perspective.

~ MUSIC AND AESTHETICS ~

The music was honestly amazing! I personally believe the music makes everything a lot better, especially the songs were a bit creepy and deep at the same time. I would take it so far as to say the music was really the best part of the drama.
Here's a playlist some may want to check out: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ITeTDTz5lIkZ4VkrCS3LG?si=3uH2SxVmT1GKEdMNE3UvOw

The next part is the amazing aesthetics. The costumes were awesome, which is pretty much expected in every k-drama these days. Either way, the power of each costume, and the meaning behind each of them were just wow. I still remember a scene that stuck with me, where the director of the psychiatric ward mentioned that (not directly quoted) ""she wears fancy clothes not to show off, but to protect herself, like armor.""

~ REWATCH VALUE ~

As I slightly covered before, psychological dramas that range into the 'detective' or 'horror' areas aren't really my thing, so I will not be particularly rewatching this drama any time soon; I love horror movies not dramas because it gets kind of old in a way. In any case, the main reason I may rewatch it is only for certain scenes. On that note, I loved all those small stories and the whole plot of the drama, except the overall plot of Moon Gang Tae's mother's murder case.

~ OVERALL ~

I absolutely loved and agree with Ko Moon Young's perspective on the fairytales and facing reality, and it was amazing to see how she was able to face everything that came her way. The moral of going out of avoidance to facing reality was also very relatable. Most important, it really was those short themes, where some of the characters acted with disregard of the public opinion in order to help certain people really stuck out. It is the feeling of relief to get everything out and getting past traumatic experiences.

The relationship between the main characters are quite different from regular k-drama couples. The upside about this particular relationship was that there were little to no misunderstandings. Nevertheless, I personally thought the relationship wasn't built upon love, but more about dependence and understanding, where these two characters were able to support each other; which made me think about whether it was love or not, and whether having antisocial personality disorder made it possible to love, but who knows? At the end of the drama, I felt that their relationship seemed more about convenience, but I suppose it depends on everyone's perspective on it. On a separate note, the side character relationship also seemed a bit forced and for convenient sake.

Throughout the drama, the main issue I encountered (which is slightly covered in the ""Character"" section) is that the character's intentions are hard to relate too even if they made sense/were understandable. I am more of a person who likes morally grey characters with relatable 'antagonists,' but this drama is more of a oh-so-he/she/they-did-that unattached-kind of feeling, which made it very hard to continue the drama. I did end up finishing it, but it was more of because I wanted to have a closure.

Another issue I had trouble with was the repetitiveness. Don't get me wrong. I love the fairytales and the horror scenes, but it gets kind of boring, and the plot also gets kind of long, where certain scenes could be simply cut out to make it more interesting. Nevertheless, the drama was an interesting watch!

Hard hitting drama to the society who sees mental health patients as PSYCHO
‚óèThis show is an apology to the mental health patients that they are mad or something and other harsh wrds used for them. Its like the show name ITS OK TO NOT BE OK, its fine if you have a mental health issue, you are just seeing the society differently. But we as society see them as not fit for society is totally wrong, and we need a change of perspective.
‚óèStory- I was a bit shocked to the initial episodes featuring ghosts as I don‚Äôt watch horror genre and was absolutely nor ready for it so I took my time and watched it patiently and I was slowly damped with amazing story and powerful performance. Its not a typical romcom but a dark mystery full of thriller.I love the mental health issue portrayal by various characters due to certain trauma or pain. Their healing was somewhat good. Yes I hate that DEER too.
‚óèActing- for me it was all about seo ye ji as ko-moon-young. Her sassy look,badass character and straight forwardness were beyond excellent. Her each actions were speaking volumes.
Kim soo hyun as moon-gang-tae was perfect. His sadness, love, caring for his brother, he just nailed it.
Oh jeong se as moon-sang-tae as an autistic oler brother dealing with his trauma was above par my words. He was excellent.
‚óèMusic- each ost lyrics and music is excellent. They blend with the scene perfectly.
‚óèRewatch- I would defintly watch this masterpiece again. I love medical genre drama.

‚óèAppreciation- I love the tiny tales in each episodes. The animation to them was visually soothing to eyes.
I love the costumes of ko-moon-young, an applause to her hair and makeup artist.

One of the BEST if not the GREATEST
This is my first time writing a review so bear with me :)

First of all I would like to thank everyone for bringing this drama to us. From the producer, writer, actors and everybody involved.. We are grateful.

Story - If you want fast paced and plot driven drama this is definitely not for you. Guys this is a healing drama, not a mystery or thriller drama so for those saying theres too many plotholes and stuff I get that you want everything to be solved but for me I liked that it was left a mystery for us to think about what really transpired and focus on the main point which HEALING and GROWTH.

Acting - I haven‚Äôt watched a lot of kdrama but one thing is for sure.. The acting in this one will make you feel every emotions that each actor is trying to portray. Even haters are praising the acting in this one so that says a lot. The chemistry of the main leads is really off the charts.. I honestly don‚Äôt want SYJ and KSH to be paired with a different actor/actress lol, I just want them to really get together irl. To OJS.. damn this is my first time watching him and I can say that his portrayal of Moon Sang is on point! If you liked Joo Won in Good Doctor, you‚Äôll appreciate and love Moon Sang Tae for sure.

Music - Music was great and will always make you feel more emotional during the scenes whether it be happy or sad. It‚Äôs not like those background music that will just keep repeating and try to make up for the bad acting or unrelated scenes.

Rewatch Value - I put 10/10 coz this drama is that beautiful and I don‚Äôt know how many times will I rewatch this one coz I don‚Äôt rewatch dramas but this is also the first drama that I watched while it‚Äôs airing so I‚Äôll watch it again to see the small details and enjoy more of the scenes of this wonderful drama.

Overall - This drama is really one of the best and I‚Äôm not being biased just because I liked it. Majority of the people here liked it coz they appreciate the drama for being true to its point and for me I was satisfied with everything.. actually I‚Äôm more than satisfied coz how can you not be?! This is probably the only drama that ended and tied everything, coz usually it‚Äôs rushed or they just make it confusing. If you‚Äôre thinking of watching this one I suggest go for it.. this is the only good that came out of 2020.


Thank you everyone from MDL and IOTNBO Fam and Comment Section. Let‚Äôs all hope they reunite with another project! See you guys! I hope everyone even the haters stays safe and healthy during these hard times and I also hope that this drama can heal you from the anxiety and stress that we are experiencing right now. Spead love and appreciate! Peace!

WELL WRITTEN AND ACTED
story- I would've made it a 10/10 however I recently read another review that pointed out a loophole w/ regards to the mother of the lead character and although I forgot about it, the review is actually right. Other than that, I can say this drama is well written. The writing is grounded in reality that it prevents the story from becoming over the top. Which is great for a kdrama that talks about different mental health issues, since certain creative choices might tarnish the pereception of the audience towards the actual topic and the people who experiences it in real life. The writing also made the characters fleshed out, not like any typical dimensional character that's prominetnt in a lot ofther kdramas. Lastly what I love about the writing is that it was able to make a long enough resolution that felt real after all the hardship that the characters experienced. Unlike other kdramas that had a conflict / conflict again at the last episode and try to resolve it at the same episode as well *coughs: My ID is Gangnam Beauty, Fight For My Way, The Tale of Nokdu, etc.*

acting/cast- Everybody acted really well especially the three leads. Although personally I think the two leads (the romantic couple) could've had more chemistry on screen.


Music- It's good. I'm not korean so i don't really understand the lyrics but I can It's bad that I remember it for being awful. The music did it's job properly.

Rewatch Value- The whole series is rewatchable since the story is well written. Personally though I will not rewatch as a whole becuase it's too serious.

Drama of the year
Saying goodbye to It's Okay To Not Be Okay was the hardest I've ever felt. It has everything I want in a drama. Love line is so subtle, no unnecessary kisses or bed scene. Character development is on point! The casts is good at portraying their character. I might say Moon Sangtae is my favourite. I have an autistic brother so i know how autistic people behave and Oh Jungse nailed it. I teared up mostly at his scene. Thank you Moon Sangtae for proving to us that having an autistic family wasn't a thorn all along but every silver lining has a cloud. I couldn't possibly thank the writer for being brave enough to write this kind of plot amidst many cliche drama nowadays. I truly believe she has open many eyes for what mental illness is and what autistic is. They are also human so they have feelings. It may not be everyone cup of tea but it definitely mine. I'm going to miss them so much üò¢üò¢

Wow, just wow
I feel like I have to write a review on this piece of art. This series allowed me to once again fall in love with k-dramas.

STORY -
I loved this unique concept where they didn‚Äôt shy away from topics such as mental health and diagnoses and since these topics are, still, somewhat taboo in Korea - it was even more unique. I watched one episode and I was hooked, this is one of the few k-dramas where I didn‚Äôt feel the need to skip even a second. There wasn‚Äôt one scene where I felt as though it was boring or I felt the need to skip.

ACTING/CAST -
I cannot praise this casting enough!
Seo Yeaji and Kim Soohyun were the perfect leads for this k-drama, their chemistry was out of this world and I found myself giggling and peeking through my fingers every time some minor thing happened, even their eye contact made me all bubbly. I have yet to find another k-drama that has this sort of impact on me. And man oh man do I love the clothing choices for Seo Yeaji‚Äôs character, the whole image just fit her perfectly.
I have to take another moment to really praise Oh Jungse for his outstanding performance. As someone who has been diagnosed with Aspergers (a form of autism) and who has a brother with bigger problems related to autism, I felt as though I could relate to some of the things that were being represented in the series as someone who both has a ‚Äúlight version‚Äù of it but also as someone who has a brother who is very similar to the character in the series. For the first time I didn‚Äôt feel offended by how a movies/series portrayed the diagnosis. Although autism is very individualistic, I could identify some of the similarities and just uuuugh great acting really!

REWATCH VALUE -
I would really watch this over and over again, and although I‚Äôve rewatched some scenes - I still feel that same magic as the first time I watched it.
Honestly I don‚Äôt even need to wish that I could unsee it only to watch it for the first time again, I can just watch it again and it feels the same as the first time.

I would really recommend.

What you need to know before starting this 16 hour journey.
This was one of the top notch drama I've seen this year and I've seen a lot through my life times which is not that many. First off I really like the plot development that happened in each episodes. At first I was kinda hesitant to start because of the drama title also because the writer was someone who I have not heard of, but I would suggest don't let that stop you from starting this amazing done drama.

The drama not only talked about mental illness, and different disorders, but it talks about the relationship about different personality individual that have things that they are dealing with, and are more similar than they may think.

What i really liked about this drama is everything ties with each other and how the representation was done. There wasn't anything that I disliked about that show, but other than that it ended too quickly. The main lead had a lot of chemistry with each other and I like how they heal each other and different ways. There was only one antagonist that tried to make it hard for the main characters lives, but you have to watch to find out more.

The OST was really good and I would highly suggest giving this a try whether or not your a fan of Kim Soo Hyun, Oh JUNG SE or Seo Yi JI. I appreciated the message that they were trying to give out to the viewers. However, I wouldn't rewatch it not because I didn't enjoy the drama, but I think one is enough to remain in my memory for a long time.

Must watch
I‚Äôm so upset this drama has ended I want to follow the three of them around forever! For the first 2 episodes I was majorly confused and not sure if I would like it and continue watching it because it seemed too dark but I cannot be more overjoyed that I stuck with it. Not only does it have great storyline and screenplay- there‚Äôs not a single character or scene that is unnecessary but the characters are so deep and intricate performed by the most phenomenal actors that there‚Äôs is no option but to feel each of their pain and anguish. Also just cannot fan girl over gang rae and MY more I love the two of them so much I want to watch them everywhere! Such perfect actors for such perfect roles! This is litterally one of the best kdramas I‚Äôve watched!

A healing journey that you didn't know you needed even with the ""plot holes""
This may be a long review, but I wanted to point out a few things how I felt about this drama compared to what some others have written.

I love this show, in a way, I'm like GT, but I'm slowly working on healing. Exactly how this show does with the characters, they heal over time. Some people think that the beginning of the show was the best and then it slowly deteriorates from after the first 5 episodes. This show starts as a dark/gothic/mystery. But the only reason that is, is to set the stage for when the healing begins. Healing is a slow process it takes time. Like the way this show does with the characters.
The comments that I've read that kinda peeves me a little. Is that some think that it's the 'my mom killed your mom' clich√©. It's not a clich√© for how they did this. They did it with style and a way that makes sense and moves along with the story.

Now the biggest problem ALOT of people seem to have is the mother arc. Why is her mom still alive and why is it the Head Nurse. The Head Nurse was least likely person (at least to me). It also didn't need to be a random person we've never met. That would be harder explanation to buy. But the mother needed to be alive for our main characters to heal. There wouldn't have been any closure if she wasn't alive. Also with the mother arc comes with, how did she survive. And this part I may get some backlash for but: I'm okay with how they didn't explain how she survived. Not gonna lie, at first I was a little disappointed that we didn't find out how she survived, but then I got to thinking about it afterwards. The first couple of episodes, MY said she registered her moms death years ago. Maybe part of her knew there was a possiblity of her mother still being alive. Also MY mentioned that her mother dissappeared in the basement (we assumed her father collected the body, maybe thats not the case).
Also, what really made me okay with not knowing how the mother died is this: this show has tied up most if not all the loose ends. It came around in full circle, even bringing back patients that have now healed. You think the creators didn't think about this ""plot hole""? I think they made it intentional because to really make our main characters heal is to have the mother alive. To confront the past of how GT and ST mother died. And also have MY face her biggest fear, her mother. Also, it doesn't matter how she survived. It doesn't go along with the story. Also, MY didn't care how she survived only now that she was back in her life. She could have easily asked what happened when she visited her mom in jail. But she didn't ask, because she didn't care. It's the same as how it was with her dad. To her both of her parents died years ago. All she wants to do is forget. And thats what she even told her mother, that she wants to forget her.
So to be honest I'm okay with not knowing how the mother survived, because it doesn't matter how, it's that she did.

The reason why I love this show is because it takes you on a journey. A journey you don't expect, but a journey you would miss if you didn't take it.

Best drama of 2020
KSH, SYJ and OJS really deserve to be praise for their phenomenal performance on this drama. This isn‚Äôt a drama that everyone will watch since its topic is more on mental health issues, but i would say that while watching it, i learned a lot from it. It‚Äôs not just about the romance of the 2 leads that brought me here but the fact that every episode, you will learned all the different mental health issues and how to deal with them and help them. This is indeed a Human Healing drama. I hope hat this drama will bag a lot of awards in upcoming awards shows. And i hope that people will start to appreciate SYJ‚Äôs acting skills. Of course KSH and OJS is already indeed great actors but i hope korean people will start to acknowledge SYJ too.

Overrated mess
Cliche, tropey, messy. Thanks for all the puffy reviews for making me waste my time watching this less than mediocre story. Y'all really need to get TASTE before giving 10* reviews just because you stan the male lead actor or think the leads are attractive.
Autism story is nothing to write home about, there are tons of other series that tackle this subject better. Netflix Atypical for example does it 100000000000000x better.
Female lead is toxic af, even sexually harass the ML and the super woke viewers think this okay because of what exactly? If y'all had any coherence you wouldn't ship this couple.
Lots of mental illness used for comic relief or depicted in a stereotypical matter like the lady who sobs everytime because she gets triggered over the most inane things. Depression aint cute, funny and is definetly not like that IRL.
The manic episode used for comic relief yiiiikes
Faux woke series for faux woke people tbh

Finally another drama that is not your typical Cinderella drama. Real life issues dealing with mental health.

People dont know much on this topic, tend to underestimate the amount of work that goes into looking after mental health patients.

Lots of empathy,love and understanding. The lead actor one of my favourites, he plays this role so well with all the emotions that comes with it.. brilliant!!!

The lead actress the same... infact all the actors plays their roles so well. I hope this will be considered for AWARDS.....

Very entertaining but not too much else
Quite a unique drama with some interesting themes. Seo Yeji is a stand out for me, her acting is brilliant and she plays her moody and dark character perfectly. Also very found of the support cast, all the character have their own interesting quirks and relationships, very likeable and funny as well.

What i don't like:
I'm 10 episodes in and the main story has started to unravel itself, but even still it's not that exciting. Kim Soo Hyun's character has to choose between love and his family, and is leaning towards the latter because he feels guilty. Not anything out of ordinary for kdramas.Why he feels guilty is what kind of annoys me, like dude, you were a dumb kid,

I'm also not a fan of the main relationship, i feel that there is a lack of chemistry between the leads. Seo Yeji's character kind of just forces herself onto him, and he basically does the bare minimum to reciprocate feelings. Pretty disappointed in the ""met at childhood"" trope that was used, kind of a cheap way to build the relationship from a character perspective.

Overall the relationship is odd, we've seen the male leads be the 'carer' of the female lead in a bunch of other kdramas before, but this one is taking it literally which is funny.

Regardless, i'm going to finish it because it is still fun to watch. But beyond that, there isn't a deeper level to this at the moment from i've seen. Maybe ill change my mind by the end.

Confused.
huh!? keep in mind ive dropped this drama after 8 episodes and may be lacking some major twists that magically make up for this drama's faults, so let me know if thats the case.

im VERY confused by the fact that this drama appears to be romance driven and that many of its glowing 10/10 reviews are commenting on how ""amazing"" the romance aspect is. what aspect of it is beautiful to you guys? the FL using and manipulating the ML's autistic brother into living with her so the ML is then forced into joining them? the whole ""i want him and i always get what i want"" attitude that drives all of her horrible, shitty decisions and behaviour towards everyone that comes in her way? her blatant disregard for others and their feelings, despite how she expects others to accommodate hers? the way she stalks the ML at the beginning and harasses him until he gives in and cracks a smile? the second i saw him having a lovely little flashback to the time she tried to stab him, then skipping joyfully towards her and asking her to go on a trip together (only to then have her almost drive into a wall and kick him out the car because he mentioned having to look after his autistic brother) i knew i couldnt wait to see if there was some kind of reason for these behaviours.

mental health may be an explanation (although ive read from other reviews that the drama doesnt really end up addressing any diagnosis) but it certainly isnt an excuse for romanticising the relationship between the leads. whether she magically changes into a good person or not further down the road, id probably assume it was only because she'd finally gotten what she wanted and not because she'd faced any major consequences and had to reevaluate how she approaches similar situations in life... or god forbid, gotten some professional help. as someone who suffers from MH issues, seeing the FL distance herself from the ML and attempt to work on herself and her issues before them coming back together or even her learning how to live by herself, would have been wonderful and i would've enjoyed a story like that much more.

points up for the acting, visuals and the smooth transitions and editing. especially throughout the first few episodes. i also enjoyed the supporting characters, and would've loved to see their endings if not for the fact that the main story ruined it for me. the soundtrack was also great. i want to point out that im not criticising any of the actors here, as i think they all did a pretty wonderful job, but only the plot and decisions of their characters.

This drama is difficult to review. Even though the story is very simple and unremarkable, it was strangely addictive. I found myself breezing through each episode and eager to watch the next.

It's certainly a drama for those who appreciate the journey and not only the outcome. What makes this drama work is the undeniable chemistry between not just the two romantic leads, but also the supporting cast. The level of acting is excellent. Every actor seemed to play their characters with ease, and the dialogue and interactions felt natural. I found Oh Jung Se's portrayal of Sang Tae particularly outstanding. He played an autistic character with so much respect and love, and was really endearing to watch. He captured the mannerisms so well, without it looking forced or mocking. The sentimental moments between him and Gang Tae (Kim Soo Hyun) moved me to tears, and it felt like they were truly brothers haunted by a troubled past. I congratulate Kim Soo Hyun's performance here as well. I also enjoyed the way Seo Ye Ji's played her character. She was regal and powerful, and carried her costumes with class!

What fell short was of course the story line. It was very one-dimensional and not fleshed out well. It took a backseat in the drama, and honestly made little difference to its overall appeal. I'm also growing tired of the overdone Kdrama trope where the main leads bond over a shared childhood trauma, or an intertwined destiny. I was hoping this drama would take a new approach to romance, but unfortunately it did not.

Overall, I still thought the drama was enjoyable to watch. It was visually enchanting, with a dark storybook feel to it that was unique and intriguing. I'm a huge fan of Kim Soo Hyun and hope to see more from him in the near future!

Mesmerizing
I started to watch this kdrama after it airs the 4th episode. I was so taken aback with the visuals; both the casts and the cinematography. I love how every episodes have their own sub-titles from fairy tales. It gives us a big picture of what the episode is going to be about. Also how they raise the awareness of mental health in a simple way and focusing on the patients and not only the main leads. The soundtracks are also to die for! Even the instrumental ones are so beautiful. So sad to think that this weekend this drama will be over. Definitely will have a post-drama syndrome and gonna rewatch this dozens times!

It's kind of okay
This review is not going to be funny, sorry. Just sharing my thoughts.
What I really love about this drama is the cast (real eye candy), the leads (both male and female), acting, and directing. Overall, it is a very solid story and it's interesting to watch for the most part.

There are some things that I found a bit annoying.

1. The whole story is basically a wild mix between ""The Taming of The Shrew"", ""Rapunzel"", and ""My Sassy Girl"". A bad girl escapes her golden castle and becomes a good girlfriend in the end. The only problem is that she is not just a bad girl, they portray her as a psychotic individual who is physically harming others and should be in jail but somehow is made look like a pretty-victim-turned-villain. It's fun to watch, but imagine this person in real life. And she doesn't get any better in the end, her mental health problems are just being managed by her boyfriend.

2. The ML's autistic brother's character is a carbon copy of Rain Man. I understand that nobody is going to file for plagiarism but it's just way too obvious. The actor is trying to portray an autistic man, yet all autistic people behave differently so the portrayal seems more like a carbon copy from a famous movie. Although the actor is definitely doing a superb job, he is totally into the character.

3. The animation part was heavily influenced by ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" I wrote ""heavily influenced"" because it looks too similar. I don't watch American movies anymore, but if I did, I would find even more analogies with other movies, I am sure. The scene with the FL on the bed is a visual copy of Leia from Star Wars.

4. I initially thought it was a very interesting point of how they analyzed all the fairy tales - especially Beauty and the Beast as a example of Stockholm syndrome. Quite accurate, I must say. Too bad, it was not original. They ""plagiarized"" the idea from Sex Education, word for word.

5. The fairy tales that ""she publishes"" are so poorly worded and translated, I have read better stories from elementary school students. Yet many viewers try to find ""deeper"" meaning in them. You can find deeper things in your kitchen sink, trust me on this one.

6. The worst part of the drama is by far THE PLOT. Full of holes and cliches, it defies all logic. But guess what?!! The viewers do not care. They have too engrossed in the ""when are they going to become a couple?"" thing, all those loopholes no longer seem important to them somehow. The story was quite interesting in the beginning, then got more and more boring once the events focused on hospital life and her mom's crimes became to escalate. The happy ending is totally unrealistic and not fluffy enough to my taste.

7. List of cliches:

1. Evil, abusive mother
2. Evil, abusive dad
3. Sick brother, healthy brother is the caretaker
4. A character who almost got killed, is now afraid of the sign he saw on a killer (a butterfly)
5. The mother pretends to be somebody else so her daughter doesn't recognize her.
6. All the evil people either get punished or ""change"" into good ones.

Other things that affected my appreciation for this drama:

The LF character basically screams and yells whenever she is not kissing the LM so he has to keep her lips occupied for the sake of the viewers.
The fantasy part is just childish.
They overdid that plot twist with her mom trying to make it a thriller. Not every story needs an evil mom, you know.
The main lead goes from caring for his autistic brother to caring for his psycho girlfriend. Out of the frying pan right into fire, poor guy.

Basically, I found many important issues with his drama, but the most painful one for me was the overall believability of the drama. I need some degree of believability to fully enjoy watching the drama. This one is just a fairy tale.

MUSIC: I swear the god I heard the song they played during the first kissing scene not once but twice in some previous dramas. I just hope it's the same composer, otherwise, it's pure plagiarism.

Do I understand people who loved the drama and wrote rave reviews about it? Yes, I do. Those kinds of people believe in ghosts and Santa Claus and need to grow up. Basically, if you think IONTO is fantastic, you need to get out of your teenage mode ASAP.

Also, for all of you who think that this drama somehow deals with mental issues - IT DOES NOT. It comes from me, a person who taught students that had mental health issues. This drama comes as close to dealing with mental issues as Goldilocks comes to dealing with wild bears. A superficial fantasy that is far from the real thing.

What I did enjoy was watching Kim Soo-Hyun. Remember the moment when he entered the photoshoot dressed in a suit with his hair gelled up? To die for.

And his kissing skills are on a completely different level.
Lucky is the girl who will get to experience his lips in action. Come to think of it, I think I am very orally fixated. Do I have a lip fetish? OMG... Well, you be the judge.

I wonder if I can provide any links.
Let me try:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox7QHp-O53M&feature=emb_logo

My overall score is a 7.
6 out of 7 points go for the kissing scene.

REWATCH VALUE: Definitely a big zero except for the kissing scene. That one I would like to watch a couple of times more.

Enjoy!

My obsession
I watched it in full a couple days after the last episode aired on August 9th and I'm probably on my 7th or 8th rewatch and I'm just now deciding to write a review. I don't understand how you can't fall in love. It made it hard to watch other kdramas after this - it sets the bar too high. The chemistry between KSH and SYJ is addictive. Fantastic acting. OJS and SYJ especially blew me away. Deserves every award. I truly did feel healed and continue to feel healed by this drama and just feel so thankful for its existence. What a gift. I actually initially looked into the drama because I enjoyed Park Kyu-Young's supporting role as Ji-yuul in Romance is a Bonus Book (her facial expressions are perfect) and it was so nice to see her reunite with Kang Ki-doong. Parts of the plot in the end do feel burdensome to watch, but I understand that it's meant to make it like a fairy tale and also to incorporate the kdrama/love hardships aspects. SYJ (my absolute obsession) had me bawling. She has so much range. I became enamored by her after this as so many others have and have delved into her collection of roles - currently halfway through Potato Star and over halfway through Moorim School and wow - she has chemistry with EVERYONE. But really, SYJ and KSH together are beyond words. Who doesn't want to see these two together in real life? What a blessing.

It is a Romance drama, with mental health issues as a side dish
I've come full circle on IOTNBO. It was on my PTW prior to release, then got onto CW, then I put it on hold after ep 1.... watched 2 more eps and shifted it to dropped list. Ironically, due to the scandal that Seo Ye Ji is unfortunately pulled into, my curiosity on IOTNBO is reignited and I binged the remaining eps in 2 days. This is the first drama of Seo Ye Ji that I have watched, and I am mighty impressed!! I see why she is nominated for Best Actress now. And honestly, if not for Seo Ye Ji's performance, I might be rating this drama 7. Going to watch her Lawless Lawyer after this. So hey, not all scandals mean bad publicity! IMO, I can't see why she is wrong? It was a private conversation and it is unfair to pass judgement based on a small snippet of a long chat.... but I have digressed.

What I do not like

-- This drama has mental health as its packaging and romance + family at its core. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I would really prefer it to have been romance as its packaging and mental health + family at its core.
-- The pretentious beginning. If you have seen IOTNBO, even if you love it, please think over the 1st few eps.... it was really quite pretentious. The over-the-top scenes were just there to bait us into continue watching it. And that beautiful animation in ep 1, they never repeat that again.... The baiting intention was so clear.
-- The 'mystery'. By ep 10, I was guessing that the Head Nurse is the mother, and that patient, Ms Park, is only a pawn that she planted. I am quite disappointed that I had guessed correctly so early.
-- I do not understand why there is so much screaming and raised voices in this drama? Especially for the ML character. He is a normal man who is stressed-out from caring for his brother for the past 20 years, never having much personal time. So it should have been a gradual release of his stress and letting go, but the script had him from quiet and nice guy to screaming at all unexpected changes....
-- They never really explained on Jae Soo, why and how is he so attached to these 2 brothers? JS is not an orphan, so why is he not with his parents and why did his parents allowed him to give up on building a future for himself and just tag along the Moon brothers? Maybe this works in a webtoon but in drama, scriptwriter should have given his character some backstory. JS is like a poor extra character, who is just there.

What I like

-- The 2nd half. The drama dropped its pretentiousness and focused on telling the story (2nd half is much better than 1st half, imo).
-- I love the depiction of the sibling caregiver burden and struggles. This is quite accurately depicted.
-- FL's acting. Especially in ep 14, I took 1.5 hr to finish that ep as I was rewinding and re-watching some scenes. ML did well too, but FL was more outstanding.
-- I like the CP scenes, the chemistry between ML and FL was sizzling!! Although I would have prefer more scenes on the mental health issues in the hospital.
-- The 2nd couple. I like Joo Ri and Sang In's characters, they are well flashed out and the actors have a 'couple look', lol!

Ah! What a great comeback for Kim Soo Hyun! I'm glad that he took the offer of this drama because this drama was such a rollercoaster! This was said to be a healing drama and I agree! It was a very relatable drama and it also talked about mental health which I think is very important for everyone to know.

By reading the plot, I was thinking that it wasn't complicated until I've finished the drama and actually understood where the characters' personalities are coming from. The twist was really unexpected and if weren't for the fan theories that I saw on the net, I wouldn't have any idea what will happen! What I also liked about the plot was how it relates to the female lead's stories from the books she writes. The ending was really satisfying and the family and friendship aspects in the drama are just really heartwarming. It was very unusual in a good way and it tackles so much about overcoming your cruel past.

Going to the cast, they are all amazing. Kim Soo Hyun didn't disappoint, and Seo Ye Ji's acting was definitely amazing! My first drama of Seo Yeji was Save Me, and from that, I believed that her acting capabilities are beyond what I'll expect and I was right. The chemistry between Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji is oozing hot! But the one who made me feel different types of emotions was Oh Jung Se. Oh Jung Se's acting as Moon Sang-tae was definitely top-tier. He's one of the versatile actors and I know and I wasn't expecting how he nailed his character so much. My last drama of Oh Jung Se was Stove League and his portrayal from his character in that drama to his drama here, all I can say that he's just a great actor.

The music was really fitting to the whole drama! If it weren't for the music, I wouldn't have gotten goosebumps in some scenes that literally looked creepy for me.

All in all, I loved the drama and I really think that you can learn a lot of lessons from it! Also, it's okay to not be okay.

Great story!
I loved everything about this drama. The main leads showcased the pain, fear and joy of their characters so well. This drama also tackles relevant social/medical issues of people with mental illness and special needs. It has a deep mysterious story that gets you hooked. The music and the graphics are also on point. Seo Yeji and Kin Soohyun's chemistry is off the chart!! Kim Soojyun""s character is timid, caring and selfless while Seo Yeji's character is the total opposite. Also, Seo Yeji's character Ko Munyeong has the BEST wardrobe.

Salute to the actors for a job well done. It's hard to pull off a difficult role especially in a case of a person who has special needs. A unique story line which makes kdramas great. For this review I will only put only the negative feedbacks that I observed as I watched the drama.

- There were no Climax and the Conflict of the story was only one episode. You won't really feel the climax of the drama since conflict was only good for one episode. The story only revolves the lovestory between to protagonist

- Total point of the story was simply summarized at the finale episode.

- Hype of the drama wasn't there if you waited each episodes every weekend. This is only my perspective since I only watch it and wait ever weekend. I think it is much better if you watch this series in a single day or two.

Overall the drama was great and for sure many of the viewers will be having a hard time to move on in this drama.

Your unusual Korean Drama that you should add on your watch lists!
I know that there are some K-dramas that doesn't go with the typical Korean formula (e.g. chaebol/heir - ordinary person romance; Historical and Fantasy genre; Hallyu status; etc.); but this drama is really something. A series that raises concerns about mental health is one of the best Korea had ever produced.

The story is simple - 2 past acquaintances with dark histories met again and ends up overcoming the past they have left behind. The real spice of this drama are the actors - As for KSH, what a comeback for him and yes, he still got it! SYJ also proved in this drama that she's really a top actress (also her wardrobe is absolutely stunning and gorgeous! she's like a bold Jang Man Wol). But the real show stealer is Oh Jung Se - giving a phenomenal performance as an autistic brother of KSH. There are no skippable moments in this drama! The hospital and patients scenes gave some motivation to the lives of Sang Tae, Gang Tae, and Mon Young. They also used some fairy tales and stories in the series to parallel the events that happened in the episodes. Each are summarized by the story that the trio narrates, most notably - Mon Young.

Although the drama seems perfect, 1 thing I like to emphasized is they don't use the other characters well in some points. Like isn't it strange that there is no romantic relationship between Sang-in (CEO) and Moon Young? or even Sang-in having a feelings for Mon-young? I think he can be a potential third wheel for the couple. Also her mother - I don't want to spoil but I don't like the plot twist in the last episodes.

Will all those shortcomings, it still doesn't ruin the quality of the drama. I'm looking forward for this drama to bag numerous award (OJS may also won a DAESANG!).

I know that not all will like this drama since the majority prefer a rom-com series but I swear, there are still scenes that are really hilarious (some are dark humors of Moon Young) so I really hope to give it a shot!
1 word to summarize this drama- MASTERPIECE

A very fun and casual watch
I really enjoyed this drama, and I really liked the casting for it as well! The story built up well and there were lots of references to previous episodes that linked really well together. The build up of the overall story line of their parents involvements with each other was quite gradual and didn't have a huge surprise ending like many other dramas would, but I liked this because I think the story came second. To me it felt as though it was more focused on the characters and them over coming the traumas they faced in their childhoods, rather than a who did it scenario. It did have some cool plot twists that were fun and the story definitely didn't disappoint. Would really recommend to watch it!

Beautifully written & play
The story, animation, cinematography, soundtrack, and acting are amazing. Beautifully written and directed. It's a very thoughtful even for tiny little details like their costumes. This has been an entertaining and heartwarming story about learning how to live with one‚Äôs scars without them getting in the way of pursuing happiness and fulfillment. In that sense, the first and last fairy tales really sum up the theme. Obviously not typical K-drama. Every episode gave a roller coaster feeling, its funny, scary sad, and happy. Agree with SooHyun that its a human healing drama. The best drama ever, worth every second. The chemistry is amazing! Sangtae Oppa deserved awards.

Episode 5 the motel scene is hilarious between the male and female lead. Let just put this out in the open am a SUPER-MEGA fan of the female lead like bruh her character is priceless. I love the FL character Ko Moon Young . This is what females are like they have a backbone and they are crazy like I am glad that they don‚Äôt give a weak FL. I like the harsh and cool FL that was created in this show. I also like the chemistry between the ML and FL like they almost Complement each other. I am quite curious about the storybooks cause i like them like i seriously like dark fairytale it‚Äôs like so good. Hat off for the creator for this Kdrama and those storybooks like they were very creative for this Kdrama. Movin on, let me tell you the bromance is amazing between Kang Gi Doong (Jo Jae Soo )[Gang Tae's friend] and Kim Soo Hyun (Moon Gang Tae) . I really ship to the point I wish that this drama was a BL. oh i almost forgot about the baby sound effect anytime the ML save one of the ML side characters heck even when he sometime talk gay like i am cracking uo with laughter.another hilarious scene is when the ML is jealous when he see othe men with the FL that can also be said for the FL too when she jealous too. Now almost closing into the end of the show it legit made me cry buckets of Tears. Oh and I almost forgot the deer that always cries or makes noises when the ML and FL are going to make up as in going in for the kiss that always gets intercepted by the deer noise. I can see they put a lot of effort in this drama because the did animation on the stories that was being told.

This is one of the best drama I have watched this year. From the first episode to the last episode I was hooked. The thing I love the most was the character development, story telling and the animation which was used in the drama.

Casting: The people who did the casting I really want to give them huge round of applause. The actors were amazing. I was able to connect with characters and their emotions.

Music: The timing and the use of the music was really great in this drama . For example the music which was used when Munyeong confessed GangTae made that clip even more funnier.

THIS IS A MUST WATCH
I picked up this series because of Kim So Hyun. It's the best decision I have made thjs month.

The story is refreshing, captivating and intriguing. I was on tenterhooks wondering which direction the story will take. It wasn't easy to predict the happenings. The story really potrays the meaning of love and the healing process and growth involved in falling in love and staying in love.

The coustume for the FL were all beautiful and runway worthy. The acting of the ML and FL was flawless and perfect. The chemistry was intense(If you don't believe me just watch until the Gang Tae and Ku Yeong kiss each other). Even I could feel the heat watching them. The expressions of the Lead Actors was fantastic and well interpreted.

The Music was apt. All the OST's were appropriately used to convey the mood of the story. I am definitely downloading the all the OST of this series.

I will definitely rewatch this as many times as it takes to be able to mimic and lip sync the words of the FL. The performance delivery of the actors in this series expecially Moon Sang Tae, is award deserving.

I am looking forward to the next series that will serve Kim So Hyun and So Ye Ji acting together. They are my most favourite on screen couple. I'll ship a relationship between them any day.

Absolutely fascinating!
I had my doubts starting this drama despite all the rave ratings....I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be something I will enjoy. But once I started ...I couldn‚Äôt stop. It was enthralling... gripping.....there was so much emotion and every single actor did justice to their roles. It‚Äôs was beautifully made and I didn‚Äôt want it to end. The female lead was so unusual that it was actually refreshing, it seemed the drama did a role reversal when it came to the male and female lead but it made sense. Everything about this drama was just perfect.

It really is okay not to be okay
Satisfying to the very end. The casting, acting, THEEE STORY-TELLING (OMG!!) was phenomenal. And the OST (Original Soundtrack) brought the story together so seamlessly. Mental health is a taboo topic not seen to often in kdramas. It‚Äôs Okay Not To Be Okay explored mental health in such a thorough yet elegant manner and I am HERE FOR IT! The animation fillers reminded me of Timothy Burton style: semi-dark, yet whimsical and so beautifully done. It was serious with the perfect amounts of comedic relief.

This drama makes you fall in love with not only the main characters, but all of the supporting and even stand-in extra roles. It‚Äôs so adorable.

I‚Äôve seen it twice so far and I would love to watch it again with anyone of my friends/family who are interested.

I love, love LOVE this drama. I Highly recommend this work of art!

Best TV series of 2020
Just as I gave up on the 2020 TV series, this series seemed to me to find water in the desert. The story, the acting, especially the KHS SYJ duo became my favorite couple. But the Oscar goes to OH JUNG SE FOR BEST ACTOR!!! He really did touch our hearts, I really love his character and how he portrayed it.


Human healing drama gave a very correct meaning. You will find many pieces of yourself in this series. Perhaps it's a drama in which you will find solutions. I have to say that it contributed a lot to me.

Be sure to watch this drama.

Be emotionally prepared!
This drama is way too beautiful that I could not stop watching it. Luckily I watched it until it stopped airing so i did not have to wait for the upcoming events.

It was an emotionnal rollercoaster to me but I enjoyed it just as much as I felt both happiness and sadness. If you are looking for something to enjoy in all aspects of life: family, relationship, love, hatred, friendship, physical and mental illness and so one, this is deffo highly recommended. If I had to describe it shortly, I'd say this is an aesthetically beautifully sad drama.

I also want to emphasize on the main actors acting: the main actress for portraying one of the most sensitive topis in the entire world: mental health. the main actor for showing the reality of family sacrifice. And lastly, but not least Oh Jung-se for showing that imperfection is the real beauty.

The OSTs were just too beautiful that I had to download them to my phone and listen to them whenever.

Truly a very beautiful unforgettable drama to me.

Very unique and well done show
This show definitely stands out for its unique theme. The story pacing was just the right amount, not too fast or dragged out. The use of children's fairy tales for the narration of plot and characters was beautifully done. Main as well as supporting character stories are well written especially the character development we see in all the characters. The actors did an amazing job, Oh jung se's acting as moon sang tae was really amazing to watch. The OST tracks are really beautiful. The show also has a very satisfying ending. Overall it's a very good show and will definitely recommend this show. The drawback according to me is that it has the clich√© kdrama tropes without which it would have been truly unique.

Where should I begin? I have been off the internet for a while and that also gave me time to think clearly about this drama. Still, I couldn't help but give it a 10.
'It's Okay to Not Be Okay' is, indeed, the drama of the year for me along with Hospital Playlist and Extracurricular. I have to say, I haven't watched all the 2020 dramas so keep that in mind. But yeah.
I want to talk about why I gave the story a 9/10 first: yes, the plot was interesting af and it's really addicting... but. There has to be a but, right? It is indeed true that there were some lacking things? I won't actually mention them to avoid spoilers, but yes, there were certain parts on the episodes that left me kinda 'empty', not filled up enough. Still, the drama is indeed about healing and it deals with that on a really realistic way. The fact that healing also includes Sang Tae, who is a character with autism, is also something that adds up a lot to the plot. We get to see things from his point of view too, which is super interesting.

The acting is marvelous. To be honest, the acting that impressed me the most wasn't Kim Soo Hyun's or Seo Ye Ji's but Oh Jung Se. Portraying an autistic person is really hard and he did it so good... he made it look so effortless, so natural. And yes, there were parts where Seo Ye Ji's acting also shocked me, as well as Kim Soo Hyun's, but long-term it was Oh Jung Se's, everything be said.

Ko Mun Yeong (Seo Ye Ji) is a book writer. Well, for children. On some episodes we get to 'read' her books along with different characters and I found this really amazing! The books were so good, always leaving a deep message behind, and the illustrations that came with it really impressed me for good.

The OST is one of my favorites along with Hotel Del Luna's and Goblin's. I was always waiting for a new track to drop. Especially the english ones, I just loved them. I kept the OST on repeat for weeks and sometimes I still do.

Overall, the drama in general is different than what we're used to. With a role-reversal that actually worked AND not changing throughout the episodes, it makes you feel what the characters are feeling and is addicting af. I loved Ko Mun Yeong, I lived for her scenes. Don't get me wrong, Gang Tae's scenes were also really interesting and I loved them, but Ko Mun Yeong just had something. The chemistry was AMAZING and their kisses... oh well. You'll have to see yourself.

I recommend this 10/10. It's something really different and the plot is interesting, the acting is perfect as well as the OST and it leaves you wanting more after every episode. Weekends were the best days of the week while it was airing, I swear, you won't regret it.

Rapunzel but she's basically hungry all the time.
I can't believe I didn't start this show sooner! I laughed, I cried, I squealed, and I loved every minute of it. I absolutely loved this show. I really liked how unpredictable this story and the characters were. I also really enjoyed the whole fairytale and book writing aspect of it. I'm so glad I went into this show not knowing too much about it. I personally think the ending was perfect and tied up fairly well. If you are undecided or debating to watch this show, don't overthink it and just start!

Upon hearing so many positive reviews and remarks about this drama, the craze has gotten into me as well. I decided to binge-watch this during my mandatory quarantine. It was very difficult to get into the drama right at the very beginning - the plot seemed too thick to debunk. There was a shroud of mystery surrounding the characters, which was intriguing, but together very complex and required complete concentration to realise the whole plot. The story seemed very underrated and very unlike the traditional cheesy Kdrama. It tackles themes such as mental illness, murder, friendships, romance, childhood trauma and so much more. To be honest, it can be a handful to handle for a beginner watcher. However, the cast is very talented, just as expected from Kdrama veterans, which were perfectly chosen to act for this difficult series. I believe that the characters and the acting is what made this drama spectacular and completely unforgettable. Not to mention the gorgeous sets and beautiful outfits. You cannot disagree that Ko Moon Young is definitely a Kdrama style icon of 2020. In addition, the soundtrack was very fitting, with a mix of Korean ballads and English songs. Personally, I could not rate this a 10 as it was lacking clarity and was not that captivating at the start: I only got into the series as it was progressing. But I will not forget the chemistry and the acting of this drama. Overall, this series is definitely a new concept and I can see the praise behind it. If you are into deeper, heart wrenching and a bit disturbing themes and plots, I feel like you will enjoy this a lot!

Let's start with the good. It's Okay to Not Be Okay has a unique premise for a kdrama which it handles beautifully. They portrayed characters with a variety of mental health issues fairly accurately and with a lot of sympathy and understanding. The only other kdrama I've seen that addresses issues like this is It's Okay That's Love. The actors all did a fantastic job! I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about any of the actors' performances. Seo Ye Ji in particular was amazing. I thought her emotional range was really refreshing and well-rounded. I also loved how there was absolutely no love triangle and that the main couple didn't get together and break up a million times like in so many dramas. Overall it was just really well written and well-executed.

Now on to what I didn't like so much. I know I'll probably get some flak for this but I could not stand Moon Sang Tae. The character was just incredibly annoying. I desperately wanted him to have a smaller role in the show. I simply found everything about him infuriating. Yes, this was partly because of his autism and how that manifested in his character but it was mostly because of how he affected his brother. He was very selfish and it made me sad every time Gang Tae suffered because of him. Related to that I found Moon Gang Tae's character arc frustrating at times. His arc at first seems to be about learning how to take care of himself and putting his needs above those of others for once. But that arc is never realized. He stagnates halfway through due to guilt over his brother. I wish he had more character development. I also really disliked the plotline surrounding Ko Moon Young's mother. It simply made no sense. It was a huge plot hole within an otherwise very coherent show. To avoid spoilers that is all I'll say.

Overall I did really like the show but it wasn't the greatest kdrama I've ever seen. I'm happy others loved it even more than I did but it was just okay for me.

Rollercoaster
It‚Äôs so refreshing to watch a kdrama what goes about psychiatry. I am happy that they make this drama. I heard a lot off this drama, but haven‚Äôt watched it till recent. Because it didn‚Äôt really attracted me. When I started I became right to the start addicted. The cast where so good. Especially the brother from ML who plays a autistic boy. Great job! I really believed he had autisem. The ML & FL had really great chemistry. The both has been hurt in the past and together they became eachother strength. In this drama there are a lot off emotions like a rollercoaster, but it‚Äôs a really good story, acting and drama. Hopefully with this story a lot more people will understand and accept what it is like to have autism of have a psychiatric disease.
This is a must watch! If you want something refreshing than this is it!

Drama That You'll Recommend Even After Decades Later
Likes:
* The way the writer/producers interpret well-known fairy tales into a darker version with the intention of motivating you to face the harsh reality head-on instead of daydreaming a happy ending.
* High degree of chemistry between the leads. Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se were phenomenal! They shall receive an award for their outstanding performances!
* Supporting roles that acted so well - I was either rooting for the good ones or hating on the evil ones!
* Amazingly beautiful visuals.
* Tear-jerking subplots of the hospital patients.
* Indirectly educating audiences to be empathetic towards other people who seems to be different to you.

Dislikes:
* The little plot holes towards the end but nahhhh, it's forgiven.

Do not miss this drama! 100000% Must watch
This drama...
Oh my where do I even start?!
Right from the first episode I was hooked to the story , the characters, the flow , everything was perfectly placed and every episode was a journey in itself.
STORY: This drama revolves around three people tied down by fate and destiny , others call it an ‚Äúill-fated‚Äù relationship which they turned into something so much more deeper, stronger , more beautiful and lovely. Almost every episode had me smiling , crying , healing , thinking , going nuts Every emotion I could comprehend.
What a story, the storytelling is so beautifully done that every nook and cranny is clear and audience receives it.

ACTING: No words! Perfect perfect cast...
I can not describe how perfect this drama is for me. Every aspect , every scene , their delivery , every emotion came across very very well. Kim Soo Hyun Couldn‚Äôt have chosen a better drama for his comeback. All of the cast did a serious commendable job.

MUSIC: Music completed the scenes tbh
Love it! Already some songs are loaded in my Spotify playlist, some slow some melody overall great and fitting music

REWATCH: So hear me out....
Sometimes when you wanna get lost in another world and not be connected to what‚Äôs happening around you , just rewatch this drama. You‚Äôll enter into another world which is like a rollercoaster ride of emotions with lots of love , healing and deeper messages. It‚Äôs quite a deep drama. Some of you guys may not rewatch it at all because it‚Äôs deep. It depends on you.

OVERALL: This drama was a beautiful unique journey of growth, healing , self discovery, self love, and so so much more. ALSO THERE ARE SOME PRETTY HILARIOUS SCENES DUDE ,. Watch it because it‚Äôs worth the time. You will feel things which will make you think, think a lot about a lot of things. You will cry , laugh , smile, scream, and cheer along with the characters of this drama. Simply beautiful. There are only very few dramas which are Beautiful and this one right now is owning that throne for me.

Thank you to the producers and directors for giving us this good beautiful drama!

Its okay for the show to be okay
So I believe everything is perfect about the show. From the production to the music, acting, cinematography, characters, art design, story (well almost). As other reviewers have already mentioned how this is a character-driven drama and mostly focuses on the healing of the 3 main characters among other patients in the hospital.

There are a lot of things I loved about this drama. I loved the focus on mental health awareness. There were a lot of side characters whose story was really beautiful and it made me tear up a bit. The show respects all its patients and takes great care of them. Some of them were healed and some of them obviously were in progress.

I loved the writing aspect of the show. The storybook concept was beautifully crafted with the inner lives of our leads and other patients, so it gives a second layer of storytelling to help us understand their struggles. The art again was very well done.
I loved the acting in the show. the actor who played Sang Tae was amazing. Our main romantic leads also had amazing chemistry and the female lead was a revelation to me. I usually don't like KSH, but I really liked him here.

Now let's talk about characters and their development. The best development was obviously among the 2 brothers. their relationship really evolved during the show to not only make them less co-dependent but to value each other more as people and as family. I loved Ju-Ri's mom and other side characters specially Jae-Su Gang Tae's friend and MY's colleagues. Even Ju-Ri and the manager's brief romance was cute. I was a little disappointed was with our female lead whom I found kind of irritating. Because of her personality disorder, every time she would do something chaotic, the viewers will have to rationalize that behavior (its clever writing to excuse her behavior though). Also, I wanted to understand how her APD works but that plot was soon forgotten in the later episodes. I predicted her mom plot in EP-10 itself, but that itself was extremely undercooked.

I totally understand the writer's perspective that MY's craziness was required for Gang Tae to help him release his pent-up frustration and she might be good for him overall. but as a viewer watching MY harass Gang-Tae was uncomfortable to watch. It is why I've left many dramas like Oh My Ghostess.

So while everything was amazing on paper, I seriously could get myself to care about any of the main characters. The plot in itself was extremely draggy, and I myself wanted to drop the show many times. Even the romance could not get me hooked as I was not invested in the romance. Also, like another reviewer mentioned I have a low tolerance for self-loathing and pity so while it can a great drama for others, for me it was meh. But yes I completely appreciate the team behind the show.

Casting - definitely the best choice. Kim Soo Hyun did a superb acting, those emotions coming through his eyes. I loved Son Ye Jin's voice and wardrobe! Oh Jung Se did so well portraying as an autistic adult.

Storyline - something new, addictive for me, the twists and turns are unexpected! I did cry on some episodes that are really heartbreaking.

Music - loved the OST! I saved it on my spotify playlists.

If you haven't seen this drama, I highly recommend it! Worth watching.

So this story is just off the top. I loved the main character. Her personality is awesome. She's like not scared of anything, and she can so anything. Strong women right there. The only thing is is afraid of is her mom, which honestly her mother was a terrible person. I loved Sang Tae, he was so cute, and adorable, I love how he is also honest.

I also love how like the main character's personality sort of like change. Like in the beginning Moon Young said ""I love you"" to Gang Tae, and she followed him and kept saying it, and then towards the end, Gang tae did it, that was very funny. I loved the deer scene, that was wonderful.

But can anyone answer me this question, HOW THE HELL DID HER MOTHER LIVE. Like she was pushed down the stairs, and her head was cracked open, and she was bleeding so much. Like at that point she should have already died, not to mention Moon Young's father put her in a coffin and threw into the sea, like how did she survive all of that?

An extremely deep and interesting drama
It has its negative and positive points.

At times it is difficult to be patient with the prota's autistic brother, he makes it very difficult for some situations that are even boring, but the performance is undoubtedly impeccable

The protagonist harasses the prota a lot, which I particularly found comical, but often unnecessary, she is a person with mental problems, so she doesn't notice, but it's still unnecessary.

I missed the protagonist's amorous development, I can't see him gradually falling in love, it just seems that he started to like it and that's it

A flawless, audiovisual drama that I've never seen so perfect... Without a doubt memorable and iconic
The plot of the story is spectacular, a very well constructed drama that delivers what it promises
It's so remarkable that you can easily remember details, even after months of watching, it's worth it

95/100

Not what I was expecting, but some great acting!
I saw some clips on Youtube and thought I knew what this show was going to be like, and I was wrong, well partly wrong.

Ko Moon Young is such a unique character, and if she wasn't so incredibly beautiful, it would be too, too easy to dislike her. She has such long beautiful hair, and beautiful eyes, and I think her waist actually got smaller near the end of the series, it was so tiny! She was always dressed really well. Ko Moon Young can act though, and go from no emotion, to great emotion.

Moon Gang Tae was basically the male version of Ko Moon Young. Wow, can he act! The guy could go from a face like a statue, to so emotional, that you could feel it.

Moon Sang Tae plays a character with Autism, and does such a great job of it. I thought he really had it. I really didn't care for the character in the beginning, and I think they meant for you not to really like him that much, but by the end, that changes.

I swear, I think everyone in the show can smile better than just about anyone else. Talk about changing the way someone looks with a smile. Just unreal!!!

This is a serious show. The focus is on the mind. The majority of it is with characters from a mental hospital. Every character has a interesting personality. The caregivers have the patience of Saints!

Pretty much every character has some serious mental baggage to deal with, and that's all the main characters as well.

There are many funny moments, but some very intense moments, and many moments that have you thinking. It's pretty deep, and they are really good at making characters. If you like reading between the lines, you can do it here, because they are that good with the acting.

If you're looking for a show that doesn't require tissues, then this one isn't for you.

It's quite a interesting show, but it might not be for everyone. This isn't fluff, this is a pretty serious story being told.

Would I rewatch it, maybe, a good way into the future. Just to see Ko Moon Young I might do it. :)

Best‚ù§Ô∏è
It is a very unique drama that really needs to be appreciated. It was a big step to produce a full-length drama tackling about different mental health disorders. This drama is very psych-heavy but I guess people need to be aware of these disorders too. They need proper treatment and not judgement. The story is a bit cliche but they really added a unique touch to it. Since this Psych-themed drama shows how their thoughts run in their minds, I love how they portray these thoughts using animation and exaggeration (for differentiation from reality). People with mental health disorders might not be able to distinguish reality from their imaginations, thoughts, or fantasies, but the people around them could. We should show them that we understand them and we care for them (Just like how Gang Tae does it). It's good that they get treatment. I just wish Mun Yeong will also get treated. I know her character will still develop so let's wait for it. However, we must not romanticize her inappropriate actions. She has anti-social personality disorder which makes her unable to distinguish between right and wrong. This must not be tolerated and Gang Tae is doing a great job correcting her. This is still ongoing but it already made us feel different emotions. It's good that people are becoming more aware of different mental health issues and the triggers that can be associated with it. Thank you, It's Okay To Not Be Okay :)

Music, animations, acting 100% Seo Yeji's voice? 101%!!

A Dark Fairytale to Warm Your Heart
Let me say, just wow!! This drama quickly scaled the list to become one of my favorite dramas in such a short amount of time. I‚Äôd hike it up there somewhere between Hotel Del Luna and Black (2017). Yea...that‚Äôs how much I liked it.

It‚Äôs Okay Not to be Okay (or Psycho But It‚Äôs Okay) is a darker, edgier drama that hits on real-world issues like mental-health in a fanciful, almost fairy-tale way. But truth be told, I was locked in immediately by the playful, whimsical Tim-Burton style animation that was introduced in episode one. The continuous references to the Adams Family through imagery and dialogue was delightful, dark, and delicious, like drinking espresso with bitter dark chocolate.....yum.

Seo Yea Ji ROCKED this performance!!! Okay? At first, it was hard not to notice the similarities between her and Jang Man-Wol (played by IU in Hotel Del Luna). But let me tell you something...this lady stands firmly on her own. I found it hard not to intensely care for her even while portraying a cold, bloodthirsty, emotionless psycho. There‚Äôs something notably charming and warm about her presence and style.

I loved Kim Soo Hyun as the main character/love interest. He played the part very well & spoke volumes with his eyes alone. The chemistry between him and his autistic brother Moon Sang Tae (played by Oh Jung Se) was amazing!! Sang Tae was a character that latched firmly onto my heart and would not let go. It was hard not to care for him deeply.

All in all, give this highly underrated drama a watch. Seriously....we must value even the little things that give us room...to simply breathe....

From a psychology major
I found this drama very beautiful, it conveys a lot of mental health issues very well, although a bit very dramatized, just like any drama. As a Psychology student myself, I am not extremely knowledgeable, super advanced in the field of mental health, however I loved to see a few of the most hot topics in the field talked about, mainly topics related to childhood trauma and autism. Autism sure can be a challenge to live with, and this show portrays how easy it is to interact and befriend unique people, people that communicate and see the world in a very different, peculiar way. Moon Sang Tae is an extreme example of an autistic person, showing symptoms such as difficulty identifying emotions, repetitive movements & speech, poor eye contact, focusing intensely on one topic, social withdrawal, extreme sensitivity to external stimuli (lights, sounds), poor ability to stay on topic when answering questions, fixations on certain objects or activities, aggressive behaviour (either with self or others), and so on. This diagnosis was challenging for his family, especially his mother who raised Moon Gang Tae to take care of his brother and protect him. What made this show more realistic and painful were Moon Gang Tae's feelings of abandonment, when all of his mother's attention was towards his special needs brother. These feelings made Moon Gang Tae struggle with getting close to other people.

On the other side, there is the ""sociopath"" lady, Go Moon Young, who appears to suffer from anti-social personality disorder. Now, I've seen some pesky reviews saying that she's the villain, an awful woman, she shouldn't be with Moon Gang Tae, when in reality she is a victim herself. I firmly believe she is not a psychopath, as she shows massive genuine remorse throughout the show, she shows she is capable of empathy and putting herself in someone else's shoes. I personally loved to see a show offering hope even for the ""monsters"". She is a victim who has never really addressed the trauma she went through in her childhood, therefore acting upon her poor coping skills and defense mechanisms. Anti-social personality disorder is a result of severe childhood trauma and neglect. She was raised by an extremely abusive and controlling mother, who isolated her and demanded her to behave in a cruel way. Go Moon Young shows symptoms of anti-social personality disorder such as illegal behaviours, stealing, repetitive lying and deception of others, often for her own amusement, impulsiveness, reckless behaviour, aggression, irascibility manifested through violent acts or speech, disregard towards one's personal safety, disregards towards possible dangerous consequences, irresponsibility regarding her career life, severe lack of empathy, presenting hedonic behaviors as well, following her own urges and wishes at all costs. Her relationship with Moon Gang Tae is considered to be a pretty toxic one, she disregards many of his boundaries, deliberately makes him uncomfortable in many instances, does not care about his needs as much, she becomes anxiously attached to him, demanding for his attention at all times. On the other side, Moon Gang Tae is very cold towards her, rejecting any way of emotionally or physically approaching her, his personal walls being very tall. However I firmly believe they are very mature in their thinking and behaviorus, they are capable of learning and transforming, they are capable of healthiness, just like any other of us. Sure sometimes they might say or do silly stuff, or hurting words. Mistakes are all part of learning, progressing, as long as they are accepted and stored as lessons.

Overall a very beautiful drama, with ups and downs, it is a very hopeful drama especially for people struggling with mental health, that comes to show that no matter what dumps life has dragged you through, you will find your light to shine someday, it is possible to overcome your fears, it is possible to live a fulfilling life, it is possible to get out of the darkness, bitterness and suffocation. Yes, I admit that this drama is obviously dramatized and not all of us will heal through the power of love, healing is such a rocky adventure, sometimes it feels like you went back from where you started, other times it feels like you've progressed so much. Healing is not linear, and for sure it is not simple, but it can sure be a fun adventure! Sometimes it takes place next to another person struggling with their own heavy burdens. Don't forget guys, sharing your burdens will make it easier for you! Talking to someone else, getting the professional help you need, it all can help! It is never too late to start your healing journey, these guys were in their late 20's!! You can start healing at any age, you can work on yourself at any age! Stay hopeful, little butterflies.

I almost cried every single episode, ready for box of tissues
Somehwere I saw or read that this is a Love Comedy, but i don't think so. This is a love story but not a commedy. It made me laugh once in a while, but I was pull into the unique atmostphere of the drama as human love story. It is unique set up so if you onyl look for romance / love comedy, this isn't like that. Each episode will touch your heart with sadness and warmness of human love.

And the atmostphere of drama and settings, such as old casle like house, the way LF dress with old style fashion and hairstyle, , suspense and bit of scary feeling towards the ending of the drama, are wonderful as part of drama.

Most impressive actor was the older brother of lead male actor. His acting was transcendental !!

This drama healed me
I can't explain how close this drama is to my heart. It talks about trauma and mental health. I love how beautifully they have portrayed these in the drama. And especially I like how in every book Ko Mun Yeong had written, they deliver a message. And I hear many people say they don't like this drama because of Mun Yeong's personality. Guys!! She has been suffering from mental trauma since childhood!! How can you expect her to be a normal happy person? And the ending had brought tears to my eyes. It wasn't a sad ending, but it somehow made me feel so many emotions. It was beautiful, warm and inspiring. Definitely recommend!!

Wondrously Unique Story with a Few Bumps at the Start
For me, this show was hard to get into at first because the female lead, Ko Moon Young, starts off as a grade A b*itch -- though there are reasons why, she starts off as being unrelentingly selfish, manipulative, and even obsessive over the male lead, Moon Gang Tae. However, this ends up a little forgiven as the show quickly picks up its stride and turns out to be about the healing power of human relationships, especially as it pertains to mental health.

This kdrama is famous for portraying mental health in a positive light and its easy to see why: psychological problems are treated semi-realistically and handled by the fictional psychiatric hospital staff in a respectful, therapeutic way. Underlying these character-driven stories is a fairy tale backdrop, where the individual stories end up being an allegory for the main story. It's a very clever and unique formula.

Ultimately, it is a great show, but for me personally, I think Ko Moon Young's character really took it down a few notches for me. In particular, I felt like the show sort of started her off as having some kind of diagnosable mental illness, but then pivoted to the source of her personality and her issues being trauma that she faced. For me, I think this revelation made it just a little more unforgivable to me that she acted so self-centered and immature in the beginning of the story.

In short; a drama about a childhood love and mental traumas.
It's a drama less about romance than it is about personal healing and learning to come to terms with your past.

If you liked It's Okay, That's Love, you will love this. Although the romance underpins the whole story and keeps it going, I believe what most people liked about it is that it is driven also by relatable psychological themes such as family, personal hurt, trauma, and etc. I will rate this an 8 overall because it's objectively a good show, but not a show with themes that I particularly enjoy.

If you like dramas that are a little heavy with the romance not being the main focus, you can check out this show! Music and storytelling are great all around, it's a matter of taste.

I watched it for the second time...
Megn√©ztem m√°sodszor is √©s minden pillanat√°t √∫jra √©lveztem. Az eddigi le√≠r√°sok k√∂nnyed mulats√°got √≠rtak, de nagyon m√©ly emberi dr√°m√°kkal √°tsz≈ëtt sorozatot l√°ttam. A sz√≠n√©szek ‚Äû√©ltek‚Äù, √©s nem j√°tszott√°k a szerep√ºket, ami csod√°latos √©lm√©ny. Az eddigi sorozatok √©s filmek k√∂z√ºl kiemelked≈ë sz√≠n√©szi √©s dramaturgiai √©lm√©ny volt. Sz√°momra ez az egyedi hangv√©tel≈±, de sok embert meghat√≥ dr√°ma 10/10 pontot √©r. Mindenkinek csak aj√°nlani tudom.

I watched it a second time and enjoyed every moment again. The descriptions so far have written light amusement, but I have seen a series interwoven with very deep human dramas. The actors ‚Äúlived‚Äù and didn‚Äôt play their part, which is a wonderful experience. Out of the series and films so far, it was an outstanding acting and dramaturgical experience. For me, this drama with a unique tone but touching a lot of people is worth 10/10 points. I can only recommend it to everyone.

Amazing characters with amazing plot and amazing screenplay!!!!
It's an amazing drama, and from start to finish it will grasp your full attention! The female lead brings something fresh as she isn't the typical soft-spoken lead you often find in Kdramas. Her whole character especially at the start of the drama will have you glued to the screen! The character development of both male & female leads are entertaining to watch! There really isn't a strong love triangle in the drama which I appreciated. Although, there was potential for a love triangle, it wasn't seriously considered in the plot. It's the best kdrama I have watched so far with amazing OST as well!

amazing must watch
If you are looking for a good drama without that typical romance plot you rather watch something knew this is for you it is romantic but not too much is unusual how the leads show their emotion and or affection they are both healing mentally it is drama that is really focused on mental health and its disorders its very psych-heavy and a little dark.
The acting is just wow is a drama that will drag you in from the first episodes.
If you are looking for a sweet drama this is not for you but you should give it a try if you are up for something knew of course it has its romance but it is portrayed different with a boss b###h of female lead and a caring male lead that is not necessarily fond of the FL
Is a really aesthetical pleasing drama with a great production and acting

A complete world of emotional war
Where should I begin with? This drama is just a GOLD.

Superb acting by the main leads. And my favorite strongest female lead Seo Ye-ji.
Just go for it. I am out of words to explain this great piece. Just watch it.

It has sad moments with joyful ones. Fighting with the past is hard and can be tricky but with the love and support of our close ones, we can overcome anything. A clear-cut drama that focuses on how a human would feel when he is mentally challenged with real-life responsibilities, The drama has many cheerful moments and you can connect to the main leads.
The ending was also satisfying and make you fall in love with the plot.

it's a great kdrama standard -so fresh and original, it definitely stands out-
You like psychology? This is the show for you.
‚Üí trauma, neurodiversity representation*, three dimensional characters with development done right and they demystified the portrayal of antisocial personality disorder.
*it sucks that it's portrayed by a neurotypical actor, but just the fact this character was written is already a start (we gotta see the progress).
There are scenes that I felt were a little too much, but the other amazing scenes made up for it.
The only thing that bothered me is that she harassed him quite a lot at first. I know it's supposed to be funny, but men can be victims to abuse and women can be perpetrators. Women are the majority of the victims but there is a percentage of men too and they should be respected, not treated as a joke. It's a fucked up double standard, if he acted the way she did I think the repercussions would be different. --Since it's not the main part of the series I still love it, but just because we like something doesn't mean we get to ignore what could harmful.--

Be Prepared to Cry Your Eyes Out
Damn!!! I cried a lot with this drama. So many scenes that broke my heart and so many children carrying heavy burdens placed on them by their parents. Goodness!!

I liked the series overall. Really great cast but especially Oh Jung Se as Sang Tae. The man should have won all the awards the year this came out!!This drama ended up being totally different from what I thought it was going to be about. Seo Yea Ji is stunning and once again the Kdrama wardrobe and costumes department was on fire with her looks. However, her character, Ko Moon Young was not easy to like. Once we get her full story, we can see why she behaved the way she did. It was actually quite refreshing to see her development throughout the series.

Moon Gang Tae is one of the most heartbreakingly, tragic characters I have ever watched in a drama, K or otherwise. The amount of things this man had to endure was too much for me to bear and like I said, I cried a lot. The man couldn't catch a break.

One of the best things about this drama was the use of the well-known fairytales and the ones created by Moon Young that show the parallels of the characters lives.

I also really loved the animated scenes from the storytelling. Just phenomenal. OST is good too!

A MUST-SEE DRAMA
""What the Shadow Witch has stolen from them was not their true faces but their courage to find happiness.""
ÏÇ¨Ïù¥ÏΩîÏßÄÎßå Í¥úÏ∞ÆÏïÑ, or better known with its English title, It's Okay to Not be Okay, is one of the dramas that I have been waiting to air because it is the small screen comeback of Kim Soo Hyun after serving in the military. That's why this is a very special one. Just in case you didn't know, I have been a fan of Kim Soo Hyun since Dream High era. Anyway, in this blog post, I'll be sharing to you the things I like, hate (if there's some) and lessons I learned in this drama. I may have some spoilers here so read at your own discretion.

Things I liked about this drama

The animation and VFX
As a multimedia artist, I am definitely impressed with the animation and the vfx of this series. I like how they used stop-motion animation to give this creepy vibe. Stop-motion animation is a meticulous type of animation. It requires a lot of patience that's why I really appreciate it. Also, I also like how they presented the main characters. They give me some kind of Addams Family vibe.Regarding the vfx, since they showed us at the end that they are using the blue screen for the scenes in the balcony of the castle, I must say that I am truly impressed on how they made those effects. Hands up to the vfx team.

The cast line-up
This drama has a solid line-up. The actors and actresses in this drama are so amazing. Well, amazing can be an understatement. Every actors and actresses fit with their roles and well, they also fit well for each other. I mean, I can't imagine other actors playing those roles. I also like how the main characters' past selves really look like their younger version. The casting team did well. And speaking of casts, Oh Jung Se is really a versatile actor! I first watched him in When the Camellia Blooms. His character here is really different from that character and he pulled it off very well. I hope he wins an award for his role here.

It tackles about Mental Health
Mental health is something a lot of people are afraid to talk about. Maybe because they are not that informed about it or they just don't want people think that they're crazy. Admit it or not, a lot of people will label us crazy when we tell them that we visited a psychiatrist or psychologist. As a person who is suffering from depression and anxiety, this drama gave me hope that those people who are not that aware with mental health and mental illnesses will have an idea about it and how they can deal with it. And also they gave me an assurance that I can recover from my mental illness.

The stories within the story
The fairy tale story books that Ko Munyeong wrote were really an eye-opener. My personal favorites are The Boy who Fed on Nightmares, The Cheerful Dog, and the Finding the Real Faces. The main reason why I loved this is because I can relate to the stories. I keep on thinking, is it really made for kids or is it made for adults? I love how adults can relate in these children books.
Aside from that, it gave me another perspective on how to look at the fairy tales. We always think that this is the moral lesson of the story because our parents or teachers told us so, but in fact, there are more lessons that can be found there. And I love how Ko Munyeong pointed it out.

The emotions it gives me
This drama will give you a roller coaster kind of emotions. One minute you'll see yourself crying and suddenly you will burst out laughing. A single episode can make you experience a lot of emotions. I think that this drama wants us to release those emotions because there are times that we also try to hide these.

The story twists
There are a lot of twists in this drama and that is what makes me want more of it. There were just so many mind-blowing happenings. Spoiler alert, yes it's a happy ending. I actually expected it already but I never thought that this happy ending can affect me equally with a sad ending. Maybe because I saw the development of the characters. It's probably one of the most satisfying ending. I personally love it. It was not the ending I was expecting but it was the ending the drama deserves, a happy one for each one of them.

Things I somehow hate in this drama

Questions that were not answered
SPOILER ALERT. The main question is how did Ko Munyeong's mom suddenly live again? Was she resurrected or something? I don't remember watching a scene telling how she survived from falling from the stairs knowing that a lot of blood spilled that time. Because somehow, it doesn't make any sense to me. I just need this question to be answered and we're all good.

Lessons I learned from this drama
I'll be writing a separate blog for the lessons I learned from each character because I think this review will be long once I added those. Anyway, these are the general lessons that I got while watching this drama.

Taking care of our mental health is as important as taking care of our physical health
Most of the time we tend to neglect our mental health because we consider it as a ""not important"" part in our lives. But in this drama, it shows us that mental illness is an illness. It is not something to be pushed away. It needs to be treated so that we can fully live our lives.

Blood-related or not, it is the bond and love that matters
We can see how the friendship of everyone grew. They may not be blood-related but you can feel the love that they have for each other. One example is Jaesu. He is definitely the best example of a best friend. He is just there for Gang Tae every time he needs him. And he is just so happy that at the end, Gang Tae called him ""Hyung (older brother)"". You can also see Nam Juri's mom. Look at how she takes care of everyone! She was just a landlady but she ended up being everyone's mom. The way she takes care of everyone is really heart-warming.

For parents, your children are not your artworks
Yes, you brought them to this world but that doesn't mean you can control everything in their lives. They are a separate human being. They belong to themselves. The thing you can only do for your children is to give them support and love they need and guide them while walking on their paths. Note, guiding is different from dictating what to do.

For children, your parents can make mistakes but that doesn't mean they don't love you
Like in Gang Tae's part, he grew up thinking that he was never loved by his mom, that he was born just to take care of his brother. But when he is sleeping, we can see how his mother loves him. It's just that his brother needed more attention. Our nation's eomma once said, cut your mom some slack.

And of course, it's okay to not be okay
Just like what the title says, it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or just feel nothing. It's okay to show the world what our real emotion is. Because we're human beings. We're not robots who don't feel any emotion. Release your emotions instead of bottling it all up. Cry if you must. But after all these heartbreaks, let's all stand up together and move forward.

Conclusion
It's Okay to Not be Okay is a drama that I will cherish forever. It's now listed as one of my favorite dramas along with W Two Worlds, Angel's Last Mission: Love, and Scarlet Heart Ryeo. This drama will give you a roller coaster emotion. It will make you cry, laugh, angry, kilig, and everything you can think of while giving you a lot of life lessons. Each episode may be longer than the usual, but you won't feel like you're watching a long one because everything is well-packed. I'm very thankful for those people who created this drama. It was worth it. Watch out for my blog about the lessons I learned from each character of this drama.

AMAZING.
This was my second-ever kdrama, right after CLOY so this masterpiece holds a special place in my heart. It's still one of my favorite dramas of all time. This drama is different and unique and that's part of the appeal, it's kinda dark and yet not, it's realistic with a touch of fantasy ambiance at the same time. The highlight of the show is without a doubt ML's brother Moon Sang Tae, who portrayed his autistic character astonishingly well. I've found in most dramas featuring autistic characters the show can be overrated simply because people appreciate an autistic lead, while the show itself may not offer much else - that's not at all the case here, the high rating is without a doubt deserved. I've never been so moved by a character, and that character's relationship with his brother, than I have in this drama. Watch it for that reason alone.

The one fault I did have with this show was for me as a psychology major, the whole ""redeemable psychopath"" thing got on my nerves a bit. In reality someone with FL's psychopathy traits would not possess any remorse or desire to change, period. Psychopathy cannot be treated, and I wish they'd been a little more careful with this. I did think it was a creative touch how they tried to relate her lack of ability to read people to Moon Sang Tae's autism (although also very inaccurate).

Even with those faults my rating wasn't affected because the show is otherwise so moving and well done. It's without a doubt a must-watch, just go into it with an open mind and try to see past the FL.

Warm, funny and poignant
A drama that pulls at your heart strings and stays unforgettable. So warm, hilarious and moving.
The FL character is so charmingly psycho, her deep voice, no-filter talk and swearing are cute and endearing. The leads look beautiful. The costumes, the castle, hospital, the scenery- everything is eye candy. Bonds of brotherhood, friendship and found family are endearingly portrayed. This was not the type of drama i found to be binge watch friendly, rather I slowly enjoyed it over several days. Loved the perfect ending.

A BEAUTIFUL PSHYCOLOGICAL DRAMA, WITH A WHOLESOME STORY AND PERFECT MUSIC .
This drama is a masterpiece when it comes to kdramas. I love the cast , their acting feels perfectly natural and as the story progresses you really start to connect with them. The plot is also good and feels natural . The music is just perfect , I found myself grooving along with it every time I heard it and overall gives a nice feel to the show . Being a perfectionist myself I tend to watch only those dramas that actually worth the time I am investing in them and trust me, this show is worth your time. Its is fun to watch and has a balance of emotions , so you will not feel bored at all. The music fit well with the characters and the story. The characters are super fun and every one has a unique trait making even the side characters fun to watch. OVERALL , AN EXELLENT SHOW , THAT IS WORTH YOUR TIME , IT GIVES YOU A REFREASHING FEELIING AFTER YOU COMPLETE IT AND VERY WHOLESOME.

I rarely got the feeling of excitement just by watching the first episode. You may get a lot of questions at first but for the following episodes they will answer them little by little! We have different taste in K-drama but if you're going to watch this, you have to ready yourself to feel it, understand and have an open mind. The thing that I really like is on how this drama shows characters' feelings and emotions in different form so the viewers will understand the depth of it and mental illness. The main characters have a strong chemistry! I've also read comments on different flat forms and they are mostly positive! I can't wait to finish this faster! It's highly recommended!

Amazing
I can't get enough. The actor/actresses just click, it's like the drama was based on there character Kudos I can't imagine anyone else.
Just like the title this drama is about people going thru there own issues and need some help in seeing thru there problems. Some are curable and some never will.
This happens to be a boy likes a girl but she tells him to leave (he doesn't know it was her mother's control). He's upset, then he has to deal with an a brother with autism who he loves, but upset when mom tells him he only born to take care of him (tissue time). Then his mom dies and they want to send him to orphanage and his brother to care center. He refuses to separate and so they run away and go thru so many struggles to survive. His brother starts having bad dreams that butterflies are attacking and so every 9mo there move. More than 16 times. So he find a job in there home town and decision to move back and now the true story begins

Amazing Drama
8 episodes in and this k-drama has managed to continually impress! Just when you think you've watched the best episode yet and it can't possibly get any better, the next one raises the bar to a level that previous k-dramas (and I've watched many) and imo future dramas will struggle to meet. Even if somehow the writers stuff it up from here on (which I doubt given the quality of the writing so far), the first 8 episodes have been so brilliant and delivered so much that I would not hesitate to recommend the drama just on these alone. First time ever that I have not once used my ‚è© button. Instead I have rewound multiple times just to re-watch and really absorb scenes and dialogues! One of the most balanced and well paced dramas I've watched. The writer has skilfully employed comedic relief interspersed with the heartbreaking and anxious moments. The writer has also taken the time to lay the foundations for the story and provide a natural progression of relationships. This has given viewers the time to really invest in all the characters and the romance. I've cried, giggled and laughed out loud in pretty much every episode.

Spectacular cinematography, storytelling, directing, OST and acting. The Visuals of this drama are such that I'd be happy just watching it on mute and still enjoy it. The main leads make a spectacular pair and their acting has been top notch. Normally I really hate the 'staring at each other' in k-dramas, but these two have the most expressive eyes that I seriously feel that when they look at each other I'm interrupting something very intimate. Their chemistry is insane! This director and the actors know how to show what the characters are thinking and feeling just from a close up and slight change of expression of their face/eyes. No need for words!! When they smile, you smile, when they cry you cry! I've really been on an emotional rollercoaster.

The way the writer has dealt with the very sensitive subject of mental illness and autism spectrum has so far been very commendable (and can I just say that Oh Jung-Se will definately HAVE to win the Best Supporting Actor award, he is ridiculously talented and has portrayed his character so realistically). Having family that's in similar situations where brothers/sisters/parents have struggled and sacrificed so much as caregivers of siblings/children with autistism or mental illnesses and who have had to make some very hard and heart wrenching decisions in life, this drama has been able to accurately, sensibly and realistically depict these struggles.

The wait for the next episode for a drama has never been this difficult for me....

Should be next on your list to watch?
8 REASONS WHY IT‚ÄôS OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY SHOULD BE NEXT ON YOUR LIST

1. NOT YOUR TYPICAL MALE LEAD
Kim Soo-hyun plays the role of Moon Kang-tae, a young man in his late 20‚Äôs who works as a community health worker at a psychiatric ward. Kang-tae also takes on several part-time jobs just to make ends meet‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt usually see in K-Drama Land where CEOs, chaebol heirs, captains, kings, princes, doctors, professors, famous writers, and other well-off male leads abound‚Äîturning away from the trend of the rich guy role. As a health worker, Kim Soo-hyun dons a scrubsuit (swoon) and it just makes your heart flutter watching him take care of different types of patients. And with all the sibling rivalry going on in most dramas, seeing a character who is so fragile and sensitive towards his brother just melts our hearts (and we all know Kim Soo-hyun always delivers when it comes to dramatic scenes so prepare your own boxes of tissue).

2. STRONG, FASHIONABLE FEMALE LEAD
Just recently, strong female leads are popping up on almost all dramas. Adding to the list is Seo Ye-ji, who plays Ko Mun-yeong, a successful and popular children‚Äôs book author who suffers from anti-social personality disorder. Although she comes off as selfish, arrogant, and rude, this strong personality is also her charm (yes, her dark-humor actually adds spice to the drama). Also, when I say strong, I mean someone who knows how to fight back against troublemakers! Talk about girl power! Don‚Äôt even get me started about Mun-yeong‚Äôs enviable wardrobe. Can I just say she slays every outfit she wears? Go girl, make the world your runway!

3. REVERSED ROLES
Unlike most dramas where the male lead is wealthy and the female lead is financially mediocre, the roles played by Soo-hyun and Ye-ji are actually the opposite. Kang-tae is the poor one here and Mun-yeong is the affluent one. Also, while it is common in dramas that the man does extravagant or heroic acts to win the girl‚Äôs heart, Mun-yeong is one of the few female lead characters who actually makes an effort and goes all out to chase after her leading man. Despite the role reversal, chemistry remains undeniably strong between these two! ‚ù§Ô∏è

4. MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS
The drama sheds light on various mental health disorders, one of which is effectively presented by none other than Baeksang 2020 Best Supporting Actor Oh Jung-se, who plays the role of Moon Sang-tae, Moon Kang-tae‚Äôs older brother who suffers from autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I cannot stress just how convincing Jung-se‚Äôs portrayal is of someone with ASD. From his posture, to his stance, to his gait and the way he talks as well as his facial expressions‚Äîhis acting skills are spot on (I could smell another Baeksang award for him!) Since the setting seems to be mainly at the fictitious OK Psychiatric Hospital, it‚Äôs safe to say we could look forward to seeing more mental health issues being tackled as the story progresses. Additionally, it is great to see another aspect of mental health awareness‚Äîthat is, seeing it from the caretaker‚Äôs point of view as they impart the struggles and frustrations they have to deal with in their line of work. With this drama, I‚Äôm crossing my fingers that people will finally see and understand how challenging yet fulfilling it is to take care of persons with mental illness.

5. ATTENTION TO DETAILS
I have to applaud the research that has been done for this drama. As someone who has dealt first hand with children with special needs, it is very satisfying to see the effort the production crew made just to make everything as realistic as possible. From the labels plastered all over the Moon brothers' house, to the repetitive TV lines spoken by Sang-tae, to the fixations of Mun-yeong and Sang-tae on specific objects, I could say it‚Äôs a job well done in delivering the realities that come with mental illness (planning to post more on this subject later).

6. CINEMATOGRAPHY
One word: WOW. Each scene is breathtakingly shot it‚Äôs like a moving piece of art. The camera angles are well-thought of that every time you take a screen shot, it always comes out pleasing to the eyes. Oh, and did I mention the aesthetically pleasing color palette? Again, one word: WOW.

7. ELEGANT ANIMATION
The animation in the introduction immediately reminded me of a Tim Burton production with its dark theme. It was haunting yet soulful as it narrated the inner struggles of Mun-yeong. The animations done to convey what went on in Sang-tae‚Äôs mind was beautifully done as well, showcasing the colorful and creative world of persons with ASD.

8. OST
The drama‚Äôs soundtrack is captivating and beautiful, leaving you wanting to search for it immediately as soon as you hear them play in the background. Each song fits the scene it plays on perfectly, it‚Äôs like all your emotions have been converted to music.

If these aren‚Äôt enough reasons to convince you to watch, I don‚Äôt know what will be. Come on, you know you want to watch it now too! Catch It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay every Saturday and Sunday on tvN and Netflix (9PM KST)!

HEARTWARMING AND EYE OPENING
This story got me crying, laughing, loving, and understanding a few minutes away from each other. It's raw and real and sometimes it's scary how you understand the struggles and share with the pain. It's a drama that will warm your heart and make you feel understood. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it's something so raw and real that it leaves an impression on everyone who gives it a chance.

The relationship between Sangtae, Gangtae, and Munyeong are all special in its own kind. The love that the brothers had for each other is one to emulate and live by. I admit that Sangtae sometimes has the best lines in this drama.

The second lead was not terrible or pathetic, she had her own story and she was strong too. the people surrounding our main leads are amazing, they supported them like no other and it was amazing to see.

I hated the mother but she had a bolt or two loose so I won't mind her anymore. Juri's momma was a delight, as in all of her roles. The best friend was such a dream, imagine following your friend and supporting him like that, if that's not love then what is? He is truly part of the family and deserving to be called 'hyung'.

My best advice yet? Give this a chance.

Captivating!!!
The one thing I liked about this drama is its ability to draw you in. Each episode leaves you wanting more. Korean dramas rarely delve into dramas that have to deal with mental illness and disabilities. This drama does a great job of bringing such topics to light. Filled with funny, emotional and romantic moments, this drama is bound to have you hooked.

Every character, from the main leads to the supporting, does a good job of captivating the audience. And each episode has its own arc that it deals with.

BEST KDRAMA EVER
That title wasn't even an understatement. It's Okay to Not Be Okay is hands down the BEST kdrama I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of kdramas. Honestly if I even wanted to find a flaw with this show I couldn't because it was so masterfully created in every way. I'm still blown away by this show and how powerful it is. The messages they gave every episode, and the amount of topics they covered. Also how well they paced everything which included several mystery plotpoints, romance, and multiple romantic and platonic relationships. Each and every character had a purpose and message even if it was revealed later in the show. All of the characters had great character arcs with no real unanswered questions. Each episode was able to top the next to my surprise (the tears and smiles were endless with this one :) The soundtrack fit this show SO perfectly. AND DON""T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FAIRYTALES. The writers are literally genius for that aspect, each fairytale had such a powerful message and related to the story so well CHILLS. Also the mother storyline was actually quite satisfying. They didn't try to overdo her character because even as she was the amount of trauma she caused on Moonyoung was astronomical especially since she was a kid. I love how our perspective of her changes as we see her from child Moonyoungs memories and how Moonyoung sees her now. THE ACTORS MY GOD. Every single one of them killed it, and our main three shined so much. This by far my favorite drama from all of them. OH JUNG SE IS SUCH A TALENTED ACTOR GIVE THIS MAN AN OSCAR, AND GIVE ONE TO SOOHYUN AND. SEO YEJI AS WELL, IN FACT JUST GIVE THE WHOLE CAST EVERY SINGLE AWARD. Anyway haha, moving on from actors the crew was phenomenal. Cinematography was breathtaking the directing was seamless, I LOVED the editing, and the writers literally blew me away with this phenomenal story. They really outdid themself in the best way possible. This was really a one of a kind show that is extremely hard to find. Honestly its one of THE BEST shows I have ever watched let alone kdramas. I could talk about this show on and on, but I'll end this here. If you haven't watched this show you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice, and if you have watched it, please tell me how I'm ever supposed to get over this amazing show that is ""It's Okay to Not be Okay"". No but really, I'm never going to get over this show.

What a fulfilling show
I've started to draft this review at the end of episode 11, my heart was so full, that I felt this urge to share my thoughts about this show with this community.

At first, this is just an weird, funny and exquisite story, very dramatic and eccentric. But boy... Was I loving it.
As the story unfolds, those eccentricities, that weirdness, is slowly replaced by findings, findings about one's feelings, realizations about the world around us, honesty, understanding, meeting each other halffway, buy mostly, this is a show about love, love in all shapes and forms. You know that feeling when you need to grab a pillow, and hold it against your chest, hide your face ?and make an huge ""ohmmmmmm ??"" expression? That's what I've been doing this entire show.
Like I said, my heart is full, the actors chemistry is incredible, and I love the leading actress, everything about her and her performance is perfect in this roll.
Please, watch this show with an open mind, and let yourself fluctuate in this sea of discoveries.

Fresh and heartwarming!
This show swept the international community by storm, and to be honest, it didn't live up to the hype (for me). I felt uncomfortable and creeped out at times, but I suppose that was the point. At the end of the day, you come to understand these people who ""aren't okay,"" and this story beautifully helps us increase our compassion for one another. I hate to admit that I was kind of weirded out by Sangtae at first, but it's really a testament to the story and Oh Jung Se that I ended up rooting for him HARD ‚Äî  and I began to reflect on how to be a better human. By the end of the story, I found myself rooting for this sweet family, and lovingly remembering all the patients (both through the story and the ""real-life"" counterparts). Special shoutouts to Ahjussi looking for the door, the star-crossed lovers, and the politician's son. You were such gems, and the last episode did a great job at tying up these knots!

Some missing plot threads: what happened to Park Ok Ran? How did Mom make it through the ice? WHY DIDN'T THE STORY END WITH A LIL GANGTAE (kidding... but not really)?!

It took me a long time to watch this show. I didn't LOVE it, but I do appreciate the messages and the overall direction. The cinematography was stunning. Kim Soo Hyun is a beautiful crier, and I loved his chambray shirts (although his whiny way of saying ""hyung"" got grating). Also, I was completely in awe of KMY's outfits. If only I could pull off HALF of what she wears.

If you skipped this show, I feel bad for you.
I'm not even going to lie, I've managed to watch this show twice now in a span of a week and I'm still watching clips of scenes here and there throughout the day because I'm happy it's over and ended the way it did but I'm also sad because it ended. I couldn't help but cry and have the tears that I did because everything about this was heart warming and heart wrenching at the same time. I really liked that this show kept you on your toes, I loved that there was never really any huge miscommunication and I just overall loved the relationships between every single person. I don't really know where to start with this but I can honestly say that I was not disappointed at all, like at ALL. I don't typically watch psychological type dramas because I'm really into rom-com's but this had everything you needed and more. You have the male lead that's just fantastic all around, he's an amazing guy, caring, a sweetheart and a bad ass female lead that was born into an unfortunate life and crazy background story and like your typical Korean drama, the two of them are in an entanglement that goes way back per usual which I like :) Gang Tae was awesome, a fantastic brother, hard worker, great friend and Moon Young was sick af, she was tight to me and the brother, ACTOR OF THE YEAR!!! I just thoughtfully loved the story, I loved how it never let me down, I loved how I had to keep going and going because I just needed more.

I can honestly say that every single person in this show played such amazing actors and actresses. The chemistry between the main leads was just wonderful and they did not let me down, I loved the brother, he was fantastic, the emotions I felt in this with the side stories and different kind of personalities was just wow. From the second mom to best friend to even the hospital workers.

I loved the music, it was great timing, calming, wonderful.

Overall, I would definitely rewatch this show, in fact, I have AND I love this show so much that I want everyone in my life to watch it with me. Lol. It was WONDERFUL. Everything about it was not disappointing at all, it had great pacing, it had great acting, the romance was the greatest amount, the family, the psychological part was even absolutely wild. I binged this in less than 24 hours, I chose this whole show over sleep. I'm not even exaggerating, that's how much I loved this whole show.

The Rush, The Drama
I truly like the storyline and the screenwriting. It's for the mature audience. However, episode 4 lost my interest, but I quickly regained my focus with episode 5, and the start of feelings evolve into strange chemistry. That was a mouth full. Actually, you'll see this building in episode 1, but it seems to be stagnant for a few episodes, but the drama and the character flaws and issues will keep your interest long enough to wait for the romance. This drama is also funny. I genuinely love the acting and the character of Mr. Lee, the publicist. He's not on the screen often, but he leaves an impact on the audience with his comedic dramatics and care for the lead actress. Now, there is always someone with unrequited love... This is boring. It's not even amusing anymore with any storyline. It doesn't bring anything but an annoyance and time fillers.
Nevertheless, the leads, Gang-Tae and Mun-Yeong, are too darn attractive together in this series. I believe that's why I gave it another go after episode 4. I want to see their strange chemistry and how they overcome their past hurt and heal.

I'll have to update my review after the series end.

~It's Okay to keep watching as everyone needs Healing~
Some slight/minor spoilers ahead~
Mental Health is a topic that have recently been under everyone's radar where there are many high profiled case that sparks outrage and sadness among the domestic & international community as whole without having the true method in escaping the desperation people faces increasingly. At one point in a lifetime, an experience/encounter that unfold which would make you question your entire existence including how your life are interconnected with another and to imagine getting perspective of living the life as a ""mentally-troubled"" individual. Now magnify that in a drama and you will get this drama which attempts to tackle this same question. But what is so unique or the standout point I notice early on for this drama?

**Summary**
A detailed summary I can brief on would involve having a male lead (Moon Kang tae) accompanied with a contrasting autistic and traumatized older brother (Moon Sang Tae) living a nomadic lifestyle where MKT is working short term as a caregiver/nurse in different psychiatric warded hospital trying to escape from a distraught past that is filled with mystery and pain for both brothers. It is until the male lead met the female lead (Ko Moon Young), whose someone with antisocial personality disorder tendencies (not knowing the true extent of love) and through this fateful meeting they had, they would faced conflicts and heal at the same time between one another on how they think and act in the future. During their meet-up, stories of other mentally-ill patient would popped up ever so slightly and give rise to awareness for us viewers. Teaching us about morals as a human and how it is okay to not be okay.

**Story Stands out and Attention to detail**
What stands out in the summary I have given are that the depiction of mental illness is very well written as the director made the choice of linking the story-line with supposed fantasy-like ""fairy-tale"" with morals striving to prove a point about the reason what/who/why/when people faces an issue and how they can grow out of it meaningfully. The depiction isn't always merry and is usually portrayed in a darker undertone but after going through all the struggles/obstacles would be when the dark tunnels leads to the end of a tunnel, a bright finale. The story is very much set in a realistic scenario tackling on psych-heavy theme, but it is a pleasure to see that there are fantasies/animations/exaggerations or dream/imagination sequence which would display a sense of false reality existing within patients and we as viewers can see that. Soon thereafter, the immediate sharp reality of the drama hits us with a bang and ground us on the floor, making us more relatable to the cast and scenario with very clear goals in mind.

As of now, the story have shown great pacing without delaying the lead's interaction and showing progress at how the leads are dealing with their owns emotional and psychological problems. Each episode reveals some clues for viewers to guess the final outcome, making the story a great discussion topic to have between viewers. The fact that some reviewers (who worked as caregivers) also praise the effort of production in showing an accurate representation of how a treatment to patient should be and how the patient normally react to stimulus in daily life is an amazing feat itself to show that the story is reality-based with good intentions. There is a recurring theme of ""therapy"" session where the story progresses with one core solution to solve different problems. I can safely say that the story element is well-written with intentions and nuances. The writer have made sure that the morals we have learnt from previous episodes is still ever present in future episodes, emphasizing the fact that everything is linked with nothing being thrown out. There is a mystery element to it which was good but wasn't the stand out point and has minor plot holes. 9.5 stars for the story.

**Character designs**
The female lead (Ko Moon Young played by Seo Ye Ji) is designed as having a cranky, headstrong, somewhat psychotic exterior with hints of having a softhearted interior female beauty with similarity to Jang Man Wol from Hotel Del Luna. I have seen a title given to her ""A matured, crazier version of JMW"" to which I fully agreed. KMY is a trendy fashion icon with stunning dresses and gorgeous accessories where I can imagine people trying to imitate her high-class style during this period of time. And what is more significant are her acting is true to the character without any big faults. Just a tear droplet or a slight smile can speak a thousands more words that if actual words were spoken. Reversing the cliche where the male lead is usually the wealthy and the more dominant counterpart, the female lead here does not follow this cliche and is quite dominant in ways where she is equal to the male in levels. Her acting is perfect for her role.

The male lead ( Moon Kang tae played by Kim Soo Hyun) is designed as having a more introverted personality that is more rooted to a normal male with some traits that aligns with being a lead. Traits such as not placing much importance in wealth, status or fame but rather on taking care of his family and patients first. Kim Soo Hyun doesn't exactly need confirmation for his acting because other than his flopped movie, Real. Every single drama/movie production of his is a success and his acting here is stellar. Not only is he very handsome, he can display emotions very well where I would cry for him every time he cries too.

The other leads I consider such as MKT's older autistic brother, Sang Tae are phenomenal in his acting which largely prove he deserved his 2020 Baeksang award as one the best actor. Just the expression, the way he talks and action. His character showed great development over the 16 episodes, showing a believable yet empowering role as an autistic individual which I would love to share with anyone facing a similar situation to his. Amazing... In contrast, Juri gives me the feeling that she isn't the typical second female lead either because it is shown that she is just as pretty in her own right where she is not as invasive to forcing MKT into a relationship. Though she is jealous and can be petty at times, I am certain I would not hate her but rather like her enough to follow her own plot as their past unravels. Moreover, she has consistently proves in the latter half of the drama as being more than a ""side character"" and is quite rich in backstory. She acted really perfectly.

There is also moments when the female lead would be doing something inappropriate due to her disorder and the lack of understanding she has over the world create a stark contrast as to how a normal human would have perform the action. This stark contrast isn't as romanticize as many would assume because slowly but surely, the male lead is correcting her action in a gentler way possible. On the other hand, the male lead who seems normal on the outside faces a pressure that created anger and sadness which cannot be diagnosed easily until the female leads notices it. The female lead with her keen observation would also correct his behavior but letting him unleash more of himself rather than just pure suppression. The topic of how you shouldn't just bury yourself with work/responsibilities but rather take a time off to have fun and enjoy what life has to offer. The end result is a ""BALANCE"" between the cast where male lead preach for control and female lead preach for freedom. Together they can heal each others weakness and compliment one another for their future lifestyle.

My verdict is that their chemistry is overflowing with tension at every corner. Perfect casting 10/10.

**Music**
Regarding this aspects, 10/10 for me due to how perfect the song fits the eerie vibe and fairy tale-esque feels. Once I heard the OST, it became an insta-download from me as I could imagine the scene in my head of when the song is played. The music being this captivating makes every scene flow so well along with the music. My favorite would be Breathe by Sam Kim. The ethereal feeling it invoke right at the start and then giving you that hopefulness in lyrics and vocals. The 2nd favorite would be ""In Silence"" which invoke a desperation and loneliness in me where I wish someone would ""heal"" me. As more songs unveil, I began to love the very wacky sounds present in other OST like Wake Up and Got You. Since it was a Netflix original, there is a number of English songs available and it is why international viewers can sing along to the song. Little by Little - Cheeze is also one of my favorites!

**Rewatch value**
This is super high as I have re-watched the drama a few times myself in anticipation for the next few episodes. I discover that there is so many Easter eggs hidden and foreshadowing so a re-watch is must to uncover the secrets the director hidden meticulously. An example would be in episode 1 where Sang tae mouthed the conversation between two animated characters, that is a major foreshadow to KMY and MKT future relationship and I highly recommend you keep this in mind as you watch.

**Cinematography**
Rather than the freeze shot or the abrupt change in sequence to a scene, this drama have moving-action shots that is relevant and interesting to view to my pleasure. There are so many scenes I could talk about so to focus on one scene as an example, the were able to transitioned from a miniature bus in a miniature city landscape into an actual bus ridden by the male lead in one scene smoothly. There is more scenes you will notice when you start to watch. The color palette too leans towards beige and black so when any other color appears, it becomes shocking. In this case, the female lead's dresses would usually have a popped out color highlighting her ""uniqueness"" and show-off persona. The ""Tim Burton"" like animation is a treat to watch and is very suited for any age group to view.

**Final Judgement**
Overall, the drama is a masterful work that tackles the topic of mental health issues and heal it in a way rarely seen in a drama of this capacity. Being the small screen return of Kim Soo Hyun and having Seo Ye Ji who naturally exudes charm through her deeper, lower voice, the casting is perfect and that is factoring in Oh Jung Se who I have been seeing in top drama lately like When My Camellia Bloom. The music and cinematography creates this flow that brings you visions and run downs in our journey of healing. As I was watching it airing, I had this hope of the drama maintaining their excellence and quality to which I will say that it did. The quality have just rise without a big dip. There could be some bumps along the way but for sure as I was watching the drama, I became emotionally invested and knowing all the references in fairy tales helped. Spotting the hidden details and theorizing with fellow fans. This drama is a personal masterpiece that I have placed up there with My mister. Whilst I am not sure if you will enjoy it as I do, for you to reach this point in my review shows that you are intrigue and I am thankful for your reading. The ending is satisfying and perfect too. Happy Watching!! 10/10

I just came here to thank the writer and director for the best kiss in a drama after a very long time in ep. 11. I also want to thank them that Sang tae told the pshyciatrist about the secret so quickly in ep12.
Every one should acknowledge by now that this is a unique story, best cast with phenomenal acting of three leads, best chemistry, best heart strings pulling scenes etc, etc.

Did not live up to my satisfaction.
This drama follows the genre of romance as well as other genres such as psychology. The plot sounds very interesting but the pace of the drama is just too slow. I don't enjoy dramas that are slow paced, resulting in me longing for the climax or just the rising action. The cast is good, the acting is pretty decent. I understand that the main male lead's character is portrayed as shy, quiet and reserved to himself however, there wasn't a depiction of outstanding acting as these types of characters composition don't contain of heavily influenced acting or dialogue. Overall at the most I would recommend this drama to someone who has just started watching kdramas.

Search for feelings
Not having feelings or not knowing that you have them? It was this question that I asked myself when I heard Gang-Tae's speech about Mun-Yeong's supposed lack of feelings. I believe that many people know that for healthy development, as healthy I include good mental health, it is necessary to grow up in an environment that provides this, but that did not happen with the main character of this drama. Aware of this, can we say that she has no feelings or that the set of situations she experienced made her an emotional mess? Mess she shows in her actions that look more like a cry for help ...

I think that the discovery of feelings, as well as the healing of the main characters' traumas, is a point as or more important than the possible romance. For like Mun-Yeong, Gang Tae also needs help, only he hasn't realized it until now.

To show this ""search"", I believe that the choice of how the narrative is shown is interesting, as well as the references to Tim Burton's style. Representing the feelings, desires and aspects of the characters' lives from the fairy tales written by Mun-Yeong besides enchanting also allows a greater immersion of the spectators, as it is a creative way of seeing reality ...

I've been waiting for this drama since it has seo ye ji and the comeback of soo hyun, and so far it has yet to disappoint. the plot is great and they already have spectacular chemistry(I'm assuming because they have already been a couple in a commercial a few years ago). I hope this drama stays having it's plot intact cus there are plenty of dramas that stop being good half way through. But yea, i would say this is a interesting and cute drama so far. I'm really loving the new female roles they are making leads now a days, rather than the female lead role always being some hard working girl that is poor or is dating her boss and is a push over lol. New and fresh i love it. At first it reminded me a bit of IU's drama of last year. Mainly because the ending when soo hyun appeared and now hes in this ? Wow... episode 4 is BEAUTIFUL i cant

Not for me.
Hated the dynamic of the main couple, and knowing they end up together made me drop it. I liked the characters, but did not want the main couple to end up together at all. Usually I wouldn't mind all the problematic stuff that comes with characters like these, I might even love it (if they go through character development etc.) but the fact that Sang Tae was involved made me hate it. I didn't care about the main relationship, I only cared about Sang Tae and wanted him to be okay. There were way too many episodes left for me to keep on watching just for a relationship I don't care about. I googled the important plot points and dropped the series instead.

The acting was good though, very nice production. If you like the main couple's dynamic you will love this! It just wasn't for me. (Why wasn't it Moon Young x Joo Ri?)

t is a very unique drama that really needs to be appreciated. It was a big step to produce a full-length drama tackling about different mental health disorders. This drama is very psych-heavy but I guess people need to be aware of these disorders too. They need proper treatment and not judgement. The story is a bit cliche but they really added a unique touch to it. Since this Psych-themed drama shows how their thoughts run in their minds, I love how they portray these thoughts using animation and exaggeration (for differentiation from reality). People with mental health disorders might not be able to distinguish reality from their imaginations, thoughts, or fantasies, but the people around them could. We should show them that we understand them and we care for them (Just like how Gang Tae does it). It's good that they get treatment. I just wish Mun Yeong will also get treated. I know her character will still develop so let's wait for it. However, we must not romanticize her inappropriate actions. She has anti-social personality disorder which make her not being able to distinguish between right and wrong. This must not be tolerated and Gang Tae is doing a great job correcting her. This is still ongoing but it already made us feel different emotions. It's good that people are becoming more aware of different mental health issues and the triggers that can be associated with it. Thank you, It's Okay To Not Be Okay :)

Cinematic and Mesmerizing Plot
From what I‚Äôve seen so far the FL can come off toxic but I believe the demons she‚Äôs fighting with emotionally bc of her past is the a major reason. Does it excuse her behavior, no, but it's understandable. The drama so far has touched basis in different aspects of autism, personality disorders and other mental disorders. It‚Äôs also nice to see there‚Äôs romance, but it‚Äôs not the main focus. It looks like a drama that focuses on mental illness and the healing aspects that will help bring awareness behind them. The main characters look to have different but similar pains in their childhoods and from what I see they‚Äôll help heal each other‚Äôs wounds and grow to love each other. I have also heard some may view this drama a bit toxic or lack of plot depth. But from what I‚Äôve seen so far I haven‚Äôt seen much to complain about. But what drama is perfect? For me, I feel this is a drama I‚Äôll watch until the end, re-watch or even buy for my fav drama collection. This review is my opinion of course. To those watching, give it a chance at least. If it‚Äôs not for you, that‚Äôs fine. Happy drama hunting to all.

Work of brilliant art, story telling and masterful directing
The visuals and photography are crystal clear and beautiful. It is like watching a master artist paint on a canvas. The actors are so beautiful and the ""lack of feeling"" on their faces conflicts with the emotion the story is communicating in such a complimentary way that you can not help but think about the story frequently during the week. The impact of the way the director put everything together is very powerful. I completely believe that some people watching this movie will experience profound healing from past hurts. At times it is so funny and quirky that I laugh out loud and I dont frankly care who hears me or who thinks I am crazy. I am in good company in the movie in any event! How anyone can think this movie is boring goes beyond believe...they are probably crazy as well! This series is a collectors item which ever way you look at it.

I just wanted to say that some people are trying to give an expression that it is boring or something just to drop its view and ratings. Do watch it yourself all the episodes that have aired so far and decide for your for me this drama is the best one so far in this year is it gives a meaning to fantasies and real life emotions. It one hell of a psychological ride. Just watch and decide for yourself . This drama connects past with present amd deals with traumas and feelings while targeting audience affected by those circumstances and giving them a notion that these wounds can be healed with a little support over time. It will take time but definitively will heal

Award won leading actress
After winning the best actress award I would say just watch to see why, but after watching this 3 times front to back you would say must be good and it is, yes it does have some weak spots one the mother so changed her own daughter can‚Äôt recognize her is a reach, her mother being the head of the nursing is a stretch, the father is a hard buy, but the leads brings us a great time and the brother is one hard act to follow so just watch it. This movie has brought the lead actress to the top of the list her value has increased that says a lot on how good this drama is, supporting cast performances were great the ending is why I rewatch if your going to invest 16 hours then you need to have a ending that you can say satisfied and rewarded the time spent and this one does.

Just made my days happier ! :)
This was so well done!! The story is quite unique and I like that it's realistic to a point. I felt there was some repetition somewhere in the middle of the story when they kept going back and forth but I seriously enjoyed it overall.
The cast is awesome, The acting is incredibly well done. The emotions were perfectly conveyed. I laughed, cried, got excited and had my heart flutter in just one episode multiple times,
All in all, this drama made my days better. Thank you everyone ! Will keep loving and supporting you ! :)

I always have high hopes of the acting choices by ksh. I knew he is that kind of actor who chooses roles that suits him best though i know he is very versatile. The female lead is also very talented i have watched her previous dramas but this is by far the best role for her. Having them both makes it simply perfect. Their eyes, the body language and the way they deliver their lines is just magnificent.

The story itself is very fresh. Mental health could be one of the most difficult And challenging topics i guess to be shown in full length drama, but i can tell this drama will make a huge success. I can tell the cliche and the trauma of the leads already but they will certainly give justice to this in the end.

I have never wished for a drama to just reveal the whole 16 episodes already in one day but i certainly did on this one.

god fucking damn they're so cute. really good casting. good dynamic between the leads, AND SEO YE JI IS VERY FUNNY! She fits the role perfectly. so far so good since they're not rushing the leads to get together. i just hope they continue to raise awareness towards mental illnesses, since kdramas (esp this one since it's available worldwide on netflix) tend to have a very large audience. cant wait for future episodes! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

maybe it's just not for me
i watched this about a year ago, but only got around to writing a review now. i don't have any moral problems with this show, but it didn't end up connecting with me much and i have some ideas as to why.

i think the biggest problem for me was the male lead. i understand that him being very passive and constantly taking care of others instead of developing himself is kinda the point of his character but there was just nothing about him that made me connect to him or anything that made me understand why the female lead cared about him so much. i didn't feel much chemistry between them at all.

what ultimately made me drop the show was the return of the female lead's mom where she comes back from being presumed dead, gets plastic surgery all over her face to make her look different, and comes back to messed with the leads. it felt so out of place in the show because the show is not that campy and if they were going to have the female lead have to face her abuser, they could have done it any other way outside of making her mom this weird, campy scooby doo villain.

one thing this show really has going for it is the female lead because she is amazing and deserves to be in a better drama. i don't have aspd, but i do think the writers at least tried and did better than most would. there's a big problem these days as using the word ""sociopath"" interchangably with ""bad person"", so this depiction showing someone with aspd as being morally gray but capable of doing good and having loving relationships is very nice.

i don't have much else to say which is funny considering i watched 14 hours of this. overall good concept but average execution.

felt like it‚Äôs mocking me
The casting of Sangtae was poor.
Sangtae is supposed to be an Autistic character, but the actor who portray him is not. And as an autistic person, I didn‚Äôt like that‚Ä¶
The actor is ‚Äòacting‚Äô autistic, he can stop being autistic while I can‚Äôt. I live with struggling social cues, communicating my feelings, masking, getting tired easily of social interactions and trying my hardest to fit in, but the actor doesn‚Äôt
He ‚Äòacts‚Äô autistic and gets priced for a good performance, but I am autistic and gets bullied for it.

I‚Äôm sure the drama is grate. But what I‚Äôve mentioned really ruins it for me. I can‚Äôt watch something that makes me feel like I‚Äôm being mocked.

I tried y'all, I really did.
A running gag in my Korean class is how I am an avid reader of romance novels, but I am pretty much averse to Romantic K-Dramas. Crash Landing On You so far is the first and only one that I have loved. I would count Mystic Pop-Up but that's more of a Fantasy Family drama. I'll try to be brief, but this was a new record for me, I got 2.5 episodes in before I permanently clocked out for 3 reasons.

1. Ko Moon Young tap danced on every last nerve I had.

Pretty much every romantic K-drama I have bailed on has MLs who behaved similarly or worse. This trope of love interests being cruel until they fall in love/sleep with a virgin (looking at you After/Kissing Booth) is TIRED. No, you don't need love you to save you, you need to leave us the hell alone so we can find something healthy and won't run up our blood pressure up. Plus, I know they tried to work in the aspect of KMY having severe mental health issues as the reason, but that doesn't seem good enough an explanation considering the harm done. At no point in the episodes I watched did I think, ""Hmm, she seems really seems ready and deserving of love.

2. Most interesting storyline wasn't the main one.

I was more into the Moon Brothers' story because it seemed more realistic in it's depictions of being a caretaker to an intellectually disabled sibling, autism (for Korean standards) and the fine line between support and codependency. Would have loved to watch it unfold, but Miss Author got in the way.

3. Kim Soo Hyun's sexiness couldn't save me.

Okay, it was at this point that I was SHOOK. Kim Soo Hyun could literally read me obituaries and I'd think it was the sexiest thing ever done. I sat through ALL TWO HOURS of REAL yet, couldn't make it through 2.5 episodes of this show. Seeing him in this show? It just didn't connect for me like it usually does.

I had high expectations for this drama, knowing that it's Kim Soo Hyun's first drama after the military enlistment, but I was really dissapointed. The story is soo slow and also kinda boring, and it didn't really catch my eye, or who knows maybe the story has a philosophical side that my dumb brain can not understand. The characters are also boring af, and I can't really imagine the future chemistry between them. Compared to other titles of this year, this one was really one of the worst ones...I really hope that it will get better in the next episodes.

WHY LITTERALY EVERY PERSON NEEDS TO WATCH THIS PIECE OF ART!
A HUMAN HEALING DRAMA INDEED!
This is my all-time favourite korean drama. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants an emotional, incredible, entertaining and fascinating drama. I Loved all of the actors, Their acting Is Amazing. You can cry and laugh at the same time while watching this. It has everything, a perfect drama needs. Love the cinematogrpahy, the acting, the symbolism/ subtle nuances in the way certain scenes are portrayed...it's just a really beautiful drama. It tackles mental health in a really jarring but unique way. It's witty but I can tell it'll be a healing type of drama. The characters are complex and well written and equally well portrayed. Chemistry is on fireeee and of course Seo Ye Ji's outfits üíØ btw, osts are amazing.
litteraly dying while waiting for next episodes. EVERYONE!!!! Definitely check thiss masterpiece out!!!!!!!

I've just watched the two episodes that were aired last week. It's a slow show with an action that doesn't exist. The only thing that I liked about it was the main male actor and the music. The main characters didn't have any chemistry at all. After I've watched the episodes, I decided to give up on this drama . I gave a star, with indulgence, for the first two episodes. I was really dissapointed by the action and plain characters and story. Over all it was a show which didn't really catch my eye, and compared to other dramas that I've seen, this one was not the best.

Not for everybody
Well, I guess I'm the odd one out of the bunch when I say I agree it's not for everybody.

The first episode didn't grab me at all. It just seemed like people just watched this drama because of how the characters looked.
I learned real quick that it might have that Disney 'love at first sight' feel and it did but the female character was just twisted because of psychological issues she had with her own father.

I learned enough from the first episode that this isn't my cup of tea.

I also have to stop falling for reviews like this. The minute I see people talk about how good a person looks I just need to steer clear of that. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for eye candy but come on, it doesn't give a good enough reason to watch.

""A life without love is like a year without summer.""
That's a Swedish proverb in my title. I am a winter person, but what good is the cold of winter, without the warmth of summer to give it sweetness? Summer means happy times and good memories as well. One must maintain a little bit of summer, even in the middle of winter in order to remember the warmth that life as well as nature provides you with.

""Our Beloved Summer (Í∑∏ Ìï¥ Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî) [2022]"" is a story of such warmth, enthusiasm and vehemence; a love story that's worth telling and worth witnessing. It's about the growth, the progress and the upswing of a relationship that thrives even on the verge of vanishing. This is definitely an unique tale that'll bring all kind of emotions out of you and make you experience numerous amount of perspectives of life.

Kook Yeon Soo (Kim Da Mi) and Choi Woong (Choi Woo Shik) were highschool batchmates, persuaded to film a documentary portraying the first and last students of the class together. The documetary goes viral and by the end of the filming, they fall for each other and start dating, which lasts for next few years until they breakup for unknown reason. After 10 years, as they end up working together for a while, they have to film again showing their current situations. How will they cope up with the lingering feeling for each, as they move forward in their lives individually? Well, for that, you have to watch the drama by yourself.

Choi Woong is an Innocent, ingenuous and artless teenage guy whose free-spiritedness has made him the last student of his class though noone has been able to recognize his skills & intellect and what his future beholds. Kook Yeon Soo is a brilliant student, though self-centered and a lil unkind. Despite everyone's assumptions about her she lives an honest life by adapting to her reality.

Kim Ji Woong (Kim Sung Chul) has been the closest friend to Choi Woong since elementary who has now become a documentary PD. NJ (Roh Jung Eui) is a super-successful Idol star who is very honest and kind-hearted. Go Eun Ho (Ahn Dong Goo) is a friend to Choi Woong and his manager. Lee Sol Yi (Park Jin Joo) is the only friend of Yeon Soo and a pub owner. Jung Chae Ran (Jun Hye Won) is the Asst. PD at SBC.

Some old, familiar and experienced faces among supporting character are Seo Jung Yun (Lee Yun Ok) and Park Won Sang (Choi Ho) as Choi Woong's mother and father respectively. Cha Mi Kyung (Kang Ja Kyung) as Yeon Soo's grandmother. Jo Bok Rae (Park Dong Il) as the main PD at SBC.

The child actors for Choi Woong and Ji Woong, Song Ha Hyun and Kim Ji Hoon also did a great job. They were so cute and were able to portray demanded emotions aptly.

Special mention to Lee Joon Hyuk and Kwak Dong Yeon who played guest roles with badboy characters which actually felt like guest roles.

The plot development is steady though it doesn't look like it bcs of longer reminiscences from their highschool days and some flashbacks from their childhood. At the beginning of each episode, they show the progression of the 3 main characters when they were immature teens; combining them won't seem like a consistent tale bcs there are 3 different pov-s for each of them, which is fairly balanced. Also, some of the episodes in the later half, exceptionally, has the pov-s of the current timeline, one of which is given to NJ. Similarly, the ending of each episode is accompanied by epilogues to provide the audience with references.

The pacing is the only problem that lies with the production and editing. It isn't consistent; somewhere slow and somewhere fast. This could have been avoided but it was manageble for me ngl. Talking about the episodic progression, It took me 2 episodes and a half to be hit by the mood of the drama. The furtherance was good, 4th was a bit off in terms of substances, I felt. The ending of 6th felt like an ending of a story itself, I mean ep1-6 somehow felt like a show. And I was wary about what more is left. But to respond my questions, they provided me with a unhurried, warm and beautiful journey while the two parties go on a quest of love and attempt to eradicate all the odds on their way.

The finale week (15th & 16th) came as a surprise. Just when I thought they've forgotten about few things and are gonna end the show with cute moments and jolly fillers, they slapped me with the most important topics to be considered. I am so so so happy they didn't forget them. Honestly, I think those 4 episodes could be better executed but fine. The last 2 episodes are like truckloads of sadness and pain, they got many peak moments and tend to be gloomy for most of the parts. All loose ends were wrapped well in there and even though a lot of things happened in the last episode, it didn't feel rushed.

This is the directorial debut for Kim Yoon Jin PDnim who was, in fact, the producer for one of the 2020 best ""It's Okay to Not be Okay"". Despite that fact, the job he has done in this drama is so first-rate that it proves all the competence his skills behold. The screen editing, the screenplay management, the storytelling method and the overal execution is well taken care of. The pacing was perfect for the genre providing apt vibes; it's not exactly a warm pure romance but the painfully beautiful vibes wouldn't have been felt without the moderately slow screenplay. The cinematography is perfect; given the genre, mood and messages the story wanted the audience to catch, it was quite successful in doing that. It is beautiful and particularly the warmth could be felt through the camera lenses.

I honestly didn't know about Lee Na Eun jakkanim before watching this drama but given her experience in writing only one short webseries prior to this, she has done a fabulous job, no? I am very much willing to read the original webtoon now. Notably (for those who don't know yet), the drama is a sequel of a webtoon written by the same author and the same title (Í∑∏ Ìï¥ Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî - Ï¥àÏó¨Î¶ÑÏù¥ Ï¢ãÏïÑ!). Simply, the webtoon is a prequel for the drama involving the highschool documentary days. I love how she has focused on the character dynamics of not just the 4 leads, but also the seemingly minor supporting characters. I particularly loved Ji Woong and NJ's backstories. The method of storytelling, the monologue notes during the backstory remembrance, the narrations and most importantly the plot development... everything is so good, I swear. I also loved how she has made the characters interpret various thoughts.

Nam Hye Sung PDnim is a super familiar name among the Korean composers and has composed for so many dramas, on the top of that for many excellent ones. There are 13 OSTs in total (by the time I write this) and I seriously love all of them. I usually cite my most fav or top 2 but I wanna mention more than that...

#1 ""The Giving Tree"" by Lee Seung Yoon is my most favourite. The soft beat song with pleasing vocals is about reminiscing the sweet memories of the past whose warmth is still heartfelt.

#2 ""Drawer"" by 10cm again is again about reminiscence but with a romantic and aesthetically beautiful tone which could make you cry. 10cm never fails to do his job.

#3 ""Our Beloved Summer"" by Kim Kyung Hee is the theme song for the drama which is a refreshing harmony and pleasant call for love.

#4 ""There For You"" by Kim Na Young is a soulful and emotional song, which is known to be her forte. It strikes out one's insecurities in a relationship. I particularly loved the rhythms.

#5 ""Summer Rain"" by Sam Kim which has the softcore melody that makes your heart flutter, no doubt he is proficient vocalist. The song is a very comforting one.

#6 ""Maybe If"" by BIBI is a song of 'What-Ifs'. It narrates various possibilities while dissecting the decisions of past to pick out the regrettable ones. BIBI's pointed vocal is so on point.

#7 ""Christmas Tree"" by BTS V is an eulogy to love. It perfectly depicts the art of loving and the feelings of being loved. Taehyung's vocal is like cherry on the top for this track.

Other OSTs are...
""Squabble"" by Ha Sung Woon
""I Will Make You Happy"" by Jang Beom Jun
""Even Now"" by Yang Yoseob
""Home"" and ""Why"" by Janet Suhh
""Red String of Fate""by Kim Kyung Hee

""From a philosophical pov, love is all about giving; it's what you give, and not what you take."" This is an anonymously quoted line that we all know of but lemme assure that Our Beloved Summer goes beyond all the definitions and breaks all the barriers, in order to come forward with its own interpretations. I will try my best not to spoil while explaining this and please note that the next few paragraphs are descriptions relating to the show's scenarios.

For the world to become beautiful, the golden precepts to live by are mutual understanding, respect, tolerance, forgiveness, and love. OBS signifies how important these 4 factors are, in love. Love is love, no matter what but one must be aware of how to love and be loved, and to acquire that knowledge, we must be willing to learn each and every day out of it. OBS also shows how important its to learn despite the pacing and time period taken, bcs what matters is when you come back with full comprehension.

The feelings of not being loved anymore leads to insecurity which works like a poison in a relationship. Even in the strongest relationships, the fear of judgement by your partner is the mark of guilt and the burden of insecurities. Self-esteem, ego and reasonable pride are some elements contributing to it and I'm glad they didn't forget to sort out the lil knots left to untie at the end of the drama, even though it was late.

Honesty is the best policy- as you've heard, but my friend! It takes immense courage to be honest in a relationship. We often forget that we are mere human beings, and not magicians who can read others. So it's important that we tell things to others and also become a good listeners. Hiding is like lying to your own and it accumulates to further treachery. At the same time, opening up to your partner not only relieves the pain to some amount but also comforts your soul. This is another factor they've emphasized in the drama.

""Because nothing would happen If I don't do anything"" is a line from this drama which implies that our choices or decisions are what shapes our future. It doesn't matter whether we joy over it or regret it bcs it's already too late to go back. We might have another chance to set things straight but that again depends upon the others involved. Because In the end, that was the choice you made, and it doesn't matter how hard it was to make it. It matters that you did.

""Please keep loving me."" was a desperate call from one of the characters in this drama. We all wish to be loved for only ourselves and nothing extrinsic, but what exactly is the necessity and is that entity sufficiently reserved to elicit love alone? Well, the answer lies in our hearts with some reasoning left for our brains to do.

There is a great gift in conflict that is resolved heart to heart‚Äîit‚Äôs a deeper understanding. You just need to be willing to do your part to dive deep for the pearl. That's the greatest message ""Our Beloved Summer"" gives away to it's viewers. It simply is being deeply in love than being crazily in love. This drama truly brings out the most basic thing about a dating relationship.

I think I could be the only one but It somehow reminded me of Yumi's Cell. They're not similar in any way but the fact, that both of them are about processes and not constant or regular outcomes, is what makes both of them unique. I came here solely for Choi Woo Shik, Kim Da Mi and Kim Sung Chul bcs I have always loved their performances. Not having read the webtoon, I wasn't expecting much when the drama was still in making but when the hype about it started going up the hill, it took my level of anticipations with it and I am proud to announce that, it has exceeded whatever I thought It'd be.

Final remarks... Our Beloved Summer will remain in the top 10 list of Kdramas based on youth life essence for many years to come. The drama is character-driven and each & every aspect of this drama gets an near perfect score and the credit must go to the entire cast and crew. Couldn't be grateful to all of them for this beautiful piece of art which is thought provoking and very heartfelt. This is definitely a must watch. My ratings reflect how much I loved it and tbh it had it's own flaws whicu are in fact negligible but to be fair, I can't give 10/10 haha.

P. S. Might comeback sometimes to edit bcs I feel this is a bit disorganized since I had a runny nose while writing, hehe.

Wounded hearts: Do they complete each other?
Just know that this is NOT a conventional rom-com. Yes, it does incorporate a good deal of heart-fluttering sweetness, and some wonderfully timed comedic moments, but this drama is largely a layered dissection of human relationships and all of the accompanying emotions, and it truly emphasises just how upbringing can affect one's life priorities and decisions. It is an angsty, and introspective, yet still very warm and sentimental journey about people figuring out how to cope with trauma and loneliness, with the main focus on the fractured relationship between two ex-lovers who unexpectedly meet again.

[ The intriguing set-up ]

One half of our main couple comprises of Choi Woong (played by Choi Woo Shik), who was raised by loving parents in a comfortable financial state. He is an artistic, free-spirited and quirky guy, who saunters through life at a leisurely pace, devoid of a proper dream. The other half is Kook Yeon Soo (Kim Dami) who was raised by her grandmother, and laden with debt following her parents‚Äô death. She is much more driven and over-achieving, and very insistence on her success to turn her life around, and finds romance to be a luxury that she can't afford.

Their story begins in high school and they initially shown to be bickering extremes who revel in pushing each other‚Äôs anger buttons, and would probably be more willing to maim rather than marry each other. But since love and hate walk a very fine line, the couple soon ends up falling head over heels for one another, and they date for five years. It isn't completely smooth-sailing, and there are some rocky times as they struggle to find their place in each other's lives especially throughout certain pivotal life milestones, but there are also some glimmering and very beautiful moments that showcase the depth of their connection.

However, their relationship implodes one day when Yeon Soo suddenly drops the brutal break up card, and the reasons behind it remain a mystery that both the viewers, and Woong himself, desperately desire to uncover and understand. Unfortunately, without answers at the time, the couple ends up parting ways. Luckily, by the whims of fate, following a lengthy separation, they cross paths again when their adult lives somehow intersects once more. It is coincidentally at a time when the documentary they filmed together in high school suddenly becomes viral and they are then pestered to film a reunion version. This brings us to our current present day time line.

On the surface, Our Beloved Summer seems to be the typical ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù & ‚Äúenemies to lovers to exes to ?‚Äù trope, and admittedly how they are thrown back into each other‚Äôs worlds again and given a second chance story to re-right all their previous wrongs is no doubt too convenient and formulaic, but the plot devices utilised to propel the narrative forward were actually quite refreshing and very effective.

[ The strategic use of flash backs ]

Excessive time shifts can understandably be fairly annoying when heavily used, but the script-writer seamlessly interweaves the past and present timelines here with careful finesse by using the documentary footage and interviews in an almost meta nature where the characters are able to share their inner thoughts, feelings and motivations to the viewer watching. The audience is also transported back to various events in the past, occasionally through each character‚Äôs own perspectives, and it highlights how some memories can be so markedly different when they are coloured by individual subjectivity.

It especially emphasises how as humans, we are all unreliable narrators to a certain extent - we choose to recollect memories in a way to paint ourselves in a better light for self-preservation, or we just weren‚Äôt exposed to certain details because it was purposefully not revealed to us by the other party involved. In this drama's case - e.g. during the break up scene, we are first privy to the way that Woong experiences immense hurt as he believes that Yeon Soo has callously abandoned him for no concrete reason, but later we are shown Yeon Soo's own true emotions during the event, revealing the other side of the coin.

So kudos to the production team for how the narrative was unfolded in such a creative manner.

[ The nuanced exploration of individual arcs ]

There isn‚Äôt a wild or extraordinary plot-line here. The show is driven instead by the captivating (yet also frustrating!) dynamic of our couple and the people connected to them, and is especially grounded in its realistic and flawed characterisations. No one in this drama is perfect or ideal, but rather, they are all absolutely human and much more relatable in certain ways.

In order to hide her multitude of insecurities, Yeon Soo's defence mechanism is to immediately throw up a fortress of prickly walls around her and she brandishes stubborn pride as her shield, while Woong's is to shut down and either wallow in a state of non-functioning depression or indulge in childish and petty behaviour. But the drama soon steadily unfolds the rationale behind their deep inner wounds, and calls to attention their vastly differing love languages (W: acts of service; YS: words of affirmation) and makes it clear, the immense lack of communication that will possibly remain their major downfall, second time around, if they don't learn how to compromise and be more open and willing in their understanding of each other.

Some people have faulted this show for being too meandering in its pace, labelling it cyclical and draggy in addressing the conflict at times, which I won't 100% refute because it is somewhat true, but personally, I feel that the back and forth trailing tempo was necessary to remind us that growth can often times be a very slow and very painful process. Navigating trauma caused by issues such as familial abandonment, poverty, bullying and the after-effects from a horribly messy break up amongst other issues aren't that easily overcome with a just magical snap of fingers, and I'm thankful that this show doesn't romanticise or blow over the problems some of the characters face too quickly in favor for hurrying the romance.

We get to see their gradual changes as characters attempt to heal, or at least come to grips with learning how to survive after having taken hit after hit after hit; or even better yet, learning how to live well again despite their previous scars that will never vanish. There's a saying that grief doesn't shrink with time, but maybe, we can grow around our grief instead.

[ Stellar Acting Performances ]

Although there are quite a number of thoughtful words spoken, it is actually more in the quiet moments and the lack of dialogue at times that allow us to truly feel how powerful emotions can be. Our main actors, especially Choi Woo-Shik and Kim Dami, embodied their characters so remarkably well, and were completely exceptional in expressing the tumultuous and raw feelings associated with the fear of loving someone. Both their micro-expressions and their EYES just reflect all of their unsaid words and pent-up emotions that threatened to overwhelm them so wondrously. And the duo also manages to balance the occasional sweet sentimentality with their comedic timing so well, and their chemistry together is totally off the charts.

The rest of the cast is superb as well and they bounced off each other perfectly during several of the group scenes. Kim Sung Chul is excellent as usual in his portrayal of the conflicted Ji-Woong, who has the burdens of family troubles and also has to weigh up the age old question of love versus friendship. Park Jin Joo is charming as Yeon Soo's best friend Sol-Yi, and her dynamics were matched well by Ahn Dong Goo, a relative newcomer who plays Koo Eun Ho, Woong's manager and friend.

[ A+ production value and cinematography ]

One of my absolute favorite points of Our Beloved Summer is the amount of detail taken to craft the world they belong to. The settings are ever so picturesque including the especially dreamy and lush forest and beautifully calming surrounding village they visit midway through, the neighborhood they lived in is so cozy and quaint, yet so very aesthetically pleasing with the mix of modern and hanok architecture, and Woong‚Äôs own studio is literally a piece of artwork in itself.

The drama also employs a more muted and desaturated color palette that could almost be perceived as washed out on occasion, however, considering it isn‚Äôt the straightforward bright and happy rom-com it was initially marketed as, I believe it fit with the evocative atmosphere, and the misty tones lend especially well to the nostalgia and reminiscing nature of the drama.

Choi Woong's intricately crafted art work are hand drawn by artists Thibaud Herem, and Kim Seung Bae, and they have great meaning behind them, giving further deep insight into our main character's ongoing issues. And, we definitely can't forget the OST - plenty of well-fitting songs that remind us of the feeling of falling in love, so warm, like sunshine filtering on your face, or like a secure and safe blanket that wraps completely around you. It matched every moment so aptly, and made the watching experience so much more immersive. Every time I listen to each song now, I can still vividly picture each scene in my mind.

[ Very Minor Minus Points ]

Unfortunately, I did knock off 0.5 points because I did have some nit-picky quibbles, and I could see why people could have certain issues with the drama, especially when there was just potential for MORE:

Firstly, some of the character development.

Without delving too deep and risking spoilers, I really wish the writer had just focused more on Ji-woong's own personal demons, including his issues with his mother which was one of the most heartbreaking arcs, and also on his friendship with Choi Woong and the ""debt"" to his family for the care they showed him, rather than on his half-baked unrequited love story which I personally felt was underwhelming, weak and had no real concrete basis to stand on in the first place. Also, NJ, the last of our quartet played by Roh Jeong Eui, who has to deal with the pressures of being famous including cyber-bullying and her own kind of loneliness, had such great potential with her own story but unfortunately her character's purpose remained fairly murky through most of the show, especially when she was mostly relegated to being a third party to our main relationship.

Some other side characters, especially the cameo made by Kwak Dong Yeon as artist NuA, and Lee Joon Hyuk as manager Jang Do Yul were all fairly under-utilised. Though, thankfully the plagiarism feud regarding the former was not created to just be a one off plot device, and did come to fruition in episode 15, but the climatic moment just didn't feel as strong as it could potentially have been, especially if the arc & character had been more fleshed out and more recurring throughout the drama.

Secondly, some of the drama's own advantages also did become it's own pitfalls too.

Due to the realism invoked in the script, many of the characters were depicted to be very flawed (as humans always are), and with mistakes made, they (and the paths they decided to tread back & forth on) were inevitably occasionally frustrating to watch and were difficult to root for at times, so truthfully this aspect may put some people off, especially if they are looking for a drama with a faster pay-off and characters to fawn over instead.

So, mileage may vary depending on your expectations.

And lastly, as much as everything was wrapped really satisfyingly, I can freely admit that it was still a tiny bit TOO convenient as certain plot points were resolved a little too neatly and rapidly, especially after having had that push and pull for so long. But since healing is a constant process, even if the drama has chosen to end at such a point in their lives, I have faith that our characters will continue to keep growing and evolving into the future within their universe.

So, despite some honestly minor flaws to me in the grand scheme of this show's journey, Our Beloved Summer still remains one of my absolute favorite pieces of content that I've consumed lately, and I would even go to say it is one of the most impressive and most complete narratives that the romance genre that k-drama land has delivered.

It was a therapeutic, and multi-layered exploration of love and relationships, and it also delivered the message regarding how how the trials of life aren't actually designed to entirely break us, but hopefully rather, for us to figure out how to overcome such obstacles in order to come through infinitely stronger and tougher.

It also discusses how the people we encounter on our journey through life can change us in ways we may never ever imagine, and it reminds us to try open our hearts to those around us who are more than willing to be a comfort or a refuge through both all of our happy, and our tough times.

If you're ever in the mood for a very wonderfully touching slice of life show that may or may not have you reaching for the tissues, but will also never fail to place a smile on your face, then look no further. Definitely a top recommended drama. :)

This drama gives you butterflies.
As I am seeing this drama roll out every week I find myself fascinated by how good the Main Leads of this drama are in portraying there emotions that it just leaves me mind-boggling and a loss of words. So if you were considering of starting the show then don't think twice and start this show for it's talented actors. The chemistry between the two leads is off the charts. And the way they portray sadness just leaves my jaw dropped and eyes wet. You can actually feel the emotions they are trying to portray. The actors did justice to the script and storyline. The supporting actors also are to die for.
It is slow-paced romance drama which never gets dull at any point of time. And leaves you craving for more. The writers did a great job in not letting the story die at any moment. I personally am a huge fan of slow-paced romance dramas. But not many drama are able to pull them off. The writers have written some very meaningful lines, and the thanks to the translator of this show they have done a really good job,translating into equally meaning lines. As some of the Korean I can see is not what the English meaning is, but it fits the best and I like it more. I remember, how in RUN ON, she loved her job translating films and series, and through that series, I really came to know, translating is hard and meaningful job.
I rate dramas that can make one emotional over the dramas that makes one laugh just because I think it is difficult to touch someone's heart. And only by touching their hearts can you make them connected to the characters and the story. So do give this drama an eye. I assure you that you won't be wasting your time on it.

my beloved time... wasted.
FULL REVIEW, SOME SPOILERS

i have never been as disappointed in a drama as i was with this one. because truly, i wanted to love it. it started off well, with beautiful cinematography and osts, with a fun plot and good actors, but thats where it all ends. after the first few episodes it all felt monotonous and repetitive. i expected fun bickering, lovey dovey moments, thought out characters, an unexpected twist with the documentary, DEPTH. the initial trailers seemed fun, fresh, nuanced and promised all of this, which the first few episodes somewhat delivered. afterwards, everything was a dull filler. let me explain.

my biggest issue was this: despite all the love professions and cute moments, i didnt care for the couple very much. after showing us how yeonsu constantly broke up with him whenever she wanted, the immature miscommunications, the imbalances in the relationship, i just didnt want to see them together. your first love is not often the person you stay with forever, and thats okay. this wouldve been a great healing drama, where the leads heal individually and learn to love themselves without the other. instead i felt the opposite, like they were codependent: ung could only sleep with yeonsu by his side, yeonsu felt empty without him.

therefore I think the drama should‚Äôve gone in a different direction- a story of forgiveness, growing up and growing apart, getting closure. i wanted them to meet again, learn more about each other now that they were broken up, heal separately and stay separated. that would sent a better message, and it also wouldve worked better given the set up. if they were to end up together, there shouldve been a different backstory. all we saw initially was them bickering, which was cute in highschool, but we never really saw them grow to like each other. more specifically WHY they liked each other.
they were complete opposites and the drama never went deeper with their relationship past superficial conversations and longing gazes. this lack of depth made it hard to imagine how this was a love strong enough to last YEARS. they had so many problems, i mean, yeonsu‚Äôs ‚Äúif i leave you just come back to me‚Äù what? how is this in any way cute or goals? speaking of, i felt that the characters werent created equally. yeonsu was given so many flaws while ung‚Ä¶ wasnt (especially in the beginning) and it made yeonsu look like the bad guy. i wish he had been more stubborn, or complacent in the misunderstandings so i wouldnt have to ‚Äúpick a side‚Äù. especially when ung was defending yeonsu to us, saying he saw a different side of her: her ripping notes just to give it to ung, her refusing to see the flowers then bringing ung petals, etc. this whole ‚Äúmean to everyone but me‚Äù trope is outdated. if the ending had to be them together, then the backstory should‚Äôve been more ‚Äúright person wrong time‚Äù and less ‚Äúpointless couple break up for dramatic effect‚Äù. and yes, they matured in the present day relationship, and there were cute moments. but yeonsu and ung were kinda boring , both in and out of the relationship. i didnt ever feel that they had that strong of a connection, and i never even got why they kept breaking up and getting back together in the first place. overall their relationship just didn‚Äôt work for me. and yes they were cute during the end, but it doesnt make up for everything else.

everything outside of their relationship was also undercooked. yeonsu went to work every few episodes (to not do work), ung barely drew. and these were their main traits. rather than being fully developed it felt like they got a traumatic little backstory which led to them having ONE issue: yeonsus pride and ungs attachment. what happened to the first few episodes, to the driven yeonsu? why didnt they explore more of how she burnt herself out from working too hard? or what jobs she had before landing the one we barely see her go to now? why not delve more into ungs wishes to live a peaceful relaxed life? how he even got famous considering it‚Äôs the complete opposite of his life goals? these questions are all unanswered because all the drama cares about depicting was their relationship.

lack of depth affected the other characters as well, with them being mere stepping stones for the main relationship. producer ji for example, giving him mommy issues and a never ending crush doesnt make up for the lack of personality. and am i supposed to believe he hung onto his crush with the girl he barely talked to‚Ä¶ for YEARS? why not go more in depth to his relationship with ung and ungs parents instead, or even his won parents? in the present day he didnt seem like a very good friend, so depth is much needed. his documentary thing wasnt developed at all, even though the documentary aspect was initially what made this drama so unique. it felt like filler instead of its own character, and didnt connect with jiungs arc at all.
yeonsus best friend- aka the only character with some pizazz- was not on screen nearly enough. all we know about her is that she had a lot of boyfriends and has a strict family. ungs manager just fangirls over nj, i found him unbearable. couldnt he have been given ONE personality trait? nj pops in and out when we need some drama when she couldve been such a GREAT character. we had her tiny subplot with online bullies, and that was it. why not showcase the pressures of being an idol, or maybe even ONE scene of her singing or dancing or modeling or acting or SOMETHING?? mr jang, who i assumed would be the SML, never showed up after the first few episodes after he said he liked yeonsu?? what even was that ?? yeonsus coworkers are only there to gossip about her love life and their boss- i dont even know why hes there. i just wish the other characters were more delved into, like in hometown cha cha cha. its been proven that this CAN be done and still leave enough time for the main couple. and they certainly couldve spared some screen time. i know this is a romance drama, but there is such a thing as too much romance.

overall,
this drama felt undercooked. it could‚Äôve been fantastic, really. highschool romances, bickering couples, cold leads, this has all been done well before. look at fight for my way, hometown cha cha cha, its okay thats love, etc etc etc. this drama shouldve taken notes from those that did it well. instead, they created a perfectly average drama that relied on cute moments and filler to make up for poor writing and direction. no slice of life, just romance. a poorly written, average romance.

My beloved drama <3
i think we all have that one (or many) drama we never had in Plan To Watch but absofrikinlutely loved it. ""Our Beloved Summer"" was such a drama for me. it's calm, cozy, refreshing and puts a big smile on my face whenever i think about it. comfort watch to the max. it's kinda ironic how i never thought I'd watch this but here I am...

starting off, our ML is total goofball, super adorable, protect him at all costs kinda cutie. it's my first time watching Choi Woo Shik and I'm sure I'll forever remember him by this role (he's a softie irl too). needless to say Kim Da Mi owned her character again. all the changes in their relationship was portrayed so well now i can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. my favourite support role was Kim Ji Ung. the best second male lead right there. he's one of the nicest SL portrayal I've ever seen. i didn't get much SLS, thanks to the main leads chemistry.

two high school classmates who are polar different are forced to appear on a documentary showcasing their lives for- what i think- is a social experiment. both are immature and bickering all the time. they eventually fall in love and fall apart. years after the break up, their documentary from high school goes viral and the leads are in spotlight to recreate their old memories with new vibes. the main plot is what happens when two ex lovers are forced to work together again. we get to see how they progress their relationship despite their once terribly failed attempt. it was really 'healing' to watch them heal from their past.

the color palette itself gives off a warm soothing vibe. no matter how stressed you are, this is perfect you make you smile. imo, the comedic scenes are written and executed really well. it has the right amount of comedy to lighten the mood that actually makes you smile instead of giving second hand embarassment. multiple POVs were so fresh and fun to watch. i enjoy books with multiple povs but hadn't seen it in dramas so the narrative‚Äîcharacters pov was enjoyable and insightful.

it'd be a crime not to mention the osts! for me the notable ones were the main ost ""ÏÇ¨Îûç"" sung by 10cm and ""Christmas Tree"" by BTS V (we stan two supportive pretty best friends!!). just listening to Taehyung's deep voice makes me feel things (that was totally unnecessary here but i said it anyway). anyways, it's the perfect show for any season, as it covers almost all in the runtime.

Dull and repetitive!
As expected of Netflix¬¥ standards, the directing, the cinematography and the musical scoring was outstanding; full of eye candy scenes. Quite beautiful and very melancholic heavy, which I¬¥m a sucker for. So the experience was a joy for my eyes and ears, with that in mind it was easy to sometimes overlook the non interesting story and the lack of character development in the early episodes. But once it hit episode 12 everything just fell apart and the story/writing/main and supporting characters shortcomings became apparent. Once the main leads¬¥ internal conflict was resolved which happened in episode 11 the remaining five were just abysmal and the beautiful cinematography was not enough to keep me interested.

Should I recommend this series? Yes, if you¬¥re into young angst, love beautiful productions and you¬¥re willing to overlook story and characters.

All is fair in love and war‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ And this is a little bit of both.
Delightful is the one word that comes to my mind when trying to describe Our Beloved Summer. I will not lie, this series nearly lost me in its second half, but now that is done and all wrapped up, I can‚Äôt help but miss it. I try not to have too high expectations in dramas these days no matter what I hear as to not set myself up for disappointment and then be too harsh on a show, as it has happened in the past, but I couldn‚Äôt help but be excited for Our Beloved Summer before it even aired. I love the cast and the mature concept and good God- I just love a mockumentary format. It‚Äôs a trope that I will never ever get tired of. So yes, I would say that had pretty high hopes for this drama. And while this is definitely not flawless, it still delivered what I wanted from it.

Even at its weakest moments, Our Beloved Summer felt comfortingly youthful from start to finish. The actors, as expected were great. I adore Kim Da-mi, I find her oh so charming and looking at the webtoon, she seemed like the perfect choice for her character. And without a doubt, she definitely did end up being my favorite aspect of this romance. Gook Yeon-su is such a great female protagonist, I couldn‚Äôt help but fall for her. Strong-willed, smart, competent, cold but never cruel, childish but never annoying. She was just a wonderful lead.
Second lead syndrome also definitely hit me hard here, Kim Ji-wung was my second favorite character by far. I read many complaints about him being hung up on a girl for years despite having little to no contact with her and while I will gladly admit that he was annoyingly whiny about it at parts, I always viewed Ji-wungs affection for our female protagonist as an extension and manifestation of his jealousy towards Ung: His best friend already got the restaurant chain named after him, the loving family to come home to, how come he has to get the girl as well? So even though I didn‚Äôt necessarily agree with our second-leads actions at certain points, they made sense to me from a storytelling-perspective. Him being in love with Yeon-su didn‚Äôt feel like a plot point shoe-horned in for a love-triangles sake, it was pretty clear from the beginning on, that his romantic attraction was entirely one-sided. Instead, his unresolved feelings were something for him personally to overcome, and considering that, he felt like a more well-rounded and realistic second-lead than what I am usually used to from my K-dramas.
The chemistry, the most important thing in any romance, was definitely there. Our two leads were great together and a joy to watch through all their bickering and loving scenes. It‚Äôs hard to convince an audience, that two characters are good for each other even if you see them constantly fighting and making each other miserable but I think this was achieved here. There was never a doubt in my mind, that our two protagonists deeply cared for each other. Their relationship felt heart-warming and believable and I just had a lot of fun watching them interact.
I don‚Äôt think that Our Beloved Summer‚Äôs cinematography was necessarily anything special in terms of shot-composition but the color-grading definitely stood out to me and largely contributed to the youthful vibe of the show. Also: the documentary format worked excellent here. The many hand-held shots made this feel even more intimate, like I was genuinely eave-dropping on this couple and experiencing their love with them. The interview parts also fit in really well and were the shows main source of humor. In not many stories do we get to see the dissonance in how a character views themselves and how they actually behave, I thought it made a really fun addition to the show and allowed me to get to know the two leads on another level.

But I had mentioned in the first paragraph that this show nearly lost me in its second half. Even though this is a pretty mature and fresh story in concept, I can‚Äôt help but feel like this series still fell into all too many K-drama tropes it really didn‚Äôt need.
I loved Ungs family, they were incredibly lovable characters, but I am so sick of secret-adoption plot-lines. No matter how maturely they are handled, and I feel like Our Beloved Summer did its best with it, they always seem so cheesy and needlessly melodramatic to me. Like, was this plot point really necessary? His adoption wasn‚Äôt something for Ung to work past, he kind of just makes his peace with it without any major events, and I wouldn‚Äôt say that this detail about his past really added to his character. The whole thing felt like something written in solely for a plottwists-sake. I don‚Äôt think you need to justify a character having adoptive parents, unconventional families are definitely something that should be represented more in media, but I much would have preferred it, if Ungs adoption hadn‚Äôt been like a grand reveal or something his parents kept from him. If this was an attempt to further normalize adoptive families, I think it would have been much more sincere and overall tasteful, if Ung had simply been adopted by a loving family, aware of that fact and at peace with it. To me that way, this plot point would have felt much less out of place.
Speaking of out of place, I don‚Äôt know what to make out of NJs character. In no way did I find her unlikable or unpleasant, if anything I think she is rather cute but something as glamorous and otherworldly as an idol didn‚Äôt really fit into a story that, other than her, felt pretty grounded and somewhat thrived of its relatability. I don‚Äôt know, I have to admit that I enjoyed her dynamic with Ung but I can‚Äôt help but feel like her presence took away a lot of realism from the show.

However, both of these flaws really didn‚Äôt bother me all that much, they were just minor things that took me out of the show a bit. My main critique is something else and it‚Äôs a sentiment I don‚Äôt think is shared by many people. In my opinion Our Beloved Summers biggest weakness is Ung himself.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like Ung, he is funny, kind, intelligent and thoughtful. He is basically flawless, perfect even. But herein lies the problem: Ung is too perfect.
‚ÄúIt is her fault we broke up‚Äù, is something Ung says about Yeon-su in one of the first few episodes. Through the majority of this show I was under the impression that this attitude would be something he would have to overcome. That Ungs weakness was supposed to be his ignorance about his own shortcomings. Very rarely can you blame a break-up entirely on one person, I thought that would be something he would have to come to realize. But then a weird thing happened: The plot validated his thought-process.
It is very subtly implied, that Ungs immaturity and sunny mindset are the reason our female protagonist doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing her pain with him. That his nonchalant attitude seems othering to someone who has had it rough and I figured that, since he, for the most part, had lived a comfortable life, Ung can sometimes be ignorant about the struggle of others. But then the show portrays it as if that is something for Yeon-su to work past alone. She should just get over it and open up more. It is stated by herself that the reason they broke up was her own pride, no questions asked why she never felt completely safe to share her burden with her boyfriend. Ung never has to self-reflect. He is someone that was wrongfully left by his girlfriend because she had issues to overcome. His carelessness not only gets portrayed as something that makes him more lovable but as an actual strength Yeon-su has to learn from. Meanwhile her strengths, like her strict work ethic, are actually also portrayed as her biggest weaknesses that made her miserable all her life while her ex-boyfriend got to follow and achieve all his dreams.
I don‚Äôt understand why so many K-dramas are so terrified of giving their male protagonists actual tangible flaws to overcome. Maybe it‚Äôs because romance dramas mainly serve as female wish-fulfillment and the writers are terrified that we will lose interest if the love interest is not perfect in every single imaginable way, but it is something I am starting to grow really tired of. It‚Äôs especially tiring because Yeon-su is such a great example of a perfectly imperfect character, with an equal number of strengths and weaknesses. She had an actual character arc, wisdom to share but also things to learn. I just feel like the same thing can‚Äôt be said for our male lead. That is why this felt more like a story about Yeon-su‚Äôs growth than like a story about two people both working past their issues to rekindle their relationship. That didn‚Äôt make this drama unenjoyable, I love Yeon-su and her learning to open up was still an interesting character arc I enjoyed watching, but I just think that this show could have even better if it had provided Ung with chances to grow as well.

All this doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Our Beloved Summer. I feel like 2021 had been somewhat disappointing on the romance-front but this drama truly was a breath of fresh air. Hopefully this is a good sign and I can expect more out of 2022. Despite its flaws, Our Beloved Summer really felt like summer to me, keeping me warm through this cold winter season.

""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away"" - Philip K. Dick
Confused by my title? You will understand after you watch the drama.

Our Beloved Summer is the first modern rom-com drama I'm rating 9.5. I don't usually rate an ordinary modern romance drama more than 9, unless it has some fantasy in it. But, this isn't any ordinary slice of life rom-coms that we see here and there. This isn't ordinary at all! This beloved drama just came, stole my heart and went. Let's look why:

THE STORY

This drama is inspired from a webtoon 'Our Beloved Summer' created by Han Kyoung Chal and original work by Lee Naeun, who is also the screenwriter of this drama. The webtoon can be considered as the prequel of this drama as it focuses on the high-school days of the characters. Honestly writing, I haven't read the webtoon. So, I came here with am empty slate and went away (I don't think I'll be able go veryfar. I'll soon come back.) with my heart full of love.

This drama is a coming-of-age, which tells us the story of ex-lovers Choi Woong and Gook Yeon Soo (will hereby be mentioned as CW and YS). They had broke up with a promise to never meet again. But, fate brought them together again. They were forced to come in front of the camera and into eachother's lives as a documentary that they shooted 10 years ago, in high school, goes viral. This series shows their complicated feelings for eachother and their growth, how they managed to organize their feelings.

The thing that I loved in the story was how the story is said. The perspective of the story changes throughout the drama, which helped to focus on all the four main characters's emotions. Also, the portrayal of the relations between each characters is done so amazingly that we could relate to our real lives. This is what a true slice of life really is.

This drama also had many realistic quotes that are hard to realise but will make you stronger.

I also liked the titles given to each episodes that is a summaryof the whole episode. Though we don't get why the episode it named such at the beginning of the episode, we would surely get it at the end. This helps us to digest the whole meaning os an episode.

CHARACTERS

I have never seen such cute wand warm chacarted in any modern romance drama. In most of the modern rom-coms, either the female lead is annoying or the male lead is a goof. I'm not saying I don't like these types of dramas but that the main reason I most of the times give these kinds of dramas a 9 or below is because of the characters of the story. But, in this drama, I saw the kind of characters that can be related to real life.

The character growth in this drama is another aspect that made me give this drama a 9.5. YS was an independent, no-nonsense, aloof and hardworking girl. She was the top of her class. She cared about everyone but was forced to wear a cold nature in front of others due to her poverty. She didn't want others nor herself to be bothered about her feeling. She thought she could handle everything by herself but, ultimately, found out she was not the master of her own emotions. SHe also realised her mistakes and realised that her life too is beautiful.

CW was a free-spirited and unruly last ranker who always avoids doing works. He loved drawing buidings from high school. He was the type of person who don't bother being hurt or uncomfortable, if he can hurt the people around him. As the story went on, he changed into a more matured and understanding person. He, for the first time in his life, followed his heart.

Kim Ji Woong (KJW) was the type of person who is almost like YS, although he is poor. He too didn't want others to bother about his feeligs and always confined everything to himself. He also changed in many ways. He understood his mother, most importantly.

NJ is a kind of person who is always excited and kind. She always want everything to go her way. She is cute and friendly. Also, I have not seen any SFL who is less annoying than her.
The other supporting characters also have fully formed characteristics, which helped to enhance the story line of the drama.

This drama is all about realising mistakes and finding our trueselves.

ACTING AND CAST

I just recently ventured the lands of k-dramas. So, I was utterly umfamiliar with the cast. Through this drama, I became the fans of both Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi. They nailed their character with such degree of emotional depth that there is an intensity of the convincement that touched my heart. They are simply perfect for the roles and their chemistry made me think they are meant for eachother.

And as far as the other characters are concerned, I can say that they all did a good job in portraying their characters. Supporting roles like Ahn Dong Goo and Park Jin Joo madethe drama lively. Also the actors who portrayed Choi Woongs parents did a commentable job.

THE MUSIC

This drama have a whole lot of OSTs, which were just amazing! There were OSTs in English as well as Korean languageThe is another thing that raised my rating for this drama. Most of the episodes introduced new OSTs of the drama. Christmas Tree
and Home are my personal favourites. Some of the notable OSTs:

""Drawer"" (ÏÑúÎûç) by Kwon Jung-yeol (from 10 cm)
""Maybe If"" (Ïö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Ìó§Ïñ¥Ï†∏Ïïº ÌñàÎçò Ïù¥Ïú†) by Bibi
""Squabble"" (Ìã∞Í≤©ÌÉúÍ≤©) by Ha Sung-woon
""There for You"" (Ïù¥Î≥ÑÌõÑÌöå) by Kim Na-young
""Christmas Tree"" by V (from BTS)
""Home"" (Ïßë) by Janet Suhh
""Why"" by Janet Suhh
""The Giving Tree"" (Ïñ∏ÎçïÎÇòÎ¨¥) by Lee Seung-yoon
""Summer Rain"" (Ïó¨Î¶ÑÎπÑ) by Sam Kim
""Even Now"" (ÏïÑÏßÅÎèÑ Ï¢ãÏïÑÌï¥) by Yang Yo-seob
""I Will Make You Happy"" (ÌñâÎ≥µÌïòÍ≤å Ìï¥Ï§ÑÍ≤å) by Jang Beom-june
""Our Beloved Summer"" by Kim Kyung-hee
""Red String of Fate"" (Ïö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Îã§Ïãú ÎßåÎÇ† Ïàò Î∞ñÏóê ÏóÜÎäî Ïù¥) by Kim Kyung-hee

All these OSTs also have their own instrumental version too.

OVERALL

I don't usually favour rom-coms, especially the ones without any special elements like sports, crime or supernatural. But, I'm glad that I didn't avoid this by categorizing it into an ordinary rom-com. Although, primarily looking like an ordinary romance drama, this thakes us through a roller-coaster of emotions, without wasting its potential. It beautifully captures different perspectives of life and thus lives upto its slice-of-life tag. As I said before, I went in with a blank slate and this show truly went beyond by expectations.

Thanks for reading!
Please notify me in case of any mistakes and errors as this is my first long review.

A PERFECT drama!
Our Beloved Summer actually pulled it off ‚Äî a PERFECT drama! You have no idea how thrilled I am about this fact, and how much I love this show. It has layers and depth. It has impeccable acting across the board. It has the most beautiful, calming OST. And I can watch scenes over and over again. Heck, I can see myself coming back and watching the whole thing over to pick up on things I hadn't noticed the first time. This is THAT comfort drama. I feel so lucky to have watched along with this show as it aired.

It's not often that a show comes around and makes you feel something, yet Our Beloved Summer makes you run the gamut of emotions. I laughed out loud, I cried in front of others, but mostly, I found myself smiling from ear to ear. You go in expecting a light, fluffy romcom, but you end up getting so much more. Every episode has a clear theme that brilliantly ties to the episode title (all of which are named after famous movies). The production choices are immaculate (let's talk about that ep 8 turning-point montage or the ep 10 thematic switcheroo!). And the biggest feat of all was how tight the story was. I can't help but compare Our Beloved Summer to the Reply series/Prison Playbook/Hospital Playlist ‚Äî that writer/director duo pulls off uno-reverse-cards on the viewers in a high impact way, but geez, those episodes are always HEFTY. In contrast, I commend the Our Beloved Summer team for doing more with less and keeping every episode to a neat 60-minutes. It is not easy to convey all the depth, heart, and meaning that this show does with such limited time. Somehow, every episode offers a contained and thoughtful lesson, but all the episodes together also demonstrate progression... with overarching themes, behaviours, and character arcs that simply make sense. So many shows start strong but lose the magic in the second half, while Our Beloved Summer goes from strength to strength. In fact, the second half was even better than the first! My favourite moments in the whole drama came from episodes 10-12 and 15. The weakest episodes were 13 and 14 though; I'd say they contributed little to the story (but at least they didn't actively sabotage the story, unlike many other dramas that self-sabotage after certain plot points get resolved).

As for the acting... OSCAR-WINNING CHOI WOO SHIK DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I've seen Parasite, but this is my first time watching him in a ""fluffy"" role. He killed it as Choi Ung; a deceptively challenging protagonist who could easily become an unsympathetic, annoying or bland caricature in a lesser actor's hands. I am so proud that he's a fellow Canadian countryman and a veritable TALENTED STAR. Beyond Choi Woo Shik, all the other leads brought top-tier performances of their own. I can't imagine another actress as Kook Yeonsu. There were moments I loved Ji-ung and NJ more than our 1st leads, and they serve as a perfect foil. And the rest of the supporting cast rounded out the drama beautifully. Every single character serves multiple purposes, even the minor ones. How did the writers craft such a compelling story without any hatable villains? Everyone is so delightfully human.

I didn't expect to gush about this drama on every single criteria, but I must also point out that the OST is top-tier. V's soothing voice made a wonderful primary OST, with so many other shining gems. I don't think I've ever saved this many songs off a single OST before (seven songs, in case you were wondering). Also, can we talk about the gorgeous cinematography? The changing seasons make you feel like time is passing by. Speaking of time, I've spent way too much of it writing out this review. The tl;dr? Make sure to watch Our Beloved Summer ‚Äî it's one of the best in the business.

Shiny But Dull‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm probably in a small minority here with ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô but the series really, really, really didn‚Äôt do anything for me.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I have always had a lot of respect for Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi as they are both brilliant actors and their roles over the last few years have been really varied. Even here I‚Äôd say that their parts as the main leads remained a really strong factor throughout the show.

But the chemistry? It‚Äôs hard to describe really. I guess it was a bit lacklustre. It shouldn‚Äôt have been because Woo Shik and Da Mi were really brilliant together in ‚Äò The Witch‚Äô but it was hard to really feel any dynamic charm between their characters. It was existent but it felt a bit fabricated imao.

As for storyline it‚Äôs nothing really new or exciting per say. I really like how the series did take on a lot of old-fashioned tropes though and gave them a bit more depth than just the second female lead/ male lead being purely ‚Äú potential love interests‚Äù and having their own feelings and reasons also.

I felt as though the pacing was a bit off personally. As much it was kinda sweet to see characters grow, the plot did feel as though it had run its course by about episode 12. After that whilst there was still some element of plot, it was a bit overstretched. I felt as though the series could‚Äôve done with either stopping at 12 episodes, or at least bringing in a more exciting plot-drive rather than feeling a bit repetitive after the 3/4 mark. The ending was to be expected in all honesty.

The scenes and cuts were arguably one of the strongest factors of the series. The colors were really bright and bubbly and helped to reflect a lot about the characters and the actual tones were glossy and slick. I felt as though maybe the series could‚Äôve been a bit more creative with certain shots than just including standards sequences, but apart from that, I can‚Äôt deny a that the filming was pretty much eye candy. The OST was also good personally also.

I felt as though maybe like a lot of romance dramas with big names, ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô was a little overrated for what it was worth as the storyline and pacing were a bit tedious and dragged in parts and there wasn‚Äôt really anything new offered to the table. Yet I can‚Äôt deny that it was quite pretty with scenes, the acting was very good and the OST did particularly stand out. A strong 7.5/10 for me; not perfect but a decent romantic melodrama.

Typical tropes made special
Enemies to lovers turned exes to lovers two of my favourite tropes. Yes, they‚Äôve been done before but not like this. Our beloved summer takes two very common tropes and manages to make them different, special and realistic. Such close attention to the smallest details. Beautiful use of colours, tones and weather to reflect the mood. They dive deep into characters emotions and the psychology behind them really drawing you in to help you have a deeper understanding of them. The use of the documentary and showing us each characters point of view. The situations that the characters was in were so realistic and relatable, you find your self feeling more immersed into the story and understanding the pacing of the show more. The script, it was written eloquently! The show deals with really important serious topics; abandonment, depression, loneliness, poverty and more. Yet they were all handled with care.

The acting was obviously amazing. The emotions they were feeling I felt them too and even if I didn‚Äôt feel them I still found myself feeling emotional regardless. We have Oscar winning and Chungmuro actors of course the show‚Äôs acting was going to be good!! Kim Dami is my favourite Korean actress and after Our beloved summer I like her even more and I‚Äôm excited for her future projects.

The music was very enjoyable with a wide variety and lots of respected artist. My favourite OST was definitely Sam Kim‚Äôs and BiBi‚Äôs!


Now the very few dislikes. NJ I couldn‚Äôt really find myself liking or connecting with her character I found her annoying and out of place. The only time I really liked her is when she stood up for herself against her trolls but unfortunately that‚Äôs where it started and ended. My only other complaint is one of the love triangles. Jiwoong being in love with his best-friend‚Äôs girl friend for over ten years was just silly and it took far too long for him to finally get over the situation. It just didn‚Äôt make any sense. 10 years is a very long time for him not to have moved on. It also felt out of character. Was he really willing to risk his only deep and meaningful friendship to try and pursue a woman who‚Äôs in love with his best friend and always will be. These are the only reason I gave the story a 9 and not a 10.

Overall, this was a brilliant kdrama and I highly recommend it. At first I was worried that they left too many storylines last minute and the ending would feel rushed but I was very wrong. The ending was done beautifully filled with a mixture of emotions. Kdramas tend to fall flat somewhere along the show but Our beloved summer was genuinely good ep 1 until 16.

Our Beloved Summer; The ‚Äú Break Up‚Äù Story With A Twist‚Ä¶
The ‚Äú break up‚Äù story is a trope in rom-coms which is timeless. Main lead meets main lead, a love story ensues only for the characters to end their relationship through an acrimonious breakup. However whilst Lee Na Eun‚Äôs screenplay alongside the directing reigns of Kim Yoon Jin offered viewers a fairly heartwarming coming-of-age tale with an element of mystique , it is important to establish that the drama rarely touched upon new subject areas or topics either.

In the past Choi Woong ( Choi Woo-shik) and Kook Yeon-Su(Kim Da-Mi) were high school classmates and polar opposites. Whilst Yeon-Su was an intelligent, hardworking and top-achieving student, Choi Woong was a laidback teen during his high school days; caring little about being a low-ranking student and being focused upon his artistic abilities instead. By a whim of fate, Yeon-Su and Woong discovered that they were chosen as the main subjects (,out of wide selection of candidates,) for an indie-style filmed-documentary.

Even after the documentary finished filming , Woong and Yeong-Su‚Äôs mutuality for one another soon grew into sincere feelings as the duo began to date during their college years. However, shortly after finishing their respected diplomas, the former sweethearts went their separate ways with the intention of never meeting one another again,but, fate has an odd way of bringing people back together . Several years into the future , the documentary has become gained a viral cult -following and consequently both main leads find themselves reunited once more.

‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô is a fairly lighthearted watch for the most part. Whilst the series does run highly upon certain elements of angst and melodrama surrounding certain relationship dynamics and unrequited feelings , Lee Na Eun‚Äôs focal drive of the series surrounded mainly the relationship dynamic between its main leads.

Of course, it‚Äôs wrong to say that ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô wasn‚Äôt entirely
absent from its more droning ‚Äúlovey-dovey exchanges‚Äù and tedious romantic setups, but, in a series where the focal point surrounds a niche break-up story and potential love story ( which could either irk or appease audiences), satire is sometimes quintessential to helping break the ice. Director Kim Yoon Jin presented the series as a self-conscious reflection of popular culture influences and references. The insertion of evident allegorical homages to different genre films such as; I Know What You Did Last Summer‚Äô, 10 Things I Hate About You‚Äô, ‚Äò Pride And Prejudice‚Äô, ‚Äò Catch Me If You Can‚Äô ‚Äò Love Actually‚Äô helped to present the different emotional stages of the main leads‚Äô relationship in an obvious yet admittedly intuitive manner.


Yet whilst Kim Yoon Jin‚Äôs clever usage of titles and filming will certainly not go amiss amongst viewers, there is admittedly one elephant in the room which should be addressed openly surrounding the series; , the pacing. For the most part, ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô is slow-burn. Whilst the average episode could last around an hour and did take time to focus upon certain elements of relationship and character building, the series could feel somewhat dragged out by the latter-half also.

Naturally it isn‚Äôt always necessary for a series to have a specific antagonistic force or evident end goal. However for a series to keep viewers engaged characters can often be presented with motives, drives and personal goals in-between the main storyline to give flare or help to flesh-out character building. Whilst we did see some opportunities for this to happen with certain characters, the main leads were rarely given a more dynamic or personal raison d‚Äô√™tre as characters. ( Aside from the potential impositions of their relationship or character drive for the ‚Äúsake of plot‚Äù. ) As a consequence, ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô could sometimes feel as though it was slightly conflicted and dragged down by its pacing. Instead of either compacting the series into twelve episodes or attempting to add a more decisive plot-motivation, cliche misunderstandings, misconceptions and niche setups began to arise as the storyline entered its final part.


Nevertheless, the main cast were fairly dynamic as our main leads. Choi Woo-Shik versatility as an actor is proven again within his charismatic performance as main lead Choi Woong; a formerly deadbeat student and a successful artist and illustrator in adulthood who has shared complicated feelings for female lead Kook Yeon-Su.

Admittedly, Choi Woong could often feel shoehorned into ‚Äú plot‚Äù moments and tension in order to keep the storyline ‚Äú intriguing‚Äù . ( Incliding through several main subplots .) Yet rather than allowing the main lead to become the reimbursed ‚Äú vengeful lover‚Äù or ‚Äú cold and aloof‚Äù trope, screenwriter Lee Na Eun adds an air of subtlety within his equilibrated character strengths and flaws. He has an endearing relationship with his father ( Park Won-Sang) and mother ( Seo Jeong-Yeon) as well as with his best friend Kim Ji Woong ( Kim Sung Chul).

Costarring alongside Choi Woo-Shik is Kim-Da Mi. The actress likewise presented her persona as main female lead Kook Yeon-Su with a dynamic ambience onscreen. At times, Yeon-Su initially could often feel like a carte blanche female lead; enforced to become the ‚Äú polar opposite‚Äù to Yeon-Su. However , ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô rarely shied away from giving golden opportunities for viewers to understand more about her as a character . Her misconceptions and labels placed upon her from others, a surprisingly heartwarming relationship with her quick-witted grandmother Kang Ja Kyung ( Cha Mi Kyung), as well as most notably coming to terms with her mundane office job , did allow some intuitive insights into Yeon-Su‚Äôs persona.

From being at one another‚Äôs throats in ‚Äò The Witch; Part 1‚Äô to former-lovers in ‚ÄòOur Beloved Summer‚Äô, Kim Da-Mi and Choi Woo-Shik‚Äôs onscreen chemistry was undeniably one of the driving strengths of the series. However whilst Da-Mi and Woo Shik‚Äôs chemistry was sweet and heartfelt, their characters‚Äô onscreen relationship could admittedly a feel a little shoehorned at times through plot and did place slight strain upon the written relationship feeling natural.

Kim Sung Chul‚Äôs role as Kim Ji-woong played a pivotal role within kicking off certain events of the series. Admittedly Ji Woong‚Äôs presence during initial events and revelations of the series could admittedly feel a little staid at the best of times but his involvement in later events of the drama is provided as necessary for plot-drive.

Then there‚Äôs also second female lead NJ ( Roh Jong Eui) ; a popular K-pop idol who becomes enamoured by main male lead Choi Woong after he doesn‚Äôt fall for her charms. Unsurprisingly, NJ‚Äôs role in the series was evident from the beginning to present an ‚Äú obstacle‚Äù within the battlefield of affections for the main leads. However , rather than reimbursing NJ as the ‚Äú jealous second female lead‚Äù archetype, the series does provide some golden-opportunities to explore some more depth behind NJ‚Äôs feelings as well as her personal-growth.

Director Kim Yoon Jin seemed to have a fairly tactful eye behind the camera also. Professional long distant shots and close-ups were cleanly cut , unobstructed and slick in order to delve into the characters‚Äô mindsets and daily lives. In particular, Yoon Jin‚Äôs presentation of vivid palettes and tones stood out through the frequent usage of mellow-yellows, tonal whites and blues in order to bring about a hazy tone of nostalgia throughout the entirety of the narrative.

The OST was mainly subtle and predominantly composed of gentle instrumentals - sweet and helping for viewers to focus on dialogue ( instead of lyrics), but admittedly certain tracks delivering a more emotional and memorable impact also.

It was evident to see from the outset that ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô would attract a lot of intrigue and interest from its main cast; particularly A-listers Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi‚Äôs dynamic onscreen reunion and performances. However despite the series offering a different take on old tropes and diverging from expected character archetypes with a touch of depth , ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô could sometimes feel weighed down by its predictable setups and inconsistent pacing in parts. Nevertheless, whilst ‚Äò Our Beloved Summer‚Äô did not possess an original setup, the series was a surprisingly heartwarming watch also.

We Go Through 4 Seasons for A Reason
More mellow than a comedy-one of a kind drama that affect viewer emotionally in a marvelous way. I rarely rate romance drama with a full score or even above 8.5, but this drama made me otherwise. It reflects perfectly how my life is, especially the female lead narrative. Like the life in summer, the change from the fall, farewell for winter, and the growth of spring. I can relate to their story of pain, longing, and sincerity as if I am the one in the story. From the conflict that stop the main characters, a reason why we should sympathize and rooting for them, and how the characters change and finally getting their goals at the end. This story journey is unraveled through the theme of weather and season like a pacing stage of life, it lives up to its title ""Our Beloved Summer"" and the reason why I named my review, ""We Go Through 4 Seasons for A Reason"". Let's start~

[ Compelling Plot ]
The drama is started on the leads most memorable season, summer. It is the season where they entail the growth of love which strengthens the bond and distance between them. They start and end their journey with documentary filming, a lively concept from this drama. The unfolding between the past and the present is another 'fun' point. The stories are told from different perspectives by Choi Woong, Guk Yeonsoo and Kim Jiwoong maximized immersion in the narrative and emotions of each character. The story that was still hidden will be unfolded anew through the second half like a reversing mirror. Their past story, which encompasses the reality they face, providing a warm touching sympathy beyond laughter and excitement. They show us how real and valid the leads try to rebuild a strong relationship that can stand the test of time, by understanding the different stage of life they go through. This drama isn't only about romance, but it is also about balance between friends, lovers, family and this drama express how that could influence our lives's priority.

[ Warmful Character ]
Every season has a set of associated traits and it shows in the four main lead personalities. They are introduced like a different weather. Choi Woong is summer and Yeonsoo is winter. Both leads are a really contrast and different person with a strong similiar traits that compliment each other. Choi Woong is like the bright blue sky of summer for Yeonsoo, and she is like a warm christmas gift to Choi Woong. Jiwoong is fall by his complexity of emotions. While NJ is spring represents exciting beginning. The characters have fully-formed personality. We can imagine them as existing person as they have both strengths and flaws. Most importantly, from main leads to supporting characters they each have personal goal that determines their arc. The cast also did a great job delivering emotion in the most realistic and natural way. Good acting and good story truly can make interesting play.

[ Attention of Details ]
I found crazy little thing everytime I rewatched. Like the time-shift narrative method they used. Then the episode title that is referenced by a lot of classic movie and how it connects the two stories. The number and date details on the flashback scene. The staff also give a lot of attention to property, showing a hint of colors from both main leads, a change of hairstyle on actress, handphone version to determine era, and filming setting with words of referenced korean literature. What I like the most is decalcomanie dialogue and scenario between two main leads. These 'easter-eggs' add to the excitement of watching this drama. Throughout episode, they have hidden messages and references to other works as a little game eagle-eyed viewers can play to enhance the experience.

[ Unique Perspective ]
I must say this drama is another watching experience. Aside from eagle eyed game from easter egg they give through all episode, at the same time you can also look the perspective from their past 10 years before drama timeline by reading the prequel webtoon. While watching the drama, I strongly suggest you all to read it so you can get better understanding how the main couple grow, learn, fall in love with each other and why their reuniting has bigger chance than them moving on. The story is like two sides of same coin and if you only watch or read one of them, it might become one sided bias.

[ Impressive OST ]
The OSTs are also top one. I always think good OST are songs that make us focus what is going on the screen while still listening to it at the same time. One that remind us the scenario in the drama without having to watch it. One that is perfectly in tone with the story and our life. And for me, this drama truly has those soundtracks. When I listen to ""Maybe If"" I will remember the hand holding scene. ""There For You"" reminds me when Yeonsoo broke down into tears. ""Christmas Tree"" recall the kissing scenario. That is just three songs I mentioned and more soundtracks you have to discover from this drama. All of it perfectly conveys the story of the characters - their yearning, hope, heartache and the struggle to be fine despite the pain of their break up that resurfaced when they meet again.

[ Overall An Emotional Satisfying Love Story ]
Our Beloved Summer is an outstanding drama that has a message revelation that stays with me and that is the biggest reason of my high mark. This drama might have a simple premise but I promise, the story captures well beautifully and realistically complex how relationship work from various perspective. It remind us the different view between people and how to keep the harmony and discord in relationship balance of people around us. Because we know relationships are not all sunshine and rainbow! Will I recommend it? Of course yes.

The Pain We Carry
On the surface, ""Our Beloved Summer"" is about two unlikely high school students who are paired together for a documentary. Yeon-Soo is the top student in her class. She's driven and determined to be the best. At the other end of the spectrum is Choi-Woong, who is dead last in his class. He appears to be lazy, uninterested, and lacking in any ambition.

On a much deeper level, ""Our Beloved Summer"" is about the pain we all carry around with us. Much of it has to do with the past and how people are treated, whether it be from parents, other friends, or people from relationships. Pain is inevitable. Suffering, however, is optional. And it's amazing how much we suffer by holding on to the past. Yeon-Soo bitterly states in one episode, ""Facing the past makes me feel trapped in it."" This is because the past needs to be released. Especially the pain. And much of this series is about that: letting go of the pain, and thus, coming to peace with the past.

Yeon-Soo is a woman who appears confident and doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks about her. This makes her appear cold and indifferent. However, this is what is on the surface, because underneath, she's a young woman in turmoil. She pushes everyone away from her because she feels she not worthy of being liked or loved by anyone. The irony of pushing people away in order to avoid pain, is that the person we really end up hurting, is ourselves.

Choi-Woong is similar in his pain. However, instead of pushing others away, Woong chooses to barricade himself in his house, focusing on his art, and having little contact with others. Why? Because he's been abandoned by those that should have loved him and been there for him. And so, just like Yeon-Soo, he also feels unworthy. And when Yeon-Soo breaks up with him the first time, it reinforces his feelings of unworthiness all the more. Woong is also a gifted artist. However, he draws only buildings, which seem to mirror his own feelings of trying to remain emotionless and distant from anyone else. We come to find that his true masterpiece of art is finally revealed in the very last episode in a most profound and touching way!

Ten years later, Yeon-Soo and Choi-Woong are asked to do another documentary, due to the success of the first one. Reluctantly, they agree. However, the more they begin to spend time together, they not only realize that the feelings they had for each other never went away, but they're able to finally confront their own demons from their past and put them to rest. They do this by acknowledging their fears and realizing what's been holding them back. They also realize that the goal of a relationship isn't to change the other person, but to change yourself. And this is why their relationship ultimately works.

The world is full of Yeon-Soos and Choi-Woongs. People who build up defensive walls, or hide themselves away because they believe what others have told them: that they are unworthy. Feelings of unworthiness truly rob us of our chance of having a happy, fulfilling life. And they exist only within our own minds.

This series is truly beautiful and uplifting in depicting the pain of these two lovable characters and watch their healing finally begin to take place. What's more, is that they also learn how to lean on each other when needed. They begin to trust their own love and strength and use it for each other as well as for themselves.

I cannot speak highly enough of Kim Mi-Da and Choi Woo-Shik. Not only is their chemistry undeniable, but they are able to give us deep, complex characters using subtlety as a powerful acting tool. A look; a smile; a falling tear...all brilliantly showcased to make us feel every emotion that they are conveying.

I was also thankful that the writers didn't succumb to a ""typical"" ending in the last episode. I love it when writers dare to follow a more realistic path that suits the characters and the situation rather than force a ""happy ending"" that is contrived and unbelievable.

I rarely speak of the music in my reviews, but Kim Kyung Hee has quickly become a favorite of mine! His title song is something that I've found myslef playing over and over again. I also loved his songs from ""Crash Landing On You."" He seems to perfectly capture Yeon-Soo and Choi-Woong in his song. I can't listen to it and not think of them!

This is one of my all-time favorite series involving ""young"" love. I cannot say enough about it. The series was cute, funny, heart-breaking, inspiring, touching, provocative, necessary, and deep. How many series can I say that about in over 45 years of watching shows? Not many.

it started and ended with a documentary
‚ö° our beloved summer brought us inside of woong and yeonsu‚Äôs journey as individuals and as a couple. the slow burn romance that one falls in love to as they watch more. we felt the flutters, frustrated, and cry with them.

‚ö°ordinary that‚Äôs extraordinary. we resonate with how the characters are struggling, and how they are facing their unresolved issues. we have been woong, yeonsu, and jiwoong in our lives. we have the 3 idiots personality within us.

‚ö°our beloved summer reminding us ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a dull life we are living, but a dazzling one. in times where we felt we‚Äôre alone, there‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs always there. you‚Äôre not alone. it also reminds us ‚Äî our year hasn‚Äôt ended yet, there‚Äôs still more to come.

Drag, Drag & Just Drag !!
Please don't keep high expectations!

After completing it ( started skipping after 7-8 episodes) I honestly feels like this one is hella overrated. I was trying to feel their love for each other but I just couldn't coz there WASN'T ! So ex-lovers can't even talk properly & figure out their awkward condition Even when they have to shoot and work together? FL was so cold tbh, i understand because of her past & all but still...

And... I was like wtf when they showed that whatever ML did in past 5 year was in vain. You know the reason if you've watched it. I can't understand what they want to say/proove after showing that!!!

So disappointed !! I really hoped this one will be good if it's getting this much popularity but...

Good ending, but overall boring.
Another drama with high ratings, but I just can‚Äôt figure out why. I guess it must be me‚Ä¶ kind of like how I found Hospital Playlist and Decedents Of The Sun, again both highly rated, but I found them boring too. I fast forwarded through almost every episode except 1 and 16. I couldn‚Äôt wait to finish. I thought it dragged on and on, repeating the same scenario over and over. I think the acting was good, and the basic idea of the story was good, but 16 episodes was way too long. It should have been made into a 2 hour movie instead. I probably should have dropped it, but I suffered through it. If you like very slow paced dramas, with a simple plot, that repeats things over and over, you‚Äôll like this. The ML Choi Woong‚Äôs character, was unemotional through most of it, except for a few scenes, and the FL was very annoyingly arrogant. I gave it a 7, because like I said, the plot was good, and the acting was ok, but it was just too long for what the writers wanted to tell. Could have made the story half as long, if not less.

Slow and repetitive
Not sure why many people are liking this drama... it started off interestingly enough. It was funny, quirky, the main couple were very cute and had lots of chemistry.

Then it started getting repetitive, a lot of push and pull, the same old drama/ issues/ problems. I don‚Äôt quite like character developments of both leads. They seemed to really lack any sort of communication, even after 5 years of being together, breaking up and after another 5-year lapse and meeting again. Towards the last few episodes, we do see some growth & maturity in Choi Ung, but Yeon-Su was just disappointing. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt really like Kim Da-mi‚Äôs acting. She was cute but I didn‚Äôt like the way she talked. She seemed to mumble her words way too often, it just annoyed me.

As for the supporting casts and story, found it too dull and cliche. Unfortunate I skipped most of it with NJ and Ji-Ung. OST was not too bad, it had that one song Christmas Tree sung by V from BTS.

All in all a little disappointed. Expected much more from this, but it reminded me a lot of the drama More Than Friends.. which was SOOO SLOWWWW and boring. OBS was at least more interesting.

Magic Number 7
Majority of the popular kdramas are a 7 for me. That's how I feel about OBS as well. It is good but not great and perfect. It is likable but not special and close to my heart.

It started great with a very compelling theme of documenting two high schoolers and an interesting screenplay going back and forth between past and present. The characters were flawed and relatable and so were their actions. I liked the comparisons of lifestyles of the two leads.

Oddly, I wonder what are the odds that all three leads have issues in the family. It was with a few unpredictable twists but I wasn't particularly thrilled to know about their family issues as I only came in for the documentary part. I was eager for glimpses of the final cut of their adulthood documentary but that didn't happen. Had they even spent like 15 mins showing that instead of all the family issues then I would have willing watched it. Guess, my expectations were different.

I expected a bit of comedy and a nice breezy romance with a slice-of-life setting. The initial comedy with a coworker and drunk scenes were hardly comical. I found this to be very minimal on comedy. Romance is more about feelings, talking, and bickering. But it was hardly breezy. There are many moments I felt ""just open up and talk about what you are feeling or what went wrong"". I didn't like how they got into a relationship without proactively discussing what went wrong. Yes, they were constantly pinning for each other, but getting back with an ex without resolving past issues is low-key problematic.

Character-wise, I can see what they were trying to portray: toppers don't necessarily become achievers and last rankers don't necessarily end up as mediocre. But I felt ML had more luck than most of all would have, to get rich and good parents and to have talent and to actually put that talent to succeed whereas FL was poor, had no parents, was hardworking, and got some job. I think this characterization felt forced and it more made me feel that ML was very lucky and despite his issues, I couldn't feel empathy for him. Also, there are these moments where ML gives up on something very easily whereas FL had been working very hard for a similar thing. For instances like these, I couldn't look past their jarringly different notions on life, money, and stuff. But of course, I'm looking into too much but on the superficial level, they are interesting characters. Likewise, FL opening up about her issues could have done better. She rarely got her cathartic ""baring it all"" moment of showing her vulnerable side in the relationship and if at all done, was hurried through. Ji Ung deserved so much more than the closure he was given. Rarely was anything shown about his mother's actual reason, and his occasional rudeness to Ung felt quite random.

The pacing felt good up to episodes 10 or 11 after which I was constantly skipping scenes and 2Xing. Similar to most of the kdramas losing their charm around 10 -12 episodes, OBS ran out of stuff to talk about. Maybe they could have added nice flirty scenes but their chemistry felt cute and okayish for me.

I really wanted to see CWS in a nice rom-com as a nice guy so that wish has come true. As for KDM, she felt reminiscent of her Itaewon Class character sometimes. I will be rooting for KSC henceforth. RJE's voice is really nice.

Would I rewatch the scenes during their school days? Likely. Would I rewatch adult life or romance scenes? Meh.

As for music, it was good and suited to the theme of the drama. But I won't bother about adding it to my playlist.

OBS feels intriguing as the Youthood but immemorable as time passes by.

Over hyped Drama... ‚îê( Àò_Àò)‚îå

Sorry I'm NOT sorry !

I had very big expectation for this Drama. I am very disappointed.

It‚Äôs unbearable to see female lead be so rude to her ex when she‚Äôs the one who broke his heart.I know there‚Äôs more info that revealed about her life but I can‚Äôt imagine male lead really wanting to be with someone who lied and broke his heart and never apologized. No interest in their romance.

And when I tried to watch it till the end..
I was just speechless, how could they concluded at last that whatever male lead achieved was all just waste ? They bragged about how he is famous artist , giving live demo for such a great building, his paintings are very admirable , a celebrity is fan of his work & his paintings are EXPENSIVE and of soo much value . Then at last they're showing that someone told him that his paintings are nothing but ""JUST EMPTY "", A child who's Trapped in his own world ? And they're showing that whatever he did was all meant nothing to him ? ( Okay... they're trying to show us , he didn't know what he likes, what he wants to do in his life and he was just doing it without any meaning..does that make sense? NO !!
As an art lover myself I strongly believe that they just ruined the half meaning of this drama by showing this kind of story!
I was trying to complete this boring drama because of their boring romance, where I feel no emotions but at last I'm watching this ?
I'm just Disappointed

At last ...This story so far has no pull so they are manufacturing it by slicing and dicing the scenes and jumbling them so the audience cannot figure out what's going on.
The more I think of it, it is becoming more and more frustrating.

God knows why people are loving this drama ! There are more good dramas related to this kind of content.

Strong start until ep6. Then things gradually go down.
The velocity of good start got me high until ep6. After I figured out that this story has no more element than a love story between two grudged exes, my curiosity and interest levels decreased. There's no more interesting conflict, so things are flattening down along the way. I had no more interest to watch this until the end after finishing ep12, esp. when being compared with Snowdrop that is on air during the same time and kind of competes for the audience's attention. I came to watch it until the end, though. After the last ep has broadcasted, I came to pay my due. And yeah... I was right, it isn't interesting anymore after ep12.

In terms of acting, I don't feel the character of grown-up Yeon Soo in Dami. Grown-up Yeon Soo portrayed by Dami was intentionally stern and kind of melodramatic. I'm not very satisfied with Dami's acting. Come to think of it, she also felt off in Itaewon Class. Among the three main leads in Itaewon Class, Dami was the weakest (her character was more challenging to act than the 2nd female lead, though.) Anyway, naughty, young Yeon Soo in Our Beloved Summer was still fun and enjoyable to watch. Only the grown-up version that was lacking. For Choi Woo Shik here, his acting was also off from scene to scene. All in all, I don't feel the lover vibes between them. Toward the end, they started to kiss a lot, and I felt nothing in their kisses at all.

Warm, Mesmerizing love story worth watching ...
I'm already missing this beloved drama ,What a ride this show was..

A unique love story worth watching. Every broken love story deserves a second chance. Our Beloved summer is one of the warm, mesmerizing, calm, beautiful drama that you will watch. This show never disappoints you from beginning to end(except 9th and 10th episode with minor flaws), some scenes are so wonderfully written that it hits hard deep inside your emotions which are so relatable to our lives.

Amazing star cast a big kudos for Choi woo shik and kim da mi for beautifully portraying their warm emotions all along. Supporting cast is also good.
Drama is very well written and directed, but has minor errors in middle.
Ost's were THE BEST in this drama.

Lastly my favorite line ""Everyone has unforgettable memories from a certain year of their life .They cherish those memories so much that it lasts a lifetime""

Give it a try ,this drama is worth watching..

soft, warm and cosy - a must watch!
usually i give romance dramas a high rating based on how much i loved the main couple since that's the main focus of those dramas but i still gave this one 10/10 even tho the couple weren't my personal fav (they are still very cute tho!!) which i believe, is very telling of how good it was overall.

the cinematography, characterization, writing, acting all of these other elements are what really knocked it out of the park for me. there weren't any scenes with side characters that i wanted to skip to get to the mains and i genuinely really liked all of them from yeonsu's best friend to ung's manager to jiung and nj (at first i didn't expect to like them as much as i did but i think each character was given depth and were made likable) and ung's parents were so cute i loved them.

i also enjoyed the development of the main couple's storyline and i was invested since the very beginning (THE ANGST IS SO GOOD W/ THE EXES-TO-LOVERS TROPE) and their chemistry was great like when they get together again their acting is so natural it did feel like they were people that had dated for a long time in the past so there wasn't that awkward phase once they started dating again. the flashbacks to the past when they were dating were so sweet and made me root for them even more as a couple!

i really liked the documentary style of the show with each episode starting with a narrative which gives you an insight to a character's backstory. the atmosphere gives winter, snuggled up in your blanket, wanting to watch something light and cosy and this being the perfect watch vibes. even though it's a slower drama i didn't find it boring at all or like it was dragging on. also, saying it's slow does not by any means mean that it wasn't fun since i do think there were some genuinely funny scenes as well so it delivers in the comedy aspect as well as the emotional aspect. i could go and on about this show it's so good imo but i don't want to give too much away.

if reading this review makes you think a show like this is for you i whole-heartedly recommend our beloved summer!!

A MUST WATCH DRAMA!
Our Beloved Summer is such a wonderful drama... Its a masterpiece.

The plot is about lovers that broke up and ends up getting involved to each other.
It shows how they overcome the sadness and sufferings. This drama has many lessons to learn.

The cast are perfect for the role. There chemistry is no joke. They conveyed their feelings so well. And also the OST's are good. Im actually thinking of buying the OST Album.

This drama set my standards in men so high.
Choi Ung is the best!!!
And the second male and female leads are too nice to hate.

Watch this drama now or you'll regert not watching it earlier.

Beloved Indeed <3
Where to start, this show was amazing!! I've been waiting for this show since the description was put on MDL and I was not disappointed. This show was beautiful from the characters to the music :)

Story: It's great! We see many different stages of the main couple (enemies to lovers in school, dating, post-break up, when they meet again, and rekindled/back together). The writers do a good job telling the story of the 2 main characters which I appreciate. You see that neither of them are bad people, just lonely.
- It's also more on the slow-paced side but it makes the show even more meaningful and beautiful.
- I will say this show gives of lowkey melo vibes rather than rom com. There are many comedic moments but the emotional and tension-filled might be more prevalent to you like it was for me... I still love the show and I laughed and smiled a lot but just a mini heads up hehe
- I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of the love square but not enough for me to knock it down from a 10/10

Acting/Cast: This is my 1st time watching Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Shik and they were amazing!! Their chemistry was great and they embodied their characters :) All the other characters were equally great and I loved seeing some actors again like our favorite best friend Park Jin Joo, and Jeon Hye Won. Also, Ung's Parents have to be some of the best Dramaland parents I've seen, they were wonderful.

Music: Absolutely one of my favorite drama osts, it's stellar!!! My favorite is ""Maybe If"" by BIBI <3

Rewatch Value: I don't rewatch shows because I have a long watchlist lol but if I did ""Our Beloved Summer"" would be on the list, especially the couple moments :)

Overall, this show was soothing and I loved watching Ung and Yeon Su find their way back to each other. I recommend this show if your a fan of any of the cast, enjoy aesthetically pleasing shows, or looking for a good story & soundtrack! If you're not a fan of slow-paced shows this one might not be for you but I think it's still worth checking out, Happy watching!! :)

Everything is just perfect.
For the first time in my life, I actually found that one drama that I absolutely love. This drama has everything, great directing, great camerawork, great acting, great setting, great story, great characters. Just everything.

I begin watching this drama with no expectation at all, I just think it's gonna be another feel-good drama and nothing seems special about it. But I'm totally wrong, this drama started in a very special way, they begin with a flashback when the main characters are still in high school, shooting a documentary about their lives as top ranked student and worst student in school. It may not sound spectacular, but the way they made this summer-flashback-highschool scene is brilliant. They perfectly portrayed the personality and the whole nature of our main characters when they're still young and later show how much different they are to their present-day self (light spoiler: they're not different at all „Öã„Öã).

The way they use color in this drama is absolutely beautiful, you will feel the warmth of summer and the coldness of winter and the way they combined it with parallel editing give us this beautiful contrast between the past and the present. And let's not forget about the beautiful camerawork, everything just blends together perfectly.

The acting...what can I say? Choi Woo-Shik and Kim Da-Mi is just the top tier actor/actress in Kdrama right now, they totally owned their characters. Their subtle expression is just perfect, I never saw any actor/actress that can be nearly as good as them at this kind of subtle or micro expression, their characters felt really humane because of that.

The last but not least, the OSTs. The OSTs for this drama is PACKED with talent, V's ""Christmas Tree"" is absolutely beautiful and fits really well with a lot of scenes in this drama. BIBI‚Äôs ""Maybe if"" is just *chef kiss, and 10cm just being a romcom OST king as usual with his new song ""Drawer"", his voice is a must in a romance drama.

TL;DR. Just watch this, please. It's my first 10/10 drama and I'm really picky with my ratings. I guarantee it will be a great ride all the way to the end, enjoy.

None of the other romcoms can compare to this drama !
It's been a while since I've written a review and this drama is literally so much worth my time writing it.
Love, family, life struggles, self-love, this drama contains it all. From laughter to tears, it made me go through so much emotions by its realistic depiction of the struggles one faces in life and by the hilarious situations faced by the characters. Its plot keeps you going from beginning to end, the depth of each character is captivating. The actors and actresses did such a good job ! Especially the one who played Choi Ung, his performance amazed me. I literally fell in love with Ji-Ung and every character, they all had an interesting personality, and were far from your typical drama-like characters with predictable reactions.

I think I can say that this drama made me fall in love with love, envying the deep relationship between two people whose lives were always intertwined together. If you didn't believe in soulmates or in the saying that opposites attract then this drama will make you change your beliefs 'cause oh god, Choi Ung and Yeon-su are literally made for each other. I'm still in daze from watching it and I can't believe it's over, I'm on my way to watch it a second time because it remains one of the best 2021 dramas and one of the best dramas in my heart (as cringey as it sounds).

If you're looking for an unique type of dramas or an unique plot with romance and sweet bickering then this is for you ! But also take a box of tissues, you might be moved sometimes !

Holy! My first 10/10 for a Kdrama I thought I would not like it.
Anyone who is like me hate to watch kdramas of when exes get back together? Well, I like to watch it now thanks to Our Beloved Summer.

When Our Beloved Summer is ongoing - I have seen A LOT of people drop it and now reading some reviews says it all. They hate one or the other character but not both and it is proven if you read some reviews of Our Beloved Summer. The funny thing is - they are both in the wrong. It teaches us a lot of life lessons (not just relationships). The most important thing in a relationship is communication (as well as understanding). If you hate one or the other character but not both then you really should think again (I'm sorry). You have to put yourself in both of the characters' shoes to understand the situations. If you still see one is right and the other is wrong - watch it till the end, you will understand why. Treasure the youth and everyone, record every moment, things will bound to get better whether sooner or later, don't set the wall on yourself or on the people you loved and our growth of the journey.

Man, the casts - Choi WooShik and Kim Dami (any The Witch Part 1: Subversion's fans here?) like the usuals - perfect and powerful duo (hopefully, I can see more of them acting together in the future). Their chemistry is awesome as are the other cast members! I actually watched Our Beloved Summer was for the casts and my favourite webtoon artist (the one who brings Our Beloved Summer alive) but stay for the story, casts, music and everything about Our Beloved Summer.

The osts - in my opinion, the only kdrama with ALL OSTS that are that good. By far I love ""Kim Kyung Hee - Our Beloved Summer"" the most. The settings are set in all 4 seasons even though the title says only summer and that is beautiful. Additionally, from the school years to adulthood - I love every moment of it. The ending makes me happy and refreshed, I hope it does the same to any of you who is going to watch! Definitely going to rewatch it when I hit the darkest part of my life or when I need to feel refreshed haha

P.s. - go check out the webtoon! The author has made another masterpiece called ""Spirit Fingers""!

Not often you can experience a drama like this....!

Our Beloved Summer simply one of the best romantic melodrama released recently. At first 3 episodes i thought of little bored because of the documentry scenes and everything looks so boring. But after that i think from the 4th episode onwards it slowly getting more and more interesting. I found something particularly new from this drama, That was the beautiful character voice narration that happens almost all episodes.

An episode before ended with something curious or interesting and after that the starting of the next episode will be with a voice narration of a character, every time all the 4 main character has something to say. And it was so beautiful and very refreshing to hear and understand their part of story in the drama. For me personally i like the 2nd ung's character. His life and everything he went through was really touching to watch. Not often you can see that in a kdrama, the development of that character the relationship with his mother his friend and their parents everything was so heartwarming and interesting.

After that definitely kim da mi's side of story. Her mature decision making and powerful behaviour and handling of situation was one of the highlight of the drama, also the hidden emotions, and ofcourse you cannot miss our main hero ung. Brilliantly narrated everything about him. Also the 2nd heroine NJ. She has a small screen space but even though she also has so many reality to say.

Our beloved summer simply a must watch kdrama. Its not just a romantic drama. It has many things to discuss to you. The development of characters relationships and mature romance and beautiful intense moments that captures makes this a different drama. You must try this for sure. Don't stop after the first few episodes because there is so much things waiting for you after that. Enjoy watching..

Summer comes back better sometimes
One thing I love about Korean shows is how they display the difference in the lives of those who are rich and those who are poor - the way money restricts our ambitions and controls our choices. I really liked how that was subliminally embedded within the show and explaining how that affected things. The relationship chemistry between the two lead actors was superb and the confusion was sincere and well-constructed. So many times I watch a show where it's very obvious that the two like each other but they're too blind to see it. But in this one, the confusion is born from a lack of communication and inability to read each other, which is established early on as a fault and flaw amongst both of them. Therefore, when they kept misreading each other, I liked that.

I'm quite done with Kdrama love triangles but this one wasn't too cliched and cheesy, so I can give it that. The side characters were rather well-written both in having their own motivations and how they interacted with the show's main characters.

I must talk about the music. There are a few shows which have grabbed me through their music: Hotel Del Luna, My Mister, It's Okay to Not be Okay, Because this is my First Life and now this. The OST in this is quite beautiful and I cannot emphasise this enough. I would recommend this show to everyone.

The summer you will all love!
This new kdrama is getting noticed by everyone, and all the success it's having is well deserved! Who knows, maybe it will become one of the most popular series of 2022? I wish it will.

The story revolves around Choi Ung, a nationally renowned illustrator and Kook Yeon-soo, a public relations expert. Both are 29 years old, both are unhappy and both were madly in love with each other until 5 years ago... at least until they became just one another's ex. For this reason when they broke up they promised to never see each other again, but fate will not be on their side: in fact, during their last year of high school, they shot a documentary together and, after ten years, that documentary is gone viral, so much that fans ask for it to continue to see how the two protagonists are now. So the production house decides to please them. At first it will not be easy to convince Ung and Yeon to participate, but then things will start to take a different direction.

Reading the plot, you might think it's a simple love story, but I assure you that it's not! The feelings in this kdrama are transported from the screen to the viewer's heart, because they are feelings that we have all experienced at least once in our life: regret not having done something, fear of opening up to the other person. This was possible above all thanks to the skill of the two protagonists, played by Choi Woo-shik (yes, the one from ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù) and Kim Da-mi (you can find her in ‚ÄúItaewon Class‚Äù). They have crazy chemistry on screen, and they managed to make us poor viewers participate in their sentimental dramas too! In addition to this I feel I want to underline the beauty of the soundtrack, which made me shed many (too many) tears and the tenderness of some scenes that you absolutely must not miss, so run and see it, you will not regret it!

fluffed romance with some twist
‚óèFIRST IMPRESSION
How was I in my school days I wish I had some photographs of me. its so cool if you have some videos or photos of your school time. with friends. i just have all classmate pics which were given by school, and its enough for me to get nostalgic.

‚óèSTORY
The story shows the leads persnality clash since the school days as they are polar oppsite. FL is like running in a competition to exel in her future. ML is simple who lives in present without a worry enjoying the nature.
But the two meet again as the time has brought the two together once again.

‚óèPLOT VIEW
This plot I have seen in many dramas about high school students who turn couples in their adulthood.not just in dramas but in real life too. But this story is diabetic sweet with so many heartwarming and humorous moments. Because its the leads are polar opposite bickering couple. But they create a magical chemistry which is worth watching. Leads set aside their differences and fall in love again understanding the life and its beauty.
It also shows how good grades topper student shows an instance of a good future. And art is seen as a low grade to people with no future. That really needs a change.
Since the start of series it has a pace and surprising events, which is engaging and always make one wait for the next episode. Well am beingeing this because its difficult to resist from watching the next episode

‚óèACTING/CAST
CWS is the guy next door, who is unattractive, lazy but is kind and enjoys life. He lives his passion and not in any competiotion. CWS as choi Ung is the perfect. I cant take anyone else for this role. The heatwarming epression he delivers is crazy rich with his innocent curvy smile and shy eyes.
KDM is a tough stubborn character. But she looks so beautiful with long hair since I last saw her in Itaewon class. The resilient and cold character suited her as she doesnt smile a lot and has a lot of vigor in her eyes.

‚óèMUSIC
The OST‚Äôs are soulful. They enhances the mood of the scene and remains in the mind for a long time.

‚óèREWATCH
Yes am definetely rewatching this. It just reminds me of my first love.

‚óèAPPRECIATION
The color palette of scene is so eye-pleasing
The lighting of the rooms, dim, dark has a feeling and mood.
The sketches of CWS is picked carefully and everyone is lovely to see.

‚óèFAV SCENE
Well, there are many and it's difficult to choose one.
I would pick the brooming scene from episode 2

‚óèQUOTES
I love things that don't change but people change or disappear over time

‚óèAFTERTHOUGHT
A fluffy yet emotional love story.

The drama gave me butterflies, making me want to love and be loved again.
I waited until the end of this drama before continuing to watch it, and boy was I not disappointed. I completed the drama in one day. The story and its characters completely absorbed me. However, it is not perfect, as the majority of people claim. The couple's relationship is highly poisonous. In their youth, the girl was extremely immature; the boy was content with what he had and lacked ambition for the future. Although they had valid reasons for their behavior, they never communicated effectively. As the story prgresses, character build up is shown. I'm pretty pleased with the ending, though it may appear a little rushed.

Who said that this was comedy? just who? who?? hehe
I won't accept this as comedy, I'll consider this a half romance hehe, this is really sad and emotional there are funny scenes but actually it is full of sad stories. This drama is not that sweet but I would say one of the warmest drama I've ever watched. Honestly, I started watching this because I thought it was comedy and sweet romance but after watching the first half, I am disappointed because the pace is so slow like the atmosphere between the characters stays the same. But now that I finished it, my view on it really changed, I realised that I watched it not for romantic scenes or sweet or kiss scenes but because of the story itself.

This drama depicts the story of three friends (Ji-ung, Choi Ung and Yeonso). The story revolves about relationships, family and career. The focus of this is they showed how rough is the relationship of Ung and Yeonso, they showed how did they became enemy because of the bittersweet past relationship but as the story goes, they gave in and face their hearts than living their past. They became lovers again who supports and understand each other til' the end.

Another view of it is the story of Yeonso. She grew up without friends because of the fear that she can't treat them like they do to her because she is living really poor. She is parent less and only have her grandma to be with. They faced so much hardship together, financially, and the poor health of her grandma. That was actually the reason she broke up with Ung because her grandma got sick they need to leave their house and they are really financially challenged and that made her the most to feel the pain in that break up. She suffered silently and put all the sadness in her hearts for all the years.

Next is the story of Ung. He isn't poor and he had his two parents that is why they thought that he has a good life. Behind that, ever since he was a kid, he knows that he was adopted, they picked him up on the streets, and because they treat him really good, Ung needs to keep that he knew it but tried to make them happy. He isn't ambitious but really scared disappointing his parents. He was also troubling in his future as an artist because he realised his dream a little bit late that is why he is questioned on his talent because he didn't finished school. And of course he was also so much in pain because of the sudden and no reason break up from Yeonsu.

And lastly, Ji-ung the sad boy because Yeonsu liked Ung not him but he is not evil, he stayed friends with them. ji-ung's life is really sad, he is living a broken family and being neglected by his mother. He never felt that love from a family even though Ung's parent took care of him but he still needs attention from his mother. I never experienced this and I'm really scared to feel what he felt.

These 3 characters have common thing, because of their past and painful memories, they isolated themselves and they never tried to go out of their world and the good thing is they all realised it at the end.

This drama is really so sad but it still cute and adorable because of Ung and Yeonsu (they are really cute that I would like to pinch their faces hehe). And also I will not forget the one who made it funny even with the sadness our supporting roles Mr manager and Sol-i the friend.

There are other side stories but those that I mentioned are the focus.
I really don't like it at first but I love it now.
So, just click the button and watch it now, if you are not satisfied with the first half continue it and you will find out how good it is at the 2nd half. Although I don't want to re-watch because it is really so sad.

WATCH IT NOW!!

Magic unveil on 2nd watch - Power of Perceptive
I have to admit that I thought this drama was just so-so after I first watched it. Was expecting more of the typical light-hearted romantic-comedy dramas with occassional splashes of comedic scenes thrown in, but was slightly disappointed by it falling short of my expectation. (Please read till the end of the review!) My initial reaction was that it the first few episodes was quite funny, but mid episodes got draggy and ending was alright. I thought it will be better with more funny scenes thrown in. I was wondering ""Why does it get so high rating?"" Despite that, the chemistry between Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Sik is undeniably blazing. I ended up search for BTS clips and got hooked in even more. A comment on Youtube about how the editing brings out the power of the Rain Kiss in Ep 8 and that triggered the realization on the main theme of the show -the Power of Perceptive.

What sets this drama apart is the way the scenes were presented to the viewers. Clippets of flashbacks were shown slowly bit by bit as the episode/drama progressed which is very different from the usual drama. This creates a different perception of the characters in the plot. When I watched it for the first time, I didn't really understand why the characters in the drama were so emotional in certain scenes and couldn't really fully emphatize with the characters or understand their actions. I felt that Yeon Su was too distance and cold, while Choi Ung was so cute in the show. The most memorable episode that left the biggest impression was Ep12 with all the cute moments. I also liked the occassional comedic scenes that were thrown in once a while throughout the drama. That was how I felt on the first watch. (Looking back now, this seems quite superficial as there's much more the drama has to offer!).

I decided to rewatch the drama again and boy was I surprised at howmy whole perception of the drama changed.
THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC OF THE DRAMA BEGINS!
It's the first time where I rewatch a drama and had a different feeling towards the characters, plot and how good the drama is!
The magic of the drama unveil itself on the 2nd watch. With the background and context of the characters in mind after the first watch, the 2nd watch of the drama left me with a complete different feeling despite the fact that the scenes, characters and entire show is exactly the same! Thats the power of perception. After understanding the reasons and background of Yeon Su and Choi Ung, I could feel the strong emotional scenes come to live in my 2nd watch (which the audience will not fully understand on the first watch due to how the scenes were edited throughout the drama). I also came to appreciate the beautiful cinematic which I didn't notice in my first watch. It brings forth new perspectives.

The theme of Perception/Perceptive stood out the most to me in the drama.
Different characters have different perception towards Yeon Su and Choi Ung's relationship.

Firstly, our perception is shaped by how information is presented to us. The public thinks that Yeon Su and Choi Ung were enemies in school due to how the scenes where edited in the documentary. Similarly, Yeon Su's colleague thinks that they are enemies, and Mr Jang and Yeon Su has a thing going on. On the other hand, the PDs, Yeon Su and Choi Ung's friends think that something is going on between them.

Secondly, the difference in perception is not only affected by what is presented to us, but also subjective on the individual level. This is shown in the scene where Yeon Su went up the stage were presented in Yeon Su, Choi Ung and Ji Ung POV.

Lastly, on a even more micro level, our own perception may change depending on how we choose to look at the situation too.
Yeon Su's own view on her life changed when she changed her perspective that she's always alone and had no friend, to one where she noticed that her friends and colleagues were always supportive of her throughout her life.

The difference in perspective is not only applicable to the drama itself but also in real life as well. Just like how the audience and characters are affected by these difference in perceptive, viewers of ""Our Beloved Summer"" are affected by how the producers edited the drama and how the scenes are presented to us as well. This is apparent by how the flashbacks scenes and different POV of the various characters on the same scenes are presented. It's magical how the producer managed to replicate this change in perspective of the characters in the show to affect the audience watching ""Our Beloved Summer"" in real life as well! (At least that was the effect it had on me!).

I'm not sure whether this is intentional, but it also draws parallel to real life as well. Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Sik were enemies in the movie ""The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion"" just like how Yeon Su and Choi Ung were portrayed as enemies in the documentary they were featured in their schooldays. But behind the scene, they were friends. Then they were reunited (Da Mi and Woo Sik in this drama and Yeon Su and Choi Ung in the documentary). Not sure whether this was done delibrately, but just like in the show where the behind the scene unedited clips of the documentary were the best bits, behind the scene of ""Our Beloved Summer"" were even better than what were shown in the drama. Just look at the BTS of the kiss scenes and extremely comfortable physical interaction between Da Mi and Woo Sik (in interviews too) !

This drama is like a sweet onion with so many layers waiting to be uncover. Just like in life; You got to slow down, take a step back, give it a chance and be open to changing your perspective to truely appreciate this drama completely - its plot, editing, cinematic, actors acting and chemistry. The show is much deeper than it seems. You'll be pleasantly surprised by what it will bring to the table!

Nice aesthetics and feelings, petty outcome for 2nd lead syndrom victims
""Every life is a work of art. And it becomes complete when all pieces come together.""

What started as a very heartfelt journey had a somewhat wishy-washy end - and no, I'm yes, I'm saying this because I was under the influence of the stressful second-lead syndrome. But not because he didn't get the girl - I swear!

Our Beloved Summer on a first look basis seems to have any troop to appease the typical k-drama viewer: haters-to-lovers, second lead syndrome (to some, at least), artistic shots, unjoyful and earnest quotes, and a very nice soundtrack to back it all (I'm a sucker for any Sam Kim OST, sue me!).

And it does! I fell in love immediately with it all, the way everything felt like it was worked to the detail, with both the heart and the mind. This series felt clever yet sincere. I found myself rooting for every character, even NJ who I didn't enjoy 75% of the time. They were complex, more than pretty cardboard on a screen.

However, OBS was a victim of what I like to call ""The Episode 13 Curse"" where, around the episode 13 (from 11-15 usually), it looses its essence. The main characters' plot was pretty much concluded, still the writers thought this kdrama clearly needed more emotional trauma and suffering (the overdone type), especially for Ji-Ung, which pissed me off. At least, from the little they developed his plot in the last episodes, they added a delicate streak to his journey. I'm still pissed, since it felt...wasted, tossed aside, so we could have 30 minutes of lovey-dovey scenes. They could've easily spared some time and level everything.

By all means, I didn't hate the main leads. They had cute chemistry, I'm just the type of viewer that enjoys the push-and-pull more than the icing on the cake, the chase more than the destination. Basically, I love to see two people getting closer, but not them being close, does it make sense? Well, still, they were adorable, and almost everyone in the series is impossible to hate. In the end, I felt like this is the type of drama that is meant not to be watched, but to be carefully appreciated. The ending was just bittersweet to me.

Top 5 dramas of 2022,regardless of how early in the year it is!
Going to keep this short everything in this drama is amazing,doesn‚Äôt feel dragged out,boring or lacking in anyway for me.
Gook yeon so is quickly becoming one my favorite female Korean actresses,some people didn‚Äôt like her in itaewon class but I loved it, she‚Äôs a amazing actor and so likeable,she‚Äôs adorable aswell.
Choi woong changed my opinion of him in this drama, I wasn‚Äôt really interested in his dramas but now I really like him because of his performance In this!
There was no random twists or breakups between the ML and FL lead which lead to a perfect ending.
Also have to mention the MUSIC in this drama is top tier v‚Äôs OST for this is amazing and every bit of music they played along with made me enjoy this drama more for me,
This will be in my top 5 for this year and I know this because it‚Äôs been a while since this show finished and I‚Äôm still thinking about it ,I loved everything about it!

An Emotion Trigger!!!!!!!!!
Okay, I don't usually leave reviews, especially when a drama is still ongoing, but I just couldn't help it. This drama is like a piece gotten out from my personal life at a point. Just goes to show what a relationship really entails. The struggles, thoughts, weird moments, breakups and makeups. The drama brought out a side of realistic relationships that really should be seen. Love requires EFFORT.
The characters did a perfect job ,they all played their part, provoking emotions. Y'all just 12 episodes of this drama, I've cried, laughed, sighed, felt all kinds of emotions, cos I could personally relate to most situations in the drama, especially the relationship between the leads.
I loved every piece of this drama and if you're seeing this review, you should definitely try it out, it's totally worth your time.
You might not understand the message from the onset, but eventually you'll find this drama relatable.
Pros
The leads were perfect and fitted for their roles.
The OST is on another level of perfection, each ost suits each scene/episode

Cons
I can't think of any........

Once it's completed I'll surely watch it over and over again.

Struck a chord with me....again...and again...and again
LOVE. PLAYFULNESS. MISUNDERSTANDINGS. ABANDONMENT. LONLINESS. HEALING.

Two broken souls (well, maybe 3). Emotional baggage. Opposites. Crazy about each other

I gulped down this drama like a starved puppy. It has been too long since I've seen such a skillfully woven story free of any cliched feeling. To the director, screenwriter, editor, and cast: THANK YOU.

Beautifully written with a beautiful soundtrack. This story had everything. There were some lines in the script that just...it just really struck a chord with me. Some indescribable feeling or thoughts I 've had...captured in a poignant line or moment in this drama. I just found bits and pieces of the characters and emotions so relatable.

Now I have to talk about the amazing cast, especially the two leads. Woo Shik is just phenomenal. He is a criminally underrated actor who deserves more lead roles to showcase his versatility and amazing acting skills. He just become his character. This character could easily have become boring or too much of a wuss, but he made him relatable, layered and endearing. In the emotional scenes, sometimes it's so subtle, but the way he says the lines is just so heart wrenching, but on the other hand, he also can infuse a scene with subtle mischievousness that lends itself to the comedy.

Kim Da Mi, who's been on my watchlist since the Witch, is fast becoming one of my fav actresses. I loved how her character was written with many layers. A snide exterior to hide a girl who's been hurt too much. A girl whose pride constantly gets in the way. Someone who shows her warm side to only the people she trusts. This character and how Da Mi portrayed her was so fresh to me.

I loved the fun bickering between these two, and loved the sweet honest moments even more. They did such a great job of maintaining that history of love and hate with the underlying layer of just being crazy for each other. From being enemies in the Witch to soulmates here, it's clear how gifted these two actors are.

The side characters were great as well, specifically Park Jin Joo as the Unnie BFF and Ahn Dong Goo as Woong's manager. Both were so funny and created a lot of the comic relief. For once, the side characters didn't feel like filler and were used to support the leads instead of going on their own tangent. The only exception is Ji Woong's character. I found his relationship with his boss or mom a bit boring which is why I couldn't give this a complete 10 rating.

I look forward to other projects this director or screenwriter may have as I think they did such a fantastic job creating a humanistic story without the corniness of cliches.

Our Painfully, Pain, Pain, Pain with a side of fluff
Prepare yourselves for some pain, and I do not just mean a little pain, I mean a lot of it as the team for this drama truly do all in their power to make you feel the prolonged suffering of the main couple with the use of dialog, visuals and a pretty painful OST.
I was honestly surprised over how much could feel their pain, as I spent most of this drama with a lump in my chest. And as the true drama masochist I am I LOVED every moment of it... yep I did! If you are not a fan of pain step away and do not come near this drama.. because it has so many different types of pain and levels of brokenness, fear and pain making it one of the most painfully, pain, pain, pain dramas I have watched of course with some humour, cuteness and beauty... but did I mention pain?

I think I read someone say this reminded them of Reply 1988 and I am willing to agree, I am just not going to tell you in what way, so I won't spoil it for you... But there is deffinetly a familiarity between the two dramas.

This drama has a few (very few) slightly annoying scenes, but I would say this is a meet after a break up drama done right. though I did want to yell at the cast from time to time to TALK TO EACH OTHER... There was not a single character (ok one) that was not lovable at least once.

Extra points for the way they portray how poverty affects people, as well as some pretty raw lines about bad parenting... minus for some other parts about parenting but then again some more for the good parents and what makes a family...

Extra points for the OST, showing how much ones mood affects the way you hear a song, as some of the songs Feld sad and dark in some of the episodes but happy, fluffy and romantic in others... yes the same song, same piano... same tone, same voice... completely different emotion. Now that takes talent and cooler me impressed!

It also has some well done product placement, some a bit too obvious that will make you laugh, and some PPL that is just in the way... Also wrong botle of Soju... it was blie! very confusing. They make good use of umbrellas too...

This drama is not for everybody, so do not be fooled by the name Our Beloved Summer... there is very little beloved and even less summer (it is mostly fall and winter). But for all you fellow drama masochists out there, this will have you felling stuff, biting your nails and screaming at the screen!

Oh and most of the episodes are named after movies from the 90s... kind of cute.

A SERIES WITH A GREAT START & PROMISE BUT SEEMS TO RUN OUT ON STEAM
I can't tell you how delightful the start of the series is. It's like a 'Vantage Point' treatment which onion skins the story. Everything which you saw in the last episode seems to take on a completely new context and hue in the next episode on the basis of what is revealed. Given that it shows no great thrill or disaster or violence or any of the trope high drama, the almost soft grip the story gets on you as the viewer is hard to describe. Well that is at least till the 8th-9th episode. Each week I'd be immersed in the characters hoping, wanting to know more about what happens to them. All this goes on until the 11th episode. When suddenly, the story, which seemed like some smooth champagne till now, loses ALL fizz and then almost becomes long forgotten soda water. I am left wondering, did they change script writers midstream? Or did the script writer suddenly feel lost? But there seems to be a qualitative gulf between how the story started and how it ends. It could have been brilliant, but it isn't. The actors though put up a commendable performance. One leaves the series with. lament of all the potential lost.

'Every Life is a Work of Art'
This is my first review here, I will try my best to articulate my thoughts!

I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but Our Beloved Summer pleasantly surprised me.
While I will admit that I started watching this drama because I am a huge army and the OST enticed me, I binge-watched it in two days and ended up loving every minute of it. I'll just list the pros (the good) and cons (the bad) because that's probably the best way to explain how I felt about this drama.

The Good:
The plot was gripping from the start; the documentary aspect really elevated the show because it would have otherwise been a typical rom-com.

-Relatable characters: each character contributed something to the story. They each had their own struggles, which they handled gracefully.

- No annoying characters: The characterization in this show was excellent. I feel like I'm too old haha, so I get annoyed when there are evil or annoying characters in shows (of course, this depends on genre, and such characters are necessary in some shows), so it was nice to see that everyone was just living their own lives and not actively seeking to harm someone ahah.

- Sweet romance and Beautiful friendships: Yeon-su and Ung were delightful to watch. Despite their disagreements and breakups, they clearly loved and cherished one another. I don't like second male or female leads because I dislike love triangles and the like, but this show can teach a lot of writers how to write secondary characters. Rather than ignoring them or making them one-dimensional, the writers gave them proper backstories that helped the audience understand their choices and behavior. I rarely have SLS, and this one was no exception, as the chemistry between the main leads was top notch. Even though each character did not interact with each other on a regular basis throughout the show, it was palpable that they all served a purpose in each other's lives; I use Ji-Ung and NJ as an example here because, while they were not particularly close, NJ accompanied Ji-Ung when she noticed he was eating alone and Ji-Ung's advice to NJ changed her outlook on life.

- OST: The OST is quite literally perfection. Truly fit the tone of the show all throughout.

-Stunning cinematography and very aesthetic character fashion!

The Bad:
- LACK OF SOL-I AND EUN-HO!!! I adored their dynamic, sometimes even more than the main characters', but we got very little screen time with them together (as a couple; though I understand why they couldn't just date right away). I'd love to see these two in another show someday. Similarly, I would have liked to know more about both of their pasts more, they seemed like quite interesting characters.

- I can't help but criticize some bits of the ending, as much as I think it was perfect. I am very critical of Kdrama endings because I have seen far too many that are abrupt and rushed, causing me to lower my overall rating of a show; I felt the same way about this drama. The show began slowly, and I believe it could have sped up some scenes/episodes and focused more on the final two episodes to tie it all together nicely. They did address every issue and every character's story, but it could have been spread out more (if that makes sense).

- I think that's it ahaha

Overall, Our Beloved Summer is a heartwarming drama about the reconciliation of former lovers as they try to make amends and grow together with the support of their friends and family. All of the characters are likeable and are shown to face unique hardships that they eventually overcome gradually (but surely). If you're looking for something soft and cozy to watch during these cold winter days, this is a simple watch with inspiring life messages.

It's not a spoiler but it's my feelings that I wanted to share here about OBS
I saw people saying that the story was kinda boring or frustrating or the immature behaviour of FL for breaking up again and again....well I won't say they are completely false or wrong the FL indeed broke for silly reasons and the last break-up or you can say that ""I WILL HANDLE MY PROBLEMS"" but you know what people are a actually ignoring this ""CAUSE I DONT WANT MY BELOVED ONE TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT TO GET WORRIED ABOUT ME.""
This is the major thing people are missing or are not able to see. Just tell one thing when you love someone would you like them to suffer with you when you have The TYPICAL attitude of I'LL HANDLE IT COZ I CAN ???
When teen are in relationship they TEND to hide their PATHETIC part from their partners and that's the thing The FL did.....
I am not criticizing anyone I am just making the ignored thing have some limelight
.
The story and everything is good.... you'll actually smile while watching them being clingy and all.....and believe my it's not a waste of time....All the actors are super cute especially Choi and Kim da mi they both are just so cute.... So yeah whenever you feel like having kinda getting good and kinda postive vibes you can watch it...
Thank you.

Youth is bright and warm. Just like this drama.
Ok, I might be a bit biased about this one because Choi Woong is my ideal man so I love this drama so much (hence the perfect 10 ratings). Anyway...

Ah, yes. My mind and soul left after this drama ended. All there's left was EMOTIONS. My heart feels so warm and I feel it melting every episode. It's SO good! This is a masterpiece! After 2 episodes, I knew this will be one of my favorites.

The four characters gave us such refreshing personalities and they all shared such great lessons that will surely help us. The amount of friendship, family, and love are all equally shown. It may have seem to focus on their (the main leads) relationship but there's really MORE to it.

The comforting feeling I get with every episode... I can't even explain how beautiful it is. The soundtracks fits the drama/scenes so well. Though I know Kdramas had perfected this already, I still want to say it.

I'm drunk in my emotions. My heart just feels warm and cozy. This will be one of my comfort dramas. I will be rewatching this every know and then. And I know you'll do too!

Kudos to all the casts and staffs esp to the one who wrote this amazing drama. Can't wait for the movie!

An exceptional work of craftsmanship from script to casting to direction to acting
‚ÄúThose who do cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.‚Äù - Harvard philosophy professor George Santayana

Sometimes we hear these phrases, like the one above and others, and they sound wise at first glance so we accept them as wholly and universally true. But if there is a whole and universal truth, it is much more likely that there are no whole and universal truths (except for, paradoxically, this one). ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù is a show about repeating the past - Woong and Yeon Soo having different values and backgrounds but loving each other despite them. In their past, the differences overcame them and they could not stay together.

Ironically, it was impossible for Woong and Yeon Soo not to remember their past as it was filmed in a documentary which remained popular into their adulthood. Can their familiarity with the past help them not to repeat it? That‚Äôs not really the issue though, whether for them or anyone else. Knowing the past but not recognizing how to change the present and future is useless.

The show isn‚Äôt built around the soundtrack like an idol drama, nor does it feature innovative or elaborate production design or wardrobe. But the crew for these elements were terrific. V‚Äôs ‚ÄúChristmas Tree‚Äù was one of many outstanding songs featured. The wardrobe for Woong in particular was stellar. And the locations where this show was shot were tops.

Woong is almost a polar opposite, on the exterior, of a typical male lead. Outwardly, he‚Äôs lazy and a coward. In the hands of a less talented actor than Choi Woo Shik, Woong could have been a disaster of a character and sunk the show. But this performance is mesmerizing and further solidifies Choi Woo Shik‚Äôs status as one of the most talented actors of any age and hailing from anywhere. That Woong is talented as an artist is made clear from early on but it is his inner emotional strength, that he will shrug off his own troubles and stand beside and lift up someone else who is suffering is where Woong really shines as a character.

If there‚Äôs a trope that ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù fails to avoid, it‚Äôs that if the two main characters had simply communicated openly and honestly with each other, they could have avoided many of their troubles. Well, hard to avoid here since the foundation of the story is that they‚Äôre separated after a five year relationship. But the show misses when it spends almost its entire first half focusing on the narrative primarily from Woong‚Äôs perspective. Yeon Soo‚Äôs inner thoughts are only momentarily illuminated until after the midpoint. The result is that she‚Äôs portrayed as an unapologetic bad guy between the two and Woong is the innocent victim. While the reality is that she did break things off, there‚Äôs much more nuance to Yeon Soo but it‚Äôs not revealed for a long stretch.

Once ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù delves further into Yeon Soo‚Äôs character, however, she comes alive as a layered character, tragically unselfaware while driven and loyal and smart. As the show proceeds, particularly in the final few episodes, Kim Da Mi‚Äôs portrayal gets better and better. She deftly alternates between lighter humorous scenes and raw emotional displays. There are probably examples of a finer pair of performances by both male and female leads in a production, but none spring to mind immediately.

The two secondary leads, unfortunately, do not leave the same impression. Kim Sung Chul and Roh Jeong Nui are both fine actors and perform admirably. The characters they play, however, are lackluster. Kim Sung Chul‚Äôs Ji Woong is an emotionally stunted friend of the main characters that is effective only briefly as a prop to move the arc forward between Woong and Yeon Soo. His own storyline is far and away the least compelling portion of the production. Meanwhile, Roh Jeong Nui‚Äôs NJ is an atypical idol with a crush on Woong. She has a brief but unnecessary subplot of her own that primarily just whets a viewer‚Äôs appetite for a return to focusing on any other part of the show.

An additional note is that ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù has one of the finest supporting cast ensembles of any show. If there is an easy layup in drama casting, it is to always, whenever possible, include Park Jin Joo as the female lead‚Äôs quirky bff. She‚Äôs as marvelous as ever here. But there‚Äôs standout performances as well from Ahn Dong Goo as Woong‚Äôs manager, Seo Jung Yeon and Park Won Sang as Woong‚Äôs parents, Jo Bok Rae as a senior television producer, Jung Kang Hee as a neighborhood hardware store owner and the sublime Kwak Dong Yeon makes several guest appearances as a fellow/rival artist to Woong.

Kim Yoon Jin nails how to handle the key emotional scenes. He lets the actors take over. The soundtrack takes a pause. There‚Äôs no moving cameras. The best example is the scene at the end of episode 11 where Yeon Soo struggles to find the words she wants to say to Woong. Technically, it is as simply presented a scene as a viewer will find. But it is an emotional powerhouse of a scene. Narratively, the show only strengthens as it nears its end. It continues to deliver humor, warmth and tenderness until its final moments.

If ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù were to be summed up in a single word, it would be warmth. We can all use more of that and so it is most highly recommended.

One of the best slow burn and slice of life kdramas in recent years
This drama had been on my radar ever since they started releasing promos and teasers and I end up picking it up while it was airing. To be honest, I wasn't completely sold on the drama initially. It seemed funny but I was unable to relate to the characters a lot. This was the case till I found myself totally obsessed with it after ep 5. This drama was very light in tone for most part and while not a perfect one, for me the viewing experience was a memorable one.

PLOT:
It's about a group of friends with the main couple being a bickering will-they-won't-they one. It comes with a twist because they have history together and the drama's narrative poses questions about their true feelings, intentions and scenarios. For me it was enjoyable watching the leads rediscover their feelings, or accepting the fact that the feelings never left. While few things in their history as a couple were off they did manage to mature and be better versions of themselves with each other. I really liked the direction in which we see same things from two different perspective. It's like how memories in real life are. The brain records the dominant feelings in the situation or how we were feeling but many a times we unconsciously discount the struggles other might be going through at the same time. There were some interesting aspects to Yeon Su and Woong's relationships.

I really think the strength of the drama lies in its main characters and the interactions they all have with each other. The side characters are equally strong and while they are flawed, they all had a struggle I could relate with. Being a kdrama, it doesn't shy from undertones of melodrama but thankfully nothing majorly tragic ever happens. I swear I would have rated this drama much less if that were the case.

CAST:
It's a wonderful cast with strong performances from almost everyone. Choi Woo Sik and Kim Dami made really good efforts to seem natural and comfortable with each other which I really appreciated. There were also some new faces for me who made a good impression on me and I'll be excited to check their future works also.

OST:
The OST fits the mood of the drama. No need to say that BTS V's single is already massively popular. It was cool of him to lend his voice for his Wooga squad friend after 2020's Itaewon Class. We love it.

OVERALL:
I would categorize this drama as more of a slow burn with elements of comedy, friendship and slice of life. While it has its flaws and I had minor issues with its writing in a few places, it still remains to be a strong drama that is quite worth a watch. I think anyone can enjoy it and the ending is quite fitting as well. It left me wanting S2 and I'd be up for it if they ever made a sequel to this.

Warmest and saddest love
I really enjoyed everything about this drama.
This will definitely be my all time favorite and will rewatch many many times.

Each week we were shown the past and present of our characters. We got to experience their pain, sadness and love.

It was especially nice to see real and accurate insecurities of many characters. We also saw the goodness and happiness of having loving and supportive family and friends.

It reminded me of Romance is A Bonus Book and Angel's Last Mission:Love.

Still this drama won't be everyone's cup of tea as it may seem as a simple story with complicated narrative along with stupid misunderstanding but this is what actually happens in real life. It's character and emotion of the people after all complicated to understand especially of your loved ones at times.

Still my favorite episode would definitely will be 8th episode

Lit drama ngl
I‚Äôm not even gon cap, this drama fr beautifully executed mane. I love this OG Choi w??shik but the chemistry between him and his ex. Dawg this drama making me high key miss my ex but reality is what‚Äôs over is over on to the next fr.

Top tier cinema photography and dialogue, what you thought was going to be a fun and light hearted drama the first few episodes turned out to be a eye opening, jaw clenching, fist opening, teeth pending enlightenment of the deep intricate details of a relationship that really matters.

Also I ain‚Äôt fw the 2nd male lead, guy boring and his mum an L fr. The girl lead Lawd have merthy, her acting is truly the work of Vincent Van Dough. Her sheer ability to act cute is definitely not a feat in it self as she is evidently a cute person behind the cameras. I‚Äôd like to thank god for blessing me with this kdrama, and I want to give a shout-out to my mum for just being there unlike 2nd male lead.

choi ung, standard of all men.
(this is my first time writing a review so i am sorry if this isn't the best! don't mind any mistakes or spelling errors!)

our beloved summer is a show that not everyone can touch on. a show that is realistic that many people might find it boring. many watchers are actually looking for unrealistic love that touches on clich√©s such as high school first love and all. but our beloved summer touches on raw emotions from former lovers that happens to break with one-side knowing all the reasons and another side that basically know none. then, they meet again and their story are tangled with each other.

how did i came across our beloved summer?
- when i saw my instagram feed full of choi wooshik and kim dami, i was like ??? at that time, i didn't had good impression on kim dami just yet because i didn't enjoy itaewon class, the drama that starred kim dami. but i did know choi wooshik from parasite. by chance, i came across some clips and decided to watch, 'the witch' and fell for them lol. so, i became excited for obs since mid-nov.

about the characters. everyone in the show is relatable which makes our beloved summer something a viewer can relate to.

with no doubt, my favorite has to be choi ung. he seem perfect. a guy that has a loving family, supportive parents that allows him to do what he wants, a successful career and no worries. however, there is a depth into it. he was abandoned by his biological father and left him a scar. this perfectly sums up why he love and hated yeonsu for leaving him with no expectation. he is a huge boyfriend material and a walking green flag. well, they often say ""don't settle down until you have found your choi ung"" and i agree to the fullest.

kook yeonsu might seem like a girl that is cold and rude. but it was forced by the situation that she was placed in. to me, she makes her choices with no regrets and work to her dreams which is to live a peaceful life, able to pay for bills. there is another side of her where she is caring, heart-warming and making choi ung fall for her.

jiung... i felt that his character was somewhat wasted. but it is hard to say since hun's emotion are complex. we might be able to get over it easily, but for him, maybe not. i am glad that he had choi ung with him. however, i hope that he walked it out quicker, which he did eventually.

nj... honestly, she has to be one of the best second female lead that i have seen. she doesn't do any foul plays to make choi ung hers which i adore it. she was a friend that happen to seek comfort to choi ung's drawing. she is an idol where she received hate comments for literally breathing and that happens to the third and fourth generation idols where they get tons of hate comment.

i hated how some of the our beloved summer hated nj for some of her actions when she is more of a direct and straightforward person. actually in an episode's preview, they hated on nj too much that is honestly unbearable. but some worship jiung and pity him... isn't it double standard?

i love choi ung's parents and maybe that's because they resemble to my parents somehow. i love how supportive they are to choi ung, not wanting to be anything? fine. you just live your life to what you want. they never pressured choi ung to score well in school. which i hope everyone can have the parents that always support you to what you do.

the acting in this drama is pretty much top-tier. choi wooshik and kim dami has great chemistry and was able to bring the drama to the fullest with their acting. it could be a scene of watery eyes and turning away but these two actors does it so well. the rest of the cast where perfectly casted for their characters.

the ost are well made. most of them are ballet like or slow tempo. one ost was sang by v from bts!
my two favorite ost are 'why' and 'our beloved summer'!

overall, obs is a great journey with many emotion kicking it. rather than a romcom, it is more of a mix of melo-rom and romcom LOL! is it worth watching? without a doubt, yes it is. so what are you waiting for?

A very heartwarming drama with amazing cast
I love everything about this drama.

The casting director did a very amazing job, Choi Woo Shik, Kim Da Mi an all the actors were able to potray all the characters perfectly.

The music director did a very great job as well, despite of the OST were sang by V, 10 cm and other well known singers, the ost itself really really gave you the mood..

Overall, it is a very recommended drama to be watched. Slow pace but not boring, the story is flowing nicely.. a very heartwarming and healing drama.. Kudos for everyone involved in the drama ????‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

tender, soft, and precious. it's been a joy.
I'm going to miss this drama so much. The last time I felt this taken by a drama was It's Okay to Not Be Okay. I felt so fully invested in the characters and the development was laid out for us beautifully. It's truly been an honor to watch this drama. The casting was pure perfection. Dami and Wooshik and their soft facial features and their magnetic chemistry, it felt so natural to watch them show us this love story. It hits you in all the right places. Challenges you to become more patient and understanding. Urges you to trust in yourself and live boldly. I want to thank the entire production team for such a treat. Our Beloved Summer holds such a tender place in my heart. I'm so happy that I watched it.

Mellow and quiet
This is a character-driven drama for sure ‚Äî if that's your thing, then this drama pretty much does it perfectly. It's just a drama about relationships (family, friends, lovers) and there's never really any outside pressure. The characters and relationships are all pretty unconfrontational; things just happen as they do and this drama is more of a ferris wheel, as opposed to a roller coaster. What that means is that if you prefer a more plot-driven plot, it might feel like the drama is dragging and that there's nothing happening.

With that being said, I definitely skew towards the latter; there were scenes and progressions that I was craving and never really got. At the same time, I really loved how all the characters were portrayed ‚Äî nobody was over-the-top, there were no true villains, and I liked how even minor side characters had their distinct personalities come through in very little screentime.

Overall, this is just a warm, soft drama ‚Äî for me, it wasn't a tear-jerker or a heart-wrencher, but it'll make you feel fuzzy and cozy.

Sweet, heartwarming, and fun to watch
This drama was very heartwarming, sweet and fun to watch. The ML and FL did an excellent job portraying their characters. I fell line love with both of them. I also liked the supporting characters his friend who also had a crush on the FL lead but he never really did anything but have his heart broken because he would not ruin his friendship with the ML. The two ML I loved watching how they became friends and how they were there for each other. I also liked his manger he was fun, goofy and had me laughing. The FL leads friend was also bright and fun to watch. When the manager and the friend where in scenes together they always had me laughing. Also enjoyed the colleagues of who they worked with. Even the star that was in this that liked the ML I even ended up having a soft spot for her. This was a nice drama that showed the value of friendships, relationships and the people around you.

The story was fun to watch it was about the ML and FL in high school they do a documentary she is the smartest in the class and he is last in the class. They are the exact opposites. Years later the document goes viral and they ask them to do another documentary this is how we get flashbacks from high school and find out they actually had dated for a few years and broke up.
Since they are now doing the documentary again we have the ML and FL starting to care for each other again. It is a very nice development of their relationship. I loved the ending I think it wrapped up nicely!

What a masterpiece!
I'm compelled to write this review because I believe everyone should watch this series. However, if you're new to Korean drama, don't start with Our Beloved Summer, there are a lot of high quality KD, but OBS is on a league of its own and it sets the bar high.

STORY:
How can a simple story be told in such an exquisite work of art? The writer, Lee Na Eun, had a vision and trusted a rookie director, Kim Yoon Jin, to execute. No details were spared, from the cell phones used in the life stages of the characters, the books borrowed from the library when they were in HS, then as adults, and during the proposal. The place where they broke up and where Ungi said the magic words to Younsoo. I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention the beautiful cinematography of ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù. The series showcased the beauty of each of the four seasons.

ACTING/CAST:
Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi are exceptional actors and their chemistry in OBS is un-matched. We can see why their co-star, Kim Sung Chul, referred to it as a national treasure. Choi Ung and Yeon Soo‚Äôs characters are typical of any Korean dramas and so is their story. What set them apart were the actors who played them, give all the awards to Wooshk and Dami now. They weren‚Äôt even on my radar prior to OBS, I watched IC but didn‚Äôt care for Dami then; and decided to watch Parasite in between OBS episodes.

OST:
The music of ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù pulled everything together. The story, the characters, each setting, each scene, were all made more beautiful because of the soundtrack. This is the first OST that I purchased, and I had to pay more for shipping than the actual products ‚Äì I can‚Äôt wait!

REWATCH VALUE:
I rewatched most episodes while waiting for new ones to be released. I‚Äôm planning on rewatching the entire series, with less anxiety of how it will end, and more appreciation of its artful storytelling.

What A Cute Drama!
I have been waiting long for this drama since last year. Since I started to like Choi Woo Sik. And yess....applaused! I love their chemistry, I love all the soundtrack, I love the drawing, I love the friendship between them especially Choi Ung and Ji Ung.

And this story succeed to bring me back to my school life and my crush during that time. How miss crazily to that time. And there's a few scene that makes me nearly to cry.

Choi Woo Sik, I am your fans since I watched you in Rooftop prince and I think I will continue to be your fans. To the director of Our Beloved Summer, please make this drama happy ending. Pleasee. Since this drama still on going. So please make happy ending. And, please send someone for Ji Ung. Don't be too cruel to Ji Ung. I started to like Kim Sung Cheol also. Hehehehe....

Anyway, I love the whole story. This masterpiece really touched my heart. ? 10 stars!!

This review may contain spoilers
A lil talking and trust is what it takes to make that Summer ‚ÄúBeloved‚Äù.
This review contains very little spoilers and is written in rather uncomplicated language.

So Let's Begin........

What could've been just a bunch of rather heartwrenching and traumatic memories for the Leads, turned out to be the most Beloved and Cherrished times of their Lives.

This show began at our Leads meeting again after 5 years since their break-up cuz of a Viral Documentary that they shot when they were in high school 10 years ago and how they ended up being together again after dating for 5 years since high school to breaking-up and finally understanding what Love and Life is.
How it just takes a lil more effort to look at things from a slightly different angle.

Life gave them a chance not to undo the past but to learn from the mistakes and not to repeat those again.
Like how Yeon-su said that ""the more you try to run away from past, the more it traps you in and that it makes you repeat the mistakes again"".

That documentary actually came as a gift for them and that's how they found out when they actually fell in love 10 years ago and how they loved each other but due to their own pride and prejudice they presumed things and let go of each other which could've been resolved with just a lil talk face to face which they eventually learnt. They learnt to trust each other and communicate.

Yeon-su found out that she wasn't all alone like she thought all her time instead she had someone to rely on at each phase of her life, someone came in as a friend, some as colleagues while someone as the love of her life. All she had to do was to look at them and let go of her presumptions.

And Woong learnt to let go of his traumatic past and being afraid of getting abandoned again.
Ji-woong learnt to accept his life too. They all embraced their past while learning to love their present.

This show dealt with a lot issues.
From Childhood Negligence by Parents to growing up in poverty without Parents and abandonment by loved ones. A messed-up break-up and it's consequences.
The drama showed how trusting yourself and your loved ones is the most important thing.

‚Ä¢ Cast and Acting :
The Cast of this drama was top-notch. Each actor did justice to their respective characters. You could totally feel the emotions that the characters felt.
I've been a fan of Choi Woo-shik since ""Hogu's Love"" and Kim Da-mi since ""Itaewon Class"". Kim seong-chol is one great actor too, I remember him from ""Prison Playbook"" where he made a brief appearance. Roh Jung-eui did a fabulous job too.
Other cast members were perfect too.
While some were familiar faces like Woong's Mum and Dad who played such warm and kind people.
Sol-ri played Park Jin-joo, the perfect actor to play that eccentric best friend of the FL did full justice to her skills by bringing much needed laughter to our screens.
While others like Eun-ho, Chae-ran, Park PD, Yeon-su's colleagues were new faces to me. They all were so good as well.

Perhaps what surprised me the most about this drama is that there's no character that I could hate. I was reading the interview of the writer of this show and how she chose to write 3-dimensional characters with no-one solely bad or good, which I agree with.
After all, all humans have multiple sides to them.

‚Ä¢ The OST :
I can say that this show had one of the Best OSTs of all time. Each song played in the background conveyed and aroused emotions. Every song went well with the over-all vibes of this drama.

My Favourite Tracks are:-
#1 Christmas Tree by V (OST Pt.5)
#2 Home by Janet Suhh ( OST Pt. 6)
#3 Drawer by 10cm ( OST Pt. 1)
#4 Maybe if by BIBI ( OST Pt. 2)
#5 The Giving Tree by Lee Seung Yoon ( OST Pt. 7)
#6 Summer Rain by Sam Kim ( OST Pt. 8)

I have these tracks on my Spotify Favourites now and on loop listening to these. Idk why but I cry when listening to Giving Tree, Home, Maybe if and Drawer.

Now what I didn't like:
The only thing that could've been better was if they had only 12 Episodes or if they showed a lil more of their school days and if the last episode gave a lil more elaborate ending to us than just throwing a lot at once.
No, I am not saying that it felt rushed or messy rather I felt that our Mains had a very lil time having those cute couple moments.

Besides that Product placement by Samsung lol ? every character had a ""Z-flip"".

‚Ä¢ Conclusion: This drama is truly a gem. From great acting, writing, cinematography, direction and OST, this show had it all.
This drama has truly become one of my favourite dramas of all time that I like to call ""Soulful"" Dramas which I can watch multiple times.
I felt all the emotions while watching this. From crying to getting frustrated, from having that smile on my face unconsciously to feeling butterflies in my stomach. It had it all.
What made this show so special for me was how it reminded of my own life, being grown up as a single child of a single mom in a not so affluent family and being perceived as an aimless and lost cause person. I could relate to all three characters... Yeon-su, Choi Woong and Ji-woong.

I hope they make a season 2 of this perhaps 3-4 years from now like how in the very last scene they started filming again after finding that the sequel to their documentary went viral too and told the viewers that they're married.
Wouldn't it be interesting seeing Yeon-su and Woong married and their reactions to what life has in the box ready to be thrown at them. Also I want a true happy ending for Ji-woong and NJ too.
On that note let's wrap this up.

Hurry and go watch it now.

I didn't give away a lot of what actually happened cuz I want you to watch the show yourself and experience each emotion that the characters felt.

BTW, am so grateful that I watched this show in just 38 hours and got outta my K-drama slump.

Great OST not a fan of the characters and story
I won't say I don't recommend it because it's honestly not bad it's just not my cup of tea.

So I watched until episode 13 and I wasn't sure if I would like it at first from the first couple of episodes but I gave it a chance anyway.

First, the stuff I enjoyed. I enjoy the OST and the cinematography. The characters are likeable, it has an enjoyable vibe and I like how it has a documentary style like lovestruck in the city. I like how we got to see them from their high school days and how they kind of did like a remake to see where they are now. Just because yeon soo did well in school didn't make her as successful as she thought and just because choi woon wanted to live a calm and quiet life it didn't make him unsuccessful.

The stuff I didn't enjoy. I like the male lead, choi woong, but it did get on my nerves that even how he was treated by yeon soo, the female lead he still went back to her. Yeon soo got on my nerves from the very beginning then after awhile she wasn't that bad and I did like her but I just don't like how she treated choi woong and acts like she didn't hurt him and feels hurt after she thought he moved on. I know they did explain her reasoning but I don't think it justifies the way she treated him and broke up with him (Unless I might have missed something though so my bad).

I did try to get into it and I only got to episode 13 because I thought I could keep giving it a chance and sort of forced myself (I just sped it up honestly) and I don't like to leave dramas on unfinished but I just don't feel motivated to finish this one. Like I said it isn't bad just isn't for me. I'm dropping it for now but I'll probably go back to finish it because there's only like 3 episodes left.

refreshing af
this kdrama is something else! it's still airing as i'm writing this, but seriously consider watching it.

it has a stereotypical breakup and get back together trope, but the directors do such a great job at making every episode intriguing and original in its own way. the cast is so perfect and the chemistry feels super real.

also as an army i love V's ost Christmas Tree. also maybe if and drawer are two other amazing osts.

this drama makes my mondays and tuesdays so refreshing :) i love how relatable the plot is and the supporting cast is so cute. getting serious second lead syndrome though ;-;

A heartwarming kdrama
(minor spoilers on the ending and the characters stories)

In my opinion this kdrama was really heartwarming it's simple and peaceful, I love how it explores relationships whether it's platonic or romantic. I loved every single character in this series, I feel like alot of people found the timeskips annoying but while everyone is entitled to their own opinion to me it kinda would've felt odd without it since I felt like that's what the series is all about and why I loved it. The ending was so fullfillying to me all the main characters got their satisfying end, and even the secondary characters that I adored got a satisfying and heartwarming ending. I'm sure that I won't forget about this kdrama any time soon since the characters were not only relatable but really loveable as well.

I loved NJ she's one of my favorite characters in the series at first she come off negatively to me but her story was all about self confidence, loneliness and living the way you want to live, she struggles with her fame that made her feel lonely and alone, in the end she finally had the courage to be herself and live her life the way she wants to live it, I love the fact that she stood up for herself didn't care about people's opinions and hurtful words.
The main characters and the main couple as well we're really cute even tho to me they had really different personalities they still were able to overcome challenges and grow as characters and accept eachother. I really don't understand how some people dislike her just because she's a second lead doesn't mean she isn't a good character.

Kim Ji-Ung who's a fav of mine as well. his story would probably be relatable to alot of people, he has alot negative feelings about his mother and he had every right to resent her since she was neglectful and made him feel only when he was just a child who needed a family a mother to be there for him, to me his choice to take a video about his mother was heartwarming because he did for him, and for hope of forgiving her one day. I liked his ending it was satisfying and it was really heartwarming seeing him smile for once.

Lee Sol-Yi: I really love her bubbly personality a real esfp lmao shes really cute and has a really enjoyable persona and she's an amazing friend that was always there for Yeon-Su. There more to her as well then just being the main characters friend.

Jung Chae-Ran: she's incredibly underrated lmao I love her, she's relatable and mature, she's always there for Kim ji-Ung even when he was struggling.
she wasn't a main character at all but I still looked forward to her scenes. Her ending was to me satisfying as well she was able to confess her feelings and let it out, I found it really cute lol eve tho it was a short scene it was still realistic in a way.
The rest of the characters all stood out to me as well but if I start talking about how much I love the other characters then this review will be really long XD

If you love a peaceful slice of life kdrama about relationships, familial problems, love, personal conflicts, personal growth, youth and friendships then you'll love this kdrama :)

PLEASING STORYLINE! ‚ú®
I am so certain that many of us have started watching this series because of the cast, at least I did.. but the plot, the storyline that has kept me going!!
I can't belive how amazingly they have portrayed the roles of the said characters. The development shown along with their vulnerability as a whole made it a must watch, and a re-watchable series!
And to not forget the OST, I've come to like all of the songs, and the way each of them give a meaning to the storyline and the characters.
I believe that this was such a pleasant beginning to us kdrama stans in this 2022.

Courage to take chance on love, once again
Acting:
I loved all the characters, both the leads and support, since they complemented the story well and everyone portrayed their character perfectly to the extent you get carried away with their emotions while watching the drama.

The music:
OST ... Absolutely beautiful, perfect timing, and giving an extra emotion to the scene shown. And as an Army myself Christmas tree was just the perfect addition to this drama, maybe I'm a little biased here?.

The story:
The story depicts various shades of love throughout the episodes, whether it is the first love as high school students, more mature love once they grow older, when there is one sided love, the love between friends and the love of family, and the love for oneself.

Through the documentary these different tones of love can easily be seen and identified, however as they say, there is a reason why roses have thorns, because holding something so truly beautiful as love comes also with sacrifices and sometimes heartaches too.

Overall:
I highly recommend this drama. You're lucky to binge watch it if you like. I had to wait for a whole week to continue the story as I have watched it as it was airing.

I think it's the best romance-comedy in this year?
Background:
I don't like watching pure romance or romance comedy-drama ONLY IF there isn't my favorite actress as the lead. So, what brought me here is to see Jeong Eui (Hong Shi Ah from 18 Again). I have never thought I would love this drama at that time.

These are what I felt when watching this drama:
a. Pros
- This drama is so funny. The comedy scenes look seamless and natural.
- The relationship conflicts are cute yet stabbing my heart deeply.
- The romance plot went up-down-down-up-down-up-up so that the watchers can't guess what will happen next.
- The chemistry between Kook Yeon Su and Choi Ung looks beautiful.
- Supporting characters really shine with their own comedy lines.
- No obsessive or aggressive characters. Just kind of triangle-love and unrequited love. Yes, it's a more realistic way.
- Jeong Eui executed her role very well!
- Kook Yeon Su's coldness made the romance aspect alive.

b. Cons
- The plot went boring slowly in the last two episodes (this is a normal thing in romance drama though). It's hard to finish the drama until the end if we're late to watch. It's recommended to watch the last two episodes right after you finish the 13th episode (binge-watching).
- There's one major unsolved plot that I can't mention here because this is a spoiler-free review but it's not a big deal, you can still enjoy the ending.

An enthralling drama <3
To be honest I picked up this drama because of Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Shik, a pair I never knew I needed to ship! As I watched the drama I realised how much intriguing their character's life was for me and I wanted to find out the reasons behind their choices.

Story- 10/10
High school sweethearts meeting again to film a documentary again as the previous one went viral. So raw and pure. I loved that. I am really addicted to the concepts of second chances and I was lured into due to that haha! I had to give it A 10. I was so much invested in this plot and till the end it didn't disappoint me. It was magical. Every character had their own stories to tell and I was very happy to hear that from each of them. The story was realistic and I could empathize with their feelings when they felt happy, sad or mad. It was all so beautifully portrayed! I truly adored it.

Cast- 10/10
I have seen Kim da Mi in Itaewon so I was actually excited to watch her in this. Now I don't think I can see anyone else doing the role of Yeon Soo as better as her. Same goes for Choi Woo Shik (irresistible Choi Woong) . I haven't seen his any other drama yet but now I will surely add his drama in my watchlist! He was adorable but the most important aspect of his character was neatly portrayed. Not going to ignore Kim Sung Chul (our lovely Ji woong) and Roh Jeong Eui ( our sweet NJ) since their stories were equally and beautifully portrayed through the plot, making us love them much more by the end of the drama. I liked how all supporting characters were given equally screen time for their stories to be narrated in front of audience. I personally could relate to Yeon Soo and felt her emotion through. It was endearing to see such a great cast.

Music -10/10
Okay so I had already decided to give music section a 10 right after I heard the intro song ""Our beloved summer"" by Kim Kyung Hee. That's how captivating it was! The music was beyond my expectations and I love all the soundtracks played. They were played accurately when it was necessary. It was not excessive nor too less. Since I love music personally I adored all the songs.

Rewatch Value -10/10
Let me tell you the reason. It is simple. This k-drama has that power to make you rewatch it again and again. I am not a fan of rewatching kdramas or literally anything but I feel I can rewatch this drama easily. I loved it that much that I would love to go through the same feelings and venture through the story of Yeon Soo and Choi Woong again and again. They have that effect on me. Maybe it is because of the plot, realistic yet beautiful. The messages in this kdrama were actually valuable. Besides, who would not want to watch two people who were once in love, meet again in different circumstances and understand the reasons behind their fallout in the first place?

Overall- 10/10
I would recommend this for people who like to view a realistic approach of the feelings one have for another one. I could feel the rawness and pureness of the characters and so people who seem to like that touch to a drama may enjoy it! And also who enjoys stories of second leads and side couples. I surely did love them. This drama made me feel emotions. It was relatable and touching for me.

Ps: this is my second review I have ever given and I might make corrections as times passes by (Sorry if I made any mistakes). Till then happy watching :) <3

this drama is so beautiful!
I can say that Our Beloved Summer is the best drama I‚Äôve ever watched.

This drama is so well written. The chemistry between the actors is on another level. There are bitter moments, sweet moments, funny moments. You can enjoy it all in this drama. The cinematography and the ost are masterpiece. A lot of lessons you can find in this drama and I feel like I growth with them. All of the characters are lovable and because of the pov we can understand all of the characters feeling. The problem is so relatable. I don‚Äôt know, I just want to say that this drama is a masterpiece.

I actually started this after watching choi woo shik in parasite and the female lead in itaewon class,and i think its worth it no...no.. more than worth it
The documentary style story was good ,acting of the main cast and supporting cast was good
And the music takes the scenes to another level
I would totally love to watch it again
I dont know what happened to the documentary of ji ung and his mother or maybe i may have missed it,
Choi ung has everything when its money related but still something is missing and yeon su has problems since her childhood

Our Beloved Story
A collection of different seasons of life manifested by the wonderful characters in the story. The story was truly a breath of fresh air while It talks about family, friendship and love at its core. The pacing of the story was quite good truly a job well done to the authors, and writers. Also what was that OST it was so good and it set-up the mood of every scene it comes in. I was happy that we can witness both of them on a Romantic Comedy Drama because the chemistry was off-the-roof, it was so well performed. Overall the drama was quite relatable in some aspect of life that's why many people like it and some future watchers too. Where in the story was quite simple if looked individually but the meaning of all of it mashed together creates a broaden perspective on how life should be handle and how we must seek the everyday meaning of it. Because sometimes there will always be a meaning on everything that the seasons have thrown us. Its just that we must create our own summer too!. too feel the summer inside ones wintery heart. 10/10

My beloved drama
I have seen both of the leads in their previous movie called 'The Witch' , so I expected the chemistry to be lit. As I expected they never failed me. The chemistry Among them was 101%. They were perfect for each other's happiness and sorrows. The one to rely on.

Such a well written drama with perfect ending. I enjoyed the drama to the fullest. IG now it's a goodbye. 8 weeks was so much of fun and happiness and tears with them. I hope they win more awards for this drama as it's one of the best in my eyes. Kudos to the director, writer, actors, actresses and to the production team.

Refreshing Slice of life/Romance Drama
Absolutely top 3 fav dramas of all time!! It is a slice of life drama which I think is why it's not everyones cup of tea since it doesn't have a lot of dramatic plot points and can get slow but I loved it for the fact that it focused on character and relationship development. (Also just a sucker for good slice of life/exes to lovers/established relationship)
Story/characters
I think the strongest point of this drama is that you can relate to the characters so well bc they're very real in the sense that they are flawed in their own way but are living through life and trying to overcome the hurdles life throw at you. I adore how they ended up developing their relationship in a healthy manner and grew to be people that were able t o love each other fully again. I think it was very realistic how sometimes more than love you need to find and love yourself first before being in a relationship. I think the healthiest relationship is when two people are sure of who they are and what they want and know how to be themselves and they find a partner that only enhances those aspects in life and I think this is exactly why woong and yeonsu needed that break. To develop themselves as people and figure out who they are, what they want before being in a relationship again. Getting to know the side characters was also beautiful and the way the side characters were there as support rather than toxic competition was really refreshing, I ended up loving NJ so much in the end although she couldve been easily written as the toxic superstar, she was really the opposite, someone with a lot more layers than you expected. Also super stokes that Jiung ended up having his little happy ending as well;-;

Acting
I love choi wonshik and kim dami so much! their portrayal of these characters was amazing and it felt so real. All the supporting cast was also really well casted, overall acting was superb!

OSTs
Some of the best OST's in a drama I've heard in while!! It's very different vibes from your usual drama Ost ballads but it fits this story so well. I love Christmas tree and I did not know it was sung by V until a good 5 episodes in lol but damn did his voice fit this song and drama so well. The intro song was also lovely and I have most of the OST's in my playlist^^

TLDR
Extrememly well done slice of life drama that focuses on the characters and relationships and portrays them pretty realistically. Very refreshing characters and storyline as well, close to no toxidity/annoying drama tropes/characters. Acting is amazing and OST's are perfect and make this a well rounded, romantic slice of life drama that I'd highly recommend!

Old story, New Packaging
When you've watched many kdramas (romantic) there are just somethings you come to expect. You know the main leads have felt a sense of deep connection since their childhood/adolescence. You also know that the second ML barely has a chance with the FL. Our Beloved Summer plays along with similar tropes. What makes it different from other shows is how the story was executed, the documentary piece and detailed background story of all characters keeps the show fresh and watchable. The lead characters' acting and chemistry also works in its favor. What I didn't like about the show was that the finale seemed rushed. They didn't seem to care about tying all lose ends with the characters other than that of the ML and FL. I rarely feel that kdramas give closure to the second ML and this show is no exception. Also Kim Sung Cheol reminded me a little too much of Lee Sang Yi in Hometown Cha Cha, considering both their characters were documentary filmmakers too.

To sum it up, if you're looking for a light romantic story with great chemistry between the leads, you can consider watching OBS. It's pretty predictable storytelling but Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi do a good job. Oh, and Roh Jeong Eui was adorable. She needs her own show.

More than about First Love Reunited.
Completed - 2/26/2022 - 9.25 rating

This review is my very subjective interpretation of the drama and how it speaks to me. ‚ÄúOur Beloved Summer‚Äù moves me so much that my gut tells me it‚Äôs deserving of such a high rating. This is more than a love story about first love and second chances. It is about self-discovery, finding your own paths and living your chosen life.

When I binge-watched the first 7 episodes, I immediately knew that this was going to be a special drama. I could not exactly pinpoint why I like it so much. I am usually not a big fan of slice-of-life dramas as I find the pacing to be slow. Not with this drama. I can‚Äôt wait to tell Netflix to go to the next episode and skip that intro. I want to know what‚Äôs next.

I really enjoy the storytelling of this drama. Though it‚Äôs full of flashbacks, they are done in such a way that I do not find the flashbacks annoying. I enjoy the parallel storytelling of how the documentary was filmed 10 years ago, compared to the present. The high school bickering and sarcastic remarks are fun to watch. Even though our leads act like they dislike each other, you can‚Äôt deny the strong chemistry there.

When we are brought back to the present, you can feel all the suffering, longing and hurtful emotions the leads are feeling. The attraction is obviously there, yet it took them a long time to find a way to be honest with themselves and with each other. When Choi Woong and Yeon Soo are finally together, I was so happy for them. The audience is rewarded with really cute, sweet and loving moments. I am glad to see skinship with decent kissing as well. The initial breakup might be painful. But Choi Woong and Yeon Soo need the right timing and have to grow up to be a better version of themselves, before they become the match made-in-heaven.

Initially, I find the storyline about Kim Ji Woong and his mother to be out-of-place. It seems like I am watching a whole different drama that has nothing to do with our leads. Then I realized, this drama is not just about Choi Woong and Kook Yeon Soo. We also have a third character, the observer from 10 years ago and the observer again for this documentary. This is also Kim Ji Woong‚Äôs story.

We actually have three successful adults who seem to have conquered past challenges and grow up to be mature professionals. But deep down, they are lonely and broken. We have Yeon Soo who has to shoulder her family‚Äôs financial burden and suffers from an inferiority complex. We have Choi Woong who feels lonely and abandoned, and continues to struggle with these emotions, and also feeling unworthy of his parents' love. He‚Äôs trapped inside his own little world and unable to break out of it. Lastly, we have Ji Woong who is desperate for his mother‚Äôs love and attention, and continues to have a missing piece in his heart.

If I have to find one thing to criticize, it would be the continuous playing of songs. I actually really like the OST and all the songs. I just found them overplayed. I think I counted one episode where 3-4 songs were played almost back-to-back. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt need the music to tell me how to feel. It‚Äôs ok to have some silence when our leads are contemplating.

Other Observations:
1. I have seen Choi Wook Shik in other dramas before but I never found him that attractive. But he‚Äôs so adorkable in this drama. I really love his character and his cute and shy smile. What a sweet boyfriend!
2. I also enjoy seeing a more mature Kim Sung Cheol.
3. No annoying characters in this drama!
4. The color palette of the drama seems to be a little washed out or has a yellow tone. Is it me imagining it?

I wish my summer was beloved too
Feb. 20, 2022

Oh damn, another drama done on my ever-growing list of k-dramas. I can't believe it‚Äôs done. Our Beloved Summer is one of the few dramas where I will excuse the ""break up"" parts because it is so well thought out and not like those unnecessary breakups in other dramas.

The chemistry is splendid, I think that the male lead and female lead were able to convey the emotions needed. I like how the acting is just appropriate and the casts were not overacting or underacting. Also, the documentary movie was so cute as well. I kinda skipped it through while watching since I cannot find the subtitles. But I'll edit this review, once I find the subtitle for their move.

Ji-ung is the character that I have a lot to talk about. For me, I relate heavy to his story so maybe this is why he captured my heart and my attention throughout the whole series. Yes, it is hard to accept parents who have neglected you throughout your whole life. I also understand why he felt that way. I just wanna hug him so bad cause he needs it so much. Thank god, he was able to find some sense of family with Ung's parents. I really hope that Ji-ung was given a solid partner, but I'll settle for the hint that the directors gave away.

I guess the moral of the story is: cherish your life and live as if it is you're last...

My type of drama
I really love this drama. It's heartwarming and fun to watch. I don't know but I really have a thing with seeing two characters with a past and suddenly meeting again and sparkling their feelings which never really ended. I loved each and every character here. Gook Yeon Su was a character I can relate to in some way. She's seen as a strong, nonchalant, person but she's actually in pain and has a lot of sadness inside. Choi Ung on the other hand, was nice to see as he looks clueless, slow-witted, but definitely warm to people around him. I love how their love for each other bloomed after letting out their thoughts and emotions which were once untold. It makes me think that this kind of situation, actually happens in real life where a relationship falls apart because of misunderstanding and not being open to one another. I love how they lowkey care for each other even when they already broke up. I think they were the cutest! Can't get enough of them. The side characters were also fun to watch. Kim Ji Ung was not your toxic second lead who forces his way to the FL's heart. Rather, it was more realistic of them to focus his attention to his current situation; his loneliness and emptiness. I think it was a bit frustrating to watch that almost everyone has a sad story with them, but also, quite interesting and not over done. I think everyone was well written, with depth, interesting, and worth your time. I cried a couple of times and was feeling all emotional because this drama was well done. The reason why I'm not giving it a full rating because I admit, sometimes, I also felt like it was too sad for me as almost every character feels lonely and sad in the drama. But that's it! Setting that aside, I love everything about this drama. The cinematography, OSTs (try not to cry while they play challenge), plot, script, and the characters. It was an overall great watch to me. Might need to rewatch this in the future. Highly recommended.

Its like a soft summer breeze
i suggest you to watch all episodes without much gap, so that you will get that feel, Feles like a nice realstic story line , there no bad characters or bad people in the drama, kind of pure love story, from high school to adulthood.

Watching the drama feels like , spending time in nature,like i told like a cool summer breeze.

But the last episodes are good, but kind of felt like, little bit boring, i really felt sorry for the NJ character, i heard many fans supported a different story line, Korean dramas never stop doing these triangle love stories, it hurts when all the characters are good ones like in this drama

Just perfect and poetic!
I'm still in love with Our Beloved Summer. At first I wasn't that interested in the drama, but then, I begin to pay attention to all the details, the music, the silence, the image and the acting. So then, I got caught by the drama. It's a beautiful and subtle drama. I can now comprehend the silence between the main couple, it just make sense. And the actors have this chemistry I can't explain, it just fits in the drama. I just want to rewatch and register some pictures of this poetic drama in my mind.

KENA EMOTIONAL DAMAGE YANG LUAR BIASA AHAAAYYYYYYYY. DEMI ALLAH CAPE BGT NONTONNYA. KALO KATA ORANG SUNDA MAH, NYEREDET KANA HATE.

gue paling gasuka bangetttttttt cerita cinta segitiga di antara dua sahabat. terakhir gue nonton kisah serupa tuh di love alarm, tapi sama kaya obs ini, GUE TETEP GABISA BERENTI ALIAS KESEL TP GEMES JG HHHHHH.

secara keseluruhan our beloved summer emang apik banget sih. well written, semuanya dikupas habis tanpa meninggalkan lubang tanda tanya. dinamika plotnya cakeuppppp, lengkap! gemesnya ada, kesel dan gregetannya ada, sedihnya pun ada. penggunaan kedua‚îÄatau tiga kalau kim jiung juga termasuk‚îÄsudut pandang dari tokoh utamanya pas, ngga berat sebelah. character developmentnya juga keliatan walau pelan banget tapi ya masih dalam batas normal. tadinya kalo kook yeonsu masih nyebelin dari awal sampe akhir, gue pengen banget ngejambak rambutnya, tapi syukurnya dia berubah hohoho. selain itu kehadiran para pemeran pendukungnya juga sesuai porsi, ngga ada yang mendominasi. justru kemunculan mereka di semua scene nerbener mendukung ide cerita si pemeran utama.

visualnya cantik! vibes dan tone-nya kaya film-film indie korea, pastel pastel gitu. wardrobe pemeran utama (choi ung, kook yeonsu, sama kim jiung) juga cakeup cakeup. warnanya netral semua, jadi kesannya kaya matching aja gitu satu sama lain.

overall gue suka bangetngetngetttttttttt ahdhajsgajs sampe kebawa mimpi loh anjrit.

""coba nengok ke belakang""-nya choi ung ttep membekas di hati alias ga pernah gagal bikin gemes.

Cute and sweet
I rarely watch shows that are ongoing, since I prefer binge watching, but this was worth the wait each episode. I wasn't hanging from a thread in dire need of a continuation; I was content and quite intrigued.

The cast was really well picked. I've only ever seen the FL in Itaewon Class and it was really nice seeing her in this role. The story was great (not AMAZING but it did sum up a realistic childhood-to-adult-life relationship). The music was PERFECT. I have no complaints.

Everything ended quite nicely too and nothing seemed really forced. I recommend watching if you are looking for a lowkey, cute, modern, non-intense drama.

Nostalgia feeling with feel-good breeze
A romance drama about two grown adults who had their documentary shoot 10 years ago and relationship thereafter, which ended eventually. After 10 years, it happens once again and yes it feels nostalgic in every way.

The best thing about Our Beloved Summer that catches the eye is the cast. The charms of Kim Dami and Choi Woo Shik, who radiate youthful energy, fill up the screen, and the chemistry between the two naturally leads the story. The drama emphasizes the images of summer and thanks to this, the play‚Äôs overall atmosphere is full of freshness. Also it might feel relatable to many viewers' teenage life they lived.

The cast, whether be the lead or the supporting, had a great connection. The soundtrack is soothing and melodious which fits the setting of the drama. The story had depth, but it was fairly executed, if not efficiently. Also the supporting characters weren't given much exposure as one would have thought. Although it doesn't come close to other feel-good romance drama (like Hometown Cha Cha or When The Weather Is Fine), Our Beloved Summer manages to hold itself through freshness and nostalgic moments of reminiscing the good old teenage life.

To summarise, Our Beloved Summer ends itself as a dama that conveys the sweetness of love and the freshness of youth at the same time. It's effective enough to catch viewers' attention with it's fair, if not excellent story and screenplay.

My Rating : 6.5/10

Life Lessons
When I first saw this trailer for OBS, I saw it had both Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Shik and I immediately thought of The Witch: Subversion. While the trailer depicts this as a romcom, this is more on the slice of life side than it is romcom. It has romcom moments, but the overall message it sends can really resonate with anyone, which to me was in order to find happiness, you must be willing to forgive and let go. This is a very relatable drama as there's a bit of each character in all of us.

I have talked to some people I know that have watched it entirely and some of them only look at the surface level plot of the story, which is the relationship woes between Choi Ung and Kook Yeon Su and then critique them on what they should and shouldn't do. The core of their issues was communication, but as a viewer objectively, it's very easy to say ""Oh, just tell them, it's so easy!"" If you place yourself in their shoes and experience the kind of struggles/trauma they have, no, it's absolutely not as easy as just telling them straight up.

While the story is mainly about the ML/FL's relationship, but what this drama does very well is through the use of flashbacks, it places you, the viewer, in the character's shoes. You then understand WHY they did the things they did and HOW they became the person they are today. Near the end, when everything is revealed, you get the complete picture of the characters. When you connect all of the dots, you get why Yeon Su has so many walls built around her, you get why Choi Ung acts like he doesn't care when confronted with an issue, you get why Ji Ung has a one sided love for Yeon Su. It's a story of growth and development for them and really just about being an adult and going through life.

God is in the Details
Our Beloved Summer a.k.a That Year We Are isn't a drama that is flamboyant or dramatic in nature. This drama is not all that new or revolutionary in terms of the plot line since in my opinion there's so many dramas out there about relationship and love.

Where OBS drama excels is in the details and nuances in each episode - it's like watching a painter work - initially you don't see what is special about the painting but as is it worked into completion it becomes a magnificent piece of artwork. The cinematography, the acting, the story, the music are all brushstrokes that created this masterful and wonderful series that is Our Beloved Summer.

I enjoyed this series because of the slow burn, it felt realistic and relatable. While watching it reminded me of another drama that tugs at my heartstrings ‚Äì Because This Is My First Life, I feel if you enjoyed BTIMFL you would also thoroughly enjoy OBS and vice versa.

OBS shows the growth of the characters as time passes and it‚Äôs executed very well. Each episode serving as a chapter that's strung into one beautiful book. The feelings that I get as the writer portrays each episode leaves me anticipating the next.
OBS revolves majority around the main lead's romance but it's also so much more than that. It‚Äôs the relationship not only between lovers but also friends and families and each person life struggles that provides viewers an insight into each of the main characters. The transition through the seasons beautifully weaves into the story of the main characters and by the end of episode 16 I know I will come back to re-watch this drama and it is now shelved as one of my favourites to watch of all time.

The feeling of true love is indeed timeless :)
Love and affection towards a person does not necessarily depend on some quality of your lover, but the person itself - that's what was beautifully demonstrated through this drama. From the time of teenage to adulthood, both Choi Ung and Kook Yeon-su went through several transitions of personality, perspective, environment and struggles but what never changed was how they felt for each other all these times even though they were not together for 5yrs in between. What I loved about this drama is the portrayal of a very important message that seem to be overlooked by most people these days - the feeling of love is about the thought and emotion that you feel towards a person and has nothing to do with materialistic achievements or fame.

I absolutely loved the scenes when both the leads were shooting their documentaries during teenage time and their late 20s, I loved how beautifully the story, thoughts and perspectives of all characters were shown in the drama and honestly speaking, the way each characters expressed their thoughts and emotions to each other in few different episodes really brought tears to my eyes. For some weird reason, few parts of these stories felt very relatable to me. How we feel love and see love during our teenage time is not exactly the way we do when we gradually grow up and life happens.

If you looking forward to a heartwarming romantic drama with a bit of fun, this drama is definitely for you. I bet you'll enjoy the transitions of the characters' personality, thoughts and the way they expressed love to each other in this drama ^_^

I LOVE CHOI WONG AND YEONSU‚ù§Ô∏è (SPOILERS!)
it's the first time that I am sooooooooo invested in a kdrama. When I watched the first episode, I was really hooked on the plot. I don't get why some people don't like the concept of the documentary? I mean through these interviews and scenes you can clearly see the character development and how they have changed (in a positive way). My favorite scene from the documentary was when they were at the cafeteria and choi wong accidentally spilled the sausage on yeonsu¬¥s shirt, it was so fun to watch and how yeonsu took revenge on him xD. I always find enemies to lovers very interstering to watch.
Some may not like how ""slow-paced"" the drama was but tbh in the way, it seemed more realistic. I know a lot of people hated on choi wong since he wanted to be friends with yeonsu instead of getting together again. This is due to the fact that he was abandoned by his biological father and he was afraid of being abandoned by yeonsu again :(
Now moving on to the acting/cast, wongie and yeonsu¬¥s chemistry was on another level, I saw some comments on TikTok saying that they can't stand the couple .o you are definitely wrong idk what you are doing with your life. The last scene in episode 11 where yeonsu and wongie ate in a restaurant made me cry so much if you didn't cry at this scene, I would assume that you don't have feelings lol after they got together, these cute scenes I WAS DYING every time. They were so CUTE together . I also liked the ending of the drama, I cried two to three times, at that point yeonsu finally became happy and realized that her life wasn't bad at all and that she always had people supporting her :((( However, I wished that there were more scenes of jiwong and chaeran together!! Even though we know that they have a happy ending but they could have shown us more from them
Not to mention the ost, it was sooooo good especially the intro WOWOWOWOWOWOWOOWO (I liked this wowowowo part a lot lol) and it fits the healing concept of the drama. Everything of the drama was just perfect, the cinematography so so beautiful and how they included features of four seasons, the director had taste :)

I really hope that Wooshik and Dami will film another movie or drama together. I usually don't ship actors but their chemistry is so strong! I will surely rewatch our beloved summer again <3

Mature relationship does not take overnight
If you are a spectator that wants instant comeback to every break-ups, then this might not be for you but it's worth the wait.

This is definitely a slow-burn romance drama that deals with how Yeon-su and Ung finds each other again after an awful and sudden break-up from a long-term relationship that started after filming a hit summer documentary. What I got hooked into this drama is how you see each characters grow from their own wounds, shallow to deep ones.

At first, it might seem to be just a childish misunderstanding that resulted to parting ways but a long the way, trust me it is more than that. I know how cute and adorable they were after the documentary that with will made you wonder, ""what went wrong?""

The drama did not also neglect to include the problems that could arise in a relationship‚Äîwhat it feels to be in an unrequited or forbidden love. Some may also experienced these when they fell in-love that made the drama more relatable.

The director and writer really displayed a deep narrative on what a pure love away from a sexual representation. I'll definitely recommend this since it's been a while since I've watch a soft romance drama but watch out you might be hopeless romantic after.

Amazing story, amazing characters, overall amazing
This drama had me on the edge with every episode and told an amazing story. I couldn‚Äôt believe how much I could be attached to every single character in this drama. It follows what I think love should feel. It‚Äôs quiet, safe, full of life, and comforting. It‚Äôs a mix of romcom and coming to age genre as it follows how life can have its ups and down and how strong unconditional love could be. Hands down, this is one of the best stories I have ever followed.

*Spoiler*
I love how they portrayed that Ung was finally able to say I love you to Yeonsu when he finally grew and learned how to love himself. v

Love language!
By far I really enjoyed watching this Kdrama. Am amazed and in awe at how they understand each other love language although they always let their ego gets the best of them! Yes, they both are egos but not like any other ego couple that cant put two and two together okay. I am attached to this Kdrama. I don't want it to end but am excited to see how it ends!! You feel me? If any of you are in the mood to watch K drama but don't know where to or what to watch, Our Beloved Summer is definitely a good start for you!

JUST GO FOR IT!
I would totally recommend this drama to anyone who loves a slow pacing drama. Eventhough it's not that slow as well. For me it's the perfect pacing. The characters portrayed are human I'd say. They have their own flaws. I love how they make mistakes and works through them. People make mistakes and the point is that what you do to correct them. A regular rom-com drama with a new setting. I love how they showed everyone and their past and perspectives. All of the actors did an amazing job. The musics were on point; in love with all the ost's. Some of the parts in the story need a little bit development. Some of the episodes felt rushed while others felt slow. Especially the last ones; somewhere it felt quite rushed. But still the closing was perfect. This is one of those drama you should go without expecting anything and love every bit of it. That's how it was for me.

OKAY EVERYTHING WAS TOTALLY MY OPINION.

One time watchable. Give it a try.
Storywise nothing new in it. Its all about storytelling and characters. ML, FL characters written with depth. I like both of these characters very much. But disappointed with ending. They gave same typical ending with ml foreign returned and matured perfect person and ask fl can u marry me and happy ending.

2ml jiung character is drawn out for 16 episodes. First i pited but later i even don't care about him.

2fl nj is completely wasted.

As i only see characters i cant comment on acting. Idc they are good looking or not.

L‚Äôamour est la po√©sie des sens ~ Love is the poetry of the senses <3
This drama took me by surprise.
I didn't watch it as soon as it started airing but after seeing an edit of instagram about the characters I had to take a look.
I was hooked from the start. I have eagerly awaited Mondays and Tuesdays ever since I started the drama. Watching this drama became the highlight of my week. I think it's fair to say it is now my all time favourite. Which to be honest is strange, as I usually lean more towards things with action/thrill as well as romance. I just ended up loving every part of this drama.

The story was phenomenal. Each character played an important role and each character was a joy to watch over the course of the show. Their story arcs were unique, interesting and filled with the rawness of true emotions. I liked the jumping between the past and the present, slowly piecing together the whole story and I loved the documentary aspect to the drama. I also loved the artistic part of the story linked to Choi Woong. I thought it added a depth to his character and his story.

The cast were incredible. I thought everyone did a superb job at playing the character they had been given. I could not and would not want to see anyone else play these fantastic characters. From Kim Da Mi to Park Jin Too and back to Choi Woo Shik everyone was amazing at bringing the characters to life.

The music was unique and beautiful. From the intro to the hit Christmas Tree by V, each song added to the beauty of this drama. I for one have been listening to the music non-stop.

Like some kdrama watchers I struggle to re-watch a show all the way through again no matter how much I loved it. But I can see myself rewatching this drama very soon and loving it every bit as much.

So‚Ä¶ would I recommend this Korean drama? Yes, yes I would. That's not to say it would be for everyone because it definitely wouldn't suit some people's tastes. However, I would really recommend this if you are looking for a show with a gripping but beautiful storyline and deep and meaningful characters.

Surprisingly warm and cozy
I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. I went into this drama not expecting much but it surprised me in a good way.

I loved the format of the show. The documentary style point-of-view-switching between the characters. It gives us more insights about each characters that made them much more relatable to us. I am never this torn about who to root for between the leads. They are opposites but they sort of represent both of my extreme personalities. Most of the times, I feel like I'm Yeon Su struggling everything but sometimes I feel like I'm Ung who does not really want to care about my ambition.

The actors nailed their roles. I haven't seen much of any of them. Choi Woo Shik made a pretty good impression on me when I watched him in Parasite. Although I loved Itaewon Class, Kim Da Mi wasn't really someone I loved in that show. But here in this series, both of them sneaked to a little place in my heart.

I wished they could've shown us the documentary as some sort of special episodes though. I think it would be a nice bonus to the show.

...the emotions they displayed just with their eyes were enough to make me curl up & cry
PLOT :
Choi Ung & Yeon-su were high school sweethearts who suddenly broke up 5 years ago and have not been in contact since then but when a documentary which they did about the daily lives of 1st ranked high school student Yeon- su & last ranked student Choi Ung whose personalities completely clash with each other at that time becomes suddenly viral again in the present, the two ex-lovers are re-united again reluctantly and due to some circumstances they are asked to do another documentary about their present lives. As old wounds re-surface again, we get to explore the journey of their past which shaped their present, how they are coping with their adulthood which turned out different what they hoped it to be, their insecurities, their bickering, petty jealousy and revenge and if they are ready to move on from the past, grow up, forgive and maybe give themselves a chance again.

My REVIEW:
The premise of Our Beloved Summer is simple but what it excels at is character development, the chemistry & the art of subtlety. Rather than bombarding us with grand displays of emotions, it slowly nudges our heart and let our heart do the rest of the work because they know we will be able to relate to it and can feel what they are going through rather than trying to make us understand it to feel for them. And this art of not doing too much is risky because it can be hit & miss as many actors can't pull it off, so usually dramas take the other route. But, my God, Choi Woo Shik (Parasite) & Kim Dami (Itaewon Class) were up for it. The emotions they displayed just with their eyes were enough to make me curl up, cry and keep me awake at night, I don't think any other actors could pull off this beautiful imperfect characters and their chemistry was off the charts. The anguish of their heartbreak & yearning for each other yet unable to move on from their past can be seen plainly by us, the viewers within their subtle ticks and features but yet we can see how they hid it from everyone else.

There is no one dimensional antagonist in this series. All the other characters are also normal humans who are also going through their pain and struggle and trying to cope with it, and live their life. We can probably relate to each characters because we can see that all of them are inherently good persons just dealing with their demons like the rest of us. I wish some of them had more character growth but still it was a better representation of the secondary characters than some other kdramas who are just there as a catalyst for the main characters.

The unique documentary styled editing with the combination of showing a same flashback of past from multiple perspective was ingenious, it showed multiple facets of different character‚Äôs point of view which has also enriched the viewing experience of this drama. I also loved the minimalistic indie approach by the director as in, they didn‚Äôt go in the direction of display of grandeur with a huge iconic scenic backdrop or soundtracks blaring every second when there is an iconic moment, instead they toned it down, let the actors do their part, used silence or slow song to drive the important turning point scenes so that it feels like we are in the moment with them and we are paying our full attention to them.

And if this drama is not already worthy to be a must watch, it hits off the park with the soundtrack. All the songs in the soundtrack are exquisite, they perfectly compliment the scenes they are used in.

I would like to end my very long review with the parting words that I absolutely loved the journey that I went with the characters of this drama, I cried and laughed with them and always rooted for them. This drama is definitely not for everyone but I will miss Yeon-su and Choi Ung a lot and my Mondays and Tuesdays will feel empty without them.

A warm, fuzzy, feel good drama
When I first saw the plot for this, I had no idea how the story would revolve around the documentary angle. But the previews and stills really got me interested.

May I just say that I love both the leads so much? They make a wonderful pairing! Despite their actual age, they can pass off as high schoolers. Character development from teens to working yuppies is portrayed well. Ung is someone I would love to have as a BF. He is totally devoid of ill intentions and has an easy going personality. Yeon Soo is a strong character who, despite the difficulties in life maintains a strong sense of responsibility.

Except for NJ, I loved everything about this drama. The setting, the cinematography, the narratives, dialogue, and the soundtrack.

If you want to watch something light but full of wonderful characters and emotions, this is definitely a MUST watch.

Our Beloved Summer
This drama is a piece of artwork. Some may argue that this is a slow-paced drama, but I disagree. I'll be honest, I never expected to become addicted to dramas, particularly those classified as ""rom-coms,"" but here I am. This drama doesn't feel like a rom-com (at least for me), because they hurt us every episode. (no cap) EP 11 is my favorite episode, and EP 8 is my favorite scene (which is also Dami's favorite scene). It just that even that simple gesture made everyone's heart flutter and I am one of them! Don't let a few bad reviews deter you from watching this! (Although, it's your choice.)

enemies to lovers to ex lovers to lovers again... made new
this is one of my new favorite dramas.

the story:
i absolutely loved both the plot itself and how it was presented. i think it portrays relationships (romantic, platonic, and self) in a more accurate way than some other dramas may. of course, it is still a drama, so some things aren't realistic, but that's part of the suspended disbelief: believing something is true even if it may seem impossible. we saw how being friends with your ex isn't some easy thing to do--it's difficult, especially when feelings are involved and you don't know what feelings they are. we saw how getting over a crush is difficult and how it's hard to control your feelings--but it's not your fault. we saw how mending broken relationships with parents is hard and sometimes you can't forgive. we saw how hard it can be to address your own feelings and experiences of guilt, abandonment, and loneliness/emptiness.
i really liked how the characters were able to narrate their thoughts in a natural way. it added a layer of depth to help understand their motivations. and even though sometimes i was screaming for them to just communicate!!!, i understood their reluctance.
the characters were amazing! i loved how three-dimensional they were and how different aspects of their lives were explored: romance, family, friends, career, and general self-improvement. like a normal person, they have various stories in their lives, and i liked how we got to see a bit into the side characters' lives as well.
there are really only 2 minor things that i didn't like: the use of fate/coincidences and the slightly rushed ending. the fact that ung happened to drop his phone the night yeonsu was talking about her difficulties and the fact that they lived in the same area but never saw each other for 5 years are among the plot points that bothered me a little bit. once again, bringing it back to suspended disbelief. also, there were a few stories that i wish they spent more time wrapping up: choi ung talking to his biological father (maybe just showing the scene?), chae ran and ji ung's relationship, sol-i and eun-ho's relationship, and the wedding scene why didn't we get that :(((( i know it's a lot to put in one episode, but i wish we could've seen it. at least we got a bit of married life <3

acting/cast:
i would like to hug the casting director and give them my warmest thanks for their work. literally everyone was casted so perfectly. i cannot imagine anyone else as yeonsu, ung, ji-ung, NJ, sol-i, eun-ho, chae ran, and everyone else.
wooshik's acting never fails to disappoint. the way his seemingly blank or sad expressions convey a much deeper level of feeling always gets to me. same with dami. you can see her thinking, and then it hits you. the actors all put on such emotional performances (with the exception of our comedic relief, eun-ho and sol-i, of course). i wish they had been given some ""real"" storylines, not just comedy and a supporting role. i know it's hard to develop so many characters, so i think the story was good with the time frame and those two actors did great with what they had. i hope to see them in future lead roles! i have to give a shout out to my personal favorite, jeon hye won (chae ran). obviously her character was more background here, but i think with a bigger role, i see her acting being amazing and i'd love to see more of her as well.

music:
the soundtrack is really lovely as well. the songs are so good and the way they're inserted into the tv show is just *chef's kiss*. also, it's so stacked! we got BIBI, V, and Sam Kim! plus OST icons 10cm and Janet Suhh!

final thoughts:
i am a sucker for tropes, i'll admit that. but i have standards hehe. and i think OBS took those tropes (enemies to lovers, ex lovers to lovers, etc.) and made them their own. they made it refreshing, lovely, wholesome, better, and all around amazing. these characters felt so real. i feel like i learned more about life, not just romance, watching this drama. and that's why i love it.

Not so complicated, youthful, refreshing and warm!
It‚Äôs like a refreshing summer drink. But it is also like a warm hot tea you drink when you‚Äôre cold. It‚Äôs a mix of everything. All the feels, scenes are so relatable and realistic!

The plot is simple but mixing everything together made this amazing drama. The documentary is kinda unique. The FL and ML reunion feels so natural. The break up was so painful that I felt like I‚Äôm going through it too.

I love that there is no Evil Parents. Well, there‚Äôs Yeonsu's grandma but she‚Äôs not that annoying. There‚Äôs also Ji Ung's Mom but they didn‚Äôt explain why she‚Äôs like that but we get the gist of it.

I love how all Actors portrayed their roles really well. Feels like each characters given to them are written for them.

Choi Woo Shik looks oh-SO fine! Choi Ung may pretend he doesn‚Äôt care or that he didn‚Äôt know but I think that‚Äôs his defense mechanism. I love how he is when he is with Yeonsu! They‚Äôre made for each other!

Kim Dami is a cutie. She looks really really young especially when she‚Äôs crying. Yeonsu's defense mechanism is acting tough. I think both Yeonsu and Ung need to develop on how they can open up not just with each other but also to other people. As they are both lacking on that aspect. And I hope it was shown more in the drama. Perhaps Season 2?

Kim Ji Woong, I just hope the writer made him a bit friendlier even only with Choi Ung. I feel like he secretly (even if he doesn‚Äôt want to) hates Ung. He envies him for having good parents and for having Yeonsu. But Ung treated him so well. So I just wished him to be friendlier with Ung. If you know what I mean. I just feel like he should have treated Ung better as Ung treated him the best he could!

NJ - I thought I'm gonna hate her BUT I JUST CAN'T. She is such a sweetheart. Even if Ung ends up with her I'm not gonna be mad. (Though it is obviously not possible as both Ung and Yeonsu are obsessed with each other. Haha.)

Ung's Parents- I love them! Their the best parents. Although I think they could have been more honest to Ung. I think they‚Äôre also the reason why Ung is kinda aloof with other people.

Eun ho and Sol i are both so cute. They‚Äôre the ones that bring comedic scenes here! Love them! I am already shipping them on their first encounter.

The OST is the BEST!!! Gonna add them on my playlist.

The ending? I am definitely satisfied! I expected a lot. I expected it to be sad so I won‚Äôt be too heart broken if eve but also hoping to have a happy ending. And they ended it so well!!!

I have so many positive things to say but it will be too long of a review so I‚Äôm gonna end it here! Season 2, please!

Not the best
This drama did not do much for me . It is enjoyable , well put together and beautifully filmed , but it failed to grab me .
The story line of the traumatic experiences that the past leaves you with is the kingpin of Korean Drama , and has been done before and better . The acting was not impressive either . Long silences and doleful looks , bland faces unable to express emotions . Sure they can cry and be tearful but their pretty faces do not always convey the intensity of their emotions .
I preferred the characters when they were teenagers , they had a bit more life in them then . As they grew more mature they seemed to have lost their stamina . The sub stories were far more interesting and entertaining and the comedy they provided very necessary . The story of friend Kim -Ji-woong grabbed me most . You could sense the tension , the agony , the struggle in him and I would have liked that story line to be better developed . The ending was rushed and cobbled together , loose ends Not satisfactory .

Slooooooooooooow but addictive so far
Slow burn is not slow enough to describe the show. It‚Äôs so full of cliches and so utterly predictable that you can safely guess whatever‚Äôs coming a mile away. The problem is that it takes soooo long for the story to unfold that you‚Äôre just sitting there tapping on your watch waiting for the show to catch up with you. This story definitely could‚Äôve been told in a few episodes but it just drags on.

Despite all that‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt get mad at them because I love the main characters. I get extremely frustrated with Ung-i because he‚Äôs so passive and slow-witted sometimes (appears to be at least) but he‚Äôs so likable.

We‚Äôll see what happens going forward. Hope everything will work out for everyone.

Stunning ‚Äî every time I watch another episode I reach greater heights of awe with this drama.

The relationship: I love the premise of FL & ML reuniting as ex-partners. It's something so little explored in kdramas, but it's a storyline near and dear to my heart. The tension with which they converse, the awkward familiarity with which they speak and act, and most importantly, the quiet way they care about each other so intimately, are the foundation of this series. Although it's established that their breakup wasn't amicable, their interactions aren't rancorous or acrimonious. The way they interact shows, even in the most sniping of interactions, how much love they still hold for one another. The two couldn't be more opposite: the FL as a driven, ambitious professional who constantly sprints ahead, the ML as a comfort-loving, goofy artist more than content to just stop and smell the roses. Yet, like yin and yang, the two complete each other, even if their journey back to each other is littered with obstacles.

I also love how the problems with their first breakup aren't brushed aside and miraculously solved ‚Äî it's clear that the issues leading to the cause of their first breakup need to be resolved, and it's the very thing preventing them from getting back together, in spite of their attraction. The show really works well at gelling the past and the present in this respect, displaying both the highs and lows in their previous relationship and the twists and turns due to such in their current story.

The actors: Chemistry, chemistry, chemistry. Perhaps it's because Choi Woo-shik and Kim Da-mi have worked together before, but the romantic tension between them and the ease in which they interact makes the drama so enjoyable. Notwithstanding their previous working relationship, it's clear that both are talented actors in their own right: watching even the first episode demonstrates the gamut of emotions that they can bring forth to portray these characters. I'm simply glad that such amazing actors with massively impressive acting credits already under their belt‚Äî Choi Woo-shik with Okja, Train to Busan & Parasite, Kim Da-mi with The Witch & Itaewon Class ‚Äî have come together to bring this script to life.

The parallels: If there's one thing I love as a literature person, it's this. Perhaps it's a little cliche, but the big moments in this series so far have been prefaced by important parallels to highlight their importance in their budding reunion. It's amazing to see how the director withholds certain cuts from scenes to insert in later & make the most impact, whilst you belatedly realise the poetic resemblance, have a 'aha' moment and watch on even more enraptured. My favourite nugget of information I realised recently is how each episode is named after a classic movie: sometimes tongue-in-cheek or in jest, but other times leading to a more profound reading of the episode.

The cinematography: As the actors have previously discussed in their press conference, the four seasons are exhibited wonderfully in this show. This becomes apparent as you go deeper into the drama ‚Äî the scenic shots, the picturesque views, the camera's interaction with both the city and countryside is nothing short of magical. The way that the seasons frame the FL & ML's relationship brings a welcomed level of depth into their story.

All in all, if you love romantic dramas, watch Our Beloved Summer. It's perhaps the best romantic drama I've watched ever. Even as a seasoned 'veteran' with 100 dramas or so under my belt. Even with just 8 episodes out. I guarantee you won't regret it.

PS. May be a little biased because I love this drama too much, but I haven't heard a bad word said about it from any other of my kdrama-loving friends.

Superb drama about entering the adult world, full of sensitivity and emotion.
Story:
Reunion 10 years later, of 2 high school students who had filmed a documentary ""the worst student, the best student"". Afterwards, they dated for 5 years, and broke up painfully. The television crew wants to make a new documentary ""what happened to them?"".

Cast:
All the actors are excellent and the CL takes us into an emotional whirlwind. The chemistry between these two is palpable, amazing, natural.

Technical:
The production is dynamic and we don't get lost in useless scenes, although the narration is slow and delicate at times. This allows you to soak up the atmosphere of this drama little by little, all in sensitivity, in humanity.
The images are beautiful (the Korean directors and cameramen have really acquired a unique know-how on this point).
The OSTs are beautiful, sweet, moving.

Conclusion:
A superb moving drama about the difficulties of entering the adult world, full of sensitivity and emotion.

Choi Woo Shik is honestly the cutest. And such an amazing actor! I think my favorite moments in this drama were his ""quirky"" reactions to pretty much anything. But the best part? Woong and his parents. There was so much love and affection and respect and I think theirs was the best family dynamic I've seen in a long time.

I must admit, though, that I liked the first half of this drama better than the second one. IMO, it was funnier and it kept me on the edge of my seat, the push and pull between Woong and Yeon Soo, the will they won't they was polished to perfection. Once they got together, though, it just... lost something. It was still very good, don't get me wrong, and the actors were keeping the standard high but some of the, well, spark was gone.

Some of my favorite moments were when Woong was sick and laid his head in his mother's lap. Or when she and Woong talked about Woong knowing about his past at the end. Or the genuine care that Woong showed to Ji Woong when Ji Woong was sick. Or... well, like I said, pretty much all Choi Woo Shik's scenes, what can I say. He's a truly marvelous actor!

Dont watch the first episode if you have to work the next day.
Story: 9/10
A heartwarming, funny yet sad story about a man and a womam (kinda) in love. (what a suprise?)
The romance is a clear 10/10 for me. Kim Da Mis acting is superb and Choi Woo Shik also plays his role to perfection. The dialogues are very well written and not once did it feel like the characters words and actions were incoherent. Why a 9 then? More below.

Music & Audio: 9/10
Theres nearly nothing to criticize here. All songs perfectly fit and push the emotions to another level. It does sometimes feel like the mixing is not perfect, but I believe that is a personal preference. The only minor problem with the music is that all the songs resemble each other, and theres never a big style deviation. While its understandable, at one point in the series they couldve used a change in the musics pace as a stylistic element.
Kinda sad they didnt.

Acting: 10/10: just perfect

Camera&Editing: 10/10
The emotions the series intends to deliver are perfectly delivered through flawless camerawork and impressive but subtle editing.

The only gripe I have with the Series is one of the Subplots. Feels a bit like Perrin from AWoT. It could have been a bit less, but its still okay.
-------

Highly Recommended: 9.5/10

Drama that will make you feel all sorts of emotions
This kdrama is so good. And I MEANT IT WHEN I SAY IT'S GOOD.
The character's story is so wholesome and the drama itself shows everyone's side of story which makes it 10000% better. You can also see that their acting was good because on ho they portrayed their roles which gave me butterflies T_T. This drama doesn't have the word 'boring' in its dictionary cuz I enjoyed everything. The slow burn romance was really good. Throughout the drama, I was constantly crying or laughing and I was also blushing cuz of the scenes. I can also relate so much to Yeon soo because she is the type of person who gets misunderstand every single time and all she needs was love and care and she always takes care of his grandma because she value her which is super cute. AND the male lead was such a standard. Like, I always wanted a man like him. Someone who will try to understand you and accept you all the time. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS SO DAMN GOOD T_T. I tear up every time there's like a flashback of them. Also the side characters was so sad too. They also have their own story which made me cry a lot. I really love this drama and I hope you watch it too

the story of a relationship that isn‚Äôt over yet
Woong and Yeon Soo had filmed a documentary when they were in school, which now has gone viral. So, years after their first camera encounter, and a long time after their painful breakup, the two will have to film its sequel.

Korean Drama Our Beloved Summer is a slice of life drama about a love story that has a more realistic approach to it. The drama is well constructed, revealing the past story slowly, while the characters are dealing with their current problems and emotions. And even though the love triangle was dimmed to not work, the slice of life vibes, with a more character-driven story, gave a refreshing approach to the love story.

The latter was a bittersweet romance, with an emphasis on the melodrama and few surprises when it came to its outcome and progress.However, towards the ending, the drama started showing its weaknesses. The couple, though they were mostly connected by their teary past, they didn‚Äôt have many things in common to keep them interesting for the viewer. Also, the story got more and more predictable and had few things to offer. In the end, it was more about miscommunication than drama.

Another culprit is the fact that the series founded the story on the logging for the main couple to get together. So, after that, the drama didn‚Äôt have anything else to say, though they could have explained Woong‚Äôs family situation more in-depth compared to the brush-off that happened.

Yeon Soo used to be the best student in her class. She was raised by her grandmother and she has always been struggling to survive financially, so she learned to be tough and built a nonchallenging character. Kim Da Mi‚Äòs comeback proves that she is a versatile actress. Woong is a quirky character who is a talented artist. He is closed up and he hardly opens up or makes friends, though he is an aloof young man. He is very emotional and sensitive.

Choi Woo Shik did a great job with his performance. Ji Woong is Woong‚Äôs friend. Due to their common name, he always lived under his shadow, though he never really envied him, due to Woong‚Äôs sweet character. Ji Woong is a lonely man who feels like he doesn‚Äôt fit in. Kim Sung Chul gave a quite emotional performance.

NJ is a famous idol who is always busy, but finds nothing to make her happy. She likes Woong, however, she gets disappointed that he doesn‚Äôt seem to be as interested in her. Roh Jeong Eui handled her character brilliantly.Sol Yi is Yeon Soo‚Äôs friend. She used to be a scriptwriter, but she quit and has opened a pub that isn‚Äôt doing so well. She is an energetic character, friendly and loyal.Park Jin Joo is dramaland‚Äôs favourite side character and she is always delightful.

The drama had a smooth OST and an enjoyable pace, that didn‚Äôt confuse with the back and forth.

My overall rating for the Korean Drama Our Beloved Summer is 7 out of 10. The drama managed to present the story in a clever, entertaining way.

Beautiful OST and Cinematography
First of all, very beautiful OSTs. The OSTs definitely carried the drama to a higher place. It is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in K-dramas.
The story of this drama revolves around the good parts and hard parts of being in a relationship. I think there were some relatable moments to it which makes you think back and ponder over them. The story was overall good. There were a lot of thing happening and they did a good job wrapping everything up in the end. I would say the story falls off a bit in the middle and the main characters literally switch their personality which was a bummer as I would've loved to see the female lead as she was in the first half of the drama, tough and strong. But it was still good and the change made sense. The side characters were good but they didn't have any character buildup to them, they were just there because they had to and for some comedy relief. Except for NJ. I loved NJ.
The cast and acting was good.
The Cinematography was good and made the drama that much more enjoyable.

This drama is not perfect but it did everything right and it paid off. This drama was overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend people to give it a watch.

Finding own self and How to be loved by our loved ones...........
OMG ! Like OMG ! Okay lets start from the start. I was eagerly waiting for this drama since it was rumored that choi woo sik and kim da mi would be starring in it together. I personally loved their chemistry in the witch so I really wanted to see them together in a rom-com. And santa gifted me 'Our beloved summer'.
The story is FANTASTIC. im not saying there are a lot of plot twists and stuff but it keeps you engaged so well. The directing and writing is FANTASTIC. it is always a difficult job when you are story telling the past and the present.
You can either show the past first and then tell the audience abt the present or you show the present and the past together which is not an easy job at all. I got to see flashbacks from the story whenever I needed. The balance between both those timelines was really good according to me the dramas pace was perfect. Not too slow nor too fast. Whenever I had a question while watching the drama it got answered the next moment. So I was never zoned out or it never happened that Idk why this is happening.
I love the character design for yeon su and choi ung. They were unique yet relatable. I could relate better with yeon su. The drama involves us so much with the characters that you slowly start to understand their point of views, decisions and habits etc. You start to live the characters through yeon su and ung. The conflict between these two is so great its like the saying 'opposites attract'. They both are extremely different but its really heartwarming to see them keeping their differences aside and embracing and loving each other as they are.
I really liked the documenatry that played a big role in helping viewers differentiate between the past and present. Also the documentary helped me understand how two people can have different memories and perspective of the same moment.
Dont even ask me about the second lead ji ung I really felt bad for him. He was suffering a lot be had a harsh childhood and craved for love, family but all's well that ends well. I really like how they ended it. With all the pieces of the art together.
Our beloved summer is full of romance, heartbreaks, patch ups, tension, humor. The new love story will give you butterflies while the sad moments will make you bawl your eyes. At the end it was a really fun journey for me ! And I would highly recommend this drama I had to write more but i'll only end up spoiling stuff for you. And if all those above paragraphs weren't enough for me to persuade you to watch it (it has a ost that was sung by V of BTS)??.
See im so helpful now go and watch it ! Im sure you'll love it

This review may contain spoilers
a second chance at romance
Can two people break up and fall in love once again to create a much stronger relationship? Our Beloved summer is about friendship and family, what creates a healthy relationship that has boundaries, taking responsibility of your own values while trying to not be a savior of another's.

I hate the prolonged misunderstanding plot, so a sole plot progressing material was that, I didn't have the best expectations and thought I would dislike it so much. but as you may see, although still not the best, it was a solid slow burn, glad that I did not rush watching it.

The drama is a study on human psychology, it showed how we can interpret and misinterpret certain events from the past differently. this is executed well in the drama, using different POV's of the character's in same situations.

we have basically no plot, just daily lives of our characters and their relationships, so lets talk about them.

NJ was a favorite of mine, she truly fell in love with Ung and had amazing character development in the show, it's just sad that she had to fall in love with someone who doesn't like her back, nothing on Ung but she needed a better ending than that, also had such little screen time when categorized as a main.

Yeonsu was hard to watch at first but grows with you overtime, Kim Dami was the reason I watched, so I'm glad seeing her amazing performance here. we start off seeing the character full of entitlement, a quote from a book I am reading perfectly described her ""I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment"". Because of her poor financial situation, she became lost and entitled but gets to understand and rest her insecurities before the credits roll.

Ji Ung was personally a relatable character, always on the background and could never tell what he really felt, pain in so many levels, adding to that is his horrible situation with family, it showed why noble sacrifice is terrible, we should always confront rejections and pain, not hide and cover from it.

in the show we have an artist + a producer as part of the main cast, so exceptional cinematography was expected, good techniques and uses of light, that rain kiss scene is still in my mind vividly. Music was amazing, I sooo loved ""Christmas Tree"" by V and ""Drawer"" by 10cm

during the end we are treated with a drawing of Yeon Su, which symbolizes that the loneliness and insecurity from drawing only buildings was no longer there, they were a couple the complimented each other, and made themselves a far better version. also ends with a marriage documentary, it was a clever ending after starting off in a high school documentary. I'd like to praise this show for it's uncoventional take on second chance romances, must watch!

Good enough
Korean Drama ""Our Beloved Summer"" is a slice of life love story that founds its success in the lingering feelings between two exs who have to work together after a long time.

The drama does a great job creating the perfect atmosphere, with the use of lighting being on point, the scenes were beautifully shot and executed and the OST was brilliantly selected. And true, the game between the two main characters was an intriguing one, with the yearning for them to be back together being the force prompting the interesting factor. However, when that one was taken out of the equation, the drama got tiring and lots of scenes were added that were unnecessary and only there to fill in. So, yes, the drama started pretty strong, but it got predictable and boring towards the end. It also left out the family situation of the main lead out, which was a plotline that could have been explored in more depth.

Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast, which was consisted of an all-star pallette.

So, overall, 7 out of 10.

So much potential, probably wasted??
So okay, I mostly liked this drama. I went into this looking for a comfort drama, nothing too challenging but emotional and warm, and mostly it fulfilled this role, but I could have been done so much better. I mean the actors we are really good, obviously Kim Da-Mi and Choi Woo- Shik were the most well known faces and I expected very good acting from them, but the rest of the cast was also pretty good. The premise was right up my alley, I love stories of lovers who lose eachother and then find their way back after they've grown and matured, LOVE IT. And the atmosphere was also very on point.
But often times I felt like there were gaps left without a reason, rushed storylines that never get proper closure, the last few episodes are sometimes boring even, and the finale felt so rushed! I hate that after decades of friendship Kim Ji-ung and Choi Ung never really air out all the stuff. Also Yeon-soo never really explaind the original break up to Choi Ung, I felt that was an important step. Idk, I just feel like something was missing, so much more could have been done with the characters, because I really liked most of them. I liked this, but the finale was really anti climactic and I don't really feel like rewatching this. Maybe ever.

Go into it with certain expectations
I'm coming out of this drama conflicted over how I feel about it. From a slice-of-life perspective, it's fantastic. The characters are all very well thought-out, from their backgrounds and histories to their personalities and how they react to the world around them. I think Woong himself is the best example of this, introduced as the kid in school with the worst grades whose only ambition is to live comfortably. Over the course of the drama, we get a lot of depth into how he really felt during that point in his life as well as how he feels in the current day, and there are a lot of layers to his character that you wouldn't expect if you were only to see the first few episodes. Yeon Soo also has these characteristics, though her side of things didn't pull at me the same way Woong's did.

The story has a bright cast of side characters, too, who make the world feel very lively and lived-in, and they wholeheartedly make the drama better. Except... the unfortunate reality is that they're underutilized. Early on they feel like they might be important, but as the episodes go on they lose their significance. I can't really say that any of their stories are left unfinished, but none of them were particularly satisfying. Ji Woong is the best example. Early on, we're shown just how close he is to Woong, we see them growing up together and later on we see them leaning on one another. But further into the show, that starts to fade. As they pull more and more focus on the main couple, they leave him behind to deal with this small, out-of-nowhere plot with his mother. His mother is important to his character to a degree, sure, but that's all that his story amounts to in the end and that was really disappointing to see. Certain aspects (spoilers - if you watch it, you'll know) felt like they were just thrown in to find a way to end his conflict, and his romance with his coworker, which was hinted at and hinted at, was resolved very briefly out of nowhere. All of the couples but the main one were like that. We could have gotten so much more out of these characters than what we did.

That doesn't mean I hated the show. I liked it, I just didn't love it. The show shone its brightest during the original flashback scenes. All of the high school content and the original documentary was a lot of fun. Woong and Yeon Soo were lively and funny and charming, and it really felt like something special. I honestly wish the rest of the drama could have kept that feeling going, because it just became a bit generic once their adulthood started. And for a drama whose premise centred around a follow-up documentary to the one they starred in during their high school years, it didn't seem to matter all too much to the plot.

Our Beloved Summer does have some really heart-wrenching moments. The characters are very human and sympathetic, and it plays its strengths well. But it's not perfect, and it could have done better. A good example of its shortcomings is the plagiarism incident that happens early on in the drama. Another artist goes on television and implies that Woong has plagiarised him, but when comparing both artworks it doesn't really become apparent how the work was allegedly plagiarised, other than (I think - don't remember too clearly) them being drawings of the same (or similar if I'm remembering incorrectly) building. The thing about buildings is that if they're drawn at the same viewing angle, those drawings will look pretty similar. It's a bold claim and one that's taken very seriously in the art world, but I couldn't see the plagiarism myself because of that and thought, well, maybe they'll point out how it was plagiarised. But they didn't. They introduced the conflict and used it to push their plot along and show different facets of their characters, but they didn't care about the plagiarism itself. Naturally, Woong did not plagiarise. If anything, I believe that the other artist plagiarised Woong, but what bothered me was that there didn't seem to be a reason for this claim to be believed. Woong didn't address it and it faded from the story. Like a lot of other subplots. It came in, caused some trouble, and then vanished without any real resolution.

So, watch Our Beloved Summer. It's cute, and they care a lot about their characters. Well, about the main 2. Like cute couple scenes? Watch it. Like slice-of-life? Watch it. Don't like things feeling half-finished? Well, then maybe this one isn't for you.

Disappointing story and characters
I really like CWS and though I didn‚Äôt like KDM in Itaewon Class, I was willing to give it a try. But I‚Äôm 10 episodes in and just barely hanging on.
CWS is too passive (yes I understand his character, but this is a drama and he lets KDM walk all over him) and KDM‚Äôs character is incredibly annoying.
If any of the characters would just share the tiniest bit of what they‚Äôre feeling the plot would fall apart. Or be resolved in half the episodes. I think that‚Äôs lazy writing.
It‚Äôs infuriating to see KDM be so rude to her ex when she‚Äôs the one who broke his heart. She only shows vulnerability around her grandmother and best friend. I know there‚Äôs more info that will be revealed but I can‚Äôt imagine CWS really wanting to be with someone who lied and broke his heart and never apologized.
CWS manages to stay likable through sheer sweetness. And I blame the writing for KDM‚Äôs frustrating character. I would love to see her play someone with less of a tough outer layer. Or someone with a genuine sense of humor.
I‚Äôll stick with OBS till the end because I‚Äôm a narrative junkie. But I will definitely be skipping sections and groaning with frustration.
Updates coming after I‚Äôve watched all 16 episodes.

one of my fav dramas so far
Everything about this drama is perfect so far. The acting is well done, the express the emotion perfectly. the story plot is simply but interesting enough to captivate viewers and pull them along for each episode, and even make views think about their own life and relationships. The beautiful cinematography makes it hard for viewers to look away, it help strengthens the mood and emotions in scenes, especially with the help of pathetic fallacy. Also looooovee the ost, v's voice is like a comforting hug after you feel the emotions portrayed in the drama. The only bad thing about this is having to wait every week, every episode makes me longing for the next. 10/10 would recommend this drama. only on ep 8 will alter when finished

Does everyone still loves the same person after 10 years?!
Maybe one day my desire to write this review will increase...

STORY ‚Äì the story is not very interesting. Even the characters are not interesting to me. The couple is cute, but that is it. The documentary about the top and the worst student is a great idea and it was funny. I cannot understand why those two would film again, after they broke up in such painful way‚Ä¶

ACTING/CAST ‚Äì the acting is ok. I do not understand the role of some characters and the importance in this drama.
Choi Woong is an artist that draws buildings, works for more than 12 hours per day and yet, he says that he is lazy. His artistic vein is not well explore‚Ä¶
His sweetheart broke up 5 years without tell him the reason and lives in the shadow of happiness‚Ä¶ He has great parents and a story behind that‚Ä¶
Kook Yeon Soo (Choi ex-girlfriend) is a hardworking woman that lives without any purpose, except, maybe, taking care of her grandmother. She lacks social skills.
Kim Ji Woong is Choi‚Äôs best friend, but also in love (even after 10!!!!!!! Years) with Choi‚Äôs ex-girlfriend. He is lonely and without family, enduring the pain of loving Yeon Soo and having an absent mother.
NJ ‚Äì the most interesting character for me and the only character I was rooting. Do not understand why she should be interested in a man that does not pay any attention to her, but‚Ä¶
Koo Eun Ho (Choi‚Äôs manager) and Lee Sol Yi (Yeon Soo‚Äôs best friend) are cute.

MUSIC ‚Äì I find one or 2 themes very good and well used in the drama.

REWATCH VALUE ‚Äì maybe some parts. Just to understand how Koreans endure 10 years loving someone, even when they do not see or even communicate with each other for more than 5 years.
OVERALL ‚Äì cute story, a nice warm ending but‚Ä¶ I think it is too long for the lack of depth in the story and the characters.

""People Crave for The Normal.""
As a person who enjoys binging thriller dramas, this one is sure to have ended up in my dropped/fast forward list had I tried binging it.

The very interesting discourses and comments regarding certain characters is what drove me to begin watching this drama. Slice of life dramas are not my fort√©. But, seeing such intense character analysis for a seemingly sunny drama was what made me curious.

Probably one of the most well loved dramas that premiered last year, ""Our Beloved Summer"" is the chronicles of Choi Ung and Kook Yeon Su, two vibrantly different personalities who are forcibly put together in high school to film a documentary. The Proximity Principle proved true and it's not long before their hateful relationship morphs into love. After a disastrously earth shaking break-up, they meet five years later. Now, grown up and absorbed in their own career paths, they are unexpectedly thrown together again. But, this time, both of them are determined to change for the better‚Ä¶

I suck at expressing emotions in general and have a penchant for accepting characters and the story as it is presented, hence watching this was personally a purely fun experience for me.

Be warned‚Ä¶ the slice-of-life tag doesn't lie.
The story follows the ordinary lives of both Yeon Su and Choi Ung along with one major supporting character (Kim Ji Ung).

Sticking true to the tag, it's the characters who are the soul of the story. Though it began with almost little to no emotional attachment from my side, I slowly grew attached to them by episode 14. There is not much purposeful happening with the plot, so, if you are a fan of strictly plot driven stories, this drama isn't for you.

Kook Yeon-Su can sit together with Kat from 10 Things I Hate About You and I wouldn't bat an eyelid. Studious and meticulous in every aspect, she sets vigorous boundaries and rules to who or whatever crosses her path. Including Choi Ung. She has an almost aggressive reaction to everyone, trenchant and assertive with her words‚Ä¶ which naturally makes her one of the most unlikeable students in her school.
I found her bravado tiring. But, the writers did a good job, taking time to explain her actions and errors.

Choi Ung is far from her strict good-girl regimen. He slacks off at class, is meek like a puppy and knows more social skills than Yeon Su. He understands what he has signed up for once he begins to date her. I loved how he was not driven by goals, but rather went with what his heart wanted.

The life outside their perfect bubble has an almost domino-like effect on them. These polar opposite duos had their own ways of expressing their emotions as a result. Yeon Su was more on the *tell* side of the sphere whereas Choi Ung was on the *show* side. They each await empathic responses to unasked questions. To me, this lack of understanding and failure to express themselves was the prime reason for their break up. Now, as adults, their tables have turned. They are much more aware of their mistakes and are ready to accept the error of their ways.

40% of the drama is seen partially through the eyes of the Documentary Producer, Kim Ji Ung, Choi Ung's best friend. He was a character whose presence was pivotal in understanding the leading ones. We see a deeper side of Choi Ung through him, his own personal troubles, his support and ear for Yeon Su, the rapport with his workplace colleagues‚Ä¶ even Ung's manager and Sol - I were important.

NJ, an idol, felt really out of place. She was not annoying‚Ä¶ but I didn't understand why there was so much time being invested in her story, which could literally be spliced out and kept as a different special episode. Her presence did incite major changes to certain characters, but I felt that the writers failed to portray her with more depth or importance. The main reason seems to be her lack of interaction with the major characters.

It's the actors who breathed life into the chara ters. They lived them. Even the minor ones. Choi Woo Shik was mind blowing in portraying the very insoucient Choi Ung. Rather than appearing lifeless and boring, he was vibrant and unique. Kim Da Mi had less internal monologues than Choi Ung, but the process of unwrapping her various layers was smoothly portrayed.

I didn't find the drama too funny, though. There were a few slapstick comedy scenes, but there was always a serious shadow in the background for more than half of the drama.

The soundtrack was overall pleasant to listen to with ""Home"" and ""Christmas Tree"" being my favorites along with the opening theme by Kim Hwan Hee.

It's a drama that I'm sure I'll probably never rewatch. But, sometimes you stumble upon a coin on the road and check it out.
As Mr. Park said to Ji Ung, people crave for the 'ordinary'. And so do I.

Should‚Äôve been shorter.
If you‚Äôre not going to give us character development and more depth to the plot, then keep the drama short. It was fun and entertaining at the start, but the conflict everything revolves around of is not really that great. I think it would have been better if it had like 12 episodes. I eventually stopped caring about the main leads because of how little they change, they slowly stopped being likable, they just kept doing the same mistakes, the drama reused the same memories to justify their love story. We get it, they‚Äôre gonna end up together no matter what, but give us at least real situations that they can learn something from. In the last episodes I just kept watching because I founded Ji Woong‚Äôs story interesting.
Visually speaking it was really beautiful, those visuals deserved a better story.

First of all, I wanna thank them for telling the story in a very beautiful way. Almost every single thing in this drama is beautiful. The storyline, the characters, the vibes, the sets, the clothes, and the paintings!
The writer makes their character choose the most realistic choice in their life. And the directing just fits in my eyes and my heart, they know so well about what the viewer wants to see through their character. So, although the main love story is quite common, I enjoy it very happily. I smile after finishing each episodes.
Our Beloved Summer will stay in our heart for a long time.

Pretty good, overall nicely done.
This drama turned out pretty good. It wasn't really on my radar, but it kept popping up in my feeds, so I decided to give it a watch as the general premise sounded at least somewhat alluring.

Towards ep14 I was feeling like they should just wrap it up but the last 2 episodes did have some good moments.

My biggest problem with this drama was the 2nd FL, the character added barely anything to this drama. Through and through, I would class this as a drama with just one couple in mind. the 2nd FL has this whole backstory and persona built up making you feel bad about her and giving her a rich character but not actually using her for the story. You get somewhat of a 2nd lead syndrome but nothing serious like School 2015 *cough *cough. Either way any screen time she had just made me feel bad makes me want to go rewatch YAMG which keeps the main couple in focus at all times and brings 2nd FL/ML in only for short moments and doesn't develop their characters that much. Or Intense Love for that Celeb x ""normal person"" drama which you wish NJ could get.

The music was quite good and did bring out emotions from me so no problems with it. But when it comes to rewatch value as I stated above the interest just dwindled from ep14 and onwards. Usually rewatch dramas are the ones that keep me hooked to the end. But overall it was a enjoyable watch with a interesting story definitely worth checking out but it's not going to top any of my charts. 8/10

I should have loved this
I wanted to love this. When I came across it on Netflix right after watching Hometown Cha Cha Cha, I thought it would be the perfect substitute with similar vibes. I was wrong.
I know Our Beloved Summer is a well-made drama. I can see it through the acting, structure, story and other characteristics. However, I couldn't help but feel disengaged by it. I wanted to fall in love with the story really badly, but I was left hanging. I don't really blame the drama, I think this is on me. To each their own.
I love Choi Woo-shik and he was really good in this.
But yeah, overall, I wish I had loved this like everybody else.

The first episode hooked me up, then the next ones made consider not continuing it. I was skeptical of Kim Da mi's acting and I was afraid they were going to box her character as a cold hearted and nonchalant person. Thankfully, she ended up gaining my approval and I came to really like how the writers treated her character. I could really sympathize with her trauma with poverty and her commitment and love for her grandmother. Now that I mentioned trauma, as a psychology major I loved the way the writers incorporated and treated certain concepts like abandonment and the inner child. With Yeonsu and Ungs relationship, I like how it developed slowly. However, sometimes it gets confusing to understand why Ung loved her so much considering she used to nag and criticize him often. I wouldn't recommended this to someone wanting to see a bunch of romantic and cute scenes but I don't mind that we didn't get that. I liked how the drama focused on the developments of Yeonsu and Ung as people. Now onto the things I didn't like: the whole NJ storyline. It was boring and I found myself skipping some of the scenes. I found her character unique yet annoying. Thought I appreciate how the writers didn't make her act jealous or malicious. Also, I didn't enjoy the plot line of the other Ung and his mother. It felt pointless. I wish they would have done something else with this character. However, Kim Sung Cheol's acting impressed me and I'm slowly becoming a fan of his. Overall, even thought the start was rocky this drama was very enjoyable and it has unique approaches to the korean drama formula.

A drama that tugs at your heartstrings
Our Beloved Summer chronicles the two lives of Choi Woong and Kook Yeon Soo as they meet in high school while filming a documentary, fall in love and then meet again 10 years later post a painful breakup and after having no contact for 5 years. The story alternates between present day and the past as you find out what happened between them and as there are new developments in their relationship in present day.

While it is a romance drama, the show also really dived into both of their individual lives and what made the characters who they were... their upbringing, their family, the way that they present themselves to the world and how that was a result of their history. It's definitely an emotional show and I feel like I cried a lot but you do really get to know the characters and they all grow so much.

I liked the friendship between the two ""Woongs"" and it was so heartwarming seeing how Choi Woong welcomed Ji Woong into his family and pretty much gave him a home. I was NOT expecting the big plot twist / reveal near the end but my boyfriend predicted it so maybe I'm just not good at picking up subtle hints. Regardless I feel like the writers / director were very clever with how they chose to reveal things and with the flow of the show.

Even before I watched the show, I listened to Christmas Tree by V because it was so popular and it really did fit the show so well. Beloved Summer has probably one of the best OSTs I can recall in recent shows that I've watched.

I also liked NJ's character a lot. She was really fun and I looked forward to her scenes and how they added to the story. I also like that she was a decent person, despite being the second female lead and she didn't do anything shady.

A warm hug of a drama to provide comfort this winter
Initially I wasn't planning to write a review but GOD this is so good.
Ep 6 had me crying, screaming, throwing up so let's get into it.

Storyline:
It sets such a different tone to the drama as a whole. The whole idea of ex-lovers uniting after 10 years to reshoot a documentary is so fresh but it had me questioning how it would realistically be possible to convince them to do it. The drama explains it perfectly and additionally makes it entertaining. There are a lot of tropes (it's a romcom what else would you expect) but it's used so perfectly, that it doesn't make you cringe or make it seem 'ordinary'. The main characters are beautifully written, making you sympathize with them for their circumstances and decisions. Yeonsoo is your cold, logical female protagonist who makes small gestures to her loved ones, completely opposite when you compare her with Ung who is laid-back, impulsive and sensitive (in the best way possible). It's so so enjoyable to watch them banter. Kim sungcheol's Jiung is a wonderful character who's personality falls in the middle of both Yeonsoo's and Ung's with his story. There are additional side characters who you love and hate. I HAVE to mention Ung's parents who are literal angels. Something about how welcoming and warmhearted they are makes me tear up.

Cinematography:
It's so aesthetic. The sites where the scenes occur are all beautiful. The yellow filtering adds a beautiful nostalgic, film-like texture to it. The art work is brilliant and the transitions are pretty as well.

Soundtrack:
It's so beautiful and melodic. It just suits the drama perfectly. I love how V's track is the one that always plays during Ung's art scenes. My personal favorite has to be 10cm's 'Drawer'. That track is PERFECT. The little heartbeats before the instrumental starts? BEAUTIFUL.

Dialogue:
Ok I had to make this a separate section from storyline because of how painfully beautiful it is. Episode 6's ending broke me. That one line 'It's us of all people.' You hear that sound? Yeah that's my heart breaking. The contrast in how their dialogue matures, the words that are used in arguments all of it seems so natural. It's probably my favourite element of the drama after its storyline itself.

Acting:
The performances are as expected really good. Yeonsoo's character is something that Kim Dami embodies to the T. (not a spoiler) Than scene in the bathroom was so beautifully portrayed, it refuses to leave my mind. Choi Wooshik is perfect for Ung's character. He gives the character a certain flavor that makes him seem so charming, but I can't quite exactly place what it is. It was so enchanting to see how in the one episode where there's a little flashback montage of Ung's childhood, and I don't know if it was the child actor mirroring Wooshik's mannerisms as Ung or the other way around, but the resemblance is uncanny.

Rewatch value:
I'm resisting the urge to go rewatch it right now and just wait for future episodes. That should say enough.

It is possible to have way too much of a good thing
There are a ton of reviews for this show, so I wasn‚Äôt going to add to them, but I feel frustrated enough to want to write one. I‚Äôll try and make it short, in keeping with my critique!

I loved how this show started. Great characters, clever interweaving of flashbacks, beautiful unfolding of relationship etc etc. But as a writer I got really frustrated watching this. There is a natural arc for any story that you write and it has an appropriate length that does it justice. The perfect length states your case and leaves a clear impression in the viewer‚Äôs mind that is just enough for them to want to hold it in their hand and gaze at it a while longer, hopefully realising things for themselves, that lead them deeper. In my mind, this is the joy of a story. Not just what is told, but where it leads you afterwards.

However, in order to realise that goal, a writer needs to do two things:
1) have the message precise in their mind;
2) write only enough to illustrate it clearly.

Mostly, too much information is written and the job of editing is the delight of tightening and sharpening and chipping away until that message shines like a cut diamond. When you have cut sufficient away for the brilliance to emerge, then you have found the natural length of your story.

But dramas are commissioned and given a length: write a story that fills 16 episodes. What happens when you need to expand the story to fill the space allotted? Your diamond gets cut to fit the setting and instead of being sparkling and sharp, it becomes cloudy and dull. The writer tried to expand the beauty that was there and in the process went round and around and around the same material until it was trampled underfoot in the endless circularity that was all the middle episodes, by which time I was barely interested enough to follow it through to its inevitable conclusion.

If this had been an 8 or even a 10 episode drama, it could have rated at 8, no trouble. There was stuff that was good. The dialogue, the performances of the leads in particular, the sets, the cinematography, the drawings featured in the show... But sadly, it just has to be a flawed 6.5 for me.

The first 7 episode are excellent!
The first 7 episodes are excellent, but then everything becomes repetitive. Unfortunately,
toxic push and pull relationships are normal in real life, but unlike in real life, viewers don't want the relationship between the leads in this drama to be push and pull for most of the drama. I'm halfway through and I'm considering lowering my rating from a 9.5 to a 9. Outside of the on going push and pull relationship between the male and female lead characters, everything else is pretty great. I usually don't like male lead characters like the male lead in this drama, but the actor did so well, that I am enjoying his character.

I hope the storyline for episodes 9-16 will change a tad bit, we need a little variation.

Did not Meet Expectation
I had very big expectation for this Drama. I am very disappointed. I watched this show, all 7 episodes just for Kim Da Mi. If she was not in the show, I would have dropped it after the 1st show. I personally do not like shows with ton of flash backs. This show is littered with flash backs, which is irritating and annoying. I am not saying you should not have flash back in a show, there is a limit.

Flash Back when they were 7-8 years old,
Flash Back when they were in High School
Flash Back when they were in University
Flash Back from few days ago
Flash Back from a day ago
Flash Back from few minutes ago

You get the point. Every Episode has it. Absolutely annoying.

This story so far has no suspense no pull so they are manufacturing it by slicing and dicing the scenes and jumbling them so the audience cannot figure out what's going on. I believe they have achieved it and ruined the show. The story is simple, sometimes keeping it simple is much better than the alternative.

The more I think of it, it is becoming more and more frustrating. What a Shame!

What is so special in this story?
The idea of the drama is interesting, I managed to see the first 4 episodes, but, psychologically speaking, I saw an immature love, broken by the selfishness of the main heroine and the masochism of the main hero. Why the Korean public considered love in Nevertheless toxic, and here they feel butterflies in their stomachs, remains a mystery to me. She shows selfishness, expects to receive love without giving more than rarely, and he confuses attachment with love.
The actors are good, nothing more to say.

The Good:
‚å≤ The documentary concept
‚å≤ The sequencing of the major plot points (first half is more melo, the second half more romcom)
‚å≤ The docu flashback scenes are the best.
‚å≤ The romance, mostly (It's way more magical in Hogu's Love)
‚å≤ The chemistry between the two leads
‚å≤ The brilliant acting (If ML did variety, he could dethrone YJS in a few weeks & the FL is also incredible)
‚å≤ FL's cute chubby face
‚å≤ The bickering
‚å≤ The weak love triangles
‚å≤ The last 5 minutes of the drama (Had they spent 1-2 episodes on that 3rd documentary, I would have given the drama a 10/10 rating for sure, flaws be damned.)
‚å≤ The mild melancholia
‚å≤ The visuals
‚å≤ Despite all the stupid foreshadowing the leads stay together after they start dating again.
‚å≤ The rewatch value should be excellent with some FW buttoning.
‚å≤ The low key good OST

The Neutral:
‚å≤ NJ (I'm suspecting the actress was portraying Sulli & that made me quite sad)
‚å≤ Let's be friends! (Horrible plot device, but the ensuing romcom moments were good)
‚å≤ There were some well acted, but underutilized supporting characters.

The Bad:
‚å≤ The writing is not coherent, this is especially obvious if binge watching. (yay live filming)
‚å≤ The reasons for the initial breakup (I would have accepted ""pride"", but they just had to put a nooble reason spin on it)
‚å≤ The second ML's character feels misplaced & pointless. (Could have FW buttoned all his scenes for more enjoyment)
‚å≤ The last 3-4 episodes were sullied by the entire ""French Architect School"" plot. (Woong of all people is such a genius that he has become an architect/engineer in 2-3 years and then he went back to Korea to continue drawing for galleries and whatnot)
‚å≤ The story drags in the middle. (The writer pulled the breaks on romantic progress in jarring ways, because 16 episodes..)
‚å≤ The final episode is weak, sans the last 5 minutes. (It's not ruining anything, it's just whelming)
‚å≤ The audio quality is trash, don't bother with those planar headphones! (were all microphones bought at the 1$ store, then again even some of the songs sound horrifyingly low-fi, while some others are excellent)



--------------------------
I strongly recommend watching https://youtu.be/yxGomiIUN8s AFTER you are done with the drama. (it's only 2 minutes long)

Pretty but boring
This drama has beautiful cinematography and osts. The story in the beginning is fun and engaging. The cast is really really good. The main leads in particular are really able to deliver all their feelings. This is the best thing of this drama. You can feel all the three of them from the first scene. After a while though, I lost my curiosity as to how the story would end. It became boring. Each episode has noteworthy moments, but overall it was really challenging for me to make it all the way through the last episode.

Slow and aimless and fails to introduce new conflicts...

I knew from the first episode this show probably was not for me. I kept watching because 'secret longing' is a favorite character trope of mine, and if this show had a defining theme it's 'secret longing.'

But, even all the yearning and pained glances, couldn't keep me watching this. The conflicts are highly typical from the school portion: 'failure to communicate' 'absentee parents' and 'being looked down for being poor' and the adult portion: 'failure to communicate' 'insecurities and jealousies regarding failure/success.'

There's a lot of nostalgia for their school years that feels unearned. Indeed the flashbacks pick moments from all five years of their relationship and yet don't show any relationship development. No stray touches or being able to communicate in an easier way; there's no sense that the relationship was ever lived in.

A five year 'everyday relationship' is more than studying and a few school pranks and awkward and stilted interactions. But that's all we got in five hours, five hours is double the length of a movie!

Perhaps for some, the warm familiarity and predictability paired with better budget and cinematography is enough. For me, it felt too much like drifting without a compass.

Very lacklustre
I'm a huge fan of sappy KDs, so it took me by surprise when this one didn't hit me quite in the spot. The acting from each cast member was flawless, but the storyline and lack of character development in the earlier episodes was such a wasted opportunity. I think I must've only been 4-6 episodes in when I sort of wanted to give up watching. It also didn't help that I found NJ's character to be extremely superficial and annoying. It brought back memories of IU's character in the 2015 drama ""The Producer"", who I can't say I also liked. Anyways, I think the point I wanted to make was that if you're willing to sit through hours watching two former flames bickering, making up, acting petty, finding themselves through the lens of each other, and living very mundane lifestyles, then this is your kind of KD. I totally get that the themes of this KD is young love, forgiveness, self-development and rekindling, but what use is it if everyone nearing the age of 30 in the KD is going through teenage angst, and the characters do nothing but feign ignorance most of the time?

2019 Drama of the Year?
Be Melodramatic has the chops to compete for best drama of 2019. Airing on cable network JTBC, this drama went unnoticed, and it did not help itself with a rough start. The show quickly finds its footing and delivers a drama that perfectly encapsulates a 2010s romcom. It hits on multiple progressive themes with its female leads. On top of the premise, there is a thick layer of meta comedy which will have any experienced kdrama watcher rolling in laughter. Watch Be Melodramatic, which I prematurely crown the Best of 2019.

Story:
The story comes off a bit lukewarm and light on plot. One might think it is deserving of a ‚Äúslice of life‚Äù tag, but the plot of Be Melodramatic is surprisingly engaging, intertwining the drama with the drama within the drama. The sad surprise is the first three shaky episodes, to put it nicely. It really takes 4 episodes to bring the different pieces of the story together. That is why the MDL rating for Be Melodramatic has only been climbing with each week.

More important than the plot are the characters, specifically the trio of female leads. Again, the trio comes off a bit lukewarm on paper (especially in comparison to the fiery leads of another 2019 drama, Search: WWW), three women with a mashup of common quarter-life problems. Like real people, viewers need time to get to know the leads and grow to like them and their supporting cast.

As the leads strive to produce a drama with double digit ratings, Be Melodramatic struggled to surpass the 2% mark. Perhaps there is a general fatigue with the RomCom genre, but the show deserves more love. Even if the plot synopsis does not interest you, I can assure you that the meta comedy will have you goofy smiling through all 16 episodes.

Acting:
The acting in Be Melodramatic is one of the first signals that put it on my radar, the deadpan humor in the trailers and actor Ahn Jae Hong‚Äôs brand of comedy. On the other hand, the three female leads have a very short drama resume, the highlight being Argon from 2016. And what seems like a lighthearted comedy quickly turns into an acting challenge for the entire cast.

Once characters and stories are introduced, the show quickly digs deeper into each character and the different catalysts for their growth. Major props to Jeon Yeon Bin who brought her character, Lee Eun-Jung, to life.

The supporting cast also gets major screentime, even with a large ‚Äúmain‚Äù cast. Though they are treated with more of the lightheartedness and comedy, all of them bring an interesting, entertaining character to screen. This highlights the writer‚Äôs ability to create loveable characters and the cast‚Äôs (and casting director‚Äôs) ability to portray them.

Music:
The sound of Be Melodramatic is equally entertaining as the plot. There is a scene where the leads sing one of the OSTs, and I was dying with laughter. Be Melodramatic captures every aspect of the drama making process, including the music. Thoughtful is the word that comes top of mind when thinking back on Be Melodramatic.

However, the soundtrack of 2019 has been stellar with multiple drama OSTs topping the Korean charts, and Be Melodramatic cannot stand up to those powerhouses (looking at you, Hotel Del Luna OST). There is also a slight over-reliance on one song in particular, a song I loved, but a crutch nonetheless.

Rewatch Value:
2019 has been a solid year for Korean dramas, although I believe it rates worse than the past 3-4 years. Based on the shows currently airing and set to air in the final quarter of 2019, I can confidently say that Be Melodramatic will be top of the 2019 RomCom list. If some of the newer shows do not interest me, I might even rewatch Be Melodramatic before 2019 is over. Anyone with extra time during the 2019 holiday season, I recommend giving this drama a try.

This is my first review of a Korean drama - I just wanted people to know how cool this show is and to recommend to watch it.
I'm around 30, and this drama is exactly on point. It really is about millennials, our hardships and the best time of our lives.
I'm so glad I've decided to watch it.
I think it is a masterpiece.
It's not for everyone although - some people will think it's too boring or maybe won't get some storylines.
But if you're 30-ish, you MUST WATCH it.
Thank you so much for your work!
And please! I'd love to see season 2 :)

Dramas are made to create an embellished version of reality so we can enjoy it and relax and fantasize.
Which is why dramas trying to portray real life are often slower and not as entertaining.
The writing for this drama is pure GENIUS, a lot more real and mature, definitely a lot less cringy-cliche than most dramas out there but still manages to keep it sweet, funny and entertaining.
There was no epic confession or slow-mo dramatic moments but I felt so much emotions watching this drama. The comedy is ON POINT, I laughed so hard.
The actors are phenomenal and were able to keep this bittersweet melancholy that adulthood can bring while remaining funny.
The emotional parts have a very mature/real impression which I loved because for once, it wasn't overdone.
This drama doesn't have to be relatable, you dont have to be in your 30's to understand its message, it's just a very beautifuly done and slightly different slice of life drama with an OST that will stay stuck in your head for the next month.
I totally recommend it.

By far this has been my drama of the year. It is such a huge shame that it fell under the radar of the Korean audience. Be Melodramatic is equally funny as it is mature; the show continued to be a breath of fresh air right until it's last episode. As someone who's seen countless shows, it encapsulated exactly what I want out of a kdrama in 2019. Experienced kdrama viewers will love it's fourth wall breaking humour and unique scenarios. Although not without some flaws, it's meta humour and moments of true sincerity make this drama so charming that you can't help but love it's characters by the time you hit credits at episode 16.


Story:

Be Melodramatic deals with some big intrapersonal topics in the course of it's run and handles them so well that you truly feel the confusion and frustrations of each of the three main leads. It portrays the life of people on their late 20's in 2019 so perfectly. Admittedly the first couple of episodes are shaky and feel a bit too slice of life. Yet the show pays off its careful setup in spades as it progresses. Following it week by week felt like a old friend that you checked up on, listening to their ups and downs. The meta jokes invite you to laugh at the tropes of kdrama romcoms; it felt like someone on the inside giving you a nod of acknowledgement. Veterans of viewing kdramas will truly belly laugh at the references the show throws at you.

Within the show's sadder topics, it never felt contrived or manufactured. A problem I have with a lot of dramas is that it creates unbelievable scenarios just to create a sense of conflict within the show. Be Melodramatic never tries to fool you or insult the viewers intelligence. It laughs with you at the ridiculous moments and supports you when things get real. The progression of the show is a testament to the careful patience of the writers and directors.


Acting/Cast:

This show is cast pretty perfectly in my eyes. The three main leads are not giant names that instantly catch your attention but each of them portrayed their own stories so well. All three of the leads made you feel for their situations and gave each of the characters a true sense of reality.
Jeon Yeo Bin as Eun Jung especially shone in her role. Her's was the most tragic and seeped in emotion; but it never felt artificial or forced.

The supporting cast of the show is quite large all things considering. But each of them is given ample screen-time and development. I never found myself skipping their parts and was always happy to watch their own personal developments. All of the supporting cast played with the humour of the show well and gave the tongue in cheek comedy of the show life.


Music:

The OST fits into the puzzle of the show pretty damn well. Some contemporary and classic OST songs wiggle their way in at points in the show that give experienced kdrama watchers a nod and smile. The drama does lean on one song pretty heavily but it never felt unwelcome or repetitive for me. Although I didn't mind the repetition of that song, I do understand that it might feel a bit much for more OST-minded viewers. Though it does attempt to alleviate that by having different versions of the song.


Rewatch Value:

I know I'll be coming back to this show before 2019 ends and right now is my favourite release of the year. The writing and story-line are done with so much consideration, I felt like I lived with the characters throughout its run. I cannot recommend Be Melodramatic enough.

As usual, 2019 is packed with Romantic-Comedy dramas, and this drama is one of it. It's a challenge to produce and write Rom-Com dramas with a fresh approach due to the saturatedness of the genre. However, Be Melodramatic, with its wittiness and brilliant use of Meta Comedy, stands out in the pool.

However, it has failed to catch the attention of the viewers which resulted in low ratings despite having such edge. One of the challenges that this drama faced was enriching the characters while matching the pace. World and character building takes a lot of time which compromised viewership ratings for this drama.

The story started shakey but it was able to pick up once the story progressed. The stories of the characters were compelling and the build-up was done well.

Of course, the charm of this drama is the meta-comedy that it possesses. The awareness of the drama about itself was so genius. However, for non-fans, it might take a while to be able to understand the humor.

Everyone's acting was superb, but I loved Jeon Yeo Bin's interpretation of Eunjoo the most. She was able to interpret Eunjoo's multi-faceted character well. Ahn Jaehong never fails in delivering when it comes to comedic roles.

The OST is good but it lacks variety.

Over-all I must say that this drama is well-crafted and it's unfortunate that it fell under the radar. It's a refreshing drama that deserves the attention of everyone.

This is not a formula drama. What I mean by that is that unlike traditional dramas where the story and characters rely on a set formula or trajectory to show them where to go, this drama does it a little differently. There are premises, possibilities, seeming drama conventions set up in the beginning, some of which end the way you expect and some of which do not end up where you think they will. The drama itself has been described as slice of life, and while I don‚Äôt know if I totally agree with that label as the drama contains a concise journey for each of the characters all of whom change in some way over the course of the story, the style of storytelling has a very slice-of-life feel to it, so I understand why people would think of it that way. The story has an easy, relaxed way about it, which is definitely one of it‚Äôs selling points.

Personally, I came to like this drama a lot more than I initially expected, especially after seeing the first couple weeks of episodes. The female leads, with the exception of the single mother, start out‚Ä¶rather unlikable. They‚Äôre selfish and difficult and frustrating, and while I definitely empathized with them both and their struggles, I didn‚Äôt relate to them at all. But over the course of the drama, I started to appreciate both of these women better. Neither of them changed drastically by the end, although they did both go through a level of growth as people, but I came to understand them better. They‚Äôre both still unlikable in their own ways. They both still have personality flaws, but I came to like them because of that, not despite it. On the other hand, the single mother has somewhat of an opposite trajectory. She starts out seemingly sweet and thoughtful and somewhat meek before revealing a more layered view of herself that I can appreciate from a storytelling point of view, but that left me unsatisfied from a viewership standpoint. I don‚Äôt know that this ever made me dislike her as it was intriguing and enjoyable watching her reveal a strong, subtle confidence that lay underneath that surface level demureness, but at the same time, there was this feeling of selfishness in her character that I didn‚Äôt like very much.

I was particularly disappointed by how the writers chose to end the potential budding romance between the single mother and her co-worker. In a drama like this, I guess I should have expected as much to happen, but the sting certainly could have been lessened if they hadn‚Äôt left me feeling like he had been left with the short end of the stick. Her words to him at the end felt‚Ä¶harsh and unfair and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Overall though, I really enjoyed this drama. I‚Äôm nothing like these women, and I don‚Äôt know that I would ever be friends with women like them in real life, but I came to love all of them, despite and even Because of their flaws. They felt like real people with real personalities and real struggles and real hopes and goals and dreams. They felt human, and I appreciated being the chance to glimpse into their world for just a moment.

"" Be Melodramatic "" just didn't work for me.

Although the start was pretty good and the characters interesting, the drama got boring. They lacked the spark to keep everything interesting. Plus, the romance was corky which didn't help. Though, the characters were original, real and realistic. The performances were really good from all actors and actresses in the cast. Some of the side stories were interesting for a while as well. However, they had just too many stories to follow and they keep them entertaining for long.

So, overall, five out of ten.

I started this drama on a whim with no expectations; little did I know it would it turn into one of the best (if not the best) k-dramas of the year. This series follows the lives of three best friends and the people they interact with on a regular basis. Each character has a story that will capture your heart in different ways. You‚Äôll find yourself laughing hysterically at one scene, then being moved to tears during another. You‚Äôll expect one thing to happen but something completely different or insightful happens instead. I feel like everyone will be able to relate to at least one character. If there was one word to describe this drama it would be ‚Äúquirky‚Äù in the best way possible.

If you‚Äôve been looking for that perfect slice of life drama, look no further! Do yourself a favor and watch it now!!!

Most people are gonna say that this drama had a ""slow start"". While watching this, the only thing that kept popping in my mind was the thought ""damn, this is legitimately the best first 3 episodes of ANY drama ever"". I recommend watching this show just for those episodes alone. The show would be perfect except for a few downfalls it had at the second half of the series.

1. Some of the incredible comedic interactions were slightly replaced with some generic rom-com lovey dovey stuff
2. The ending for certain two characters did NOT make sense at all. It felt like the writer just tried to make a slightly bitter sweet ending with those two.

In all other aspects, this show was amazing.

This drama dissapointed me a bit, since the story wasn't evenly spread between the leads. I thought it would be more like Age of Youth, but with adults, but it wasn't the same at all. It was a drama with good pontential, but they weren't able to continue it, while it being interesting. I also think, Ji On's character was a good to make a very good storyline about his struggles, but they barely grazed the surface with it. It seemed like a waste of character if he wasn't going to have a proper storyline. Truly a shame, it could've been better.

After The Happily Ever After
the charming point of this drama was that it was it's own behind the scenes.. it was as if the characters were making their own drama..

this drama starts off with the aftermath of everyone's 1st love and the truth that not all 1st loves work out...
I've been complementing this drama ever since the 1st ep in the comment section, and now I'm kinda out of words ;)
basically this was a great slice of life with so many useful interesting side characters and a healthy dash of ""love triangles"" in each relationship...

I added lot of this drama's characters to my favorite lists, they are all so diverse‚ù§ and the girls (+ Hyo Bong)! it was as if I was living with them, as if I was a part of that beautifully knitted friendship.. I'll sincerely miss them...

The ost of this drama was another charming point, they really did a great job fitting each scene. and I think overall the ending was done well, in a world where I hate almost all endings, it was satisfying...
and I really highly recommend this, it's fresh and different with ALOT of beautifully hilarious comedic scenes! tbh, now that I remembered that point I think that was the best thing about this! this literally had THE best ""laugh out loud until you cry comedy"" and I LOVED that!

This one was such a big coup de coeur when it came out so I can't really explain why I left it on-hold for such a long time. The start had me quite early on, but something happened around the middle and I can't pinpoint exactly what. I still forced my way until the end and don't regret it. There is something warm-hearted in this drama, from our three female lead each presenting struggles of their own, to the supporting cast with their moment of shine, to the perfect music.
Unfortunately, I doubt this drama will make it to my rewatch list, but I don't regret ticking it off my list.

Fun and Unique but Not Perfect
I feel really conflicted after finishing this drama. On the one hand, it is unique and underrated -- you won't find your stereotypical Oppas, your comically evil villains, your Makjang conspirators, or other typical Kdrama stables. Instead, you'll see three women and their friends and family try to overcome adversity that life throws at them and feel good about it when they do. The show will give you that slice of life feeling while delivering warm, fuzzy, feelings as everything wraps up nicely in a bow. On the other hand, I found the ending to be rushed and slightly flawed, and that negated some of the warmness that I felt while watching the series.

In particular, I found the worse to be the way that Jae Hoon's plot ended: he was in a relationship with Ha Yoon that started off as a lovey-dovey honeymoon phase and escalated into a cold, incompatible relationship where Ha Yoon would literally go out and have sex with other guys, yet come back home to Jae Hoon for...reasons. The big climax of this storyline is that Jae Hoon has a heart to heart with his BFF/crush/boss, Han Joo, and realizes that the problem with the way he acted was that he idealized Ha Yoon and therefore didn't see his girlfriend for who she was and got angry when she didn't fit his ideal mold of a woman. And after that, he happens to run into Ha Yoon at a musical (which was originally one of Ha Yoon's interests that Jae Hoon learned to love over time) and there are hints that they begin with relationship anew. Excuse me, what? How can the main takeaway be ""don't idealize women. You need to love them for who they are"" yet one of the main issues with their relationship is that Ha Yoon would go out and have sex with other guys? I just...don't understand how these characters ended up in the ending position that they did. This alone reduces my rating of this show.

On the other hand, all the positives are stellar. There is a lot of meta-drama commentary with self-referential gags about PPL and drama cliches that are really funny -- I think the best example of how meta this is, is the hit ""Shampoo Song"" which is part of the OST, which stayed on the Melon charts for a really long time, and is ironically a song that Ahn Jae Hong's character hates because his ex wrote it and because it's so cliche. The acting is top notch: Jeon Yeo Bin in particular really killed it in my opinion, because she plays such an emotionally divided character: on the outside, Eun Jung is stoic and outspoken, freely sharing her thoughts to the point that it is offensive. Yet, when you get down to it, she is deeply caring, especially about her close friends and family, and the way that she heals is that she needs to learn to embrace the thoughts and feelings she's been holding in.

The way that the stories are interwoven are masterful. Eun Jung and So Min start off with an antagonistic relationship that is based off their outwardly ludicrous personalities and misunderstandings from the past. Yet, once Eun Jung starts doing a documentary on So Min, they are able to learn from each others' experiences - So Min is able to realize a love with her manager that she's been taking for granted while Eun Jung is able to do an introspective and come to terms with her dead fiance. Han Joo and Jae Hoon start as a sunbae-hoobae relationship that seems to have hints of a romance (it never comes to fruition). At the end, Han Joo is able to pass on her work and life experience for Jae Hoon to move up in the company ranks, while also dealing with his own relationship. In turn, Jae Hoon is able to show Han Joo the value of romance, which she had sort of cast to the side after her ex had left her pregnant and cynical about love. Jin Joo and Beom Soo are able to help each other get over their exes while learning how to still love each other, even if they have a strongly, yet productive antagonist work relationship.

At the end, I feel as deeply conflicted about this drama as some of the characters did about their problems. The atypical format, plot, and characters apparently drew low viewership to this show, which I think is a shame. The quality of it definitely makes it an underrated gem. Yet, at the same time, I think some of the conclusions do a disservice to the overall story -- in particular, the Jae Hoon-Ha Yoon relationship.

Because This Is My First Life's rightful successor
Melo is just one of those dramas you finish and you want to rewatch immediately. The cast is fantastic, the chemistry between all of them insane, their lives and stories completely relatable to anyone in their early 30s. It also deals with such heavy topics in such a light-hearted way that it feels a lot like life. Sometimes we come across problems that we cannot prioritize because we have work, relationships and people important to us to care about. Melo is all about sharing our problems with those people and growing together with them. Another thing I loved was the meta commentary. You will find references to drama productions we all know and love, jokes about product placement, some aegyo-bashing, self-references to the drama‚Äôs low ratings (it has now become an underground hit with young people thanks to its wonderful soundtrack) and even previous works of the cast.

So weird, yet so very perfect
Fresh and unique. Extremely fast paced. Not one moment is dull.

You have to pay attention because the writing is so clever and quick witted. Honestly, the dialogue zooms by and you have to read as fast as a cheetah.The humor might be a little weird, deadpan, and sarcastic, but that's probably why I liked it so much. I am not the type of person to laugh out loud, but I ended up doing just that while watching this drama. Honestly, there were lines that were so clever and funny that I rewinded to watch the scene again. Not only that, but I shed tears IN THE FIRST EPISODE. This drama tugged at my emotions within the first episode and continued to do so as the drama continued. Nothing like I've watch before, and it is so weird. So, so weird. But I truly loved it.

MUSIC: 100% in this category. There is one song that has like 7 different renditions and each one sounds amazing and fits the mood. I could not get that shampoo song out of my head.

ACTING: Can I call it acting, when it feels like the actors are the characters themselves? It felt so natural, never felt forced or cheesy imo. They all did an amazing job.

I'd definitely rewatch this. So many laughs. And it was incredibly unique and meta. I could've watched 50 episodes of this. I finished it in a couple days, and I was sad I had to say goodbye.

(I will admit tho, I found the last episode to be a bit weak, hence the 9.5 instead of 10. They could have ended the series way better, but I am hopeful for a season 2 so maybe they did not feel the need to exactly make the final episode feel like a final episode.)

All in all, Be Melodramatic is added to my Favorite Drama list. Watch it. You will not regret it.

What was the storyline here?
No, seriously, someone tell me what the storyline was supposed to be here, cause I still don't know. There were so many back stories and flashbacks going on. So many relationships developing left, right and center with no real sense of direction. And still, despite all that, the characters managed to do absolutely nothing for 60 minutes straight, in way too many episodes to count.

Not only was it not a comedy, it wasn't melodramatic either (looking at you, title). Heck, it wasn't even entertaining. I don't even mind the average looking male lead. Sure, let's have a realistic looking man fall in love for once, why not. But where's the chemistry? Where's the romance or the courtship or any semblance of relationship? People don't just become drones when they turn 30. Love can be passionate at any age.

And speaking of love, was the female lead Jin Joo supposed to be that rude and insufferable? Is that something we're supposed to admire and relate to, or do we just write it off as her ""quirky"" personality?

Honestly, at moments it was so awkward and try-hard, that it was too difficult to watch, let alone care about Eun Jung's storyline and road towards healing, which was the only interesting thing about this show.

Look, my point is if I can skip 10 minutes at a time and still not miss anything, it ain't the show for me.
If 5 episodes in the only semblance of romance is that they had a drunken one-night-stand and now refuse to talk to one another, it ain't the show for me.
And if after an entire day of watching I still can't relate to the female lead or even understand the reasoning behind her behaviour - it ain't the show for me.

Be Melodramatic! Damn this is a good one.

I really liked search WWW, and I thought that I would never see a better trio of female leads for the rest of my drama viewing life.

Then Be Melodramatic happens. These women might not have the same snap to them as the Search WWW cast, but the dialogue here is second to none. Every time they are just sitting around the couch and gossiping or philosophizing, I was completely sucked in to the conversation. That's not even something I am normally in to, but the writing is so damn good here.

Everything is here. Clever writing. Comedy that doesn't involve putting the character in a funny situation, but actually is derived from well written and delivered lines. Very little cliches, and when there are, they are very self aware. At the end, ven some character development that you aren't expecting for a side character. In your heart you wanted to go one way, but the writers dragged you another, and it actually worked, and you aren't left bitter at all about their choice. That is rare for a drama. Usually when the writers do something you are rooting against, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. They someone turn that on it's head.

Not much else to say here. This is a 10/10, and of the 87 dramas I have now watched, this is only the 3rd perfect 10 I have given out.

This is my first time posting a review for any kdrama, and I have watched over 50. I am writing this because it might just be my favourite drama to date. This was something that I could never say about the previous dramas. It takes this title so confidently as it a truly sweet, realistic, touching story of 3 women who are in their 30s. This drama can make you tear up and laugh out loud within a span of a few minutes. It is sweet yet sad, reminding you how realistic it is. It leaves you with a warm feeling and things to think about. You ponder on why certain things happen and how people coped with it. The ending left me with a strong desire for a second season. Just so I can see them grow and also see what their future holds for them. Even if I don't get that, the ending leaves you satisfied in a very warm, for me, it meant wishing the characters all the best and leaving them with warm goodbyes. All I can say is, this is a must-watch drama. Hope you guys give it a chance and see how it and the warm feelings stay with you.

It's an absolute masterpiece But...
If you're more into just Swoony romance and Rich chaebols in your shows then you might not like this one.

Also The show didn't do great in ratings(averaging around 1 percent viewership) because it's not part of the major TV broadcasting studio like KBS(ratings range in 2 figures).
And smaller studios (like JTBC) ratings range in around 3 to 5 percent on a good day.
Despite that, it's a criminally underrated show.


It's A very character driven show. And the leads are very relatable. The drama described itself the best, as the main lead is writing the show which is the story we the viewers are watching.(Things will be fine when you are Thirty)

But it's never really a fourth wall break. Rather Just a peak at the fourth wall which makes it more fresh

It's deeply poignant in places and hilariously funny throughout its run.
Like seriously funny, the show uses dry humour but it doesn't feel as dry as British dry humour and has a very nice balanced feel to it.

The OST is so organically a part of the show and is the most fitting with the shows story and brand of funny.

The monologue by characters are really thought provoking.

If you liked ""age of youth""(hello my Twenties) or Reply series (Answer me series). You'll love this one for sure.

If you didn't. Well.. This one's not for you.

Also the PPL in this one's is actually really funny as most of the time it's under some reference (since one of the lead works in marketing).

It's it's own brand of genius.

One of the OST titles is Consolation. It tells a feeling of having someone we know will always be there in every difficult situation that we've been. That's pretty much what I feel throughout the drama. Not only this drama reminds me of those who console me, but those who need me the most to console them.

Sometimes, unlike what they say, people don't change. When facing the same problem over and over again, it's hard for one to deal with that issue of theirs. However, if only they have others to walk with them and hold on, they can pass through that problem safely and sound and they can continue their life. Because to move on, you need energy, you need courage, and more than a friendly attitude, you need sincere friends.

This drama gives me a big burden in the beginning. As I watched more episodes, I thought there were fewer problems. Now I know I was wrong. The problems kept on coming to the characters. They never get used to it. But they will to walk through it and move on.

This drama is very meaningful to me. Every time I cry when I watched this, I feel both bad and good feelings. The weird part is that...the gut that I had was consoling me.

-

Now go to the real review of the drama production. Gosh, so good! The cinematography fits the concept. It looks pretty yet resembling the tone of our everyday life. The OSTs are all so touching. The plot is enjoyable, although I find that the plot is not really mattered when it comes to this drama. The character itself is very charming already, you would want to watch this because of the characters. They don't fall into the mainstream stigma of each character. Instead, they bring the characters to come to life by giving them the most natural attributes I've ever seen in Korean Drama. Not to mention, the casts play these characters so well.

In conclusion, this drama taught me lots of thing and it does warm my heart.

Don't understand the massive hype for this
I wished i had a lot of good things to say about this kdrama but honestly i am so tired. Took me forever to finish.
The main couple (writer/director) had absolutely no chemistry whatsoever, and i couldnt care less for them. I liked the character with a kid a lot, and her back story was amazing and touching. Ofc not as touching as Lee Eun Jung, i legit could watch a kdrama with only these characters. Also loved the celeb and her manager, they had a great chemistry! And that makes total difference. A story where the focus is on mental health and Lee Eun Jung, would be my cup of tea. The whole thing about making a kdrama and that couple, was just unnecessary and super boring.

This show is fantastic! Out of all the kdramas I've seen this is the closest to the Reply series (especially 88) in presentation & characterization, but at the same time this show doesn't push the love triangle in a stupid over the top way, which is a huge plus. I mean sure this one is set in present day Korea and it's not a 1-2 women + many guys setup, but the vibe is very similar.
All the characters, including the minor ones are interesting. All the sub-stories are cool. It's great how the drama starts, it's great how it ended and the quality stays consistent throughout. Normally I prefer dramas like WWwSK, or Fight for My Way, but this was a nice relaxing experience without the epic/cathartic moments that those kinds of dramas are known for. It was very funny, but not embarrassingly funny, It was just unreal enough to be interesting.

The casting is basically perfect, even more so than in R88. I hope that I'll see more of these actors in the years to come. The OST was good, though it could have been a bit less repetitive. +

Just to say some negative things: They took the fart jokes way too far and there were some dramaception moments that felt a bit immersion breaking.

Overall it's an easy 10/10, I hope it becomes a cult classic outside of Korea. Looking at the ratings leaves a sour taste in my mouth, I hope it's not because of the gay character, but with Korean viewers you never know...

This drama is GOLDEN
This show is golden I'm telling you because it depicts the real life situations of three women and the people they met in life. What I liked the most from the start about this show is that they are not rich bitches (like they show in Search : WWW) because that's something many of us can't relate to. It's a story of three women in the entertainment industry, who are struggling with life but doing and trying their best to make a decent living and it's so nice to see it like that. These are the types of women I'm inspired from and I know most of us are too. This show was hilarious in unexpected ways and the humour was not forced; it was perfect (with the timing, the situation and the acting)
I highly recommend this drama to everyone who wants to have a good time :)

If you are tired of the same drama pattern, this is a drama for you. It s something like Age of youth but for grown-ups in my opinion. *THE STORY* is quite unique, showing the lives of 4 friends that live together and get through hardships by supporting each other. They give you a little bit of everything: love, comedy, sadness, unusual, weird etc. *ACTING*- I really liked the characters and how they were portrayed by the actors. There is a scene in the last episode where they fight while whispering and I found that really unique and random. It s really nice how everyone managed to play a different type of a person. There is no character like the other and each one had something very distinctive in their personality. *MUSIC* There weren t many songs that drew my attention but the ones that did...ofc they were cool and unique as well. *REWATCH VALUE* I Will watch it again for sure and it is worth it. I still cannot comprehend the number of characters and personalities. God! The drama has a really chill vibe so that some of you might say it s boring but I really like that kind of approach.

Underrated heavily, deserves so much more attention and viewers!
Firstly lets start with how long I have had this on my collection and never got around to actually open the first episode and begin it. Unfortunately perhaps the reason might have been people not really talking about it in recommendation discussions or videos.

In simple terms, this is heavily 'underrated', this deserves so much more viewers than it currently has. I personally rated it 9/10 and not 10/10 just because, after a long time I might not come around watching it more than once or twice. I like to give 10/10 for dramas which I wouldn't mind watching again at any time.

What a brilliantly written story, what a brilliantly directed drama. Superb work by the whole team and the character themselves are so unique and shows different personalities and different developments from one another.

A positive drama, with not a single bit of negativity, this is a must watch, lets just say its a 'hidden gem' in my book!

This drama has been on my PTW and recommendations list for a while. And for good reason! It was wonderful and completely different from other dramas I've seen before.

Story: FAN-FLIPPING-TASTIC!!! It showcased original, sweet-cute, sweet-sad, not-so-sweet-but-realistic views on romance. There were real life problems, like mental health, toxic relationships, work-life balance issues, and the list goes on and on. I've really started liking this ""Slice of Life"" dramas. They keep getting better and better. I hope another drama from the same screen writers comes out soon!

Cast: 10/10. Perfectly cast, the acting was superb across the board, all of the relationships had chemistry, I mean come on! Like they're setting the standards so high.

Music: What can I say. Not only a whole OST, but a whole episode about farts thats not cheesy or crude. HOW???

Rewatch: Definitely binge-able, and not so bogged down with drama that it will be too much of an emotional experience to go through again.

Also, Sukku! is in this drama! OMG I was so excited when I saw him.

TLDR; It's rated high for a reason, regardless of the types of dramas you like to watch you can't deny this is well written, cast, and performed.

FROM AN OVER THINKER (VERY LONG)
Be melodramatic or Melo is in my nature is a drama for millennials. The drama revolves around 3 women as they advance into their 30s and how they view life at that point; their encounters and the people they connect with both platonically and romantically.

To start, I applaud the writer for not taking such a traditional route common in the industry. It might have been hard but I believe it paid off completely. This piece is of originality and its humane. The storyline is very unique like I mentioned briefly, I would have loved to see it in book or novel form I feel like I would have enjoyed it much more. It deals with daily struggles and it is exaggerated to the point where it needs to be in order to appease the traditional audience and rating junkies but still peak in a realistic ordeal. The characters all go through things that have weighed them emotionally, although they have been friends a while their individual struggles don't affect the way they relate with each other, there is a kind of respect in the way they comfort and relate with each other. For example, Eun Jung (played by Jeon Yeo Bin) experiences the loss of a lover as she deals with it she develops Complicated Grief Syndrome and although she doesn't realize it initially her friends do and they help her by openly comforting her in little things like when she seems angry or sad sharing a meal in silence or being goofy in a soft way and still trying to get help for her to the point where it isn't suffocating, They also confronted the reality of therapy and how it isn't easy, they translated that by going through some of that process with her and how sometimes it's needed in the healing process of any hurt.

One thing I also adored was the depth of the different kinds of relationship romantically in terms of lovers in the prime of their youth or lovers who loved at the wrong time, lovers who are not accepted by the majority, lovers who loved past their time and lovers whose love burned till it turned to disdain and more importantly they portrayed and normalized the platonic relationship manner between a man and a woman on different points between the drama and it was even more of a learning experience as they were all working in the general entertainment industry, in production, documentary, writing and directing. Jin Joo (played by Chun Woo Hee) writes a script depicting her life and the lives of her friends so in a way she narrated the drama but in a third-person view which I think is brilliant because she not only learns more about the people around her but mostly about herself. I learned a lot from this piece, there was a line I think in episode 16 that said 'No one has the perfect idea of who they are, people who believe they know themselves perfectly are the ones who will get hurt even more in the future'. I think the writer, from my perspective, tried to cause internal conflict in the minds of her audience. it's like 'hey I'm giving you this red cube' and you believe it's red and then shes opens it up and it beige inside and you're like wasn't this red. Maybe to be more specific I am referring to Jae Hoon and Ha Yoon's relationship, throughout the drama it felt like there was an obvious wrong on one end but towards the end, the ambiance of self-righteousness shifted and they both realized they were in the wrong in the relationship and that theory also goes beyond their relationship but between several connections in the cast.

The performances were great, although I could see the perspective in which the director had in mind I felt some scenes came off awkwardly in both good and bad ways, there were a lot of comic moments too which elevated the whole feeling. I would say it felt like a sitcom even if it's in the melodramatic category. All in all, I enjoyed it and even though I did stretch the watching period longer than usual it was worthwhile, I believe some dramas need to be watched in intervals to fully take away its blessing. This review is hella long if you've read this far thanks for entertaining my thoughts, it isn't even a review its more of a monologue. I enjoyed this drama in conclusion and if you like stuff that puts you in a million perspectives to widen your thoughts then you'll love this drama. WACTH IT!!

One of the Best 2019 Dramas
This was such a lovely drama that deals with life and relationships in general. The OST is really good. The plot and writing is really great. It was very related to 20-somethings and adults trying to find their way through life and dealing with whatever hardships it throws at us. One can learn a lot from this drama and there are so many quote worthy lines here. This is a wholesome drama overall and it can also tug at your heartstrings. I love how this drama centers around women. The pacing of his drama is also just right. It's not too slow and not too fast either. Watch this, and you will go through a rollercoaster of emotions.

Great acting, story and sharp dialogues lifted this above the rest
This show has been a sleeper for me for a while. When I stumbled across it in Viki I thought, not another rom-com and moved on. I then saw some very positive reviews and got interested. How glad I gave this show a go. It is truly amazing! The acting is great but the writing is the true star. It is both tropey and original at the same time. There are so much content in this show that some of the sub plots could have powered a standard 16 episode drama. The plots all move along in their own space and intersect when required without confusion. The show is a true ensemble. You start with 4, 5 main characters and then more are introduced. They are not just throw away characters either but really fleshed out people with their own back stories and goals and motivations. There are no cardboard characters here, thank you very much. Pacing is spot on. When one plot takes a breather, the next scene amps it up with a complete switch of tone. You just don't know when it will be funny or sad but you will never be bored. The first episode is probably hardest to watch because so much happened but also explained so much of the show's dynamic relationships. At the end of that hour, you would have laughed, cried, be shocked and wanted a hug. You are all in or you are out. Because the show is about the k-drama world, it can get very meta and almost fourth wall breaking but that is the fun! There are so many references to other popular drama series and in jokes. For instance, towards the end, there is a scene of the first script reading of the in-show drama and all the key players are seated around the big table and introduced themselves. What fun the actors would have in real life doing that! That really gave me a chuckle. While every episode is good/great, the last one is a gem. It really took the whole idea to town. In one scene the director and writer sat down to a script review and talked about how their show should end and what should happen to their in-show drama characters/plots. They were saying ""the viewers want this and that"" or ""they won't buy that"", were they talking about us?! Are they talking about what we (the actual viewers) want?! So meta! Kudos to the writer-nim for keeping the progress of the story real. There are no magical happy ending(s) but there are positive developments. Some might led to a happy ending but we can't be sure but each key characters are spotlighted so that we have a sense of progression. With that approach, you feel satisfied like a late night ramen that just hits the spot. It might not be fine dining but you will be contended. Oh, BTW, don't miss the episode about farting and the in jokes about PPL. One final comment, as an English speaker, I have to really pay attention while watching, the dialogues are very important and a lot are elevated beyond banter into verbal jostling. They also speak very fast a lot of the time so you have even less time to read the sub (kudos to the sub-titlers, well done!). You can't just put it on in the background and glance at it from time to time. You will miss the best part of the show and probably much of the nuances. Be warned.

Short: This was absolutely fantastic! There was humour, there was grief, there was romance, there was everything. Paradoxically, it's like it is a drama written about writing that drama. It was simple, yet complex. Brilliantly acted, fantastic (and humorous) music and a brilliant story. The ending barely matters, this one's about the journey, and it's such a fantastic journey.

Detailed:
What did I just watch?! This was brilliant!

Three women living together in their thirties along with one of the ladies gay brother. Everyone has a story, sometimes the stories come together, sometimes they're quite heavily entwined, some times they're not. Whether it's one of the women who is facing severe grief following the loss of her partner, with moments that will likely have you reaching for the tissues, or another of the women and her hilarious relationship with her director, or the relationship one of them has with a co-worker.

Strong women, strong men. Great characters and brilliant performances by their actors.

The stories all go in different directions and the writer brilliantly crafts the tales to take those stories to places you probably didn't expect by the time they're done.

I really don't want to say too much and undo the writers fantastic work, you just have to watch it.

Very re-watchable too.

Captivating, quirky and Meta!
Melo Is My Nature/Be Melodramatic is a bundle of surprises. When I started watching, I didn‚Äôt expect that I would end up binging it. The first couple of episodes are a bit slow, with the introductions still happening and due to it being very different from the usual dramas you aren‚Äôt sure if you‚Äôll love the characters and the story or not, but there are some scenes in the first few episodes that force you to continue. And after that, each episode is only better than the previous one. I was very impressed by the acting and the characters portrayal. Especially when heavy emotions had to be depicted. (Trigger warning: depression, homophobia, emotional and verbal abuse, loss of a loved one)

When it comes to the second half, some dramas which start off well often fail to live up, but this show continued to exceed my expectations. With every passing episode, the characters continue to grow and so much was said in between pauses and silence. Once again, props to acting! So many emotions felt SO real and I often teared up. This is a beautiful drama that you‚Äôll come back to repeatedly.

I‚Äôm slightly disappointed with the finale, because there were certain arcs that didn‚Äôt go my way, but the writers do a convincing defence on why it actually makes sense and though you might not agree entirely, you can see TID happening as well.

Another favourite of mine was how throughout the drama, it continued to break the fourth wall and parodied some of the lines and scenes from other well known dramas. And of course, the PPL was hilarious and so well done!

If you enjoy watching slice of life dramas or dramas with interesting characters and storyline, you cannot miss out on this. This is easily in my top ten dramas for now.

I honestly cannot be mad at this show but I‚Äôm a visual person so I can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt skip parts of the show because I had more favorite characters than others and it‚Äôs whatever. Is this one of my top shows for 2019? Possibly. The storyline of friends and family are my top things with a little bit of romance and I‚Äôm not even mad. I liked how they all clicked but you had loss with one girl, figuring themselves out and heart break with another. I shed some tears and felt frustrated all around together honestly. I even cracked up laughing and binged most of it towards the end though. But the beginning of the show was way better than the end, I started to skip through and feel a little bored but it didn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt a good show. There just wasn‚Äôt anything to make it go crazy or make me go crazy or out of my seat, it‚Äôs literally a slice of life when you‚Äôre a little older; it shows what happens when you have loss, when you have love, confidence and you‚Äôre feeling lost in general. The reason that I adore it all together is because of the emotion it swayed and I felt. I adored the friends, the family and just all around every individual persons story. I loved Eun Jung and Han Joo the most, didn‚Äôt really care for Jin Joo and I also loved the gay brother and the kid. Overall good story, acting and music. Would I rewatch? Once is probably enough. But definitely a good show; good for the soul or when you just want to feel. It‚Äôs full of mixed emotions and it‚Äôs not 10/10 but it‚Äôs close.

This drama is simple and light, but that's why it's perfect for me. The story is related to my daily life (apart from the love story), plus I will be 30 years old this year, so I got a lot of things from this drama.

I like every character in this drama. I like it because this drama focuses on the power of women, with all the problems in life.

The character I like who has only been in the last few episodes is Director Hey!. He's weird but warm-hearted. I don't expect the character to have such a twist. I like him.

The ending of the story is also not forced, it flows as if it happened as it is. No romance is forced, which is why I really like this ending.

Overall, this drama is really good! Such an oasis in my hectic daily life.

I didn't know what to think of the first two episodes, but kept watching it because of the buzz about the show. I wasn't disapointed!
By the end of the 4th episode the quirky humor and an hilarious scene with a guitar had already won me over. As it evolves, the show becomes very meta, but in a fun clever way. The characters are flawed and a bunch of dorks, but they are utterly quirky and charming in their own different ways.
Kudos for the first gay character that I've seen depicted in kdrama as a real person and not defined by his gayness, it's a shame he doesn't get more scenes, but, hey, baby steps! Double kudos to the Show for remaining centered in the female leads and not presenting romance as the goal of the story!

Could have been better
Drama had a Strange start, it was intresting but not entertaining(If that makes any Sense). But the show gradually grew on me. Lee eun jung character arc was one of the few time that made me feel something for a character in a korean drama personally after a long time.
Then why a rating of 6.5
For a drama that is trying to ground itself in reality it was too focussed on giving satisfying ending for every character.
Love story of the side characters especially the Screen writer lady was rather uninteresting. Of all the 4 main characters as in the poster 2 of the characters (Lee hyo Bong and hwang han joo) were under developed (especially Lee Hyo Bong) felt was just used to pad the run time more than anything else

first off, completely aware homosexuality in a korean drama is a big step, however, i truly wish there was more added to it. in 16 episodes there were 3 scenes with the couple (without a single touch) and maybe a total of 5 scenes referencing the relationship. while everyone else had their relationships deeply analyzed and intimately written, the 2 homosexual men had barely a graze...

otherwise, this drama is funny, thought provoking and mature. it is one of those dramas that would have been worth watching pass 16 episodes, or possibly a season 2.

The story itself is a rom com, but it's definitely more com than rom -- and the com comes from poking fun at all the other romantic comedies out there.

First of all let's talk about the comedy. The plot develops in unexpected ways, and the character actions/expressions are so on point that make it extra funny. Even when they don't reference other dramas/tropes, the characters say the darnest things at the darnest times and kept me laughing throughout.

The romance itself is pretty realistically paced. The script doesn't rush unlikely relationships (coughcough The King), and focuses on letting character emotions develop instead. There are love lines, but they actively avoid typical kdrama tropes like ""an ugly love triangle between girl, guy, and girl's ex-boyfriend"" or ""leads get happily married at the last episode, the end."" In fact, they make fun of these tropes throughout the show, either through character dialogue or through a dream/imagination sequence. (you'll see. it's so great)

The main part of this drama is the meta-ness though. There are references to multiple other famous dramas, either through reenacting a famous scene or just having a scene that matches the energy. These references are complete with the appropriate insert song (like hearing Appearance during the Secret Garden reference or the Something in the Rain insert song...) You'll have to have a long history of watching kdramas to recognize all of them (I don't; but I recognized a few... and I googled the rest), but even if you don't recognize exactly where the scene is from, you'll appreciate the humor and the efforts of the production team. Look forward to how they approach the 4th wall and the actor/character relationship. Since the main characters are in the entertainment industry, they talk about dramas a lot, and you'll see some (hilarious) references to the actors themselves or their previous roles. The cameos are also really cool! I lost it when I heard Jung So Min call another character ""So Min unni."" I swear they did that on purpose. Also like, this is probably the only drama that will make fun of product placement in dramas *as it does product placement itself*.

Finally, just wanted to praise how they took care of the ending. The last episode was gold in terms of plot development, while maintaining the comedy factor. This show was funny and interesting til its very end.

Better luck next time
I am the kind of person who prefers a bit of ""unrealism"" in a drama, it actually helps in developing interest and curiosity for upcoming episodes. It being too realistic was the problem. MDL ratings can be unfair too, 8.5 for this one is bit too much. They created way too many plots for themselves. It tried really hard to become ""Because this is my first life"" or ""reply"" but it was nowhere near them. My favourite storyline was that of Somin and Minjun's, although a very short one. And of course the OST, liked it alot more than drama itself.

Large Cast of Characters
There are so many characters in this show and that could either be positive or negative. The Reply series did it well but here, for me, there were so many characters that I didn't care about, like the side characters of the Senior Writer or even the two main leads. With that being said, this isn't that much of a character-driven drama, but those characters who did have personal growth turned out to be my favorites (Eunjung, Somin).

There's sort of a drop-off with the plot as well and some lost opportunities for exploring but this show packs its punches in many of the right places, especially in the beginning where everyone is being introduced.

Wholesome
The drama for me has been like a good old cup of coffee.
It's like one morning I woke up with a headache, and just the smell of coffee somewhat reduced the throbbing pain. Each sip I took comforted me through all the stress and when I finished it, I felt a bit empty.

Of you're feeling down or sad, then this drama is sure to comfort you. It makes you realize, it's okay not to be truly amazing, it's okay if you do ""just enough"" instead of something huge.

The acting is amazing and the characters feel real. The story is relatable and simple, which makes it more unique. And the ost perfectly captures the moment.

The drama left a sweet aftertaste for me, I hope it does for you as well.

Totally wonderful
I just thoroughly enjoyed this series and felt sad when it ended. Isn‚Äôt this about most people‚Äôs lives? So very funny, heartwarming, and at times sad. All the actors were just great, there isn‚Äôt an actor here that you can‚Äôt connect with through having the same experiences in your own life.

To me, the ones that really shined were Ahn Jae Hong (The director) and Son Keok Koo (the cursing director). This is a definite re-watch for me.

I thank whomever it was that posted on the main feed in conversations about Jeon Yeo Been, that she did a fantastic job as one of the FL in this drama. I might have missed this otherwise.

Uncanny, peculiar and interesting with 3 female leads and side character with quite deep exploration
This drama is very unique not just to entertain but also with meaningful episodes coming through. We kinda get the idea of each character, even with the side one. I really enjoy this drama because the romance part were not too much simple and you can relate to it pretty much. It was like watching how the character live their life in reality.

For people who has deep interest in movie industry can get a grasp of idea from this series. Almost all of the character work in this industry from a documentary director, writer, production house marketing team and actress. This drama potraits life really well just like a slice of life genre. I also like the quotes from each episode, the cinematography also simple yet perfect ! everything is done inadequately and beautiful.

What I don't like is how they did with ji eun and jae hoon because I see potentials with this couple but again I respect the writer-nim perspective. But, I guess this is what they want to potrait as well , how complicated relationship it is and pretty platonic.

I also like their OST's, my favorite is moonlight.

One of my recommended kdrama
This drama has been on my list since I got to know that it's sort of slice of life genre. Now, I just got a chance to finish the whole drama and I've got to say. As a fan of this type of drama, I will recommend this to people! But then again, not all gonna love this because some might think it's boring or too slow.

Honestly, for me, the first ep was great. I like the introduction to the casts. Then to the next eps, gotta say it is a bit slow. However, as it went to ep 5 and above, it's starting to look much better and the characters became more interesting. Then, I remember in one episode where Beom Su told Jinjoo that he would make groundmaking decision in the last episode. Gotta say, it works for me!

Overall, everything is great. From the characters, I like how there's no 'bad' people at all, it's just human being human , the romance (it did get me giddy at times), the plot and all. Thumb up!

BOOM, you'll love how this drama feels!
Fool me that this drama waited too long on my list. First I just watched a few Son Seok Koo's scene in episode 10. Then I decided to give it a try since I grow fonder with Jeon Yeo Bin because of Vincenzo. Omoo I suffer too much for waiting her as Hong Cha Young a week feels like so long. Okay I admit that I'm more like the obessed type when it comes into good actor/actress haha.

Then I decided watch this, since her is the Main Actress and this drama already on my waiting list and BOOM THIS IS SO GREAT!! I DON'T EVEN EXPECT THIS. This genre the main focus on character itself, and every character building is amazing. Even when you think that this role isn't really important or cool. You're wrong, every characther matters. You not found a lot of drama that feels like this, trust me. Damn this drama is definitely a gem!

I laugh a lot, cry too and this is also make me thinking about my life, especially right now I'm in the position as a good-for-nothing :)

My characters comment:
Lim Jin Joo characther and her interaction with Son Beom So is satisfying and fun, very unique.
I kinda hope that Han Joo will end up with Jae Hoon, but yeah this more like bro-sis relationships I guess? But Jae Hoon getting back with his ex? Hmmm thats not even a healthy relationships, for my point of view..
Yeah but for me the best couple goes toooo: So Min x Min Joon??

But still my fav is Eun Jung's story! I satisfied so much since her is the reason I started watching it. Her story is deep and made me cry.. Her strong and brave character screams a girl power. But that doesn't mean a human always strong, we all have our fragile part.. I wish she can make her African date come true!! We saw hopes as a netizen and I wanna thank the screen writer so so much! Especially for cast Eun Jong and Hey Director~~~

Start Again and Know Bliss Called Happiness
Things will be fine when you turn 30.

I have difficulty memorizing my passwords all the more to remember my 30s. According to the writer of this drama, when one turns 30 years old, one tends to be melodramatic. I am 42 years old and have reached half of the life expectancy limit. Is it the worst for me then? At this point, the inevitable question we often find ourselves asking is --- What have I accomplished so far?

Being the second Korean drama (the first one was ""Search: WWW"") I watched that compared life and love to a designer bag, I begin to wonder how so?

What I love most about this drama is the friendship of Jin Joo, Eun Jong, Han Joo, and Jae Hoon. But among the four, I like Eun Jong. Her character intrigued me the most. Jin Joo (Chun Woo Hee) and Beom (Ahn Jae Hong) Soo's relationship is the closest reality as it can be. Their conversations speak not only of the truth but of the elephant in the room in most relationships.

There is a great deal of narration in this drama. I would take this as an exercise of the mind. It got me thinking and made me realize a lot of things in life.

If relationships fail, do you also see yourself as a failure? Or maybe fail to grow in that relationship? It just did not work at all. Every breakup has its share of resentment and remorse. I might be saying this and that. And a lot may react with the words easier said than done. But what you take are lessons and good memories.

Do people change? For every break up, do you feel that somebody or something died that day? Does your old self remain and die? Do you want to forget that old self and never look back? At times, confronted with the question, do you remember yourself in the past? Have you set up a funeral for that old self?

I would like to believe that one can change within the situation. People can be resilient if need be and tend to adapt. In the end, the truest of ourselves remains. As long as we never stop our desire to start again, we may attain the bliss called happiness.

On another note, I can see that this drama is somehow underrated. But amidst the raw kind of vibe of this drama is a depth that somehow only sentimental people can fathom. I might sound bias, but not all people are fond of drama with a lot of talks and less action.

But then again, what I love most about this drama is it pounds you down to your core. I feel like I was reading the book entitled Men are from Mars; Women are from Venus.

To iterate what I meant:
Men: ""What matters is my feelings, not the words I say.""
Women: ""Say the right words. Sweep me off my feet with your words.""

Consistency means quality. Sometimes in the middle of airing, TV drama tends to fall short of its substance. It may have a very impressive beginning but maintaining the interest and curbing interest is another story. But not this one. That is why this drama is a must-see!

a breath of fresh air.
Be Melodramatic is a special case in dramas. It is almost satirical the way it is filmed and produced; yet it delivers in every single aspect. I think what's so special about it is that it feels so genuine. The characters feel so realistic and raw. Every single character is important to each other (hence this is why it's a character driven drama). There are no true ""side"" characters here, it feels like every single one is important to the overall story arc. The main premise in this story follows Jinjoo as she writes her first ever drama. I like how the main characters eventually all contribute to the drama she's writing.
As I said before, this is character driven drama. And every single main character has their own special arc and I find that very beautiful. Jinjoo is ambitious, Hanjoo gentle, and Eunjeong strong (I love her so much). My favorite was Eunjeong because she tackles mental health (something I relate with). They wrote her so well. I usually hate it when kdramas make mental health disappear as soon as the character ""finds love,"" because that is very unrealistic. Eunjeong takes the entire 16 episodes to get better, and she is still battling it (though better than before), and I find that very powerful. As someone who has mental health issues, it feels good to see someone on screen go through issues that I myself deal with. It never says that she completely gets over her depression, but that's the aspect I like the most. Depression is not something that will magically go away one day. It is something that has to repeatedly treated and I especially liked that she (eventually) went to see a therapist for it.
Another amazing quality of this drama is the DIALOGUE. The humor relies on the script rather than slapstick or actions and that makes it so special. It makes you pay attention to what every single character says and it's so satisfying. When the dialogue is meant to be humorous, it makes you laugh, and when the dialogue needs to be sad, it makes you feel sad. The dialogue is emotional and humorous, and it is so effective. It seamlessly switches from serious aspects to humorous aspects without ever overshadowing the dramatic elements that need to be highlighted.
The production quality is at its best here, as each episode could serve as it's own story due to how it's written. They tackle issues such as discrimination in the workplace, LGBTQ+ issues and mental health, etc, and in a way that doesn't feel performative. Everything is just done so so well. The soundtrack fits the story well, and never feels out of place. The only thing I rated low on was rewatch value ONLY because I rarely rewatch shows.

I need to be more Melodramatic
I think it's safe to say that this is my next favourite slice of life drama after Reply 1988.

While Reply 1988 left us with nostalgia after taking us down memory lane, Be Melodramatic provides for very relateable content - especially being a millenial myself in this day and age. Both dramas have a common premise, the value of friendship.

When I started the first episode, I really didn't know what to think. The format of this drama was much different to your usual k-drama layout with lives, circumstances and decisions overlapping from each character to the next.

But I decided to give this drama time, and boy am I glad I did. Each and every single character grows on you. There is a humble simplicity with which regular problems of 'adulting' are expressed in Be Melodramatic. The beauty of this show is the friendship between the three main female protaganists, and how this grounds them throughout the challenges they stumble across - be it career progression, motherhood or lost love - challenges which all us women have, or are bound to face at some stage of our lives.

I find it extremely warming when I can connect to a piece of creative work on all levels; emotional, mental and spiritual even. Touching brilliantly on sensitive aspects of growing up that one fears/is dealing with, the drama gives you a sense of comfort that ""ÏÑúÎ•∏Ïù¥ ÎêòÎ©¥, Îã§ Í¥úÏ∞ÆÏïÑ Ï†∏"" (It'll all be alright, once you turn 30).

For someone who hasn't turned 30 just yet, that's a great deal of comfort.

If you haven't already, definitely give this masterpiece a chance.

An absolute gem
The most underrated drama! Started watching because of Jeon Yeobeen and ended up adding all the actresses and actors to my favorites list. An absolute gem of a show, in terms of acting, comedy, drama, script, OST and production. At times I felt like almost every other phrase is worth to be a quote on its own.

TL;DR: Very realistic, great acting and the script feels as if it was literally torn out of someone‚Äôs life. The dialogues are deep and the relationships are all meaningful. Don‚Äôt miss it!

My first review on MDL
This is such a precious drama. The characters are so honest, raw and relatable, that you end up feeling like they're your friends. The storyline may seem boring to some, since it adresses trivial problems, but if you open your heart to it, you may appreciate the simplicity of this narrative. Though it's rather uneventful (there's not a lot of big events or great tragedies to move the plot forward, like most k-dramas), it's very interesting to watch.
Many times I was deeply touched by what seemed to be a silly story. I particularly loved the dialogues (Jin Joo is my spirit animal! So many great quotes from her), the character development (it's so endearing to watch them grow), the way the drama seems to laugh at itself sometimes, and just the honesty of it all.
The only complaint I have regarding this drama is that I felt they went too heavy on the meta stuff towards the end, and that felt a little lazy sometimes. Despite recognizing the drama has its flaws, I can't not give it a 10/10. I just love it too much. If you like slice of life, please, give it a shot!

The drama of my life at 30 told in a timid way
Watching Be Melodramatic when it's not yet 30 years old is interesting, at the same time that you are afraid you are excited to know what kind of reality you will face at this age, especially the amorous ones, in which the drama brings being very happy in some and honestly very unhappy in others, so in this review I‚Äôd prefer to bring my view on each plot presented by this drama separately.

Jim Joo & Beom Soo - The main couple in this drama is totally out of the ordinary, the dialogues between them were so complex that I came back to see if I understood correctly the feeling they wanted to convey and this was a bad experience by far, on the contrary , the way this couple has developed is incredible since standing still for an entire episode or even the fart fight that was just great (it's my favorite episode)

Yeo bin - At the beginning I found her plot delusional due to the death of her boyfriend, a bit boring and erased in relation to the others, but all of that started to change when she started to interact with So Min's desire to live and how So Min's relationship with Min Joo made her mature and face her grief, proving that she could be happy, it was the character that grew the most for me in the end her story became my favorite.

Han Joo - Initially it was the plot that caught my attention the most, I was glad they will address the difficulties of single Korean mothers ... good at first until they tried, but I felt that her character was so involved in the conflicts of Jae Hoon and Ha Yoon that his own story was in the background and its outcome has gone nowhere.

Hyo Bong - Speaking of nowhere, we arrived with the biggest mistake of the entire drama here. Be Melodramatic has sold and still sells this drama as an LGBT genre, but there is nothing about it. There is no development of Hyo Bong with her boyfriend or her story. They even gave evidence that he might have a story to develop, revealing that his parents do not accept him for being gay and chose to flee, in addition to the scene where he and her boyfriend were expelled from the restaurant. In my view the author did intend to develop this character and bring the theme to a great Korean drama, but in the process (as the drama itself brings back) they were prevented by JTBC from valuing this character, and clearly he gets lost totally in history.

In conclusion Be Melodramatic is a very entertaining drama with serious intentions, which were only in intention, tried to be bold in a shy way, and shyness made them miss the opportunity to be an excellent drama to be just entertainment Ok!

Heartbreak Three
Be Melodramatic is a drama that really challenges the status quo on Korean society and standard story telling. Having no primary plot, it tells the story of 3 FLs and their hardships, experiences and encounters in their daily lives. Each FL has had a sad or unfortunate circumstance and they are trying their best to continue on with their lives. Personally, I would include Lee So Min as the 4th FL since she also has so much backstory and her second lead ship is one of the cutest and well written past I have ever seen. (I was introducted to this drama because of the 2nd lead Lee So Min/Lee Min Joon ship that made me want to watch the entire drama) This drama literally has everything in it, from emotional trauma, heart wrenching pasts, funny and comedic duos, close friendship, feeling powerless, touchy subjects and honest love. There is so much well thought out backstory and personality behind each character that this IP could have went on for many seasons. Last note, this drama for me has the single most memorable line for years to come; ""I need a hug...I am talking to you guys..."" when you finally understand the meaning and reason behind this single line, five boxes of tissues won't save you.

Quick Story/Plot
Be Melodramatic does not have a primary plot but instead tells stories and events that are occuring with the 3 FLs. The plot also does not shy aware from touchy subjects that are much less talked about in Korean society. If I were to give a general flow of the story, the first half the drama is about the unfortunate and sad events that have occurred and the later half is the healing and becoming honest with oneself. Also not having a standard story telling format was a great benefit to the overall story as it made the audience curious and anticipating the transition of the characters and where it would bring them.

Quick Acting/Cast/Characters
There is so much backstory and personality for each character that it would be difficult to go through each one + I would recommend learning the cast yourself to really have that deeper emotional connection. Nevertheless, here is a short summary:
- Im Jin Joo is an unfortunate script writer met with unfortunate events. She eventually leaves the toxic environment and learns to cope with the people from her past and meets new people in her life.
- Lee Eun Jung is a documentary director experiencing life's cruel fate. Without much spoiling, she is now trying to cope and accept her mental trauma and move on.
- Hwang Han Joo is a single mum that has worked hard to reach the position of head of marketing team for a drama production company. She lost most of her youth getting to this position while taking care of her son and would like to experience love again.
- Lee So Min is a rising actress that does not have a painful backstory, but she is oblivious as to how important Lee Min Joon, her manager, was to her until he was scouted by another company.
- Son Beom Soo is a drama director with a quirky personality and different way of thinking. He becomes involved with Jin Joo and tries to persuade her to become his writer.
- Choo Jae Hoon is a staff under Hwang Han Joo's team and is dealing with a toxic girlfriend. Jae Hoon then starts a younger man/older woman ""relationship"" while working with Han Joo.
- Special shout-out to my boy Lee Min Joon, manager of Lee So Min. Due to a promise made back in high school, he now supports So Min as a primary goal in his life.
- Rest of the cast also have a wealth of backstory with them.

Music/OSTs
The music and OSTs are a banger which not only elevates the scenes but also brings out an extra layer of emotions to improve what would have just been a normal scene. The popular OST song "" Your Shampoo Scent In the Flowers"" covered and loved by many people is from this drama.

Rewatch Value
Would definitely rewatch and experience the emotional, heartbreak, funny and empowering scenes all over again. Sometimes I would go back to watch clips of notable scenes or listen to the soothing playlist.

Why my current rating (10)
All in all, this drama is a healing story for the 3 FLs. Learning to look past the painful experiences and forward to a better future. Since the setting is set in modern real life Korea with real examples, the plot can be taken in any direction and continued on as a series. (I am deeply saddened there is no follow-up seasons) What made this drama so compelling and eventually becoming my No.1 Drama is how well each character was written and weaved with other characters + backstories. It was like having 5 main stories all told in parallel with 7 side stories being told by most of the side casts. Each character had a role and had purpose in the story. I would definitely recommend giving this drama a go if you like RomCom, Slice of Life, Friendship dramas and remember to have boxes of tissues next to you, you have been warned...

Smart, Sassy and Female Driven
Not a single misstep in this entire drama.
Meta and self-aware with witty dialogue and killer scenes. This drama deals with loss, love and careers in a delicate balance while maintaining cheeky humor and perpetually side-winking at the audience.

While it is female-centric, and not my usual genre, all the relationships, either platonic or romantic, were fantastically written with subtleties I've never experienced before. The characters were consistent, and while there was growth among the two leads, their original zany and brash ways were kept throughout the entire series.

The production was out of this world, wonderfully produced beautifully shot. At no point at all did I feel as if I was watching B-team or pick-up scenes as you often feel in other dramas towards the later episodes.

REAL AND HEALING DRAMA
""More than the story, it's the characters that matter"" : this sentence can summarize the essence of drama; The story is focused on the development of the situation and the feelings of the characters. It is more focused on love, but it also deals with taboo subjects in Korea (and throughout the world as well) such as single mother, the death of one's lover, sex, cheating, homosexuality... It's NOT BORING, even if it is simple, the story is really exciting.

LOVE : the writers depicted love in a very fair way. It seems real.
FRIENDSHIP: the same sense of reality ! It's a healing drama for that.

The acting is amazing, perfect... all the actors of the drama have a real talent on screen. Usually, in k-drama, there is always at least one actor whose character is ridiculous, poorly played (most of the time a supposed-to be funny character). But it's not the case !! I was really impressed by the overall quality of acting;

When I started this drama, I don‚Äôt have any expectation that this drama would be one of my favorite romcom kdrama. I just love everything, how the story goes, how all characters portray their characters and oh the OST.
But I have to admit that Lee Eun Jung is my favorite character, I feel sympathized with her story, her love story is somewhat tragic. When she finally realized her bf is gone, the studio scene, I cried my eyes out. Though I was hoping to see more of her and the Director but I‚Äôm satisfied enough with her ending story. The main couple, they are hilarious, how they were bickering and then suddenly they turn to lovey-dovey couple, love ‚Äòem.

I watched this drama twice and might watch it again when I‚Äôm bored and looking for something light and entertaining to watch.

Beautiful Story About Love, Loss and Friendship
I have been struggling to find the words to accurately describe how much I loved and appreciated this drama. The writing made me laugh, cry and think about the ways I could relate to the lessons being shared in each episode. All the characters were beautifully written, especially our three leading ladies, and I found myself being instantly attached to them since the first episode. I was blown away by how well the writers were able to flesh out almost all the characters(especially considering how large the cast was)without it becoming too overwhelming, and the plot was never convoluted, messy, or predictable. The lack of predictability was something that really shocked me since this tends to be a huge issue in kdramas, specifically melodramas. Towards the end of the episode, I had no idea what was going to happen next and the realization soon hit that going with the flow and letting the story do its thing was the best way to enjoy this drama.

The friendship between Jin Joo, Eun Jung, and Han Joo felt so incredibly realistic and it made me yearn for a friendship as beautiful and lovely as theirs. Eun Jung's brother, Hyo Bong, was also a part of this tight-knit group of friends, and his presence was natural and never felt out of place. These 4 individuals had so much love and respect for one another and you can see that in the way they spoke to one another and supported one another. There was a deep sense of trust amongst the group, and apart from little spats, we never actually see them fight. It felt warm and cozy watching the scenes where they all sat on the sofa at the end of the day watching TV, eating snacks, and just talking about their day or how they're feeling. It felt so natural and I would always get a warm fuzzy feeling. What sealed the deal for me is the way they handled Eun Jung's grief, which was a major theme in the show. The 3 of them never pressured her, never forced her to speak about how she was feeling, and graciously accepted her with open arms once she was ready.

On that note, the way Be Melodramatic handled the topic of grief and mental health was so well done. Oftentimes, kdrama's tend to fail horribly when it comes to addressing those themes, but BM was certainly not one of them. Despite the fact that 2 years have passed, Eun Jung has yet to address the pain from losing her boyfriend, Joon Woo. Because of that, she's found a way of coping by tricking her brain into thinking that he is there with her and even carrying full-on conversations with him. She pretends that she is fine but once she realizes what she has been doing, she is hit with the harsh reality that Joon Woo is gone and that he isn't coming back. It's a poignant scene that reminds the viewers that Eun Jung is still in a great deal of pain but hasn't learned to deal with it. What was great is seeing how Eun Jung willingly sought therapy after her brother urged her to and how these scenes were taken seriously. The therapist genuinely cared about her wellbeing and what it is she had to say, and Eun Jung genuinely made an effort to answer the therapist's questions to the best of her abilities. It was nice to see her go back to the same therapist a few episodes later to show that she was still actively receiving help. Mental health and grief are usually not taken seriously in dramas and tend to be solved easily, but BM handles these topics with care and presents Eun Jung's journey of healing as realistically as possible. By the last episode, she still sees and speaks to him, but it is clear that she's in a much better place and is beginning to learn how to live her life without him. There is no clean-cut conclusion because grief and healing are not easy and it was such a beautiful open ending to her story.

God, I have so much more to say about this show. The way the comedy fit so well with the quirky atmosphere, the way both romantic and platonic relationships were written so nicely, the way the plot was clever and nicely paced, the way every single character, pairing, and group had immense chemistry, and especially the way the actors did an incredible job portraying their characters. My one and only complaint is the way the plot twist is thrown in the last episode where it is revealed that Han Joo was actually dating someone the entire time. We were never given any indication that she was in a relationship and it felt like a cheap way to let the viewers know that Han Joo and Jae Hoon were strictly platonic. It was genuinely frustrating considering the fact that the show had led us to believe that there were romantic feelings present, but since they wanted to show that they were just friends, I wish they had done a better job at revealing this fact. Because it is such a small issue within a sea of perfection, that one flaw isn't enough to bump down my 10-star rating and I highly, highly, HIGHLY, recommend this to anyone looking for a cozy and heartwarming drama to binge.

Melo definitely suits them, and its ok to be melo, isn't life always a bit melo anyways?
This drama definitely felt like Age of Youth, but in their 30s. Instead of school life, it focus on women and them juggling their careers and personal life. Perhaps because I really enjoyed Age of Youth, I also really enjoyed Be Melodramatic.
It is more of a slice-of-life drama, journeying with the characters through their personal highs and lows and the in-between (there is a lot of in-between moments). There is no sweeping romances, but slightly heart-fluttering and fuzzy romances. No crazy plot twists or twisted villains, just life getting in the way (e.g: death of a loved one, being a single mother, getting stuck in an unfulfilling job). I do think that there are more funnier scenes than melodramatic scenes, such that I find the drama title ironic. I also like how the drama incorporates meta.
Some of the characters might not be the most likeable at the start, but they definitely become endearing at the end of the dramas. Especially the male characters, some of them seem too aloof or arrogant, but gradually and somehow, the story reveals more to their initial impression and ended up liking their characters at the end of the drama. I am realllly liking Jeon Yeo Bin's acting, especially now watching Vincenzo too. I think because the actors/actresses are not the most well-known, I got to really immersed myself with the characters of the drama (lol sounds weird but idk how else to phrase), not comparing with their other works. (excluding ahn jae hong in reply 1988 and lee yoo jin in age of youth)
Sadly, maybe the drama's production is smaller or for other reasons, the OST is lackluster-ish. Different covers of the same song is repeated in the drama. Initially, it was played for gags, but it kinda overtook as the main theme as the song is still about romance which fits the drama. It is nice that one of the cover is sang by the main leads (I am not too sure tbh but it sounded like their voices). And now this song is stuck in my head :') (Song: Your Shampoo Scent in the Flowers - jang beom june)
I have to end this review with my favourite quote/dialogue from this drama, maybe even the best quote ever (paraphrased): ""You'll always be moneyless, you don't have money now because you're studying, then after getting a job, you'll get married and need a house, but it belongs to the bank, so you still don't have money. Then you'll pay back the mortgage but when you have children, then you'll send them to college to provide them good education, then when its retirement, you'll not have any money. And that is just the successful cases, there are worse ones yet.""

Be Melodramatic is probably one of the dramas that I put off for a long time, but once I started it was an immediate binge( I finished it in four days). The story has more of a realistic approach than most dramas and honestly could become frustrating in way? I don't mean it in a bad way, but it's like a slap to the face kind of feeling. The best way I could describe it would be maybe as if the writer was making the audience realize that they need to face reality and not stay in la la land because one day or another you'll have to face it. I definitely would say that this is a romantic comedy, but with the main focus on friendship. I would say that was my favorite aspect of this drama. It honestly made it feel as if no matter how good or bad your day was your friends are always there.

The cast is just great and I think the characters were portrayed well. The character development was well paced and made sense with the overall story. I would say that some moments were predictable,not too much, but with a hint of twists. It's just enough to keep the viewer's attention. You come to love some characters and others maybe not so much, but they all have a purpose and make the story feel more complete. You will definitely feel a mix of emotions where one moment you'll be laughing and the next thing you know a tear might be forming ( unless that's just me being a snowflake hahaha). I think the main deciding factor whether or not you watch this drama is whether you care that the story goes back and forth a lot( past to present). I would recommend to at least give it a try.

This type of drama always catches my eye in the beginning but always fails to keep it I loved the stories the acting and the relationships between the characters lets not forget about the amazing ost but sometimes I just fail to understand the characters emotions and alot of things in the story are useless and I felt that the parts I like were always cut short what I mean is that by the time i reached the final episode I reached the point that I stopped reading the subs cause it wasnt interesting anymore for me it felt as if sth was missing and I stopped feeling connections with the characters also it was nice to see an lgbt storyline i wish that we saw alot more of it though in hopes it opens up more doors for future dramas overall it was a fun watch for me although it wasnt perfect it was still has many amazing sides that I dont see often in recent dramas

One of my all time favourites
Alright maybe I kind of put too much stars but come on!! You have to watch this one. As a big fan of slice of life dramas (even though I literally like all genres) this is one of the best ones. The stories of all three female leads are different and unique and the roles suit all of the cast members so well.

When watching this drama I both laughed and cried out loud. This drama had such good comedy but it also had so much tragedy. This drama in my opinion portrays different type of goods and bads that people have in everyday life. Also all the couples in this drama are adorable especially Lee So Mins and Lee Min Joons relationship. So basically i recommend this drama to well.. everyone!

Such an underrated gem!
This drama truly deserves more hype. If you0re a fan of female-centered, slice of life dramas like me then I'm sure you're gonna love it.
It gives off a vibe very similar to Age of Youth/Hello My Twenties and, despite not being one of my favorite dramas (unlike AOY, which holds a special place in my heart), it still manages to portay the daily lives and struggles of 30 year old women.
I love how it tackles different topics - the stigma against homosexual people, PTSD and depression, the struggles of a single mother - yet it does it a very unique way: it makes you reflect on it, without being too sad and/or unappealing. I would've loved to have more moments of the three main girls together, exploring their friendship more deeply, but nonetheless there are many scenes in which the girls help each other out and are there for each other. All in all, it's a great drama and I highly recommend it. The script is what I liked the most: fun, quirky and out of the ordinary (with many sarcastic lines/puns lmao).

One last thing: usually I'm not a fan of k-dramas OST because they're usually ballads and I'm not a fan of the genre, but the OST for Be Melodramatic went straight up to my most played song playlist. The songs are fun, lighthearted and captured the essence of the drama perfectly.

If you like those Reply series...
This drama is for those who liked the Reply series, it has the same feel. The best way to describe it would be ""Friends Korean style"" or ""Sex and the City"" without the sex part. Basically, pseudorealistic, no major twists and turns, low-grade comedy with some elements of romance. The drama doesn't have any familiar troupes (like people dying of cancer or the white truck of doom) or nothing spectacular to make it stand out, it's basically tasteless. The only thing I can compare it to is a boiled chicken breast - you keep chewing it with some hope that the flavor will come later, yet.... it never does.

My major complaints:

1. The plot. It's about nothing. There are three girls, and their lives are extremely boring. It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but... where is the comedy part? It's kind of in-between sad and boring. One girl was semi-psychotic and was imagining herself talking to her diseased bf. Is that supposed to be funny somehow?

2. The ML. To say that he is not an eye candy is an understatement. Also, no courtship. Like basically none. If I wanted to watch a below-average fellow who doesn't know how to court a girl, I would watch some American TV series. There is plenty of that there. Why bother making a Kdrama when the only feeling you get when you see him on the screen is disgust? Maybe he is a talented actor but he shouldn't be playing a romantic lead. It's disappointing. It didn't help that the writer made him sit on the couch and watch TV 90% of all the screen time.

3. The fart jokes. Okay, sometimes those physiological processes can be funny (like in Welcome to Waikiki, etc.) but it this drama it's more like a tongue-in-cheek thing that makes it more cringe-worthy than funny. The writer's and director's sense of humor is definitely off.

4. The writer and the director of this drama is a man. If there is one thing he DOESN'T know it's what girls in their 30s talk about. No, they don't talk about wrinkles or how they are getting old. The conversations in that drama are quite primitive.

If it is underrated, it's underrated for a reason. The drama has achieved 1.849% on national ratings, according to AGB Nielsen Media Research. Another cable drama, Crash Landing on You, has achieved 21.683% in the same category. Not that it matters but still.

The friendship between the leads is the highlight!
The first half of this series is solid. You will be automatically engrossed in in the lives of the characters by the second episode. My favorite character is Eun-jung. Her story was both heartbreaking and uplifting and the actress played her brilliantly. I wish she had more screentime than the main lead female who plays a writer. Although I enjoyed the main lead at the begining, by the end I found her annoying and the conversations she had with the 'director' were too philosophical and at times nonsensical. Maybe if I knew Korean I would understand better. The gist is that by the end they both aggravated me. I think the drama is slightly overrated here in MDL.

Joyous Slice of Life
I really enjoyed this drama, it made me laugh, cry, hold my breath, but also did not feel over the top at all throughout the whole drama. I enjoyed the diverse set of characters all with different backgrounds.

The story was pretty simplistic, but thats what made it great, there was no major plot to follow as it shows everyday life of 3 women. It was not over complicated or too unrealistic. It is what I expect a slice of life would be, nice and slow burning.

The actors/ actresses were fantastic at portraying their characters. Jeon Yeo Bin did an amazing job of acting as someone suffering from loss, and I loved the comedy that Ahn Jae Hong Brings to most roles I have seen him. He manages to brighten the drama which can have have some serious tones to it and make it less hard for the viewer.

Again with music, nothing struck me as amazing nor awful, so I do not have a proper say in this.

I would totally recommend this to you if you are wanting to watch a lovely slice of life about 3 career women with their own struggles.

Korean Gilmore Girls
Came here to say that this is certainly the best drama I have ever seen.

The two things that make this show unique to me are the fast-paced and sophisticated dialogue, coupled with intricate and fascinating character dynamics. Actually, I can't help but to think how much this show's writing and the themes that it explores is somehow reminiscent of another one of my all-time favorites, Gilmore Girls.

Besides that, I'm impressed by all of the talent that was involved and really thankful for the quality exemplified by this drama. There are only 16 episodes so I had to space them out, dreading the fact that it will end eventually. I think the best that I can hope for is to discover another show like Melo before I leave this world.

DRAMA OF THE YEAR 2021? YESSS!
Life is not all about pain and regrets, but about the experiences and learnings. The best thing about life is that it keeps moving forward. No matter what happens in our lives at one point, it keeps going on while letting us learn from it. This is my interpretation about the entire drama.

Í∞ØÎßàÏùÑ Ï∞®Ï∞®Ï∞®, literally, ""Seashore Village Cha-Cha-Cha, truly is a story living upto it's title, giving justice to its essence while capturing millions of hearts worldwide. It is a combination of coming of age chapters and healthy, warm as well as healing RomCom, accompanied with numerous life lessons, portrayed in the form of various relationships that also throws light upon uncountable shades of life, love and living. So what does it become? A PERFECT SLICE-OF-LIFE KOREAN DRAMA.

Plot is simple as you know. Oh Hye Jin, a capable and righteous dentists resigns from work and unable to find another clinic decides to open her own in the seashore village of Gongjin, which she had gone to visit on her mother's birthday. There she meets Hong Du Shik, an talented yet unemployed man who willfully does all kinds of odd jobs to help out the villagers and wish to continue his simple life. As they encounter each other multiple times and find each other's presence during respective critical times, the bond between them grows closer making them fall in love. All these happens in the premise where lives of the villagers go on parallely, accompanying continuous build-up, growth, healing giving away love & care, as a community which is more like an extended or chosen second family.

This shit is indeed hell of refreshing because of the scenario the drama has choosen as it's set, i. e. the fictional city of ""Gongjin"" which in real is the seaside village near Daegu-Gyeongbuk of Pohang, a South Korean city located in North Gyeongsang Province. The seaside milieu, the village settings, the city architecture and the awfully ecstatic frame of nature are the elements that undeniably attracted a lot of people to it. And what made it even more eye-catching is the cinematography skills of the production; brownie points please.

What also makes this drama stand out is the method of execution and the very natural way of diegesis (plot narrative). Relationships, regardless of it's type, are unquestionably complicated but life becomes a lil easier when we put efforts make it simple, this also is an underlying message of this drama. It's so natural that i felt I have been there with those people. Obviously, melo is an important element of any show of any genre, which is here too, but events should be as simple as a glass of water that makes it realistic in order to be appealing and relatable to the audience. I feel the drama successfully achieved that outcome.

Another thing that made me go awe was the fashion sense of the characters, please give the stylists bonus, okay? T T. Not just the young and adult characters, the kids and the oldies wore beautiful clothes of different kinds all the times, no matter how simple or flashy they were. I loved the florals that Hongbajang wore and sometimes the loose fit shirts. Hye Jin's one piece long skirts made her look so beautiful. The 3 old women in their usual outfits looked cute. Village chief Young Guk's simple yet loose fit big shirts and pants oof. Hwa Jung and Nam Sook's country-side dotted tops and pants looked nice. Chun Jae ahjussi and his half pant outfit plus scarf, my goodness. Geum Chul's entite country bumpkin style outfit and hairstyle. Bora's peach creamy hair and I Jun's decent clothes toooo. Eun Chul in both police uniform and civil clothes (soooo hot) and Mi Seon in her different kinda outfits. Sorry for the terms Idk bcs of my lack of fashion sense TT.

One of the most notable things about the drama should be all the female characters who made us see various sides of life and learn from it. Potential & stupendous female characters is nothing new for Kdrama industry but this drama should stand out in this regard for perfectly creating and nourishing such beautiful-hearted women. Different women trying their best for people around them and struggling for them isn't something new but these women, from young to the old, understood it better, I felt. Extra points for that for sure.

Since it's a slice of life story where day-to-day happenings are portrayed, drawing a definite plot development in overall is difficult. So, what we can witness are 2 kinds of developments. First the relationship between the leads along with others and secondly the individual character development. Let's talk about that...

Relationship Development of Lead Couple:--
Well, healing romance troupe has become a common factor nowadays but this surely is unique and let me explain how. Not bragging or saying I predicted it but I sure had assumed the way the chemistry between Hong Du Shik & Oh Hye Jin will develop, which happened for real making me so happy. Both of them obviously cared for each other and had liking as persons despite all the bitter encounters but until the point they fell for each in their conscious, the romance was very subtle. It was like they grew onto each other unknowingly and that feelings were piling up bit by bit over time. One day the the sac of love got so heavier, it burst open into an love relationship bonding, that was meant to last for eternity. They were definitely opening up to each other lil by lil and healing the other's pain gradually in the process but in their subconscious, it was love that was blooming up inside their hearts which one day led to prosperity and nostalgic emotions of happiness.

What made me happy how they proposed to each other at the perfect point of the story and even after officially getting into a relationship, the story showed us the following development. This was a gesture that, our lives and stories don't come to an end when we become each other's life because we have a long way to travel together, parallelly healing each other while helping both individual and coupled growth. Tbh, I was worried their relationship will turn typical following the proposal but guess what? They made me and in fact all of us, learn an important lesson of life, i. e. continuity. Obviously, there were many fluff moment's but the way of executing everything through the storytelling method abd screenplay techniques made it maintain own's naturality.

We're at a point where we have run out of new ides about events and stuffs to showcase in a relationship but what matters is how they're showed to us, how natural & relatable they feel and how realistic the outcome becomes. I am cent percent sure, this drama gave off that vibes.

NOTE: HONG DU SHIK & OH HYE JIN, uri ShikHye or dimple couple are one of the best Kdrama couples with one of the best chemistry development and a healing romance.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT :--
This is probably the best thing about the drama. Not just the individual development, the buildup plus nourishment of different kinda relationships were also well drawn. The character arcs of different roles came out so well, making us relate and learnt. Let's talk about them now...

# Hong Du Shik (Kim Seon Ho) aka uri Hong-bajang, the definition of ""Jack of all trades, master oÃ∂fÃ∂ Ã∂nÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂eÃ∂ at
all"". Talented yet no proper job carrying numerous small job certificates can help fix any kind of situations of the villagers. Loved by all yet orpahned and loner with thanatophobia (fear of losing someone close), he doesn't let anyone into his heart easily. Cares a great deal about the villagers tho.

# Oh Hye Jin (Shin Min Ah), the perfectionist dentist and very righteous at workplace who is also very calculative about her life. A dating rookie and doesn't want to be easygoing abd never gives in to people easily. A definite development as she changes into a warm women who admired everyone and got love in return. Very sensitive to her life decisions and helps Hong bajang in the end in healing his heart.

# Ji Sung Hyun (Lee Sang Yi), a variety show PD and Hye Jin's university senior who comes to Gongjin to shoot his show. He really went from romancing with Da Shik (Da Hee) in Once again (2020) to bromancing with Du Shik in this drama, haha. I can't say he's a potential 2nd ML affecting the lead couple's storyline but ge surely helped them in his subconscious. Very simple and decent character he had.

# Kim Gam Ri (Kim Young Ok) halmeoni, village supervisor and Du Shik's closest who have fed and cared for him since a young age. Very stubborn because of old age. Doesn't like spending money but fond of trying different dishes. Loves Du Shik the most and liked spending time with him.

# Lee Ma Ji (Lee Yong Yi) and Park Sook Ja (Shin Shin Ae) ..wish these halmione-deul had some more story for themselves but they were basically used as sidekick of Ga Rim-ssi. Regardless, very cheerful and cute. Their annoying and active faces plus the halmeoni trio made me cry outta happiness even when they were just fighting, that was so cute uwu.

# Yeo Hwa Jung (Rang Bo Ryun), the zone chief, restaurant owner and owner to both the places used by Hye Jin. Divorced for reasons known only to her and a single mother. Very sane, humble and understanding person she was though a lil insecure about his ex-husband and has hidden stories to tell. Loved the way she walked in here hahaha.

# Jang Young Guk (In Gyo Jin), village chief and Hwa Jung's ex husband, a lone man living alone and a loving father to his son. Irresponsible and indecisive at times. Not knowing the actual reason of divorce he deviates from his path for a while but eventually finds himself back in the same spot.

# Oh Chun Bae (Jo Han Chul), a failed singer, coffee shop owner, a widower and single loving father to his daughter. Still brags about his past achievement and wants recognition tho still a tender-hearted person who cares for his daughter to a great deal and misses his wife.

# Cho Nam Suk (Cha Chung Hwa), Chinese restaurant owner, loner who misses her deceased daughter. She loves to gossip and is the most definitite source of all the rumours that revolves around in the village. Very lively and cheerful as person. Loved her nasal accent and acting.

# Choi Geum Chul (Yoon Suk Hyun), Du Shik's only friend and hardware store owner. Married with a girl child and another to come. Somewhat naive and stupid but loves his family so much.

# Ham Yun Kyung (Kim Joo Yun), Geum Chul's wife and Bora supermarket owner. Very cheerful and mature for her age. Loves and cares for her family a lot and continuously nags her husband to do better job.

# Pyo Mi Sun (Gong Min Jung), Hye Jin's BeFe and the dentist nurse. Very clever and straightforward yet falls for guys instantly. Her chemistry development with constable Eun Chul was surely a sweet thing to watch.

# Choi Eun Chul (Kang Hyung Suk), Police substation constable and Geum Chul's younger brother who's very determined at job but stupid when comes to dating. Mi Sun helps her learn about relationship and they form the cutest couple of the show.

# Oh Ju Ri (Kim Min Seo), Chun Bae's daughter, a high-schooler and diehard fan of the boy group DOS (fandom Hacker). Misses her mother whom she lost right after birth. Can be stubborn and annoying at times still loves her father. A wannabe stylist.

# Choi Bo Ra (Go Do Yun), Yun Kyung & Geum Chul's daughter who's good at studies but have hidden talents. Loves Taekwondo and a lil aggressive. Adored by the villagers.

# Jang Yi Jun (Yi Eun Yoo), Hwa Jung & Young Guk's son who's the definition of genius. Too humble, polite and rationale for his age haha. BeFe with Bora and is always with her. As thoughtful as Hwa Jung.

Other than these major characters are some other actors who justified their decent roles and are indeed notable; Yu Cho Hui (Oh Ji Hee), Ban Young Hoon (Kim Sung Bum), Kang Do Ha (Lee Suk Hyung), Wang Ji Won (Park Ye Young), JUN (Byun Sang Tae), Yoon Tae Hwa (Seo Sang Won), Lee Myung Shin (Woo Mi Hwa), etc.

OSTS:
""Romantic Sunday"" by ""Car, the Garden"" is undoubtedly the best OST of this drama which is the remake of a 2007 hit by ""JISLAND"". I love all the other OSTs so muxh as well. The lyrics are all so beautiful and were relatable as well suitable for various moods of the drama. ""One Sunny Day"" by Kassy, ""My Romance"" by Cheeze, ""Wish"" by Choi Yu Ree, ""Be the Light"" by Kim Jae Hwan,
""The Image of You"" by Sandeul, ""Here Always"" by Skz Seungmin are all good. Some of them are romantic and others are soft soulful ones.

Both the writer and director have done a very good job, individually and as partners. It didn't feel like the writer doesn't have enough experience. I mean the number of work she's done is less but who'd say so after watching this drama? The PDnim obviously have enough experience, in fact one of the best drama PDs in Korea and that shows. Cinematography, sound production, screenplay editing are also very well done. Kudos to the entire crew for this amazing outcome. Thank you so much.

Technically, I love the various colour palettes used to showcase the beauty and aesthetics. The subtle presentation of props to connect and relay the storylines are quite alluring. Story progression is smooth and relaxing with multiple peaks as perfect points. Not a single thing felt exaggerated or boring. No twisted and complicated factor except for Hongbajang's mystery; very simple. The 1st ep is basically the introduction so stick to it in case you think it's not good. The childhood and teenage encounter and destined-to-be-together trope might have become a clich√© but it's fine as long as the present story is well painted and HomeCha successfully built-up a unique love story.

Let me also add important things included in the drama: mental health issues, loneliness, lgbt+ inclusion & acceptance, gender & clasa equality, dreams and determination to fulfill it, negligence to old parents as well as kids, ways of parenting & parental love, a kid's expectation from parents as well their hidden feelings, mutual understanding, overcoming past trauma, essence of aging and importance of old age, meaning of death, the art of healing other's pain, the difficulties of pregnancy, the urge of marriage, the hopes from your partner, community life & it's importance, self-love and it's vitality, process of opening up to your closest ones, learning to seek help from others, acknowledging the help and care you receive, understanding the gestures, facing life problems & tackling them, essence of independence, appreciating life, respecting other's efforts and their urge to do well, holding on to life, bringing out the best of you..... And many more that will cost me a notebook to mention.

NOTE: The last 3 episodes are the peaks of the episode where you might have to cry continuously, so make sure to take care of yourself if you're highly sensitive and very overwhelming to cry over small things.

Hometown Cha Cha Cha is definitely very realistic, refreshing and relatable with all the elements of a perfect slice of life Kdrama. I repeat, this is the best Kdrama year for 2021. Not only the healing romance of the lead couples, other side storylines that ran parallelly left us with lessons that we seek in our everyday life. Setting the rewatch value at 10/10 bcs this is something that can be easily watched as many as times you wish, even for random watch. PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH IT IF YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH ALL YOUR TIME AND INVESTED ENERGY PLUS EMOTIONS. *cries under blanket*. In fact been crying throughout while writing this review.

realistic. relatable. refreshing.
ik we are here for the ""dimple couple"" Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho (atleast I am) so I'll skip the introduction. I haven't seen the original work so i won't mention any comparison to it. the plot seemed like something new to me and trailer gave fresh vibes so I didn't hesitate to start (nor do I regret). I'd discuss some aspects in the drama I particularly loved so you may relate to it or consider watching :)

PLOT/PALETTE:
so. back to the drama. a girl leaves her job and goes to some rural place and sees a guy who's... everywhere? I thought it would be cdrama style clich√© but it's actually far from that (thankfully). color palette of episodes are really relaxing to watch. I'm not an artsy person and I don't know much about palettes but it's really calming and definitely suitable for the picturesque sceneries.

CHILDHOOD CONNECTION DONE RIGHT:
what i really loved in the drama is that despite the leads having a couple of childhood interactions, they don't give much importance to it and (rightfully) move forward because it was simply a part of their past. it was refreshing to see such an arc because in most dramas, the leads who hate eachother suddenly fall in love because they ""vowed to marry each other as 3 yo kids"" or whatever, you get the idea.

BEST PORTRAYAL OF LOVE TRIANGLE:
the characters are written realistically and mature. props to the crew for including minor details that may seem unimportant but really adds on to reality. there's no over the top cheesy lines and exaggerated portrayal as seen in many other rom-coms. every single arc (including love triangles) is carried out so well that no part of the drama bores the viewers. I simply can't stop admiring how beautifully the love triangle was carried out because in most case it would simply ruin the overall drama experience.

SIDE CHARACTERS HAVE THEIR OWN LIVES TOO:
the side chracters had their own story to tell, not just being comedic clowns or matchmakers for the main leads. ofc their story slightly depends on the leads because they are centres of the drama but we can agree the writer gave justice to the supporting casts by not always placing them in scenarios where leading characters need them. EVERY character had their own situations and struggles but the way each person grew through the story made me happy and proud.

overall, the drama kept it charm throughout. 100% worth the watch! long story short, start watching now!!

Meh
Is something wrong with me? Is it me? Am I the problem? Why can‚Äôt I see what everyone else seems to see in this drama?

Everyone was buzzing for this but I honestly hate having to wait in-between episodes and decided to not start this drama before more than 10 episodes were out. So I waited. And it just wasn‚Äôt what I wanted from it.
I wanted to love this so so so much. I needed this show, I needed a sweet, cozy, wholesome romance. There were days where I told myself to push through solely so I would live, to watch Homewtown Cha Cha Cha. And I can‚Äôt say that I was heavily disappointed, but I wasn‚Äôt impressed either.

I want to start off by saying this: Hometown Cha Cha Cha is fine. It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not bad by any means. But it‚Äôs just not more than that.
There are plenty of things to like about this: A beautiful, charming setting that will hit you with homesickness for a place you have never been to. Two good-looking leads. A catchy OST. A fun premise. Lots of lovable side characters. I sincerely love Yeo Hwa-jung, she was my favourite character by far, and even though I am not too pleased with the conclusion to her arc, she had the backstory I enjoyed the most and all things considered, she‚Äôs probably my favourite aspect of the entire show. There were a few comedic moments that made me chuckle. It was an alright watching experience. But people are calling this the romance drama of the year and I‚Äôm just not on board with that.

The number one thing I read about this show was how refreshing and healthy it was. And I just don‚Äôt see it. This felt more formulaic than I expected it to be. We have our male lead who is perfect in every single way and always correct. His one flaw is being too caring. We have our female lead whose only job is to be proven wrong by our male lead or getting saved by him. This is fine, honestly, what are most romance K-dramas if not female wish-fulfillment. But is it particularly new or interesting? I don‚Äôt think so. This felt less like a healthy and realistic portrayal of adult relationships and more like a Wattpad self-insert fanfiction. There are times where I want that from a story but this wasn‚Äôt one of them.
Surprisingly enough, eventhough I am easy to please in that regard, I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the romance between the two leads. I didn‚Äôt really understand the progression of them falling for each other, to me, that kind of came out of the blue. Which is a shame because I do think that the actors have chemistry. But it took ages for their characters to even become something close to friends. They had the same surface-level arguments every single episode, which always ended with Doo-sik proving Hye Jin wrong, and next thing you know I was expected to believe that the two were in love as well when I wasn‚Äôt even convinced that they liked each other.
I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the way this show dealt with Hongs past either. Since we only unpack his backstory in the last ¬º of the show, the first ¬æ of the drama felt weirdly trivial. All of the sudden, the entire feel of Hometown Cha Cha Cha just changed and got way too depressing for its own good. And the extent of trauma our male lead had, was way too heavy to be resolved in the little time the drama had left. It really felt like this show bit more off than it could chew. The subject matters were a tad too dark and the writing a tad too clumsy. Instead of our male lead having this ultra-depressing past, I much would have preferred it if both of our main characters could have been just two regular people, with regular people‚Äôs problems that made them flee from their city lives (similarly to Lovestruck In The City for example). But sadly Hometown Cha Cha lost everything that made it feel realistic or relatable by that point. And I honestly had to force myself to sit through the last few episodes, something I definitely didn't expect.

Maybe I am being too harsh on this drama. Maybe I would have given it a higher rating if my expectations had been lower. I gave My Roommate Is A Gumiho an 8.0 out of 10, and on every level, objectively speaking, that‚Äôs a worse show. But I knew what I wanted out of My Roommate Is A Gumiho and it delivered exactly that. I wanted it to be dumb, harmless, cheesy, cringy fun and that‚Äôs what it ended up being. But out of Hometown Cha Cha I expected more. Something more adult, more, fresh, more interesting. And it just wasn‚Äôt any of those things.

I do not understand the hype
I will cut to the chase. It was not bad, it was a nice series to watch to pass your time but the reviews make is sound like it's a masterpiece. The only unique aspect this series had to offer is the stories of the secondary characters. However, in classic kdrama fashion, they decided to focus on the main characters' romance instead of them. That wouldn't be an issue, if the main storyline was strong or if they managed to smoothly play in the main story but I found their story the least interesting, the only interesting parts of the main male protagonist were almost brushed off and resolved out of nowhere so it felt predictable and rushed. Instead the producers decided to cram in many overused clich√©s that offered nothing to the story. The 3-4 minute blatant Domino's pizza ad in the middle of the last episode was the cherry on top... you knew at that point the creator didnt really care to make a nice story. Dissapointing, because it could have been so much more.

Both main actors are amazing (and beautiful), great acting but the chemistry was not fully there.
As mentioned previously the stories of the villagers were incredible, they dealt with so many different issues and it left me craving for more.

This review may contain spoilers
refreshing and incredible.. until the later half

overall, this show was really really good. it was mostly light hearted with lots of mature dialogue, deep characters, beautiful cinematography, and more. for the first half, i was convinced this drama would be in my top three along with vincenzo and healer. up until episode 10, I think id give this show a 10/10. somewhere along the second half it seemed to have lost its spark, but none of the issues im going to discuss are reason enough to not watch this show. overall i recommend it.

as an overview, i love thinking about how much progression we saw over the course of 16 episodes. especially within the FL whom I feel was the main vessel of change, i can see a huge difference in her from the first to the last episode. same goes for the other characters, all of them had some kind of realization or moment at least once in the show, and i really appreciated how different people at different stages of life were all given a moment to have feelings and talk about their trauma, because thats real. There also arent any typical vicious drama villains: the second male lead is accepting, the teacher is actually just quietly in love with hwajeong, everyone feels real and not at all like a typical drama caricature. usually dramas forget everyone that isnt the main character, but not this one. i also really liked the vibe of the show itself, it promises and delivers a mature healing drama full of family and friendships and community and all that good stuff. The themes of second chances, the importance of emotional support, this was also so nice to see on screen. the writing was stellar, until the later episodes ( especially ep 15). The characters are all interesting, the cinematography is great, and even the ost is good, its an almost perfect drama if i ignore the later episodes.

im going to discuss stuff i didnt like because when a show is this good, the issues tend to stick out more than usual. Some of these things are very nitpicky, so dont take them as a reflection on the show as a whole.

full review below. SPOILERS

even though this drama covered many important topics such as the hardships women face (with the crazy pervert and the childbirth) and even included a lesbian (!!!), i felt that the way they addressed many of these topics was a little skewed and delivered the wrong message. as for childbirth, i was pleasantly surprised that they were depicting it on screen as well as reinforcing how hard it really is to be a woman. but it was ruined by FL saying how romantic it was when the husband promised to be by the wifes side even though the entire episode talked about how he was a horrible husband that didnt even change his kids diapers and didnt realize that childbirth was difficult. like what ?? and as for the teacher, she just comes and goes throughout the show and i wish she was on screen and talked about herself more (instead of showing up to give yeongguk a motivating speech about apologizing to hwajeong), since lgbtq are not often seen in kdramas. and then i enjoyed how they depicted change with the FL and trauma with ML, but the way his was only delved into in the last episode really sucked since i think that shouldve been a main focus along with FLs personality shift.
It feels like all of the issues I have with this show come down to an unbalance, or a right message gets skewed the wrong way, you‚Äôll see what I mean.


as for the FL, i generally enjoyed her growth. i loved how obvious it was, how realistic it seemed. it was gradual, but there were also specific moments where you can SEE her changes. like in episode 10 where she walks in the rain even though its something she hates, just because she recalls ML saying that she should let herself just exist. i love how open she becomes, with the way she confesses her feelings so openly in ep 10 with no hesitation. when she first came to gongjin she was so artificial, pretending to listen to everyone, smiling and nodding absentmindedly. it was a complete 180 to see her be as genuine and open as she became.

For the ML, his personality was always captivating, and he was an interesting character. here is where my first issue with the show comes in: they shouldve given chief hong more flaws. he doesnt seem to have any besides his trauma, which isnt really a ‚Äúcharacter flaw‚Äù, unlike FL that is judgmental, stubborn, unwilling to change sometimes, etc etc. especially in comparison to the FL, hong is TOO perfect. Plus you‚Äôd think someone with that much trauma would seemingly have more issues: maybe trust wise or be cold and angry, but he wasnt any of those things. Up until episode 10 (which I thought were 10 perfect episodes) FL grows as a person thanks to hong which is fantastic character growth and fantastic set up for their relationship, but hong doesn‚Äôt change at all. And why would he? He‚Äôs kind, helpful, can do everything. They should‚Äôve given him a basic flaw like being stubborn or something so he could change thanks to hyejin as well. But he was the one always calling out her flaws and mistakes while he remained the same, and although he was often justified I was sometimes annoyed at how he wouldn‚Äôt mind his own business and tried to change her when it wasnt his place.

The reason I keep saying ""up until episode 10"" is because after that I feel like the show lost its spark. character wise, the shift between pre-relationship FL and relationship FL was so jarring. She felt like an entirely different person. And yes people are cuter with the person they like of whatever, but they should‚Äôve incorporated some of this into her pre-personality so it wouldn‚Äôt come off as so strange when she suddenly started acting this way. I also felt like some of her character development was wiped off after episode 10. in fact, i occasionally felt that the FL was even more unreasonable and unlikeable than in the beginning. In episode 11, she hurt ML physically and emotionally, such as when she asked him to take care of the Second Male Lead, when she has unreasonable requests, when she takes him to see the sunrise at 4 am, when she makes him wear school uniforms to take pictures. especially when she drags him around the mall and he‚Äôs clearly saying no to doing things and she pressures him when he constantly says no. And to keep their relationship a secret hyejin hurts dusik throughout the entirety of ep 11. physical violence is never okay, especially not for comedic purposes. the fact that it was done multiple times made me less and less excited to finish that episode. and the fact that her go to reaction when she was surprised was to hurt him really made me dislike her, despite all of the progress that they made on her personality. this also really pushes the narrative that shes full of flaws and he isnt because hes forgiving and understanding.


Back to the ML, he was the one that carried this Big Secret Trauma for a majority of the show which like I said earlier was made out to be his only flaw. we didnt even know what it was until nearly the last two episodes, which I have a few issues with.
i dont appreciate how they approached his trauma as a flaw, because it isnt. everyone has trauma and issues, and not everyone reacts to it the same way. hyejin was hurt by her ex bfs words that caused her to be more materialistic, but she never shares that with ML. yet she expects him to share everything with her? she had a line where she said ""im okay with showing you all of me, so why cant you do that for me?"" which, just because hes seen you drunk and met your stepmom does not mean he needs to reveal more than hes comfortable with. she pushes him constantly to open up about his trauma (that was much more severe than her ex saying she dresses ugly) and i thought this whole situation and episode were so unreasonable. i understand that she expected more from him and their relationship, she was thinking of their future and he wasnt yet. i empathize, im sure its hard when your S/O isnt where you are and youre feeling anxious about where your relationship is going. but they had only been dating for what, a few weeks at that point? that combined with how much pressure she was putting on someone that was clearly hurting made it hard for me to feel for her.

plus, when SHE decided they need a break, she kept rubbing it in his face saying ‚Äúwe are on break- BUt why arent you saying anything to me? im giving you time- BUT why wont you tell me your secrets?!? we‚Äôre on break-BUT-here i am at your house even though i suggested the break!‚Äù and then she ends the break when she feels like it- even though initially it was supposed to be FOR him to heal. this was why, despite me being understanding of how hurt she was about ML not being open about his past, i just couldnt be on her side. This was one of the moments where again, I felt that her character development was setback.
the way this led to people blaming hong when he was trying to deal with TRAUMA was just so ?? disgusting to me. no one knows what hes dealing with, but they keep pushing him. It is never anyones place to push someone to speak about their trauma or disclose aspects of their personal life if they are not ready to do so.
And hwajeong tells FL that she should give it time, which had a nice sentiment, but then she told FL to be MLs rock. Again, taking a lovely scene with a good script and turning it into something that isnt necessarily a great message. If someone isn‚Äôt in the same place emotionally where you are then you dont need to wait for them. this is another reason i couldnt entirely be on FLs side, if hong isnt where she is and he doesnt want the future she wants, she cant just force him into it. even though i loved them as a couple, they shouldve just had them break up then instead of depicting their relationship how they did. you should never push someone when they arent ready, and you dont need to wait by that person either. if you want a future, and your partner just isnt sure, then you dont need to be with them. The result of this situation was as I mentioned, FL constantly pushing ML and reminding him that she is giving him the HONOR of her patience, while he struggles to deal with his internal conflicts. The way this whole episode was handled was a big no from me.

as for ML‚Äôs actual trauma, they dragged it on for SO long. and im not saying it wasnt worth the wait, but I was underwhelmed. Maybe the trauma they gave him would‚Äôve panned out better had they disclosed it earlier and had him work on himself for the remaining episodes, but they chose to build suspense and shove it on us at the very end. Which, okay fine, but this didnt work for me. Despite the big suspense, he wasnt a murderer or anything, he blamed himself for a situation that was unfortunate but not at all his fault. Some people hypothesized that he was in a car accident with his wife and child which i think wouldve been better to fulfill the suspense than what actually happened, which was that he was there for the death of his best friend and dohas father became paralyzed (which had NOTHING to do with hong and was entirely the fault of the father who made a reckless decision). but the show treated him like a murderer which is pointless for several reasons. for one, when doha calls him a murderer, no one in gongjin actually thinks he is one so theres no outer conflict. we are never under the impression that he is either because he has proven over and over again that he is kind and good natured, so its more annoying than anything else that the show treats him this way. that leads into two, we are watching this pan out as an audience. we KNOW none of it is his fault, so watching this poor guy blame himself since childhood for his parents and grandfathers death, and then those related to the adult deaths blame him for those, it just sucked. its just not great to watch someone get beaten down over and over again, especially since this is a made up ""healing"" story and the writers can do whatever they want with it, and they chose to leave the actual healing for the very last minute. in real life, yeah there are probably people like hong. but this is a drama and watching his internal conflict pan out just doesnt make sense when its entirely in his mind and he didnt actually DO anything wrong. so its just annoying and unsatisfactory when for 15 episodes youve been like WHAT is this trauma and that answer is: another accidental death that has nothing to do with hong and everything to do with everyone else. i guess in a sense its realistic that he might get blamed by those that are hurting, but i just felt like i was watching this perfect guy who has lived a shitty life get blamed over and over again, and even now when he is supposed to be forgiving himself, the wife of his friend refused to apologize and doha tells him he shouldve taken better care of his father. what poor writing, there should be a balance between the tragedy and how much shit this poor guy gets and the healing (not to mention gamri dying in the same episode??). how many times do we need to see him apologize for things out of his control and get hurt? i think his healing shouldve been a main focus, maybe cutting into the time of all of the unnecessary misunderstandings and filler moments or even into FLs personality change. because although her arc was important, we watched her change throughout the entire show and he only got the last episode.


All of this happens in the second half of the show, which like I said lost its spark. The scenes felt a little more childish, with more misunderstandings to brace us for the couples upcoming conflict, and more happy go lucky filler to brace us for the reveal of the Big Trauma. the trauma itself wasnt handled well either. honestly, i kind of lost interest and had a hard time sitting through the episodes, while before id open netflix the second the episode was up and watch it immediately. i still really appreciated the show, but it didnt give me the same feelings as before.

Also in the second half, we see less of the other characters and focus more on the main relationship. I thought this was a big mistake because initially the magic of the show was the family feel and the environment, but that dwindles away to give focus to how the main relationship develops and has misunderstandings. the other characters only seem to come in to give motivational speeches or to make minor commentary (like in ep 15 when hongs trauma is revealed and they sit there for two seconds and take turns saying they are worried about him) or to help add to the drama (like in ep 14 when doha punches hong, everyone in gongjin is there to add to the dramatic feel). I wish we focused more on everyones individual lives ad relationship at that point, instead of making way for silly misunderstandings or filler or the Big Trauma. like the scene with yijoon and his parents getting back together was so heartfelt, and i think we shouldve gotten more of that with each character.Like I said, a solution to this wouldve been disclosing the trauma earlier and gradually working on it, which wouldve given more time for hong to actually get over it (because I can‚Äôt believe that in the span of an episode his years long trauma disappears) and the other characters could‚Äôve had more screen time.


i think the shows flaws come down to one thing: an unbalance. an unbalance within flaws, an unbalance with the pacing, an unbalance with the characters personality. There was even an unbalance of storytelling and mood: the whole drama was mature but then we have the childhood connection, really? That didnt even add anything to the story so why was it even in there? plus the way everyone was connected?? PD is related to the wife of hongs best friend and PDs editor is the son of he guy who worked at hongs company and PD went to school with hyejin and they all meet up in this one small town i mean ?? really ?? It felt unfitting for a show that was otherwise serious and realistic. And where was miseon, FLs best friend, for half of the show? In some episodes she just wasnt home, or she just isnt mentioned. She only starts showing up for relationship issues in the later half of the show. I loved their friendship, so I wouldve loved to see more of them. I also wouldve loved to see more interactions between the gongjin citizens and hyejin after her personality shift. these are just little things that could‚Äôve been changed to greatly improve the show.

Of course I dont expect perfection, but some of these flaws were so avoidable. Just taking away the line about hyejin romanticizing the poor relationship between the market owner and the hardware owner or just leaving the line from hwajeong at ‚Äú wait for him to open up‚Äù instead of saying be his rock, all of this wouldve fixed what I think of as a flaw. Overall, I do think this show was really really good. But because I had such high expectations for it, how some of the scenes were handled really set it back.

It's rom-com till it's not,
There are a total of 5 basic tastes.. ""sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory."" Other than these our taste buds can't detect anything, each taste has its importance, own value. Now just think: You are eating the same kind of food every day with the same taste, that is sweet. On the first day you'll end up loving it, the second time you will think it's good... but after some time it won't be as good as it was before, you'll be annoyed maybe also end up hating how it tastes, coz you need all tastes to satisfy your taste buds only one is not enough, bitterness might be the worst flavor before but it also is in need with sweetness, to balance out everything perfectly.

No, I'm not writing a cookbook. I just couldn't find the best metaphor to describe the drama, but it seems I do now. Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha is the combination of all these flavors. It's sweet for romance, bitter for its darkness... it's salty, sour, savory with the combination of quirky humor, heartwarming/breaking backstories. Yet not only the story offers all flavors so do the characters.

Disclaimer: This is going to be super long review.

I didn't know before I would be enlightened just by shoe scene or either found doing laundry together can be a most romantic date. Drenching in rain can brighten up my mood enough for me to smile like an idiot. We don't need majestic or grand proposals and gestures... just little moments are enough to make your heart flutter and put a smile on your face.

A slice of life, healing, it's a mystery too, then it has also a bit of melodrama, it is a tragedy. It's a lot in disguise of rom-com. Being character-driven, cliches-predictableness-troupes: do these things matter? the story is enough to get hooked till the last episode with its flow, execution, and of course those cliffhangers. Rather than having a straight solid story, it's the combination of characters-their life-their backstories while we're experiencing leads journey together... and this is like solving a puzzle, not every piece is the same but when they come together it fits perfectly. Backstories of side roles don't affect the narrative of the main plotline, it ends up enhancing it in a better way: Coz these are refreshing, even heartbreaking.. and tragic too while this sure explains having all flavors in characters.

Thinking of cons. The first thing that comes to my mind is coincidences, a lot of freaking coincidences, not just it implies how 'fated and destined' leads are together but it sure makes it to unrealities of their past encounters. And how come just everyone ends up in Gongjin... it's a bit too much in the scenario of realistic development of the story. The labour was handled terribly, the stalker part was hella unnecessary. Sometimes it lacks in flow and balancing out things, having great first half. It starts to lose its charm and the flow a bit by bit, offering 2 cringy, a bit cheesy, you'll-get-diabetic-like-sweetness episodes that don't really add anything to the story almost feeling like filers, and later it becomes dark a heavy emotional ride.. and this transaction from too much sweetness to the darker side is not very ideal, it could have been better.

The pacing of it doesn't make it bingeable, it's good for the slow watch.. bits by bits, you can't take huge chunks together then no fun as it's not amusing either surprising. But having a lot of heart-fluttering moments, a good laugh, even some pearls of wisdom without going overboard.

Let's talk about characters, the most important part.
Du Shik... overcoming the past, accepting himself, and start living with a real smile. This is his story more than anyone else. He's charming, caring, hardworking, talented almost without any flaws, maybe 'perfection' it's the flaw of his characterization (okay this is me, who prefer flawed characters more). He's just so picture-perfect to the point he doesn't feel real. He seems so approachable yet distant as a character. Someone who can be only a fictional character. He's the dream guy anyone would want in their life. Though I'm no fan of the ideal characters I do find Hongbanjag as an interesting character, it was fun to discover every side of him... actually even after making him unflawed still his character never felt 1-D. I have a lot to talk about his trauma but without spoiling it here.. I'll post it as a spoiler comment below.

I don't think anyone can have chemistry with Halmonies as Kim Seon Ho can, not only Halmonies but almost with every character he encounters... you can even debate on if he had more spark with Lee Sang Yi than Shin Min Ah lol, as Dong Shik is perfect as a character KSH is perfect at portraying him. With his charming smile that's highly contagious, I've to admit I spent a lot of time just smiling like an idiot while watching him and this isn't only abt looks or dimples lol. The same goes for emotional scenes, you can feel pain just by seeing his face.. even his fake-smile-pretending-to-be-okay is detectable in one glance. I don't think he could have been better than this.

I found Hye Jin's character relatable, she sure seems more than just being fictional leaning towards reality. She's straightforward and practical. Her development is pleasing to watch but I don't think she was any bad from the start or in need of 180-degree change. Just think of a scenario from her side: Her childhood wasn't the best, she struggled in her college days, she made herself where she's now facing all problems on her own, so her being a little stiff or insensitive towards some topics is acceptable. Having moved to the countryside as a city girl you can't adapt to the environment out of blue... growing up in a broken family you just can't accept having all people around with comfort, it takes time... that's why I enjoyed her journey of finding comfort in Gongjin. But then again it went backward where I loved seeing improvement in Hye Jin's, I was annoyed by insensitivity and lack of empathy from in some of the last episodes. I would call it rather inconsistent writing of her character.

Shin Min Ah she's stunning and very pretty. The best casting as Hye Jin seems tailor-made for her. Though I still feel her performance was a bit underwhelming in some parts.. she was great at the start, but I won't deny her being a bit over the top in almost cringe-worthy scenes. I wouldn't blame only her for it coz many times KSH ends up overshadowing everyone lol.. but apart from she did a good job. Plus they have sizzling chemistry together well what do we need more?

This one fits in the love triangle done right! it was handled with maturity. Sung Hyun is lovable and most mature... its funny to watch with being smart how oblivious he can be. I pitied him a bit but Du Shik has more priority lol so it was like for a microsecond. Other than the big coincidence of Sung Hyun ending up in Gongjin, his contribution in the story wasn't for forced or annoying... I enjoyed seeing Donk Shik getting jealous and showing his insecurities, it kinda worked as a catalyst.

The second couple is just sooo adorable, their awkward cuteness is fun to watch. The special thing about the drama is you don't only enjoy seeing leads on screen but you also enjoy seeing supporting roles... and they do have a lot of screen time but it's enjoyable. The relationship dynamics of everyone are just so amazing. There's complete family, a broken family, three best friends Halmonies, two little stars of the show... and the bonds stronger than blood relations. Together they form a family... a very happy family.

I ended up skipping Hwa Jeong's scenes with Yeong Guk they are the only ones I wasn't rooting for, I strongly believe Hwa Jeong deserves better.. a lot better, maybe just an apology from Yeong Guk would have been more than enough.... but then thinking from I-Jun's perspective I wasn't mad at the end.

I-Jun is a show stealer for me, He's such a sweetheart, more mature than half of the characters. I-Jun's character shows the details of production, why? throughout the drama, we see how considerate and amazing mom Hwa Jeong is so I-Jun's being like her this in his mom's presence is quite relatable... Hat's off to Ki Eun Yoo this kid is just 8 yrs old, but the acting he did was remarkable, I shed tears while watching him crying it broke my heart.

Hye Jin and Mi Seon's relationship is friendship goals! I also love I-Jun, Bo Ra's friendship with Oh Yoon, and Ju Ri's father-daughter dynamics. Gam Ri is my favorite character of all time. She's so lovely.. and stubbornness kinda reminds me of my grandma, maybe that's why I love her more how can I forget she have the neatest handwriting. I trio of Halmoies was one of the best things.

The poster doesn't serve justice to drama lol. It's not important but I wanted to say xD

It is simply beautiful, the aesthetics, the cinematography is amazing one of the most beautiful shows I've ever seen and yeah my storage is filled with a lot of snaps lol. I admire using the real place for shooting than sets coz it adds up more details... if you observe you'll notice scratches on wooden floors and withering of houses, it indicated people do live here.

Music is awesome.. after each episode going to Spotify and playing ost doesn't happen to me everyday lol, songs need to be addictive and no one can deny 'Romantic Sunday' is not addictive with its La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la. These days even my 8 yr old brother has learned to sing with me sha-la-la-la-la and la-la-la-la xD

It's a feel-good drama, it's tear-jerker at the same time. More like a well-made cocktail. But don't confuse this with just a romantic comedy. Objectively 9.5 is a lot but I enjoyed it with my full heart, and my guess of the third mystery was correct so what's more important?

Will You ‚Äò Cha Cha Cha‚Äô into watching this drama?

Aside from its questionable title ‚Äò Hometown Cha Cha Cha‚Äô is a remake of the rom-com‚Äô Mr. Hong‚Äô (2004) updated and directed by Yoo Je-won, the same director behind dramas such as ‚ÄòOh My Ghostess‚Äô and ‚ÄòTomorrow With You‚Äô. The storyline isn‚Äôt labyrinthine . Cha-Cha-Cha is a straightforward rom-com ( taken from the original movie) of ‚Äú city girl moves back to the sticks and falls in love‚Äù. However this boils down to the ultimate question for newcomers thinking of picking the series up; ‚Äúis ‚Äò Hometown Cha Cha Cha‚Äô actually worth watching? ‚Äú

Arguably the drama does a really good job at subverting certain cliches and stereotypes beyond the expectations of viewers . Whilst the villagers are sometimes used for stock comedy , they are often more than just filler characters also. Many of them have their own problems which are revealed as the series progresses. For example Oh Cheon-jae (Jo Han-chul) is a cafe owner and a washed-up one hit wonder who despite often ending up as the butt end of the joke, has a more sensitive side by desperately yearning to return back to his brief glory days. There was something oddly heartfelt about each episode taking a moment away in order to focus upon side characters such as the village grandmas who main heroine Hye Jin (Shin Min Ah ) encounters in this small seaside town.

On the other hand this brings us onto one of the biggest elephants in the room surrounding our main female lead Hye Jin. Actress Shin Min Ah is decent enough here. On the other hand her onscreen persona Hye Jin is trickier to address. Hye-Jin is the epitome of the ‚Äú carte blanche female lead‚Äù; a character who has some necessary plot-driven angst, sweetness and backstory, but rarely has more definitive depth, emotions and realistic flaws.

Adding to the issue of Hye-Jin‚Äôs character arc is that whilst she does have ‚Äúflaws‚Äù they‚Äôre never really pointed out by director Je-Won more directly . This is because Je-Won tries too hard to present Hye-Jin as a ‚Äú loveable and perfect‚Äù female heroine without considering that perfection can often be flawed . Of course our MC does have her sob story and angst-ridden moments later on in the series but these scenes rarely enforced more powerful emotions onto viewers as there was little to make Hye-Jin grow or learn from her past mistakes . This was case and point when others such as male lead and main love interest Du Sik( Kim Seon Ho) pointed out Hye-Jin‚Äôs mistakes at times as arrogant or rude, the drama rarely gave her the chance to grow or explain herself without either turning the blame on Du Sik for interfering, making Hye-Jin burst into tears or failing to accept her own mistakes sincerely . The problem with Hye Jin is that her character arc runs on pure plot device steam than actual character writing- we never find out what really drives Hye Jin either through her current flaws addressed, her career and future goals ( rather than mere romance) or for the sake of plot.

This moves us onto main lead Du Sik. Similar to costar Shin Min Ah, Kim Seon Ho was delightful as dexterous ‚Äúall-round-ace‚Äù Du Sik- adding his own sweet charm to a character with a surprising amount of profoundness . He‚Äôs an extrovert, incredibly talented at everything and good-natured but also shares his own personal troubles as well. On the other hand whilst later episode scenes relished in tackling Du Sik‚Äôs past, this did feel slightly rushed than well-paced. We do see Du Sik‚Äôs problems build-up in early scenes and it was surprisingly refreshing to see vulnerability against a seemingly ‚Äú strong‚Äù character such as Du Sik.

Consequently it felt as though the drama could‚Äôve done more to have built-up dramatic tension around Du Sik‚Äôs past and character arc. Whilst it is used to present drama and a spanner in the works with his relationship with Hye Jin, it was evidently used to add some tension and dramatic dilemmas rather than feeling gradually built up or allowing to present the profound connection between our leads more sincerely.

This of course leads us to discussing about the romantic setup between our leads which is (unsurprisingly)a rocky road. On a positive note it was heartwarming to see their feelings blossom . Even from the first episode the route of potential romance between our main characters was obvious. Bland chemistry in early episodes was ignited by more cutesy interactions as episodes progressed as well as fire added to the flames with dramatic tension keeping the ball game going between the two characters.

Similar to his previous works, Yoo Je-Won adds his own personal touch of oozy sweetness to the overall production. Pohang City in the province of North Gyeongsang in South Korea sets the perfect location for the fictional Gongjin village. The blue horizons of clear skies and crystal waters, provided an idealistic escape throughout the series.Vivid cinematography accentuates scenes alongside bright lighting, whilst more slapstick comedy from the original movie is replaced by a few farce scenes in order to focus upon more meaningful scenes between its main characters. The ending offers a more bittersweet note for viewers with an ending that was sweet but admittedly expected.

‚Äò Hometown Cha Cha Cha‚Äô is the epitome of a rudimentary sweet sugary ice cream treat- cutesy fluff and with its own bittersweet edge at times, but it could easily melt under the pressure of its own plot build-up and dramatic tension. Overall it is really dependent on what you‚Äôre looking for in a drama- a quick, easy and back-burner romance setup ( which you‚Äôve probably seen a million times already) in order to pass the time? Then definitely.

Slice Of Life and Everything Else...
Maybe this review will sound more like a drunk message to an ex whom you're not willing to let go.

Maybe this is not a review at all, it's just me trying to deal with the fact that the drama I have been obsessed with since its casting news got confirmed is...O-V-E-R, over. And so is my life. Okay, I am over exaggerating here but am I?

Spent my weekdays blissfully rewatching the previous episodes, analysing every other little detail the show had to offer because the writers incorporated so many layers and deep meanings to each scene and dialogue.

Not to mention had such an amazing time discussing and fangirling over the enigma that was Hong Dushik, gushing about how God awful relatable and funny the Gongjin fam was (where else will I find such wholesome side characters again?) and putting into words the feels of watching the leads gradually falling in love as if for the very first time while romantic sunday played in the background, weekend after weekend, here in the comments section.

Despite some of its minor flaws (which I can probably justify btw) personally, this show will always have a special place. Because if I had to describe the entire thing in one word it'll be- BEAUTIFUL.

From its cinematography, coastal locations, familial themes and how they were dealt with to all its character interactions and gradual growth to almost perfection. Everything comes down to being beautiful and not in a on your face way but a more sublime, understated take to the word.
As if the show itself doesn't know its beauty but only we as viewers could acknowledge and appreciate it. Which needless to say, I obviously did.

I'll probably listen to all the Home-Cha OSTs now and cry a river with the realisation sinking in that no more will I be privy to Du Shik and Hye Jin's bantering like them old couples, Ju-Ri fangirling over her favourite idol all the while his dad pitying her for missing out on the real idol in the town- him. I-Jun and Bora's cute lil friendship and hedgehog both as a pet and a metaphor will be as badly missed and don't even get me started on the grannies and Mi Seon's budding romance with the cutie cop which almost felt like courting before an arranged marriage? I don't know I want a spin-off focusing on just these two and that's it!

Honestly, the myriad of emotions all the characters made me feel throughout the show's runtime will be a fond memory because they included not just those hearty feels but also loaded it with things that I would love to reminisce about, things that actually matter in a society and I, as a viewer could empathise and/or sympathise with
1. Mental Health
2. LGBT inclusion
3. Acceptance
4. Death
5. A child's suppressed feeling of a broken family
6. Remorse

Just a thought but if every man watched Hometown cha cha cha and set Du Shik as the standard the world might be a better place.

The Love triangle which I dreaded would ruin the happy-go-lucky vibe of it all, was nothing but a mere journey of complete closure from a relationship that never actually found its perfect timing. Who hasn't gone through that? So the dreadful triangle wasn't dreadful at all but a lesson on maturity and moving on. Quite unexpected and like I said, beautiful.

Lastly, I bargained just for Kim Seon Ho's character to finally have a happy ending but got drowned in the emotional pile of it all by the end. No wonder I am still crying and smiling at the same time.

Anyway that was me, ranting my views and sorrows from one Homecha lover to the other (and hopefully to the future ones too).

P.S. since I was supposed to be helpful which am guessing I exactly wasn't? Here's link to my article for the drama which has all the overall critiques and opinion.

A Sanctuary
The beautiful seaside village of Gongjin, with its picturesque landscape, sandy beaches, rustic homes and a quaint red lighthouse that overlooks the vast openness of the ocean. It is the perfect sanctuary for weary travellers and those who seek refuge in its peaceful, idyllic setting. All visitors from near and far are warmly received by its friendly inhabitants with wide smiles, open arms and fresh seafood. Welcome to Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (where the only thing that‚Äôs perhaps missing is a dental clinic).

This fictional village truly exists but goes by a different name in real life - it is actually the coastal town of Pohang in South Korea‚Äôs east coast. HomeCha is a remake of the 2004 film, Mr Hong, which in turn is based on the original screenplay written by Kang Seok Beom and Shin Jung Goo. The 2021 iteration is helmed by Yoo Je Won (The King: Eternal Monarch and Hi Bye, Mama!) and adapted into the 16-episode drama format by Shin Ha Eun (The Crowned Clown and Argon). Im Ha Young (Oh My Ghost and Search: WWW) serves as music director.

As it was in the movie, Homecha is a rom-com about a girl from the big city who moves to the quiet little village where she meets and falls in love with a local boy. Sounds like the typical fish out of water character in an opposites attract love story except there‚Äôs more than meets the eye. In addition to the romance and comedy, this is a healing drama that explores slice of life aspects, from the mundane to the extraordinary, amidst a backdrop of myriad colourful characters and mysterious backstories.

I haven‚Äôt watched nearly enough K-drama romcoms to qualify as an expert in this subject but I‚Äôm well aware of the associated tropes that are usually present in the genre. This drama is no exception and features a number of such cliches and plot devices in the storytelling, which I don‚Äôt really mind because for the most part, they are generally well executed and not OTT. Despite the plot being rather straightforward, it has to be said, it does start off brightly and remains steadily engaging along with a multitude of story arcs and sub-plots involving certain side characters, mainly the residents of the seaside village. It‚Äôs not all rainbows and sunshine, however, due to the inclusion of angst and tragic circumstances in the overarching story.

The production is of high quality and the scenic location of the principal photography affords the drama some utterly breathtaking panoramic vistas, largely attributed to the excellent all-round cinematography. The well-rendered night shots particularly at the waterfront and pier deserve praise as well as the art direction and overall interior set designs of the traditional village homes. The action sequences are minimal but the special effects for a significant event in episode 15 are very well executed.

As far as the cast is concerned, Kim Seon Ho shines the brightest as the affable and down-to-earth Hong Du Shik aka Chief Hong. He certainly fits the role to the tee and rounds off his performance with a powerfully emotional delivery towards the closing stages of the drama that is heart-wrenching to witness. Shin Min Ah portrays the FL Yoon Hye Jin who eventually falls in love with Chief Hong. I find the character somewhat lacking in depth and infuriating at times, while her interpretation of the role is merely adequate. She is certainly capable of more dramatic range but seems to be constrained by the limitations of the script. Nonetheless, both Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah do complement each other visually and the chemistry that they share appears convincingly developed. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the production takes full advantage of their similar facial features for viewers to assign the moniker of ‚Äúdimple couple‚Äù to the leads.

Among the supporting cast, Lee Bong Ryun and Kim Young Ok impressed me the most, as Yeo Hwa Jeong and Kim Gam Ri respectively. These two veterans certainly showcased their nuanced portrayals throughout. Despite her limited screen time, Kim Ji Hyun is memorable in her guest role of Seon A, a testament to her stage experience indeed. The child actors are also deserving of praise, especially Ki Eun Yoo as Jang Yi Jun.

The drama features 8 OSTs, the most prominent being its upbeat main theme, Beautiful Sunday which reflects the overall tone of the production. The rest of the soundtrack consists of slow-tempo love ballads.

HomeCha is generally an easy and relaxing watch that provides sufficient heartwarming and entertaining moments to fill the weekend and in between more serious or darker dramas in the watch list, which was exactly what I did. The story did take a brief detour through a slightly melodramatic and angsty arc, but eventually everything worked out to deliver a much needed HEA ending for everyone involved.

Weak writing and surface-level characterizations
I enjoy deep, meaningful slice of life interactions such as those in When The Camellia Blooms, Hospital Playlist, and Because This Is My First Life. In comparison, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha was a failed attempt. The script was written without the use of metaphors or stories, only direct, curt lines that are delivered as if spoken by an immature teen. There is zero wit, description, or complexity, which is the whole point of character-driven dramas. The only breath of fresh air was the backdrop of the beautiful seaside town of Pohang, which provided a light, airy feeling to each camera shot.

The directing and writing suffers from flawed execution. Either the cheese factor is overdone and cringey, or an unnatural indifference washes over the characters. For instance, when someone is in tears and pain, the other character just watches them in silence for five seconds before any kind of touch happens and even then, it's the type of pat you give someone who dropped their ice cream, not when there is actual trauma. Characters respond with trivial lines that sound something like, ""It will be OK,"" and that's it. There are no further connections, words of wisdom, or stories shared in those meaningful moments. Characters are robbed of the chance to show how they are feeling, how they have grown, or how they are affected by what is going on. We are left to wonder what else they are thinking in their heads.

The lack of characterization also affects the story itself. The plot challenges in the first 3/4 of the show feel trivial because of the lack of follow-through on character growth and reflection. Even serious issues are glossed over and cut short. It isn't until the last few episodes that the writer suddenly decides to explore dramatic back stories and character development. The time in the first part of the show is wasted.

The actors try hard, but I bet even they were cringing at the script. Shin Min Ah plays Hye Jin as your classic cool-but-conceited woman, which could have worked had we actually been shown her inner thoughts and transformations. However, I like that in this role and others, she plays a smart person as opposed to a damsel in distress. Kim Seon Ho as Doo Shik comes across as overly breezy, hollow, and idealistic for far too much of the story, until the end bits. When we finally learn about his past, the weak script and characterization lets us down once again with more meaningless, ""It will be OK,""*pat*pat* lines. I enjoyed Lee Sang Yi as the TV producer. He brought charisma and energy to his flat character. I liked that both male leads were good people. Finally, a shout-out goes to supporting actors In Gyo Jin as the bumbling District Head, and his strong, kind ex-wife played by Lee Bong Ryun. Of all the characters, they had the greatest number of heartfelt, meaningful interactions. The rest of the townspeople were one dimensional or just plain annoying. What a shame that this was the case.

In the end, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha paints with hollow, cringey, sepia-sweet colors to create nothing more than a postcard with no message. Although the actors tried to deliver, the writing, directing, and lack of characterization ruined its potential.

Soothing to Your eyes...!!! For Sure.
In this era of all dark theme kdramas, this drama will sooth your eyes. This is one hell of a refreshing drama?.
About the plot I thought it would be slow paced but I was wrong, it is not slow at all and evolves beautifully.?
And the casting is just so perfect.Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah did their job perfectly and put a lot of efforts.Their visuals are out of this world.Their chemistry is just adorable.Kim Seon Ho showing his perfect body in some shot are ??.
There are many charecters, and they all have their own stories in life.
The people around them are so relatable like we all have these kind of people in our lifes.

In short the best healing drama of 2021.??

Swoon marathon - wholesome it its simplicity; deficient in its variety.
First off, the earlier episodes are much better than the rest of the show. Up to the seventh episode I was certain that this show might pocket all upcoming awards, but the episodes thereafter are - not necessarily bad - but a little letdown compared to the earlier eps.

The biggest plus of this show are the characters and their relationships, the slow pace as well as the chemistry of the lead couple and the scenery. But at the same time these aspects are somehow also the downfall of this drama. For example, some characters are left unexplored or just briefly touched upon, while other characters and their relationships are of primarily focus, being addressed again and again, but just don't move you, to be blatantly honest, do not intrigue you at all. I cannot put my finger on it, but even though some dialogues between the characters are extremely emotional and poignant, the relationships lack depth. 'Where the Camellia Blooms' had done a better job here.
The slow paced plot line which worked in favor of the leads in the earlier episodes as we got plenty of witty verbal exchanges, stealing glances and gestures, meaningful moments and heart fluttering push and pull scenes, helped to build their relationship and let the viewer be part of not only their growing attraction but also attachment and comfort to and with each other. However, after a while these lengthy conversations and moments of togetherness were not leading anywhere and felt repetitive and I do not dare to say boring, but sort of tedious and wearisome. The scenery is no exemption. It is picturesque and beautiful and a feast for the eyes but seeing the same spots (and costumes) over and over again reminded me of a sitcom where we have two main 'stages', the story switches between.
The lack of deeper analysis and exploration of characters goes for Dushik's (Kim Seon Ho) ""story"", his past, too. There was this HUUUUUGE secret around his past which ends up being a serious issue, but it is only explored more in depth in the last episodes, which is too short and rushed. Especially topics of greater severity should be dealt with caution, patience and pace and it is really frustrating as the episodes 11-14 felt more like fillers and definitely had room for a deeper analysis of Dushik's story, whereas, let me warn you without giving away too much, episode 15 was a sheer overdose off heavy emotions.
Also, I would like to regretfully mention that there were some unbearable ridiculous moments in the show, e. g. some slapstick comedy or a delivery scene as in childbirth, which - and I'm not a medical expert, by no means, but even I could tell - was so blatantly far from reality, that I could not focus on the rest of said episode.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the drama a lot. There are many lessons to take away from Hometown Cha Cha Cha:
- ""Don't judge a book by its cover.""
- ""Give 100% not only at work but also as you rest (e.g. no emails checking on vacation) ""
- ""No occupation or lifestyle is superior to another.""
-""You can find happiness anywhere, if you are willing to open up and appreciate the small and simple things in life.""
- And a lot more...

The greatest strength as mentioned above are the leads and their chemistry. Shining Kim Seon Ho and shimmering Shin Min Ah carried the whole show and successfully so, as the ratings reveal. While most people are understandably in awe of KSH, his natural acting and the worthy successor of good boy Han Ji Pyong, the even greater man Hong Du Shik, I personally was mesmerized by Shin Min Ah. She was so natural and instinctive as Yoon Hye-Jin.
Be it her reluctance upon meeting and engaging with people she barely knows, her little frownings when confronted with uncomfortable critique, her contrasting cheesy lovey-dovey side when in a relationship, Shin Min Ah played Hye Jin in such a realistic way, that it would not come as a surprise if there was a Hye Jin in real life running her dental practice somewhere in Gongjin.
Since Hye Jin and Du Shik have different views on life and seem like total opposites of each other, it's entertaining whenever they interact. In general their interactions are adorable and natural. There was for example a scene in which Du Shik mocks Hye Jin by mimicking her and it didn't feel like acting at all, maybe it was an ad lib. And as funny and cute their little bickerings are, their not so lighthearted and heartfelt conversations are smililarly serious and emotional, especially the latter ones make you cry rivers.
As stated above, since it is a slow paced drama with main focus on the lead's relationship you can see how they grow more and more fond of each other, rely on each other, complement each other. With each episode you can witness their bond steadily grow and become something magical; you accompany Dushik and Hyejin through their journey of love, support and character development and witness firsthand how their innocent mutual infatuation turns into a mature, healthy companionship, which makes this show all the more special.
There is another couple that is likewise adorable, but fails to outshine dimple couple.

All in all, Hometown Cha Cha Cha is an enjoyable ride with a great lead, greater emotions and undeniable chemistry, that make you swoon more than once. But frankly, it could have been better.

Honestly, it‚Äôs boring.
I‚Äôm a fan of both male & female leads, watched several of their previous dramas.
So I wanted to like this because of them, but I found the storyline very bland. i don‚Äôt know, nothing is interesting.

i like slice-of-life type of dramas, but this just isn‚Äôt it. plot is a fail. dialogue meh. some scenes are cringey too.

i struggle to finish each episode and i fast-forward through several scenes.
sadly, it‚Äôs just not for me.

Unexpectedly wholesome and genuine drama that makes you cherish every character.
Such an unexpectedly enjoyable drama. Maybe it helped that I knew nothing about this drama other than that the male lead was the second male lead in Start-Up, which I had just finished and needed another thing to watch. This is a slice of life in a modest village town where, by the end of the show, you wished all the residents were real and that you could visit yourself. I laughed, cried, and contemplated life while watching this show. Each little anecdote made me think about similar themes in my own life. The whole cast was absolutely perfect and you find yourself becoming attached to each and every person by the end of it. Would definitely rewatch again if I wanted some feel good, wholesome entertainment.

If only it had ended as well as it began!
Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha begins with lightning. Somehow, the creators were able to align everything just right for a simple story about a woman dentist hitting a wall in her life. The premise isn't new, and well, one could honestly call it a mid-life crisis series, except they purposely make sure to let us now the characters are just at true adult age (their early to mid 30's) and not yet on that particular journey.

Yoon Hye Jin (Played by the absolutely stunning Shin Min Ah) is a morally steadfast dentist who can no longer take the greedy pressures of the Seoul clinic she works. After a final run-in with the owning dentist, she quits, with enough money to keep herself fed, but not enough to open her own clinic in the expensive city. With her name in the mud with other dentists and unable to find a new position, Hye Jin runs off to a small coastal town she visited as a child that holds the last great memory of her mother. Meant to be only a day trip to celebrate her long deceased mother's birthday, fate intervenes trapping her there money-less, shoe-less, and roofless.

Enter our male lead, Hong Doo Shik known as Chief Hong, a dashing townie (Played winningly with just the right touch of sex appeal by Kim Seon Ho) who does basically every job the town has to offer, and shows up everywhere our female lead is too. As he hands her a single found shoe, Cinderella and her prince end up in tongue sparring match, as Chief Hong finds our destitute Hye Jin snobbish and entitled.

Just suffice it to say, that in this single day and night in the fictitious seaside town of Gongjin, Hye Jin meets every power player the series will deliver, and has a whirlwind of experiences that ultimately make her decide to open up a dental clinic here, where she can actually afford too.

Thus, the fish-out-of-water big city girl in small town life begins, and how enjoyable it is to watch.

Every single side character has a story to tell, and those stories, unlike other series such as Racket Boys, actually intertwine and affect our main journey and main characters. Everyone is, for the most part, believable as real people living their lives in this small town. You learn to love, be annoyed at, or mostly not like everyone in play. This is an utter triumph compared to what is many times delivered by such stories.

The first ten episodes of the series are some of the most heartwarming, funny, romantic, believable, and, I dare say, honest storytelling hours I have seen in a while. The director, and writers, always went right up to the line of over-the-top without actually crossing over into it. The restraint was admirable, and it makes one want to lay back smile, giggle, and press play in the most refreshing sense of enjoyment.

However, episode eleven is where this praise abruptly stops. When the series shifts gears with its main leads, in what should be a great payoff, the audience instead ends up with a saccharin, ridiculous, and trite hour plus episode that could cause whiplash. Whatever restraint the makers had shown instantly dissolves into a story that goes full force into territory seemingly written and executed for teenage schoolgirls.

It takes a few episodes for the series to stabilize, but at this point what existed between our main leads seems to have become a thin anorexic version of what it was previously. The story begins working overtime to create teachable, emotional, and sentimental moments. The natural honest feel good storytelling that earmarked the first ten episodes being replaced with cloying, fake, and melodramatic plot lines.

When the penultimate episode fifteen begins, you find yourself embroiled in an almost entirely different show. We get a long hinted at and hidden backstory that rolls out in the most unbelievable fashion. The events are over-the -top worst case scenarios that string together in a waterfall of tragedy. That our Chief Hong even remotely blames himself for a laundry list of events that are completely and utterly outside of his control is aggravating. Even worse, the self medication, nightmare having, therapy going lead never addressing the elephant in the room brought up episodes ago, in that he feels he causes the deaths of everyone he has ever come to love. This is left unresolved, or in truth most things end up being resolved by just a good long cry. Which is especially frustrating considering after all this exposition and chaos the episode ends with the death of one of the most beloved townspeople. Just to top of more tragedy, not that you won't see this plot point coming.

I will admit, I am short changing this a bit, but not by much. It becomes so heavy-handed at this point, I actually found myself yawning and reaching for my phone. Yes, I can tell you the current CNN headlines. And considering that this show previously had me losing sleep for just one more episode, is a very very mighty fall.

In the end, everything becomes about marriage. Marriage for everyone. Everyone in love. Even children. And to push this moral further you will be subjected to one of the worst and most manipulative scenes I've ever watched on shaming people were get divorced. It even involves a child crying. But, all is good because the townsfolk you have spent any time with at all are making a ridiculous parade down to the beach to take pictures all together in joy!

What started out amazing, ends in a bumbled, frustrating, trite, and unrealistic mess. But the beginning episodes can be watched over and over again until the end of time. And they alone keep this at an 8, B+/A- , 4 stars. If only the ending had stayed as strong.

A Simple Story with Depth
When you first read the anemic synopsis , you can't help feeling like you've seen this exact plot summary play out multiple times in a plethora of different languages, timelines, and nameless faces . It then becomes difficult to stifle the incoming yawn once you realize that this drama is going to be set in a slow and meandering sea side village, and that the drama is going to attempt to use a character driven plot to keep audiences glued to the screen.

You find yourself tempted to skip Hometown Cha Cha Cha for the next generic Kdrama on your Recommended List. But then you decide to watch one episode. That felt great, light and breezy you think, and so you play the next episode. That felt even better you thought to yourself! Then you realize there are no more episodes... you are in trouble... this simple drama set in the tiniest of fishing villages has entangled you and a million of other fans in an endless loop of hungrily waiting each week for the next episode of a drama that has very little plot twists, dark mysteries and shock factor; and yet somehow has inexorably entranced a legion of Kdrama fans in it's simple story.

Don't let the simplicity of the story fool you though, as there is plenty of depth to be found in this drama. Hometown Cha Cha Cha aims to keep the audience hungry with it's strong character driven plot, and succeeds heavily in this regard. The time the drama takes to develop it's supporting characters with ample screen time and character depth are rewarded in the latter half of the drama as these characters, that would be nothing but fillers in any other drama are given life, their names carrying more weight, and their presence offering soothing support for the Main Couple of the story. No longer are these supporting character left to be skipped and forgotten but rather they serve as a blend of different characteristic that serve to enrichen, and color our black and white sensibilities in warming palettes that we can see and feel.

The writing of the plot, the direction, even the light and melodic OST all serve as the backdrop for these top rated thespians to showcase their crafts. Whether it's the has been singer, the nosy neighbor, or the tireless mother, these talented actors and actresses break out of the mold of the stereotypical kdrama side characters to breathe life into these tired and comfortable cliched characters that would be caricaturized with a lesser plot or thespian. The has been singer becomes multi-faceted, the nosy neighbor gains depth, and that one tireless mother makes our eyes swell with tears, as her quivering voice mask the inner cracks forming within.

The ultimate purpose of the development of the characters of Gongjin became apparent in the midway point as the supporting character's stories start to intertwine and intersect with the story arc of the main couple. Similar to theatrical plays like Hamilton, the audience is almost subject to an invisible fourth wall of which none of the Gongjin inhabitants are privy to. We see ourselves jumping from the life experience of one character after another, almost as if we are all encapsulated within the show, bearing witness to this beautiful romance blooming in this tiny seaside village.

The chemistry of the two leads is electric. From the first episode till the last episode, you can't help but root for the main couple as they both try to fight feelings that clearly has bubbled over since they first set eyes on each other. Although there is a love triangle inserted briefly in the show, it's actually the main couples personal trauma that initially keep them apart at differing times of their relationship. Maturity is as the forefront of this drama, as most situations are dealt with the way that you would expect mature adults to act. Although there are scenes of skin ships in the show, it's actually the scenes where you see silent understanding between the two main leads that sets hearts fluttering. And with Kim Seon Ho's masterful use of micro expressions, a silent three second gaze speaks more volumes than the boisterous and often used ""Sarang Haeyo"". One of the most powerful scenes in the show is Hye Jin, slowly walking, slowly realizing her feelings for Dusik.

We are mesmerized by the beauty of both the ML and FL. Their laughing eyes, their toothed smiles, and their dominant dimples; all these things play a role in making us gently take a seat and enjoy the sea side ride. But as each episode further shows cracks in the main couple, we start feeling guilty in our comfortably relaxed position, as we start seeing tears behind those laughing eyes, cracks showing between those toothed smiles, and dark depths in those dominant dimples. We start realizing that all that happiness, all that selflessness may be hiding a tale deeper than we had anticipated when we first start to step into Gongjin. Just like Hye Jin's shoes, we feel we are safely in the white sandy beaches, unknowingly to us, when we look down, the tide has come in, and with it a tale of sadness, and a short snapshot of the importance of mental health and a proper support system.

Where I feel the drama may have stumbled is in the unnecessary tonal shifts in the last few episodes. But the drama ends on a high note, and the last few mediocre episodes is not enough to sabotage more than 14 episodes of good will. In reality, this is a drama caught in between. It should have either ended after 12 episodes, or it needed 20 episodes to properly flesh out the emotions and character development to properly close Dusik and Hye Jin's arc. But since the last few episodes was rushed to close as much plot holes as possible, the tonal shift felt out of place and disjointed, almost felt like watching two different dramas. The maturity and depth of the first 10 episodes start to dip in the remaining episodes, and it suffered from slightly inconsistent characterization. Of course, all these tonal shifts can be defended and explained in ones mind, but I actually much preferred the easily digestible characterizations the Main Couple had in the first 10 episodes, that the back 6 paled in comparison.

Is this drama a perfect drama? It is not. But if watching Hometown Cha Cha Cha has taught me, is that just because something is not perfect does not mean it isn't good. Just like a Mcdonalds cheeseburger can seem like a gourmet meal to a starving man, in a time when many people are healing from the mental and physical strain of the Pandemic, Hometown Cha Cha Cha is that perfect drama that captures so many different emotions and situations that we can all find something to relate and heal from.

Ms. Dentist should have brought more friends from Seoul
The show is part small-town ensemble comedy and part romance between leads attempting to overcome difficult childhoods. The foundation is there for a successful show. There‚Äôs some terrific actors in the supporting roles. Jo Han Chul, Lee Bong Ryun and and Cha Chung Hwa are excellent performers. It‚Äôs not uniformly great up and down the roster (In Gyo Jin as the district head and Lee Bong Ryun‚Äôs ex-husband flops badly), but it‚Äôs a serviceable group. Several of the supporting cast appear to function as comedic relief (Jo Han Chul‚Äôs Oh Yoon and Cha Chung Hwa‚Äôs Nam Sook particularly). The comedy, unfortunately, rarely connects. A great deal of it doesn't land because it relies on crudely portraying the locals as a group of hillbillies that has no fashion sense, no sophistication, can't solve basic problems, can barely operate modern technology and is semi-literate. Punching down isn't a good strategy to generate laughs and even if it were, the characters and cast used to attempt it here execute it poorly.

There's other issues too. Early, it appears that there‚Äôs some special connection between Chief Hong and Kim Young Ok‚Äôs Gam Ri, but her presence fades until there is a throw-in backstory moment near the end. There‚Äôs not merely one secondary romance, but a handful of relationships between supporting characters. None of them, however, get enough screen time investment to pay off. While Lee Bong Ryun‚Äôs Hwa Jeong is a strong character and gets enough screen time to develop an entertaining arc, the rest of this crew are not much more than one dimensional characters that only very intermittently entertain. Overall, the ensemble just never develops as it has too many characters, not enough character in those characters and a poor job of weaving the supporting arcs to the overarching narrative.

Which leaves it up to the leads to carry the show. And the leads are more than capable hands. Shin Min Ah is marvelous as the centerpiece character - a driven dentist with an inner warmth that isn‚Äôt visible through a normally prickly exterior. The character is far from perfect and frustratingly stubborn as she consistently finds ways to damage the tenuous relationships in her new seaside neighborhood. But the blemishes make her charms shine brighter as she begins to connect and find her way.

As for Kim Seon Ho, this is the most Kim Seon Ho style role ever. It is distilled, purest Kim Seon Ho and for viewers that are looking for what he's done in previous work only with more of it and taken to an even more natural, laid-back, ""aw shucks"" style, this role will probably never be surpassed. For viewers looking for something that would expand his range or show a new type of character, search elsewhere. But he works extremely well with Shin Min Ah and whether it was written with this intent or simply this actor found the right balance, his Chief Hong is the only resident character that doesn't end up being pigeonholed as a backwards simpleton.

Were it not for some missteps with the narrative setting up the conclusion, Ms. Dentist and Chief Hong would probably contend for best romantic lead couple of any drama this year. But the long-awaited unveiling of Chief Hong‚Äôs back story is teeming with cliches and reveals that should surprise exactly zero viewers. There‚Äôs also some uninspired dialogue in what should be a big emotional moment. It‚Äôs exactly when things should be building up to a grand conclusion that it deflates instead. To confound matters more, there's an explosion of crying and product placement in the final two episodes. Frankly, the last three episodes are a massive disappointment. While a less than stellar conclusion shouldn't completely negate what had been a worthy production up to that point, ""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" nosedives badly. Badly enough that it does cast a shadow on the show as a whole.

Recommended but barely.

High rewatch value
I usually don't rewatch dramas because I often watched mystery thriller, so knowing the story line I would not rewatch again.

However for Hometown Cha Cha Cha, I think the visual and tension between the leads were so strong that I kept rewatching the first few episodes, so that drew my attention to them.

After episode 8, I rewatched again because I got hooked by the side characters backstory and wanted to understand them better by rewatching.

After episode 12, I rewatched again for the comedy and the romance.

After episode 14, which is the latest episode I have seen, there is so much revelation to the male lead's story that I have to rewatch again from episode 1 and could fully appreciate his behaviour in the past few episodes and understand his weakness alot better.

Hopefully episode 16 will not make me rewatch again haha. But if I did, the writer has done an excellent job as well as the cast that executed the characters to make me rewatch upteem times.

Unpopular opinion - This drama doesn't deserve the hype it's getting.
First of all, I've been a fan of Shin Min Ah for years and I love her acting a lot.

But I personally think this drama doesn't deserve the hype it's getting. The story is pretty lukewarm, nothing that keeps you hooked up to the story. This story reminds me of those 100+ episode weekend dramas, except they squeezed it into 16 episodes.

The story is laid-back, portraying the daily life of a rural village, and the string of events that takes place when a woman from the city comes to live in it.

The story is okay. The acting is better with a good cast. But it doesn't deserve all the hype it's getting.

I personally had a hard time watching it because it was too boring. I even skipped most parts and managed to finish one-hour episodes in 20 minutes. I didn't even feel like watching it at the end, but I did because I hate to do things half-ass and I was hoping things would get better but NO!! It doesn't!! It's boring until the very end.

Beautiful, good at times, bad most of the time and annoying as...
This one is soooo hard to rate,almost as hard as it was to complete it...

I would say that the characters where about 65% highly annoying and 30% amazing, great and 5% ok then highly annoying followed by ok than highly annoying again (the Female Lead) all due to writing not acting the acting was fina most of it at least not much worse than other stuff, but what was extra troubling was that the awesome characters kept interacting with the highly annoying ones, making it hard to skip if you wanted to see the awesome characters but also hard to watch because of the annoying characters. Such a SHAME and here is why:

The cinematography was beautiful, the scenery was mmmmmmm.... the faces were beautiful, the abs where not bad either... The second couple was adorable ans well so was the second male lead was just the cutest guy ever The umbrella here was such a star and it was used soooo beautifully! really enough to bring up the score. The dimple couple did look good together but their interactions where 50% annoying 40% cringe 10% cute and fun. Making my love for him fade because he liked her...

Kim Young Ok is an international treasure may she live long and prosper! the kids acting AND characters were great and one of the shows most honest lines was delivered by one of the most annoying characters.... yes it did have a bunch of good lines here and there I will give them that, but it was ruined by all the cringe.

Back to the bad, the way they make suicide sound easily avoided bugs the hell out of me, people who are close to people who have commited suicide ten to have enough what ifs as it is, making it seem like a person can hinder an attempt if they just call is just mean. And so are a bunch of other parts of this drama... cringe, superficial, highly predictable, very highly predictable in a bad way sais I who loves cliches but honestly about 80% of the twists where soooo predictable it was as if they were trying to throw us off but it was so clumsy made that any one who has seen a few dramas would guess it. Also great use of product placement as well as village feel and the found family trope thumbs up there!

Story as a whole is 8-9
Character writing 1-10
Dialog 1-10 stars
Bingebilaty 5
Extra points for some well done stuff are unfortunately less than the stuff done bad...

It is not the cast acting (most of it) that is bad it is the writing! I will probably try avoid that writer in the future...

So in conclusion if you like cringe and grownups acting like stereotypical children (an insult to children out there), or just love Kim Seon Ho enough to put yourself thru this than all the power to you enjoy! Me I am happy it is over...

Its a average story but well written
For me, this drama is average. Nothing special from the story. But the drama writer can make this story become a good and mature one with good character development. Even though this drama didnt make me bored to death, but the story is kinda slow pace with nothing happened. Lack of heartwarming scenes also. Sometimes i just wondered what actually am i watching? Just seaside village usual life? Its different with reply series, hospital playlist and racket boys. They are also slice of life but there is more meaning and impression in the stories. There is destination in their stories. There is heartwarming scenes everywhere. I am sorry but this drama is not for me.

I finished Hometown Cha Chas Cha a while ago....like a couple of days after the final episode aired and just didn't care enough to write my review. I just wasn't that impressed. The story wasn't original and the dynamics between the MCs wasn't anything special to me. I didn't care for how the FMC changed so drastically after she becomes romantically involved with the MMC - it just felt unnatural and forced. I won't be going back to watch this drama, but I'm also glad I got to see Kim Seon Ho in another drama.

Don't go looking for originality in this Kdrama
I get the cozyness that everybody feels with this drama. The acting of the whole cast is that good, it makes you feel part of the town. But I feel this is all that this drama has to offer which is not little though: a very talented cast, beautiful scenery and a great ost. However, don't be looking for more, don't go looking for a story that you have never watched in dramas and you will enjoy it. With this drama you need lots of time (one hour and twenty minutes each episode) and patience, some episodes will go by really fast and others will feel long.... Do I think this series is worth to watch due to the episodes that I found entertaining? No, but that is very personal to each individual, maybe you do. Having already watched it, in my opinion it's the wonderful cast that SAVES this Kdrama, they all did amazing!

We can all agree this drama is dated
Shin Ha Eun:""Can you please put away the script under ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha""'s folder so that I can later edit it and send it to final proofreading before it goes into preproduction?"" She asked of her intern before getting up, and leaving the office until the next day.
Before her intern could even answer appropriately, the writer was gone.She grabbed numerous papers and headed for the indicated office. Before she could reach out however, a life-changing call came in, during which she completely forgot about her responsibility.Instead she crumbled to the floor and cried her eyes out. Important papers were left in the corner, all but completely forgotten. After a brief cheering up session, the aforementioned intern picked up the papers that belonged to the ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha"" script and in all of her chaos, instead of placing them in a folder, she decidedly left them on the table of a proofreader, who in turn sent it to preproduction next week.

This is how I feel a warm albeit surface level drama came about.

I always like to start off all my reviews by being thankful to all the writers, producers and everyone else involved in making drama. I have the upmost respect for fellow creative people in this field as I know that making a drama is anything but easy. As they say ‚ÄúGood news come first!‚Äù In that spirit I'll now list all of the positives I found while watching this show.

First off, the overall ambiance and mood of a small seaside village called Gongjin is stunning. It feels alive. The way they decided to shoot this fictional location as well as the way they decided to frame it makes for a very rich experience. It's fun to look at and discover new things and it almost feels like a character all on its own. Not only that but I am so glad that more dramas are being filmed and set in rural areas as opposed to urban ones. Not only does it make for a more original setting, but it also feels fresh and interesting. I'm glad smaller places are getting the hype they rightfully deserve. Because locations like Seoul have been used so many times before, now they feel uninspired and uninteresting. That's not to say that urban areas cannot be rich in content.Of course not, however it's nice to see villages and small towns get some limelight as well.The music felt appropriate though at times repetitive too.And that‚Äôs coming from me, who loved the OSTs to‚ÄùOne Spring Night‚Äù.
With that being said, another strong suit of this drama are its side characters. They are full of life. Almost cartoonishly so, But they are believable and layered. Geum-ri,a sweet but often pitiful matriarchal figure of Gongjin, will stay in my memory for a long time to come. Village and zone chiefs who are divorced and thus create a certain rift between the villagers are also stand outs. Not only that but they are probably the most realistic romantic relationship In this drama. I can confidently say that I've seen couples like this before.Oh Yoon,a washed up singer who is trying to take care of his daughter, run an eclectic Caf√©, while shoving autographs down peoples throats,is yet another worthy addition and,to a degree,a wasted potential.Coupled with an gossipy owner of a Korean Chinese fusion restaurant(who also comes across as realistic when placed in village backdrop,I`ve known people like this),they all have presence and a way to pry into the hearts of the viewers of this drama.Do you see where I'm going with this? No? Then let me break it down even further.

Everyone's character and relationship is more interesting than the main leads.

In fact this aspect of the show made me so inspired that I wanted to come up with a suitable analogy to the way their relationship was written. What I've come up with is this: If you're familiar with the way jewelry was sold in 19th and 20th century, then this should come as no surprise to you. Word of mouth was everything. If you were to be told by numerous people about this rare emerald jewel, which can only be found in one specific area, over and over, you'd be more than intrigued to check it out. You‚Äôd hear about how precisely it is cut,how clear and vibrant the color is,not at all cloudy‚Ä¶So you‚Äôd prepare your boat or pay for a ticket to board one, go on an arduous journey and finally come across one such product. However instead of feeling incredible and relieved, you'd feel cheated because this gem resembles nothing original. Instead it‚Äôd remind you of those cheap trinkets you can buy a dime a dozen in the nearby market. This is exactly what I thought of the ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha""'s principal romantic relationship.

From the very first episode, we follow a (materialistic? )female dentist called Yoon Hye jin(played masterfully by Shin Min Ah.Everyone`s acting was great across the board) and her inevitable move to this seaside village. I really liked her in the first episode. She was honest, cut to the chase, and resistant to the idea of sacrificing her own morals for monetary gain. And then she moved to Gongjin. And she became one of the most annoying female leads I`ve seen in SOME TIME. She was unnecessarily condescending and reminded me of an elitist. And basically did completely change her goal. Thankfully, the writers almost completely dropped this trait in favor of a brat trapped in the body of an adult, mature woman. Or was that truly some thing to be thankful for? Her reactions and even her subsequent relationship with Chief Hong were childish, shallow and nothing I haven't seen before. I would especially like to highlight the unneeded slaps and beatings he had to go through because of this completely normal occurrence of being in a relationship(followed by some light gossip coming from a group of people who have overall been a net positive in their lives) because it was too much for her to bear. This was played off as funny however in my eyes it was anything but.In fact it was chock-full of clich√©s. I was surprised there was no amnesia storyline. And that's not to say that clich√©s are never useful.If you use them sparingly and with a purpose they can be one of your biggest weapons when it comes to writing. Unfortunately here they were used clumsily and just because they worked before. I can honestly see some deeming this a future classic, I fail to see that touch of magic that made drama classics such as ‚ÄúCoffee Prince‚Äù what they are. What's more, both of these actors have great chemistry, which almost feels wasted in favor of repetitive checkpoints they have to adhere to.I`d honestly love to see both of them in a drama with a well-made script.What I'd also like to mention as many may have stated before,Chief Hong‚Äôs storyline seems tacked on with no real idea besides having a male lead with a bitter past. Just like so many dramas that came before.Trauma isn`t addressed and what is,is due to incessant and frankly insensitive pushing by the female lead.Seriously,she was walking a fine line between cracking his shell and berating him altogether.

Finally, many applaud this relationship as extremely realistic, when in reality to me it just feels like another romcom relationship put to the screen. Not great, not bad, just average. Or at times, below average.What works for me in this slice of life show, are the side characters who seem larger than life, and they are what ultimately saved it from dipping below fives.So what the end up with is a beautiful scenic village with interesting bits of information and funny dialogue from time to time, serving as a backdrop to a less than stimulating love story between beautiful people with mindsets that range from infantile to half baked.

In conclusion I love cheesy, sweet romcoms that can make me feel like love is worth something and can lead to victory. I've watched so many crinhy romantic Japanese dramas and loved almost every bit of them,bar some really outlandish scenes. So in theory I should've been the perfect demographic for ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha"". Not only did I enjoy romcoms in the past but I came from a dozen of horror, thriller dramas that have turned out to be just a tad much for the moment.

And still it didn‚Äôt manage to charm enough for me to give it a higher grade. At least we‚Äôll always have surfing Kim Seon Ho to look at. At least that counts for somethingI think?

Turning challenges into potential
At first this drama appeared to me to be quite light, even to the point of being petty, but as it evolved, not only the exceptional acting skills and direction, but the actual content was full of situations that are not merely relatable, but also enriching and educational. 'Yes, we've all been there', - might be a clich√© response to many of the scenes, but it's much more than that, i.e. it contains a wealth of food for thought to adjust one's own behaviour and judgement of situations. 'Don't be quick to judge', and 'give people the benefit of the doubt' would be suitable mottos for this show, - and it's done in the most inspiring and beautiful way. Making things work, creating harmony, - the big endeavours of Eastern philosophies that the West could learn so much from.

Unexpected
Everyone was saying this drama is like IOTNBO and as IOTNBO is my first and most favourite kdrama I couldn‚Äôt wait to watch hometown cha cha cha. I started watching it after it was released completely and I have to say it is very disappointing. 40% of this drama is like telugu movies(indians will understand)The male lead's behaviour, the female lead's arrogance, the other people's interference...... everything. I didn‚Äôt expect this type of love story from kdramas.

Sorry about this review. After writing this review I start watching it again and now it's one of my favourite kdrama.It was very good from episode 6.

Disappointing :/
I was really disappointed
This is not what I expected at all
The story was too ordinary till the limit of being boring
Too detailed without no need
Many side stories which turned this drama to be like the 50 eps family drama
I took A deep breath when I finished it
For the first time I didn't enjoy a drama for shin min ah
This is not her level of stories at all

Shin min ah fashion style was bad for the first time
The make up and the light was bad, made them looked old many times

The story was too predictable
Light but just to watch once which was frustrating

started so well and promising, but then...
it started so well and promising but suddenly it was a complete drag and felt like it had LOST ITSELF and just could have definetely had 8 (or more) episodes less. what started off feeling bright, relatable, and refreshing, towards the end just became a frustrating, gratuitous and nonsense tearjeaker. such a pity and waste of potential and cast.
for the most part, main couple saved this thing with their adorableness. the character hong dusik raised my standards towards men to a whole new surreal level - just made me never want to date a man again unless it's him. but from episode 7 or so til the end, their story felt unnecessarily dragged and i think we all have had our fair share of that in dramas already. the comedy by then started to lose its pace too, and there was a running bit of overboard slapstick comedy between the couple that disgusted me.
the whole cast were definitely great actors and their characters felt realistic and funny, but some secondary couples - although cute - had their plotlines even more dragged until complete exaustion than the main one. i just blatantly skipped many scenes for some of them because of it, couldn't bring myself to care.
this drama had great cinematography, very clever choices of camera angle and movement.
i rated the music as i did because it hadn't really stood out to me, despite not sounding bad.
i wouldn't ever rewatch it as a whole. maybe just some specific cute scenes like of the relationship between dusik and the elderly ladies - which was adorable and reminded me so much of my own grandmothers.

An Enjoyable Watch
Things that I love about this, is the simple plot, and the humor. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore to watch. I didn‚Äôt fast forwarded once, and that is saying something for me. Not a lot of thinking involved in watching this, it just feels kind of relaxing to watch. A perfect blend of humor, and serious subject matter. It is a simple love story with great acting, with a main love story, and a couple of side love stories thrown in. It started out as a 10 for me, but the last two episodes were kind of, I wouldn‚Äôt call it disappointing, but just frustrating. There was one long Dominos add, they fit into the story, that was very obvious. Also, they finally showed what Hong Du-Shik‚Äôs secret was. I won‚Äôt give it away, but let‚Äôs just say it was nothing for him to feel guilty about, nothing was specifically his fault. The ending wrapped everything up nicely too. I finally found out who won the lottery! Nothing left to guess about. This is a definite watch!

Best drama I ever watched in a while!!
Literally, everything (aside from the random Domino's placement) connects!

I am a sucker for dramas where the most trivial lines or moments come back to mean something at the end. And this has tons of that. I love how at the end of each episode, you kind of get an easter egg where you learn something new that adds a layer of cuteness to that episode.

It's INSANE how many life lessons they packed into such a small town of people. I have never cried this hard or smiled this much for a drama ever. The people was perfectly casted, especially the children! Get that little boy a Grammy's!

The big reveal of Chief Hong was a bit of a letdown, in my opinion. It felt like we were waiting all these episodes just for this small bit of drama during the last couple eps. But their last 2 episodes saved it, as they managed to offer closure in the most beautiful way.

Such a beautiful, heartwarming, slice of life drama. This is definitely one of my favorite dramas for sure!! Highly recommend.

Quite tiring
The cute became tiring very quickly. And from cha cha cha light fun it went full on angst on the last 4 episodes, without much preparation along the story.

The FL‚Äôs character developed from someone that made assumptions and judgements at the drop of a hat, to someone that struggled a bit when young, to a full on bunny boiler teen in love that demanded the ML‚Äôs full attention and life history disclosure on day 3 of the relationship.

The ML had a bit more of depth, albeit the whole of it pretty much on the last three or four episodes.

The stereotypical villagers were all there, and oh god how tiring the whole concept is - zero boundaries, gossiping, etc.

SPOILERS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Something nice was the refusal of the ML and the second lead to engage in the normal competition / rivalry trope.
The most beautiful part was the resolution of tooth issue suffered by the lesbian character, an allegory of healing the hidden pain she endured as she came out.

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" is a heartwarming drama with a stellar cast.

What makes this drama special are the side characters. Everyone in this small, seaside village is a family and they can easily become the publics' favorite not only because of their strong bond but also because they are funny, dramatic, sweet, and lovable. The setting was also a strong plus of this drama along with the great performances.

However, the drama had a predictable story that was pretty much not nearly original, had superficial main leads, who did have chemistry though, and a boring love triangle. Which lead to many boring episodes that were only saved by the side characters.

So, overall, 6 out of 10.

Best romcom ever!
I really hope the ending will not dissapoint me but sofar, this drama is the perfect comedy for me:
- BIG APPLAUD for the script, which is excellent, I love all the side stories which I usually skipped. I love the Hye Jin and her close friend chemistry, the grandma's loneliness, people who look like weirdos at first sight but are in fact more deep and blundering people. It's very realistic and I do like the warm viewpoint, the authors have a very human way to see all the characters.
- Each characters have their lovely scenes and its helps understanding the main plot. And frankly their acting is great! As I said I love the girls' chemistry between Hye Jin and Mi Seon, and the secondary romance between Mi Seon and the policeman. Hwa Jeol, the loving mother and good wive is nicely despicted. The villagers are not idealised, nor despised, their are shown in a warm and realistic way. Even the guest
actors, like the chicken seller has his charm! And oh my! Their know how to play comedy. I laughed a lot!
- Frankly, I came to watch because of SMH and KSH and the main couple did great. The comedy timing is perfect! They are also blundering people: at first we see how clumsy is Hye Jin and the male lead seems too perfect for me. But as the story progresses, Doo Shik also shows his weekness. EXPERIENCE MATTERS, it's good to see older actors like KSH and SMH act, they masters the scene in the bickering moments, tenders moment and of course, the kissing moments... Here, there is not some clumsy and akward scenes played by a former idol but really experienced and talented actors. They deseve our praises.
- THANKS also because the love triangle doesn't last long! It was nicely wrapped and the second lead did a great job. I love the fact that there are two caring male leads and not the typical tsundere ML versus caring ML. It's quite realistic, Hye Jin is a caring person and she does attract pure and caring people. The main romance has a very nice progress.
It might be too fluffy some people, too plain for others and now with this pandemic period, I think it's the right time to watch a comforting drama like this one. I smile, laugh and cry a lot when watching it, I fall for all the characters ans rewatched it for sure !

Scrambled eggs, not eggs benedict.

This drama is a slow simmer - not a hard boil. It's slow starting out and the pace doesn't really pick up at all. If you're looking for something that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this not the drama for you.

It started out well enough. I felt an emotional connection with the FL and it was good to experience Gonjin and it's townspeople with her. Because of that, I could understand what first drew her to Gonjin. But that's as far as good characterisation goes with the female lead. When I think about it, I don't think that she created any real relationships with any of the townspeople besides Gam-ri and Mr. Hong. In the end, she still felt more like a person who's in Gonjin as a result of circumstance rather than an integral part of the town. Moreover, Mr. Hong was an even more frustrating character to watch. His story was told in a rushed fashion with minimal tension. What a wasted opportunity! I believe more could have been said on trauma, grief, survivor's guilt and even about our ideas on how society defines success. It just felt like his emotional struggle was a plot device to keep us watching and once the drama had gone far enough, they just wanted to get it over and done with.

I also noticed that whenever Hye-jin and Mr. Hong had an important conversation, the camera would focus on their faces for a few seconds and it would feel like that awkward moment when you're done talking to someone but you can't decide whether it's okay to leave yet. They would smile at each other in a way that I found absolutely cringey. Am I the only one who noticed this?

I understand why some take issue with the relationship between Hwa-jung and her ex-husband, but I think the actors did a great job of portraying the yearning and hurt between them from the very beginning. And given enough time, more could have been done to flesh out their story. Ultimately, I still enjoyed watching these two and I wouldn't mind watching a drama based on a story like theirs.

All in all, relationships were a major problem. Some were resolved through the magic of TV happiness (Hye-jin and her stepmother) and others by simply forgetting and focusing on something else (Yun-kyung and her husband). Really, I'm tempted to start a #JusticeForSides movement.

Apart from all these issues, I can see the money that went into making this drama. The setting was ideal and it made me wish to see the town for myself. I can't really call it a light watch because you'll need a lot of determination to finish it. But it's great if you're looking for something that will not take too much from your mental faculties.

I teally enjoyed most of this series. The location was beautiful, various characters interesting and the romance sweet. The acting of everyone was on point.
However, chief Hongs past turned out to be not so dark - as in he took the blame for what reason? Yes he could be devastated by what happened but to blame himself totally was just ridiculous. Also his very self satisfied persona as the chief and early attitude towards hye-jin was irksome.
By the last few episodes the series became rather cloying - over sentimental and slow. To the point that I am not invested in what happens to everyone- including the main couple!
It just seems this drama didnt really know where it was going and I lost interest!

is it really the best drama of 2021 tho?
I feel like something is wrong with me. I can barely find the people who feel like me because most of the reviews are just people liking the drama a lot. I don't know if I am just different or something.

I decided to keep this drama on hold at episode 11 since I found it boring. I was early when the first episode came out and I watched it. It was hard to finish it but then it got okay. Then it got boring again. At first, it was actually sweet and all but afterwards it got a bit dark. I don't understand the hype it's getting. I also thought it was the best drama of 2021 at first but not anymore. I wish the female lead was a bit more strong and I wished they focused on the side characters more.
The chemistry between the female lead and the male lead was eh... they did have chemistry I have to agree, just not the best chemistry.

It was hard for me to watch each episode, I skipped through a lot or I was just not paying attention to them because I had a hard time watching it all without getting bored. There are a few lessons you can learn from the drama which I liked to be honest. I honestly feel like dropping the drama because even when I go to Netflix and plan on watching it, I just get out of Netflix after 2 minutes because it just has a slow plot.

I would not rewatch this drama again, I'm sorry. My favorite character was Yeo Hwa Jung and Yu Cho Hui and I loved the OST. a lot.

""Where have you seen a life without rain! When it's pouring you will get wet even if you use an umbrella. So at times like this, just say whatever and let it pour on you. Let's just have fun, with me.""

Hometown chachacha is such a nice healing drama. I'm not a fan of romances, but i needed something light and fun for my heart, and i chose this. My expectations were not high, and i started it after a long hiatus. Boy, i didn't know what i was getting myself into :) After the first two episodes i couldn't stop. I was fully immersed in this small town's story and the characters. It felt like i really went to a small village near ocean, and met all those interesting people. I was catching myself daydreaming about this place the whole week! So i really recommend this drama to the people who like romances. :)
Of course it had it's up and downs but let's get to it later :)

first of all Characters! This is a type of a story I call character driven. And more importantly this was fully driven by the male lead. Even though the side characters made this town, but we all saw those characters slowly as they were interacting with the main leads. Male lead character of this drama as said in the description is country boy type of a person who can do almost everything, and he will do it well. If anything breaks they call him, if someone is needed at the sea they call him, if someone is needed to make coffee they call him, if someone is needed for power they call him, if someone is needed to look after sauna they call him! People call him chief Hong, or Hong banjang (chief) in Korean. He goes around being friendly to all the people, especially grandmothers <3 The type of a person who can talk to absolutely anyone without being awkward. Kim Seon Ho played this role phenomenally well! Hong banjang was so perfect I couldn't get him out of my head. :)
I loved his friendliness so much! he once said ""...Yes, like this cross the line sometimes. Stop drawing imaginary lines like a child. Share the eraser sometimes. And sometimes show me the homework...""
The side characters were the annoying country people at first, but slowly started to show themselves as people, with different pains, loves, personalities. Each and every single one of them was interesting. I especially liked Grandma Gam Ri, and her wise words. And Yeo Hwa Jeong with her other wise words :)
We also have the second lead :) played by Sang Yi :) He deserves the best second lead award. Because he totally did what second lead is supposed to do. He made the couple jealous, he became a good friend and he wasn't making us suffer from the second lead syndrome because the first lead was so strong, and his bromance with Hong banjang was much more valuable for viewers :) I really loved their TikiTaka. How they met, and how became friends :)
The we also have out female lead, a strong career woman, a dentist. Who is kinda warm and loves justice, but soon regrets her decisions. She ends up in this village from the busy Seoul, and suddenly finds herself in a small healing adventure.

Story: This is the part i didn't give much points to. The story was absolutely perfect and very warm. Even though it was cliche, it was still a little bit refreshing to see a very nice male lead who is strong and kind at the same time, plus interacts with everyone in the village. It was going fantastically well :) Tbh the reason I didn't give much points here was because from ep 11 the characters change a bit. Their romance becomes extremely cringy (Note that this is not for everyone, something that i consider cringy, may be perfect and great for someone else and visa versa ^^) Hong banjang somehow gets this slight sadness in his eyes that is kept there till the end, and Hye Jin, our female lead, is being extremely childish, needy and materialistic. Of course some may not see these things like i saw them, so please don't let them keep you from watching this drama, because it might be a good level of cringe for you :) Because their interactions were really cute. And they still had at least one scene in each episode that brought my heart back to the drama :)

Acting: I talked about this a little bit, but the acting was really really great! Especially Hong banjang who was played by Kim Seon Ho. Even though other actors did a fantastic job, for me it still felt like Hong banjang carried this whole drama on him because he was so perfect. :) The Side characters, side romance couple, were very great too :)

Music: There are dramas that have this kind of OST that gets stuck in your head and is always associated with that drama. Well this is one of those dramas :) The OST Romantic Sunday that starts with Lalalalalalalala~~ is still sutck in my head even though it's probably been 3 weeks since i finished this drama :)

Deep messages: This drama had so many messages and so many nice quotes!! it went straight to my list of dramas with deep messages! Amazing stuff said by the characters, can sometimes be very healing :)
Hong banjang once said "" Success and Money are not everything is life. There are much more important things like Hapiness, Self empowerment, Peace, Love. Life is not a mathematical equation, there is no right answer. The life gives you a problem, but how to solve it is your choice""
Yoon Hae Jin once said ""You know what does being a good parent mean? It means to live healthily for a long long time""
This drama teaches us the power of human interest and warmth. simple words and simple interest can sometimes save a person, even if we don't ask that person about all the details: ""i was closed in a dark house but then people started to knock on my door, without asking anything, they just started to give me food. Like people feed stray cats. Indifferent yet warm. Then they started asking me things, fix the tv, deliver the food, take on the counter in the shop for a bit. So they build the Chief Hong i am today""
And it teaches the fl that there are many people struggling in this world. ""not everyone has it smooth like you, some run on roads that are hard to pass, and some ran with all their might only to find themselves at the edge of a cliff, so don't judge them without knowing""

Overall: When i just finished it I was disappointed, I could write so much just complaining about the female character, how characters changed, and how this drama would have been so good if it was made into a Hospital Playlist style xD But you know what? :) Some time has passed and I don't remember all those complaints much anymore. All I remember is a perfect drama that healed my heart, that still stays with me, and that gifted me one of the best male characters i have ever seen. I only have positive afterthoughts now.

So this drama totally deserves best drama of the year, best couple, best male actor, best supporting character awards, as well as deasang :) even though it had many flows from ep 11 and onwards.

In short.
What I liked:
healing
wise words
Hong banjang
Hong banjang
Hong banjang
light and nice romance build up
Hong banjang
side characters <3
second lead

What I disliked:
the main couple dating
the childbirth
the female lead after main couple dating.

I really do recommend this drama to the people who love romances, because this seems to be a perfect romantic story and i have a feeling it will remain as a classic in a few years :) But be prepared for cringes and then lots of tears during episode 15-16. It's a very happy ending though, so don't worry :)

P.S. i never rewatch dramas so i just put a random number there.
but actually I have rewatched clips form this drama MILLION times and am still doing it everyday XD mostly from early episodes. Hong banjang was too perfect :)

Heart warming drama
I love the chemistry between the two main leads, the bromance for the second male lead and the main lead, and the interaction of other characters too.
Kim Seonho and Shin minah pictured the characters perfectly. They were both smiley, cheerful and beautifully paired.
There were ofcourse conflict and pinch of sadness to keep the drama interesting. A lot of life lesson taken away at the end of the drama. Truly eajoyed every second of it.

A heart warming drama with great characters, interesting story line.. Funny and witty at the same time worth to re watch, highly recommended!

A Fantastic Classic
The first time I heard bout this drama and the casts, i knew I would love it so much. Not only that I liked each of them from other dramas, but it turned out that they made such a greaaattt couple, the chemistry was just perfect tho. I put somuch expectation and it didn't dissapoint me^^
I always loved slice of life dramas, and this is one of the best that i've watched so far. The gags and romances are just right. One thing that I want to point out is... idk i didnt't flutter that much on other romance dramas, sometimes it's just making me smile a bit and it went away, BUT THISSSS gave my heart somersaults and crazy butterflies inside my stomach. KIM SEON HO HOW COULD U DO THIS TO ME!!?? Ahh, seems it would last for weeks.
It might sound like I was just falling for faces. I wouldn't deny that is true. But good face without good act is a big thumbs down. Seriously like seriously, all three Mains' acts was really good, that to me it didnt miss a thing. Storywise could be cliche or classic, but a smoothly polished classic is FANTASTIC.

I'm really not that kind to rewatch all over again but this one should be the first on my rewatch list!!!

one of a kind
i've never seen a drama that made me feel so warm and happy inside as much as homcha has. i keep on waiting impatiently for the weekend to come just to get my weekly dose of serotonin from shikhye and the people from gongjin . i'm not one to commit and watch on-going dramas but this was definitely an exception.

it's so beautifully written. im so emotionally attached to this show .. don't think i'll ever move on from this as it definitely moved up to my #1 fav drama.. despite not having much angst (which i love) but still .. so good . it's definitely worth the watch

Light drama with a surprisingly heavy backstory
I'm out of words. It started as a refreshing, fluffy, and light drama but the unexpected twist at the latter ep would leave you jaw-dropped. *kidding*. Let's say ""shocked"". Since the beginning, I'm not expecting anything heavy from this drama at all. I thought it'd be slice-of-lifey, kind of like Reply, but mannn I was wrong. Let's jump to the full review based on my point of view.

STORY
This drama defines ""every charming-flawless-like guy has their own dark secret"" perfectly. Starting smoothly with no major problems, from introducing every cast in the first episode, and then circulating in Chief Hong-Hyejin life. I love that this drama gave every cast a perfect amount of screentime and their own story, so there's a complexity and also a variety of struggles everyone's facing from any background. I'm surprised they also included an LGBT topic here, and it's even an L, how rare. And they even brought up mental health issues... but it doesn't feel as heavy as I think it'd be, just making me cry a lil bit too much and got a headache. In the end, it's not a light drama.

ACTING
I have nothing bad to say, I'm not going to critique any of them, they're ALL great actors. Not only 1 2 or 3 of them but ALL OF THEM are great actors. From the oldest to the youngest did their job really well, they all sure can act. Actually, I was surprised by Bora and I-jun's acting skills, like how could they act so well at such young age?! For Kim Seon Ho, he is incredible, I'm glad his talent is now recognized by the world :( As for Shin Min Ah...as long as I could remember, she could act very well BUT I THINK in this drama there are still lacks here and there. I don't know if that's how she's supposed to act like but somehow for some scenes, I feel it looked too much and a bit unnatural(?) yet still manageable. Honorable mention for Hwa Jeong, Gam Ri, Nam Sook, and Yun Kyung, they're amazing! I won't forget Hwa Jeong's umbrella scene, Gam Ri's telephone scene with her son, Nam Sook's loss, and Yun Kyung's shoelaces scene.

OST
I'm a fan of this drama's ost! Especially the one sung by Sandeul and Seungmin. Dammmnnn those are good song, bruh. Just my style.

OVERALL
This drama is worth the wait. It meets my high expectation. An excellent story delivered by great actors, what's more to ask? Maybe more episodes? That'd be interesting. Am I going to rewatch it? OF COURSE! I will back for Hong Banjangggg~~ 9.5/10 is not overrated I think.

Healing Drama
My first time to sign up in this site bcoz HomCha is worthy to give a perfect score. The drama is imperfectly perfect that most of us can relate. The leading man who is beautifully created by a female writer, the leading female who is not a damsel in distress. Supporting casts that did their assignment perfectly. Overall, everyone did well!

These are some of my fave lines in the drama.

""Look around yourself closely, and you'll realize that you're surrounded by many precious things.""

""Keep smiling. Don't think twice whether or not you should be smile or be happy. Don't think too much. Just smile.""

Strong start and a descent ending
Nov 6, 2021

Hometown Cha Cha Cha is one of those comfort dramas to watch on a cold day covered in a thick blanket. The plot was fantastic from the beginning but I did feel like the last two episodes could have been a bit better. I feel like the pacing got really finicky during episodes 15 and 16. Maybe the director should have made it into like 18 episodes just so that the ending would not feel as rushed and that it would have concluded well.

I really like all the characters in the drama but the police officer and the dental hygienist love story really appealed to me more than our main lead. Also, I am living for the representations of LGBTQ+ people in this drama. I did not expect a Kdrama that takes place in a small coastal town to have a lesbian underplot. Though I lowkey wished that I should have brought more tissues since I just kept bawling my eyes out. I know people say that this was like a 'healing' type drama but man I cried so much. And I think that you might too!

a very, very Romantic Sunday in dramaland!
Hometown Cha cha cha is very much like the ost of its - Romantic, so so romantic in all the ways that it could be, and so so refreshing and exciting as a Sunday; makes you enjoy yourself while preparing you for the journey thats about to come.
HCCC talked about love like love deserves to be talked about, the love for ones self, love for smallest things and life, and most importantly love for other people.
The characters were like water; fluid and developing. HyeJin, you may not like her at first and Hong Banjang may be the first to catch your eye, but HyeJin definitely was the one i fell in love with the most. Her strong will had her standing head held high even in the deepest waters, she taught us emotional vulnerability, transparency and honesty is a strength not to be ashamed of. Hong Banjang taught us to hang onto love, even in the darkest times. If not for yourself, then love for other people.
Behind the scenes characters were just as strong and not overshadowed by the main leads, each getting their own stories and character depths. All the people of Gongjin, no matter how broken, come together in this witty little town that lifts up all our spirits.
The acting was impeccable. HyeJin is probably my favourite character Shin MinAh has ever played, just how realistically she captured her development throughout the episodes is truly, truly, amazing. Kim SeonHo, guys, dont get me started on him. I love that man to bits, and here he outdid himself. Layers and layers of expressions and micro-expressions, they made Hong Banjang into the character that we have all come to love. He was amazing.
and so was the rest of the crew, the chemistry was off the charts. esp love the bromance between KSH and Lee SangYi.
The drama had the best love triangle in kdrama history, the best breakup, and the best friendships. Genuinely good portryal of what it truly means to be a good human.
the production, music, setting was all so fresh. i couldnt recognize most of the artists in the OSTs. It included Seungmin's solo debut, which was IMMACULATE might i add. all the songs felt new and refreshing. Romantic Sunday, Here Always and Wind are my favourite osts.
The story is warm, like the sand on the beach, and the slow melting of ice in a jar. It melts you along with it and soon you find yourself a part of it, all warm and cozy inside. I dont think ive ever cried at a confession scene, but i did here. the emotions were all too real and all too there, it was difficult not to be teary eyed.
overall, a beautiful, beautiful slice of life masterpiece that will definitely go down in books. amazing. ill be so sad to let it go and not wait for it every week. will definitely rewatch for all the good vibes <3

WORTH THE HYPE, WORTH THE WAIT
This is one of the purest drama I've ever seen. Hometown cha-cha-cha is a well penned, casted and directed drama with beautiful visuals and cinematography.
From the first trailer itself I was looking forward to this. I usually don't watch ongoing dramas. I have always thought future viewers are lucky since they don't have to wait inbetween episodes. But this one was an exception.This is the first time I am happy that I decided to watch a drama while it was still airing. Every weekend was a worth wait. Every episode got better and better. And my weekends are never the same after homecha ended.

PLOT
The story is simple and pure. A city girl Yoon Hye Jin ,a dentist had to move to a village Gongjin and there she encounters a village boy, Hong Doo Shik( chief hong). Their multiple encounter eventually makes them fall in love. This looks like a typical cliche storyline, right?? But this is not just that. But yes, there are usual cliches. But the way they dealt with it is what makes it special. This is light, warm, refreshing and healing drama with a group of loving Gongjin villagers. This is not just the story of the leads. The side characters are not some filler characters. They also have their own story and a life to deal with.This show is about love and how it makes us stronger.


With all these cliches what makes Hometown Cha Cha Cha the best?
No messy love triangles,no toxic relationships, no unwanted misunderstandings and break ups, no hate, just love and forgiveness.

SPOILERS AHEAD

WHY THE TITLE HOMETOWN CHA CHA CHA??

I read this somewhere where that the title, CHA means car and Gongjin is the HOMETOWN here. And the three cha's refers to the cars of Dusik, Hyjein and Sung Hyun. All three came to Gongjin is somewhat connected to car. One of the reasons Dusik came to Gongjin is because he lost his hyung in a car accident, Hyjein couldn't go back to Seoul because her car needed a repair and had to stay back in Gongjin and Sung Hyun lost his way and ended up in Gongjin. So their cars(three CHA's) led them to Gongjin (HOMETOWN). And that's the title HOMETOWN CHA CHA CHA.

MAIN LEADS- Dusik , Hyjein and Sung Hyun (Ji PD)

SikHye(Dusik and Hyjein) have one of the most healthiest, mature and wholesome relationships amongst all K-Drama couples. They acted like a married couple even before they started to date. They fight,annoy, bicker and care for each other. They're the definition of opposite attracts so it's a given for them to constantly argue. But I love how their misunderstandings were quickly solved. They are the definition of healthy relationship. They talk everything out and endlessly support eachother.
There is a love triangle. But this is not your typical love triangle with leads fighting for the same girl. I am not a fan of love triangle. But here it was quickly solved and all you can see was their bromance.They proved love triangles can be healthier too. HCCC have one of the best resolution of love triangle. And this love triangle was never an issue because the main leads were mature and understanding.
Their wholesome relationship is the actual reflection of how a healthy relationship works. They had their own struggles and hardships but they never broke up. And they never said the cliche line ""I'm breaking up with you coz I don't want to hurt you"". I believe nothing hurts more than your loved one leaving you during your hardest time just by saying they don't want to hurt you!! LOL.
When we were expecting love triangles they gave us bromance . When we were all prepared for the rejection by Dusik, he accepted her feelings. When most of them(not me) were expecting for a break up between ep 12 and 14 saying that's the usual kdrama troupe, they showed how a healthy relationship should be.To add-on to the cliche thing there was also childhood trope. But they fell in love not because of that. It was just a pigment to the whole story.

FAV EPISODES
Ep 10
The realisation, confession, acceptance with a kiss everything happened here. The realisation of Hyjein was the best part here. The way she walked in the rain realising her feelings for Dusik and that gradual changes in her expression was perfect. Special claps for Shin Min Ah for that particular scene. That's my most fav scene.

Ep 16- THE FINALE
I love how they wraped the whole drama so perfectly. They also had the funniest and cutest proposal ever. The way Hyjein told to consider the proposal as a relay and handed the baton to dusik when he was upset for her getting ahead and proposing first will never not be funny.Their confession and proposal was sincere and full of love.

FAV LINES
""Who cares if the wind blows a little when we're in the same boat?""- Hyjein
""Life isn't a mathematical equation. It doesn't have a clear answer either."" - Dusik
And many many more.......

FAV SCENES
Ep 12 -- In that nightmare when he was afraid in the dark it's hyjein he calls out to. Because she is his light.
Ep 9 -- Hyjein was relieved when she saw dusik at that night. Ji pd gave all the tools to protect her from harm. But she just want Dusik's arms. And the ending hug was just wow. That felt so real.

They bicker all the time but that they are eachother's safest place.

I love the way the writer dealt with hyejin dusik relationship without breaking them up. Also Hyjein's character breaks all the stereotypes. When she was aware of her feelings she proposed to him. She was the first one to kiss, first one to confess and first one to propose. She just don't care about all these stereotypes. When she realised her feelings she run towards him instead of running away. She knows what she she wants and is sure about it .Hyjein is so far my favorite FL. I saw many comments hating her. But for me she is one the realistic FL ever. Hyejin is not your typical girl who asks for a break up when things aren't going well. Coz usually in kdramas these issues are more than enough for the couple to break up. But she handled it differently. She gave it a good thought and decided to wait for him. How many female leads will do this?? Most of them will break up without even thinking twice. That's why I say HYJEIN IS A STANDARD.

The fact that most of us were expecting a rejection from dusik but instead he accepted her feelings was a different twist. Even though he was healing inside he didn't push her away like how the usual ML's do. He's not your typical arrogant angry guy, he's just an ordinary guy.Out of all the doubts, fears, anxieties inside his head, there is one thing that he‚Äôs sure of, he loves hyejin.

All the characters were realistic and well portrayed by all of them. This is my first Kim seonho drama and he's already my favorite. His micro expressions are everything.I‚Äôve never been this impressed by someone‚Äôs skill and personality in such a short amount of time.

The top-tier writing with an amazing cast made this drama heart warming. This deserves to bag lots of awards. Also the OST'S are soothing. la la la la la keeps playing in my head ever since I started this drama. Whatever I do, all my head does is go......Lalalalalala!!! For me homecha is a gem. My love for them is as deep as lake baikal :)

You should give it a try if you want some light hearted healing drama. It's better you don't go for it if you are here expecting some twists and turns. As I said this is just a simple story with relatable characters. Do watch this if you‚Äôre into healing dramas or romcoms! You won‚Äôt be disappointed.

PS it's been a month since homecha ended. But I'm still not over them. I miss them like crazy: (

Wholesome and Romantic
I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I just had to give my thoughts on this drama! It honestly made me so happy, it was so wholesome and it‚Äôs so easy to fall in love with Chief Hong. I was nervous that there would be too much of a love triangle but it wasn‚Äôt focused on too much which I was glad of. Also the lesbian representation was done well and made me so so so happy!! The only downside was that when the main couple got together it did start to get a bit boring? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just the loss of the thrill of their initial falling in love, but it did kind of feel like they changed completely as people when they became a couple. Also they were a bit cringe lol. But overall this drama was such a good watch!

The Perfect Fairy-tale with a Realistic touch
It may seem like 10/10 is saying a lot but honestly i'm not one to give a perfect rating just like that. I have watched my fair share of kdramas and when i say this one really touched my heart, i mean it. This is my first time writing a review because i feel this drama genuinely deserves it.

Not only did this kdrama captivate me from the very start, it kept making me want more. The home-ly, heartwarming and wholesome vibe it has is honestly unbeatable. The characters are so interesting and the writer managed to give depth to all of them, be it a main lead or supporting cast. each person had a story, background and life that you want to know about and not just skip cause it feels forced. the second lead couple was adorable, so were the rest of the gongjin residents.

its really hard to keep a person's attention if the show goes slow but this one went at the perfect pace. it defied the usual kdrama cliches of evil step-moms and broken families, inevitable break up between the leads due to some misunderstanding, troubled past for both the leads, etc. Sure the main male lead does have trauma but it doesn't feel like the cliche plot. This kdrama gives you all the butterflies, happiness and princess-y feelings you want but with a much needed realistic touch. It is lighthearted but does not lack depth. A fairytale romance but not one that consumes its leads instead it betters them. Plus a great ending. It basically gives you alot of hope in life tbh. that's what it did for me.

Overall, to me this is the perfect show and i honestly have no flaw to point out. Definitely one of my go-to kdramas for when i want a serotonin boost.

A warm and refreshing dose of escapism
I loved this show. From the moment it began, I was enamoured with it. The acting of the lead pair was brilliant in exhibiting the right energy and aura of their characters. An urban raised middle-class girl with smug dismissal of the poor rural countryside folk and the man with little ambition in life other than to see the sun rise the next morning. This show was great. I enjoyed how it introduced and warmed us to the ethos and social norms of the town folk by essentially taming Hye-Jin's assumptions and forcing her to see the beauty of a simpler, less noisy life. Yes there's fewer opportunities to stardom, but there is peace and relative sanctity from malicious gossiping and the choking competition and judgement she faced back in Seoul. I loved how she was portrayed, and found her character to be refreshingly engaging, easy to sympathise with. Her flaws weren't ever annoying traits but understandable ones that made you empathise with her.

Chief Hong was a vibrant male lead and he had to the right amount of exuberance and compassion to make you love him. Plus, he is a really beautiful man when he smiles. I'm a heterosexual guy and I'm telling you right now - I got butterflies whenever he was laughing.

The show was carried by the chemistry of these two whenever they shared a scene that helped bridge the differences and create a grudging respect for who they were. Watching them fall in love didn't feel stale because of its inevitability, because they still wrote the scenes with realism. The show was also helped by not focusing too much on an overarching plot ahead of its character directions. Though this sometimes created problems when it came to laying the seeds for conflicts concerning Chief Hong, it meant you could get more invested in the characters.

I loved the town folk - the support cast were terrific. I was less interested in the film crew and didn't have time for those scenes but that's really my only quibble with it.

Overall, this was such a good show.

Very long, but a comfort to watch
This drama was good - but, why. do. the. episodes. have. to. be. so. long?

Okay, so it started out and I was like, ‚Äúwhy does this man do literally everything in this town? It‚Äôs so unrealistic.‚Äù But then my sister reminded me that it is a drama and not made to be realistic, obviously. But still, when he unravelled his whole wallet of cards for trades he was registered in I was like, ‚Äúcome on, really?‚Äù

Hye-jin - I really liked her character. I thought she was a strong female lead who knew her own mind and what she wanted in life. Very driven. Her little dentist surgery was so cute and the big tooth sign out the front just made it. I felt so bad for her when she was stating the blatantly obvious about Cheon-jae while the mic was on. Thinking about that man even now makes me chuckle.

The fact that Hye-jin and Chief Hong were so different, made it hard for me to picture them together in the end, and even ship them throughout the show. I liked their characters individually, but together I just couldn‚Äôt really see it. Even when they confessed to each other and kissed I felt no sparks for them. During that scene, all I was really enjoying was the song. Seungmin has a beautiful voice!

I found myself liking all of the side characters and was actually interested in their storylines. These people definitely boosted the show's rating in my opinion:
* Hye-jin‚Äôs friend and Eun-chol are just the cutest - I think I shipped them more than the main characters.
* The children! Omg they were so cute! Yi-jun is such a respectable little man. God bless him. Bo-ra - her too! When she sang that song at the talent show it made me weep.
* Cheon-jae‚Äôs daughter was also cute and funny. Her enthusiasm about DOS is great.
* Yi-jun‚Äôs parents

Towards the end, of course, as with any drama, it was dragging but then it suddenly got really deep which I was not expecting. And then Gam-ri died and it was just sad.

The soundtrack was great - I even bought a couple of songs after completing it because they just gave me the feels.

I feel like maybe I‚Äôd watch this one again. It was definitely a comfort show and was well produced with a great cast etc etc.

my heart feels empty,now that it ended..
everything was beautiful!!The story is quite realistic hence,relatable..characters were quite annoying at first,but everyone had a reason for their behavior. I loved how they showed everyone's side story and make us love them more and more.it's nice that everyone had a character development too,especially hyejin,I think i can say that she had the best character development.

the chemistry between the leads is top-notch! it feels like i am watching a reality show of two real life couples.i love how the dialogue seems like a real life conversation between them. as expected from great actors~

watching this really felt refreshing but warm too,at some times..I will really miss our sikhye couple and the people from gongjin..

Cha-cha-cha your way to watching this drama, you will not be disappointed!
Totally unexpected gem! I reluctantly started watching this drama as I was browsing Netflix. I am so surprised that the storyline and acting is so freaking good. While the drama is near perfect, I will give feedback on what I like and dislike about the characters (not the actors, not the drama itself).

The female lead - The actress did a fantastic job acting, and her dimples are so freaking cute. However, character wise (this has nothing to do with the actor nor the drama), I disliked how she constantly gave backhanded compliments (e.g. while the album was bad, I did like this one song). I know that this it is apart of her ""city girl, traumatized"" character, and that because of the abandonment issues that she developed after the death of her mom, and her first college-boyfriend leaving her, that she likes her personal space, but if we continuously justify people's behavior because they have trauma, they will never change.

The male lead - This actor did a fantastic job acting, and his dimples are so freaking adorable. I rarely love male characters in dramas, especially in K-dramas. This is the first drama that I watched in which the male lead was not toxic, like at all! The male lead character is actually someone that I would need, if I were interested in dating lol. Although the female lead is doing a lot of pushing and pulling, he is patient with her, and kind to her. He doesn't allow her selfish nor mean comments impact his self-esteem, nor does he allow it to stop him from helping her or helping others.

Cho Nam Sook [Department store president / Chinese restaurant owner] - Cha Chung Hwa is such a talented actress. I fell in love with her after watching Mr. Queen, and then I saw her on a Running Man episode, and after watching it, I realized how hilarious and outgoing she was. In this drama, she acted so well.

I love the older women characters in this drama. It's refreshing to see Korean dramas open up acting opportunities for the elderly.

Hometown Cha Cha Cha? More like Hometown what the fuck
This was so boring. It's a ROM without the COM

Waste your life away watching 89 minutes per episode, just for the last minute to have some ridiculous scene, like finding sandals in the ocean.

Cinderella this is not.

I give it 2 thumbs down and I would literally rather watch the last half of Start Up 20x and kill myself after before I watch another minute of this stupid show.

This show makes me go:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

KIM SEON HO COMEBACK STRONGER AFTER START-UP
2021 has been on Kim Seon Ho, not only his drama success also his activity in variety show!

People have not know him before start-up. He is a wonderful actor. His acting method really good since he has a theater background, that explain how he manage to deliver such a big emotion to the viewers ! Hong Du Sik is actually really complicated character, we might think he is all rounded but.. having a dark side of him and how Du Sik hide it from people around him is tough. Seon Ho really have to study and understand this character before portray as Du sik. As for now we don't really know the true nature of Hong Du Sik ( I didn't watch movie ) until his dark past reveal.

Some people might not like actor who portray a character like a theater artist but for me.. by combining emotion and body language... a perfect character is created !

I hope that he can continue acting and I cant wait for his next project!

Can't get enough!!!!
Been watching the show right away after it was aired and I don't know how to feel about it. I can't wait to finish all the episodes all at once but at the same time, I don't want it to end. There was never a dull moment and every single character are as important as the main leads.

Besides the fact that I love the casting, the first episode had me looking forward to what is to come. I can't help but smile whenever both of the leads smile, their characters are simply adorable. And their dimples, I don't think I'll ever get tired looking at their dimples. Who will not love them?

With just the first episode, I'm already sure that this show is another gem. I know I'll love the show and all the casts. Not only the leads but also the supporting actors will make you look forward to what kind of role they will play in the story. I loved the pilot episode, I loved the second episode more, and I think I'll fall deeper in love in every episode that will come (as I'm watching it ongoing as of the moment). The story was very heartwarming and relatable. Heartwarming in a way that even when they were not a family by blood, all of them seem like a family. It was really soothing to watch. And the life lessons in the series!!! It's another thing to look forward to. In just two episodes, I was already reminded of the good things one can do while living this life. I also enjoyed looking at different perspectives of people as the characters have distinctive differences despite sharing some similarities.

One of the comparative perspectives that I like is the generation gap. As the place is set in the countryside, Yoon Hye Jin (Shin Min Ah) and the elders' characters definitely don't match given that the elders' are conservative. But what made me love the different perspective part is when Hong Doo Shik (Kim Seon Ho) is in the picture. It's rare to meet someone with a very open-minded mind and is up for understanding the people around him/her. He plays a vital role in uniting the people's town together. He's like the bridge connecting everyone. He is definitely my favorite character because of that. Also, watching him act like that will make you wonder what his story is. You know the saying that a person with more scars is the kindest, I think he's one of them. Yoon Hye Jin is also the same but she's not the showy type so it may take time before you realize her kindness which will make you actually look forward to what she has to offer more. Their kindness combo is something I will really love to see. Plus, it's coated with their strong chemistry, something that will make you feel good all throughout the runtime. The whole cast chemistry is actually another thing.

Watching the series will definitely make you realize different dreams, personalities, and kindness in people. The show surely offers different faces of love; may it be eros or agape. So far, I was never bored while watching. I actually feel light, relaxed, and happy as I watch the show. Of course, the OST played a crucial part in creating that vibe.

It was a job well done so far.
Kudos!

Waiting for the next episode is really killing meeeeee !!!!!!!!!
Lately, all the K- dramas are based on dark comedy, thrillers...I was looking for rom-com, something refreshing and then I found this....I thought I will binge-watch this after its release...But after watching the first episode I couldn't resist myself...the story is simple but the director made it so interesting... I can co-relate with all the characters...all the characters are beautifully written...I think I don't have to talk about their chemistry...it's 10/10 for me...they literally give me butterflies in their every interaction... the cinematography is superb...






It's soooo good...you should watch it if you haven't watched it yet...

Breath of fresh air...
Been watching varied genres of kdramas since the pandemic. From historicals, legal dramas to rom-coms. Hometown Cha Cha has been on my list since it aired. I held off watching this because, honestly, the title didn't give me any idea on what the story was about.

I am glad I finally got to start this. It is such a refreshing series!! I love the countryside vibe, slow paced living (after watching Penthouse and LOve Marriage ft Divorce), the OST, quirky characters, the cute kids.... and the list goes on and on...

There are dramas that you watch without knowing what the story is about when you start. So this one which you can't really define except that it is a story about daily lives. People go about their business without any hidden agendas; literally just living their life...

The ensemble is well casted. Each actor and actress gets their fair share on screen; showing that they have a camaraderie with the people they interact with. I was at first in doubt as to the chemistry between the leads, but as it turned out, they did such a good job showing the evolution of their relationship.

This series also highlights so much of Korea's food and culture. I have been watching it and simultaneously googling the images for the delicacies they show.

If you just want to lay back and relax, then this is the series for you. Definitely deserving of the hype it is getting. Crossing my fingers that the ending would not fall flat....

Lovely, pleasant and very exciting. So adorable and cute too.
Such a refreshing take on the ""opposites attract"" plot. And the actors are really talented. The leads chemistry as the couple is one the most adorable and natural ones I have seen in years.
The writing, DOP is breathtaking. Korea sure is beautiful. This series shows not just Seoul but more of Korea and its small town community's beauty and warmth. Loved this.
The love and friendship is small towns is incomparable and precious.
(I think)
If you enjoyed the Reply series, especially Reply 1988, the warmth and the ups and downs of relationships you would really really love Hometown Cha cha cha.
Shin Min-ah is obviously very beautiful, pretty and an amazing actress. What a versatile actress she is! Wow!
Kim Seon ho is totally love love love. Great actor, amazing and talented. He plays the role of Hong Banjang so naturally, it makes me feel Chief Hong is my next door neighbour and not just a character. Bravo!
All the actors are great here. They are all such a great team. Their amazing work shows in the series itself. So very talented all of them.
Looking forward to the last three weeks of Gongjin.
Thank you!

The story i can't thinking
The storyline has decline at episode 10 how that to be.To be honest i Don't like the actor and i Don't GIVE any specific opinion. In the end from episode 1 to episode 9 amazing and come to episode 10 this nothing lmoa just bad i see. Because the performance of any play is such an ephemeral experience, writing a play review can be an exciting, though difficult, task. You have to be both spectator taking in and enjoying the performance and critical analyst of the production itself. You have to be able to provide a very brief summary of the play, a close objective analysis of the performance you attend, and an interpretation and evaluation of the entire ensemble of staging, acting, directing, and so on.

The review assignment asks you to analyze in an objective manner the relative success or failure of a given production. Note that you are not asked simply to summarize the plot or give an opinion regarding the text of the play being mounted; your review must be grounded in the production itself. Your job is to describe the production accurately, and then to render a value judgment of it based upon what you have seen and what you expected. The assignment will test your skill as a reader of the play and as an observer and critic of the production.

In addition to grounding your review on the production you witness, you must be careful to limit your review to a few essential observations in support of your thesis (which will be discussed below). You must concentrate on a few important ideas and aspects of the production and focus your attention on only what you consider the most significant parts of the production itself. Unlike a newspaper review, which can be loosely structured and superficial, your assignment is quite definite. You are not asked to cover a wide variety of production elements (i.e. performance of every actor, every costume change, every set change, every directorial decision, and so on); instead, the assignment demands that you develop a few key ideas in thoughtful detail.

We need to come up with a name for dramas aren't actually good - don't actually provide anything great in the way of plot or anything else - but get way overrated just because they offer something unique that people love.

In this case this drama is rated so high because people love the setting/ambiance which is a relaxing seaside vibe. It is also kinda charming the way ML loves and befriends little old ladies. (Seriously, his relationship with his little old lady friends is a major part of the show.) Take away those things and this show is mediocre at best. The first episodes were promising with lots of potential but nothing ever really happened and the repetitive formula of nothingness quickly became incredibly boring as the show progressed.

I made it all the way to episode 11 before finally dropping it, and that's only because I watched as it was airing and kept hoping with all the reviews it would get better. The backbone of the show itself was dull, there was no actual plot propelling anything forward except these people living in this town interacting and talking with each other every day. The chemistry between the leads was sort of there in the background but incredibly subtle and slow. I kept hoping for more from the leads relationship but in the end I just couldn't take such a hollow plotline anymore. FL's character was also very ""stuck up city girl"" and unlikeable, my guess is they were trying to portray her as a city girl out-of-towner who didn't fit into the rural life, but they completely missed the mark and instead she comes across as annoying and pretentious.

If you just want to watch something that gives a unique vibe and you don't mind slowness in your dramas and I mean s l o w, you might be into this.

Refreshing and Fun Romcom with enjoyable characters
After having finished the drama, it is safe to say that the drama is a very refreshing and fun romcom with its own quirks. The main male leads are extremely charming, with Chief Hong having a very likeable 'Boy next door' vibe and Ji PD having an equally charming 'Campus Crush' image. Our female lead is every romcom lead from 2018 - starting to pull away from the tropes and yet no so much - her character is still enjoyable and she definitely has her redeeming qualities. Do I love her? Not really. Do I really like her? Yes.
The highlight of this drama lies in its portrayal of its side characters. All of them have their own stories to tell and you really see them as people. My favorite character has to be, hands down, Hwajeong. Her story, the way she treats the people around her are all so admirable.
PS. The casual queer representation is definitely a win.
The pacing of the show is surprisingly pretty good and even.
The city where the drama is set is just so so beautiful and the sea is absolutely stunning too.
The humor isn't forced and you find yourself smiling throughout the episodes especially when the characters are bickering.
The OSTs definitely match the vibe of the show and are very soothing.
My main issue with the drama is the way immediately after they start dating, the female lead dumbs down, losing all her personality traits except for being in love with the male lead. When oh when are we going to stop doing that?
Definitely a fun watch that goes easy on the eyes.

Kim Seon Ho has to be the best thing in this drama. His acting is always so on point. Loved him, the cafe owner (also from Vincenzo) and the three old ladies. To me I didn't relate to the female lead and didn't enjoy her pairing with KSH. Thought she came across as too masculine and cringe worthy. KSH has such a fresh face and I thought that SMA looked a lot older. Would loved to have seen someone like Park So dam place the female lead in this. Probably wouldn't rewatch this drama but loved seeing another of KSH's dramas as have a lot of respect for this actor.

How To Seek For Happiness.
I might be the 0.1% of the audience who do not feel as attached to the drama as I should've been. It's not because the drama is bad, no, no. It's one of the most heartwarming productions I've seen. I would suggest Hometown Cha-Cha to anyone looking for an escape from real life, yet deciding to learn something about reality while doing it.

‚òÜ If I could summarise it, it would be:
A young dentist Hye-Jin, has a wake up call on the harsh reality of life after moving to the seaside village of Gongjin.
I had a love hate relationship with her character during the first eight episodes that I saw. It's ironic because I'm as closed off as her in real life with very few friends. I related to her woes of moving from a huge city to a little known town where you suddenly discover that many of the items you used to buy are nowhere to be found, people are more nosy and everyone are an overly friendly bunch who inadvertently put you in an uncomfortable position. I loved how she tried to mask her difficulties and attemped to change herself. Her character growth was gradual and a delight to watch.

‚òÜ But, Hye-Jin needed a lot of growth during the first half of the drama. And thankfully, Chief Hong existed to throw a pail of ice cold water on her biased views about people and life. I absolutely hated how she referred to herself as someone on the 'upper elite' despite being clearly in a difficult situation and there were several instances that her own best friend (who grew up in similar conditions as hers) seemed much more perceptive about the people around her. This stark contrast between those two stood out to me and I still do not know if that was purposefully meant to be that way.

‚òÜ I have to mention the one character whom I deeply respect: Chief Hong, the male lead and the love interest to Hye-Jin. While clearly portrayed as empathetic and a jack-of-all trades, two qualities that earn him the nickname ""Chief"", we see him call out Hye-Jin several times for her prejudices towards the 'common folk' and her stubbornness and refusal to understand the minds and workings of a local close knit community. While I 100% agree with her actions, I admire Chief Hong for his confidence in himself and flr striving to change her views. I wasn't deeply invested in their romance, which is definitely leaning towards the slow burn arc, but I loved how strong their connection was. I loved his openness and the efforts he made to make the people of the small town happy.

‚òÜ The little town has a handful of characters whom we closely follow throughout all the episodes. They are the basement of the drama. We get to know their grievances and secrets, and see them slowly warming up to Hye-Jin in turn. I loved her interactions with them. I admit, I'm eight episodes in, but I'm still unable to recall anyone of their names perfectly. (In my mind some of them: Mr. Americano + Singer and his daughter Ju-Ri; Restaurant Chief who is divorced with a son, the Restaurant Chief's divorced husband who is the head of the small town, The Shop Gang, The Three Grandmas, Pyo Mi-Seong, Police Dude‚Ä¶
Another aspect that I loved about the show was how they stuck true to the genre. It's not just the leads whom we learn in depth about, but the supporting characters as well. I have to say, I enjoyed the bittersweet parts of the drama a lot more than the lighter scenes. I've heard that it gets quite tearful during the last half.

‚òÜ Although I'm sometimes annoyed with Hye-Jin, none of the characters got on my nerves. There were no pressure inducing misunderstandings and most of the arguments would be smoothened out in a calm manner. There was something magical about how the most simple things in life can bring us immense joy and pain. At one point, it made think of quitting everything and living a life like Chief Hong's. Yeah‚Ä¶ haha.

‚òÜ The OST was fitting and had a cottage core ambience that perfectly fit Gongjin's theme. The locations were really scenic and watching the blue ocean itself left me really satisfied.

‚òÜ As to why I dropped this. Slice-of-life dramas are not ones that I usually binge. (It took me three months to complete Reply 1988.) But, I also realized that I'm more attached to slice-of-life dramas that I could somehow personally relate to. While this drama has all the right emotions that are meant to tug at our heartstrings, I don't feel the urge or curiosity to know what happens next and did not have a strong attachment to anyone. (This might be because of how disconnected I felt to the daily life of the people. I found their struggles relatable though.) And the hour long episodes of focus on the daily life of the villagers and Hye-Jin pushed my patience. (I was exhausted watching two episodes a day and tend to fast forward a lot.)
Somethings that are meant to happen, would eventually happen. Just like how the drama portrays life as: Unpredictable and sometimes bitter. I can see why so many people love the slice-of-life genre a lot and this one definitely deserves to be among one of the best in that genre.

I bid a hearty farewell to you, Hometown Cha-Cha. Maybe, somewhere in the future, I might pick you up once again to bring me back the calmness and contentment that I felt while I initially watched you.

(‚ú∑‚Äø‚ú∑)Fell in love with this drama (‚ú∑‚Äø‚ú∑)
Just loving this story. I started to watch this because the FL .she is my fav unnie... So can't miss her show, but didn't expect it to be soo good. The plot is very refreshing and unique. The locations will sooth your eyes. The side characters plays a significant role and add great comedy. The story is so realistic. I am loving Unnie because of being such an independent and confident woman who is of her own. ML is quite mysterious till now, but he gives a positive Vibe which flutters my heart. He's so cute and handsome. The bickering relationship is really cute between them.

Sweet
Hometown chacha... I must be dumb cause I still cannot connect the relevenace of the title to the drama.Yes it was hometown but is there other interpretation to chacha aside from the dance that is typically danced back and forth? Repeatitive hometown lifestyle....?

Anyway, I was so interested in the drama because of the main characters. Oh my Venus is still one of my favorites, and I want redemption for Kim seon ho from Start Up. I am hoping there is another drama lined up for Kim heon so as this drama still kept me wanting.

The drama was sweet, and lots of scenes that made me sigh.There were times though when I thought more depth should have been added. Did others feel that too?

Hometown Chacha has good actors, nice setting, and it is essentially a feel good drama. ?????

Heartwarming cliches, surprising depth, superb chemistry
I'm going to miss this dimple couple!!
Many viewers describe this as a ""feel-good"" or ""healing"" drama, and this is exactly the case. Homcha's cozy seaside village setting already lays the foundation of its biggest themes: found family, love in unexpected places, diamond in the rough, overcoming prejudice, forgiveness/acceptance, wholesome bromance, and more. If you can ignore the product placement, the fictional town of Gongjin is a heartwarming place to visit when watching Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha.

PROS
‚ùÄ Production value was A+ | The thing about romcom tropes is that depending on the way the drama shows them, they can be ridiculously annoying or pleasantly refreshing. Homcha's tropes were the latter for me, and I think it was due to the accumulation of production, acting, and directing. The music was added in expertly (seriously, I associate the best vibes when it comes to the singer going ""La-la-la-la-lalalala. romantic Sundayyy"" for one of the OSTs), and the cinematography was an added bonus. I really think Homcha's production elevated this romcom for me, despite the well-worn tropes and dialogue.
‚ùÄ Literal flirting since day 1 | I saw this Instagram reel with Du-Sik eye-ing Hye-Jin the day they first met, and one of the comments was like ""flirting since day 1."" This is accurate. Although the characters aren't officially together until around ep 10, their chemistry is off the charts at first meet! I enjoyed their romantic progression from Du-Sik helping Hye-Jin settle into Gongjin as friends/neighbors into a romantic line between similar but different people learning from each other. Du-Sik opens Hye-Jin's eyes to the charm of a small-town life (be patient with her, as her socioeconomic prejudice is pretty conditioned and it takes her a few incidents to get out of that mentality), while Hye-Jin gets to spoil Du-Sik as this king deserves.
As for the characters themselves, they're both lovable. Hye-Jin is the more flawed one (more comments about this in CONS section), but this makes for excellent character development. She starts off as a snobbish dentist with a sense of justice who's trying to adapt to the sleepy seaside village of Gongjin but ends up really comfortable with this village and its people, despite a rocky beginning. She's a character with strong morals, definitely a sense of what's right or wrong, but is also empathetic (especially to children). I love that she's strong both mentally (thinks over her decisions and makes them resolutely) and physically (doesn't take sexual harrassers off lightly).
Du-Sik is the village chief and handyman. He's hilarious, light-hearted, and doesn't take anything too seriously. One of my favorite introductory scenes is when he pulls out all the licenses/certificates he has as a handyman - LMAO! To be honest I thought this guy was way too perfect - in his house, he pretty much made everything. He woodcrafts, fixes up boats, saves people from harm, delegates jobs, makes his own wine and tea, and everything in between. This man is literally self-sufficient. Underneath that playful exterior is a man plagued by nightmares and a deep-set trauma, which this drama later goes into.
As a couple, we have the uptight and snobby dentist x relaxed and easygoing handyman. You KNOW that's a set-up for cute happenstances, lessons learned, and a slight opposites-attract love story. Love this Sikhye couple! (""Sik-hye"" combines their names and is also a sweet wine.)
‚ùÄ Superb side characters who are holistically explored | Homcha really dives into the side characters' backgrounds, and each one of them faces something that makes you want to cheer for them. (Also, love the 3 mysterious of Gongjin that the script includes haha.) Some of these conflicts include the difficulties of being pregnant/having children, losing a child, raising a child as a single dad, loss of loved ones, misunderstandings in marriage/divorce, failed careers, and more. Some scenes are heartbreaking, others are heartwarming. The common denominator is that the characters grow and come out stronger, emboldened by their new experiences and lessons learned. I'm in love with the imperfectly perfect villagers of Gongjin!
‚ùÄ Happy ending for everyone!! | Seriously, I was smiling the whole time while watching ep 16. Every character you root for in Gongjin gets their happy ending. Their stories felt completed and their endings were so satisfying to watch.

CONS
‚úï Don't watch if you dislike romcom tropes | Personally, I loved the cliches that the writers of Homcha used, but I know some people may find it boring (including friends of mine). Others, like me, love the way the drama utilizes these cliches to make you fawn over the couple. Some of these cliches include: coincidential childhood/teen meetings between main couple, (slight) love triangle (although the 2ML takes it very well and finds his own romance later on), ML with mysterious/tragic past, getting saved from a stalker/harrasser, surprise angst towards the end, etc. Honestly though, it wasn't too bad and didn't have tropes I dislike like amnesia or forced separation. All the tropes used had feel-good romcom energy.
‚úï Inconsistent character development | As much as I loved Du-Sik and think him a perfect ML, he was TOO perfect sometimes... even the 'flaws' about his mysterious past towards the end (ep 14-15 were the angstier ones) didn't really add depth to his character. He was just perfect from start to finish. Which is fine, I guess? But in contrast, Hye-Jin was imperfect and her character showed it well, which led to satisfying character development later on. In this way, the main couple's character writing felt inconsistent and lacking.
‚úï Lack of logic when it came to the ""incident"" revealed in ep 14-15 | Don't know why the drama decided to use this heavily hinted incident as a point of conflict, but the actual reveal was anticlimactic and made me go ""wat."" The people who were mad/angry/upset were pretty emotional/illogical when it came to those feelings, and the guilt Du-Sik had was unwarranted. Sure, it added dimension to his character (the trauma leading to issues such as PTSD and survivor's guilt), but the set-up was weak. Very weak. I don't know, there was just this big build-up and foreshadowing and for what? It felt like the writers just crammed those characters/their emotions in for the sake of emotional angst to lead to the finale.
‚úï Misunderstanding level: 0/10 | I don't remember any that jump out (feel free to point out any). One thing I liked about this drama is that the main couple is pretty open with their communication (ex: Du-Sik calling out Hye-Jin for her superficial attributes, them saying sorry to each other when warranted, etc). The other villagers had more misunderstandings, exacerbated by the hilarious gossip group, but it was all in good fun.

OVERALL
If you love love, family, and reconciliation, then Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha is the heartwarming romcom you're looking for! However, if the first couple of episodes don't capture your attention, I feel like the rest of the show won't (and this is what I tell my friends who were bored of it). Otherwise, I was in love with it from ep 1 and understand why people call it a ""healing"" drama. Only good vibes and energy from Homcha!

(Note: My rewatch value is set to 5.0 always as a default as I'm not the type to rewatch dramas EVER. Thus, I do not take it into account when calculating overall score.)

A SERVE through and through
At its' core, Hometown Cha Cha Cha is about men being men: doing hard labour and being in love with a sometimes mean woman.

When I talk about chemistry between the leads, this is what I mean!

This slice-of-life drama that feels so genuine and realistic that it's hard not to connect with the characters. There's something about Du-sik that I just can't pinpoint, but he's my favorite ML of all dramas. I absolutely loved the progress of their relationship, it was sooo rewarding when they just admitted their love and went from pretending to hate each other to being the most cutesy couple.
HCCC's only flaw is the divorce subplot, which no one watching cared about lol.
Either way, I now have brand new relationship goals (how tacky, I know) in my life.

Life is beautiful, just live it
Hometown Cha Cha Cha is not a love story, but a story full of emotional moments. It's all about love, pain, sorrow, happiness, regrets and every human emotion that can be expressed.

Without divulging much, it is impressive how Hometown... attempts to go beyond a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy as it explores grief, guilt, loss, and healing. While this is dealt with in a mature way, it would have benefited the show more if the intense themes weren‚Äôt all packed into the final two episodes.

Kim Young-Ok as Gam-ri, an octogenarian grandmother who Du-Sik is closest to, once again proves why she‚Äôs the best K-drama grandmother. Hometown excels at slice-of-life goodness and wholesome romance of the best kind.

My Rating : 8/10

A PERFECT ROM-COM drama.
Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha will make you cry, laugh, scream, crazy, and smile. It's not just a drama, it's an emotion. This drama teaches you the values of life, how special is life, and how you should never give up. If I am ever re-born, I want to be born in this neighborhood. From episodes 1 to 16, I enjoyed every single episode. Must watch! Definitely one of the best 2021 Korean dramas. Such a heart-warming drama. Trust me you won't regret it at all. a perfect, all-kill ROM-COM drama.

The soundtrack, the cinematography, and the writing are so beautiful. I love every single frame of it. Acting from the cast is a masterpiece, not to forget all the child actors and the side characters, great acting. There are so many tear-jerking scenes, the performance from the side characters shines a lot in this drama. Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho, the dimple couples, the chemistry between them is so powerful

Romantic Sunday
Wonderful story from start to finish. Extremely funny, and that makes you freak out a lot and suffer in the right amount. All characters steal the show, with no exceptions. Their story is beautiful as neighbors who consider themselves family and the individual story of each one is also beautiful. The evolution and maturation of each one of them is very nice to watch.

Now talking about Dusik and his history. He was the one who drew the most attention in all the episodes. He showed what a feeling of guilt can do to a person. Both self-blame and guilt placed by others. And as we suspected from the beginning, nothing that happened was his fault. They were just fatalities that I wasn't and couldn't be in anyone's control. It's good that in the end he and the people involved understood this and forgave each other, taking a burden off his heart and conscience so he could move on without worrying about what happened in the past.

Hyejin and Dusik were a relationship goal couple. A lot of chemistry involved and each one helped the other in the process of maturation and evolution. The plot that they had already met as children, as teenagers and that Hyejin called for help when she saw Dusik on the bridge, made their adult relationship even more special.

And yet the third of the love triangle didn't stay in the friendzone forever. This should be mandatory in all love triangles.

Happy ending is great. But happy ending with marriage is even better!

As we know that this work is adaption based on movies, but i should say that the drama is more beautifull in all aspect: cinematography is breathtaking, the script is fresh and nice, all actor and actress act very well,
Kim seon ho acting is superb, i love his micro expression in acting that makes me laugh and cry during the series. My favorite parts of him is in ep 15, i must say that his acting gives me chills..he should be the next kim so hyun..
Shin min ah as always become the queen of rom com, she portray hyejin very well. While they act together, the chemistry was so extra. The two of them complete each other very well, i can see they deliver adlibs naturaly and flawlessly..
Hwajeong, namsuk, and bora eomma acting‚Äôs also make me cry a river , their background in theatre gives guarantee of good acting..
The ost is always become my favorite , choi yu ree wish, i dont know why i feel so emotional while i listen to this song..
What should i say, this drama is perfection, when you need to heal your wounds or to escape from stressfull life.just go watch this drama.

THE BEST DRAMA OF 2021
To be honest the story nothing out of the box same regular love story, but the way it's executed and the way realistic touch is given makes this drama unique and special. This is just an amazing drama which makes you emotion and happy when you watch it.

The actors in this drama are really wow their performance was simply awesome. Kim Seon ho and Shin min ah were so cute and chemistry btw them was eye-catching. Not only the main lead the remaining characters just performed brilliantly. Each and every character has their own story and it was nice to watch them. Mainly Chang Yeong-Guk and Oh Chun-Jae this two just kept entertaining in the middle of every episode. And the musics in it are also amazing.

It was soo realistic that as I kept watching I felt as if I was also one among them. Just can't forget this drama it's become favourite drama now. Wish there was season 2.

Highly recommended don't miss this drama at any cost it's a must watch

IT'S SO GOOD AND REFRESHING
So fun and light. Enjoyable from the very beginnng to the very end.
The leads dynamics are hilarious and the side characters of the island are all so lovable and unique they will make the funniest scenes while adding a little bit of their own story to the show. It's a cut relationship between the leads without major conflicts between them. It potraits a mature relationship with a heathy comunication (most of the times cause the angst is a must) and the healthy relationship it's not exclusive to the main couple, the rest of the couples on the show are all very mature as well. Its a must watch!

DO NOT GO INTO THIS DRAMA WITH EXPECTATIONS
I have a lot to say so let's get into this.

This drama alone is a breath of fresh air, It's a nice refreshing show to get your head out of intense thriller dramas. HOWEVER the reason I feel a bit disappointed with this drama is because of the expectations I had on it, after hearing everybody talk about how this drama is perfect I set expectations that ended up allowing me to come out of this drama disappointed. THIS DRAMA IS NOT EVERYONE's CUP OF TEA, as much as people promote it that way it really isn't, some parts can be slow in this drama, and often times I found myself considering dropping it. I'M SO GLAD I DIDN'T BECAUSE I ENJOYED THIS SO MUCH. I believe the reason this drama has so much hype surrounding it is that I feel like this drama is perfect to watch while it was airing, it in fact isn't a drama to really binge it's a drama that you should watch episode or two a day just to really enjoy.

I honestly was going to score this drama at a 7 but the ending really picked it up for me. To those who are checking the reviews wondering if the drama gets better, YES it does especially towards the end and it is WORTH IT.

Do I recommend this drama? ABSOLUTELY. For anyone who wants something refreshing to watch without any major intense twists, this is perfect.

I LOVED THE ML LEAD AN FL SO MUCH and the rest of the characters now have a special place in my heart. I'm going to miss this drama :')

This is a drama that sounds like a hallmark rom-com; a city girl who focuses a lot on frames and her career moves to a beautiful small town and meets a scruffy local men that she falls in love with. But this is actually a slice-of-life story. It‚Äôs overflowing with warm feelings and wonderful, deep and imperfect characters that you will fall in love with along the way. It‚Äôs almost like a warm drink on a rainy day in kdrama form. Hometown Cha Cha Cha is one of those dramas that really moved me from the very first episode as there was something so cozy and homely about them that just gripped me by the heartstrings and would not let me go.

The story may not be big but it seems to be enough there that the story never drags it‚Äôs legs or or goes into endless circles with the plot. It spends a good time with all the characters and the introspection of those characters that takes place within the drama.

Hometown Cha Cha Cha strikes a pretty good balance between having a story that is constantly moving forward while also capturing this mundane life and the quiet moments as we follow all of these different characters and their lives in this small community where everyone knows everyone.

All the characters we meet on our way through the story are interesting and it‚Äôs fun to watch them and their impact on each other‚Äôs lives. Everyone has their own burdens and baggage‚Äôs in life that the drama manages to explore quite well. Watching people‚Äôs walls break down over time and people face their demons without it ever dragging too long or being too dramatic.

We get to see the different sides of most of all the characters and how complex and human they are. Each episode of the drama is more than an hour long, which I usually do moan about, but here I hardly felt it. Because I enjoyed the time with the characters so much.

There is almost this subdued suspense that is there all the way through the story. It never get‚Äôs too big, too dramatic or too ahead of itself. It captures this feeling that life can be messy but it‚Äôs also just a series of moments that pass and fade over time really well. Some moments are wonderful, warm and calm but some cruel and sad. But life still goes on somehow. The message of the story and the story itself is not much bigger than that, but it works really well.

So much of the romance, but also just the friendship that is going on, is just about the individual‚Äôs personal boundaries and the communication between them. Everything about how the romance was built radiated comfort and warmth in my opinion, which I found really sweet and just pleasant to watch. Like everything about the drama was. Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho, as well as all the other actors, fill their characters with life and emotions.

There is also a really good balance between the love stories within the drama and the other stories that deal more with people‚Äôs personal lives and their position in life. The love story will never be too sappy, which would not suit this type of story, but rather it seem more human and sensible. Even if misunderstandings occur it is quickly worked out and one can understands the reason why the character act a certain way because they story has worked for it. These people are complex and you get to see them from many angles.

The love story is still a very big part of the story; both when it comes to the main characters and the supporting characters. But even though the story is about them falling in love, it is also so much about these characters learning to love themselves as well as the other characters around them. But the drama also deals with loads of different themes such as loneliness in old age, divorce, there is a lgbt character, and many other things that crop up as we go through the lives of the characters of this small town as this is ultimately a story about the community.

My favorite kdrama of all time
The story is simple and beautiful. It is about our ordinary life. People now leave their hometown; go and work in coty leaving old people behind. This one shows you how beautiful simple life is. There are always reasons behind each story; something for you to look forwatd too while enjoy those simple stories. The casts are amzing; not only just the main actor and actress; everyone makes each role outstanding and charming in their won way. Soundtracks are wonderful. Some make you laugh while some make you cry while listen to them Recommended to all.

A Refreshing and Realistic and Remarkable story!
Ever since the start of 2021, there have been an overwhelming amount of kdramas released with the mystery, thriller, psychological genre, so HOMETOWN CHA CHA CHA was like a breath of fresh air.

The main thing that made this drama worthwhile was the perfect casting of our leads, the whole Gongjin family and of course, the Gongjin village itself! The way they captured the beautiful and mesmerizing sceneries, it will make anyone crave to live there, even if it's for a while.

Next comes our remarkable characters. Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah showed one of the most adorable chemistry, and it was beautiful seeing how their whole journey towards finding and falling for each other evolved in front of our eyes.
The spectacular acting by our cast made this drama worth watching. Kim Seon Ho's famous ""eye-acting"" was present here too, and made us all cry along and suffer with him, then comes our Gamri Halmeoni who reminded us of our own lovable grandmothers. Moreover, the side stories of our Gongjin residents - Namsook, Hwajeong, Cho Hui, Oh Yoon, the bromance between Dusik and Ji pd was very perfectly executed. The child actors playing Ijun, Bora were exceptional too.

All in all, this drama showed us the perfect bonding and love between people who are not related by blood, but at the end of the day, they are like a huge, loving family, who will do anything and everything for each other.
WHAT AN ENJOYABLE RIDE IT WAS!

Not bad but doesn't live up to the hype - a little too cringy for my taste
Completed - 1/29/22 - rating 8.25

""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" is such a highly rated drama in 2021 that I was hesitant to watch it during all the hype. I was afraid I will be disappointed. Now I can finally say that personally, I don't think it lives up to the hype. I enjoyed the drama for the most part but there are certain things that did bug me.

What I Enjoy:
1. Small town feel - It's a nice change to watch a K-drama sets in a rural area. I've always enjoyed the small town feel as there are way too many dramas that are featured in big cities, tall high rises and fancy decors. I get to enjoy the sceneries from the beach, to the mountain to the view of the ocean. I especially like the houses of our ML and Grandma Kim. I would love to have FL's office view of the ocean when I look out my office window.

2. Romance/Chemistry (first 10 episodes) - Before our leads got together, the romance was a lot more fun. I enjoyed the bickering between our leads and how they get to know each other through mishaps and arguments. Though I am not a big fan of slow-motion accidental falls, I do like side glances. The chemistry was great. During these episodes, we also see two mature adults in their 30s, navigating through life's challenges and communicating openly and somewhat sensibly.

3. Grandma Kim & Zone Chief Yeo - These two ladies are my favorite supporting characters in Gongjin. They are both tough as nails, strong and independent. They don't take nonsense from others and are caring in their own ways. They are the least annoying residents in the whole of Gongjin.

4. I really like the short but touching conversation between FL and 2ML in the coffee shop/bar. I always thought it was an unrequited love on Director Ji's side, but we found out it's actually mutual affection. If only one of them has confessed sooner and the timing is better, we might have a very different story. Anyway, I just like the feels I got when watching them and how kind and honest they are to each other.

What I don't quite enjoy:
1. Romance right after the leads got together. It seems like these 30-year-olds became hormonal and cringy teenagers. What happened to the mature adults we have in the first 10 episodes? Why all the baby talk and whining? Just because you haven't had a relationship in a while doesn't automatically turn you into such annoying people once you fall in love. The relationship could be done in a sweet and cute way without being cringy.
Sorry for the rant. I was really disappointed in the personality change, thus, I can't give this drama a higher rating.

2. Shaky camera work when shooting close-up. There are quite a few scenes that I get dizzy just looking at the actors faces. This only happens on close-up shots, esp. in the beginning and end of the drama. Since I have bad motion sickness, I was quite sensitive.

3. Annoying side characters - The most annoying support character award goes to the loud-mouth gossipmonger, Cho Nam Sook. She's so loud and annoying and I really couldn't stand her spreading rumors about every one. The drama tried to paint a more sympathetic picture on her by telling us of her history. However, I don't buy that. Just because you have a sad past does not give you a pass in spreading rumors and hurting other people. The other Gongjin residents are quite annoying as well. They are just so loud and overly dramatic.

Other observations:
1. First shot/scene of ML - why is he wearing so much lipstick?
2. They overplayed the song ""Romantic Sunday"" in the first half of the drama.
3. I like the cute and awkward romance between FL's bff and the police officer.
4. I like the adopted family feel of Gongjin, despite the annoying characters.

This was it
The very first show that made me fall in love with k-dramas, you're not only fall in love with the story but you actually feel for the characters and that is good acting. I've spent most of my life watching horror movies, the show really made me decide to give other genres a chance amazing plus it helps that the main role is gorgeous ü§îüñ§ I mean that never hurts right. But seriously if only life was really like this I guess that's what really got me into this it's every girl's fantasy. If you haven't watched it give it a chance.

Do you that feeling wen you have been waiting to watch a drama for so long and then you finally do watch it and it doesn't disappoint you?? The best feeling in the world.
Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha actually was a very gentle and soft drama. I think these two words describe the drama perfectly. The male lead was so caring, never getting angry and so cute. It wasn't a clich√© where the male lead was over-bearing and rich. his role was so down-to-earth. I am so glad that even in the end they didn't show him becoming rich or going back to his old life. It was a life lesson to be learnt.
The female lead's character was also great. At first I thought she wasn't so nice but I realised her character portrayed a realistic life. You don't always get along with everyone in life. She was honest and voiced her opinions bravely. She managed to become family with everyone else at least.
One thing that annoyed me was when the main leads became a couple, Yoon Hye Jin's character suddenly got a little cringe. Yes I get that people in love go all sweet and lovey-dovey but I found that her acting was too over the top.
Also, I didn't like the fact that she kept on forcing Chief Hong to open up to her. I get that they are together and must share everything but in my opinion, everyone has their own insecurities and secrets they don't wish to easily share. That's something they should have respected. Her telling him once or twice to open up was fine but then it got irritating when she literally forced him.
All-in-all, it was a great drama and one I will never forget. I totally loved it!

A Good Slice of Life Drama
Hometown cha cha cha ended with a really good note but overall if you look back there were some dragging situations, 16 epi with 1h 20 min duration per Episode is too much i felt. But anyway a drama which filled with so many emotional scenarios and visually beautiful and heartwarming is really interesting to watch.

The way it started was really increased my expectations. Its definitely not something we see for the first time. It's full of clich√©s but if those clich√© emotions has the ability to communicate with us is enough to label it as a good slice of life drama . If you are a ragular drama watcher you may feel little tired of some scenes, for me it's some romantic situations, especially Shin Min a acting, she looks really weird in some Episodes. its looks so artificial.

In the middle they dragged it like crazy, some unwanted love triangle caught in the center for a moment i thought of dropping this show. Because some dramas will take that it to the end, but thankfully it was ok after some point. Another interesting factor was the relationship of people of Gongjin and their bonding..‚ù§Ô∏è it was lovely, their stories and those emotional moments everything was so good to see.

The unfold mystery and that flashbacks everything related to that was also so touching.. The best episode probably will be E15, that single episode changed the entire mood of the drama, excellent. Finale Episode also took its time which was unnecessary but the happy faces of Gongjin make it really good.

Hometown cha cha cha is a very good slice of life romantic drama experience.. its really a heartwarming slice of life show. I don't know why i feel that it would be a much better drama if they reduce the episode duration or numbers. Anyway if you love these kind of plots you must try this.

Let's be honest, I'm not a fan of comedy-romance dramas and I watched the drama just because of KIM SEON HO.

I knew how the end of the story will be and the thing that was important to me was the process of the story.
Let me tell you that I enjoyed the chemistry between Kim Seon ho and Shin Min Ah.

Also the cast of this drama, made me feel good and the truth about this drama is that was not just a comedy-romance drama, but it tried to give us some lessons about life.

Of course, as always I exprienced second lead syndrome; but I can stand it because it wasn't as painful as Han Ji Pyung :)

Let's be honest another time, I liked this drama and I'm happy that I gave it a chance.

I wish the best for my Flower Boy, KIM SEON HO <3

Phenomenal acting saved this drama
After reading so many conflicting reviews I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. Was it touching and sweet? Yes. Was the acting good? I was blown away by the acting skills of this entire cast. Did the main leads have chemistry? Absolutely! So why didn‚Äôt I give it a perfect 10? Two reasons: the pacing of the drama and the storyline. (Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be addressing a lot of good stuff about this drama later. But let‚Äôs get the bad out of the way first).

First, let‚Äôs talk about the pacing. Yes, I know it‚Äôs a slice of life drama which is typically slow paced, which I expected. I love slice of life dramas and adored You Are My Glory (my all time favorite slice of life drama). But it wasn‚Äôt the slow pacing of the drama that bothered me. It was how the drama started out a little slower than normal, then continued at a very relaxed laidback pace, then suddenly out of nowhere it had major drama and angst in the last few episodes. I felt like I was watching a melodrama. I‚Äôm not talking about small misunderstandings or love triangles. It got much deeper and darker. Not only does a beloved character die but someone almost committed suicide. It was such a light, fluffy, relaxing drama that I never expected death and suicide to be the main topics of discussion in those last few episodes. If they had paced things better it would have been a far better drama. It was very slow for a good deal of the drama with very little excitement. Then there was too much excitement and angst crammed into the last few episodes. If the excitement and angst had been sprinkled throughout the drama in little bits it would have been perfect. I appreciated all of the various topics that were touched upon. Like death, mental health issues, the effects of divorce on both parents & children, and alternative lifestyles. But most of these issues were hinted at and slowly built up throughout the drama but didn‚Äôt really come to light till the last few episodes. So it seemed like everything happened all at once near the end. If each issue had been dealt with separately throughout the drama it would have been more interesting and more evenly paced.

Now let‚Äôs address the main problem of this drama, the storyline. I think the reason it felt slower than normal for so long was because of the basic setting of the story. The female lead is a dentist, which is not a very exciting job. Then the male lead doesn‚Äôt really have a career, he just fills in wherever he‚Äôs needed all around town. Most of his jobs are uninteresting like waiting tables or making coffee at the local coffee shop. And since slice of life dramas mainly focus on the lead characters daily lives, I found it a bit slow and uninteresting at times, especially when it involved their jobs. And since it was set in a laidback quiet little town in the countryside, there wasn‚Äôt much excitement. I normally enjoy a laidback drama, I find them relaxing. But this one was just too calm and sedate for my tastes. If the main leads had more interesting careers or had it been set in a more exciting location, the drama would have been much better.

Now for the good stuff: the acting. The acting of the entire cast was far above average. I‚Äôve watched hundreds of dramas and it‚Äôs extremely rare for me to like the entire cast. But they acted their butts off. I think that‚Äôs why this drama has such great ratings. These amazing actors took a drama with pacing and storyline issues and elevated it to one of the top dramas of the year. I don‚Äôt expect it to get drama of the year, but to have everyone talking about the possibility is a testament to their fine acting.

One of the things I always look for in a drama is character growth. And I was thrilled to see lots of that in this drama. All across the board each and every character grew and changed. They learned from their past mistakes and became better people. I enjoyed watching them become better versions of themselves.

With a romance drama the chemistry between the leads is essential and these leads oozed chemistry. They are both gorgeous and seemed very attracted to each other. There‚Äôs lots of kisses, flirting, and hand holding. But I wish there had been a little more skinship. And the kisses were too light and delicate. The sweet delicate kisses are more appropriate for youth dramas. When the actors are more mature then steamy kisses are expected and much more realistic. That being said, I still loved their romance and looked forward to their romantic moments. Just don‚Äôt expect a real life romance between the two. The female lead is already taken. (Shout out to Kim Woo Bin.)

My favorite thing about this drama and what I think makes everyone like it so much is that it has some deep underlying messages, such as:

First: don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover, the image people portray may not be who they really are.

Second: Burying a pain deep inside will only make the pain worse. Just like an impacted wisdom tooth, if you don‚Äôt pull it out it will just hurt more.

Third: No occupation or lifestyle is superior to another.

Fourth: Appreciate the small things in life, they are what brings true happiness, not money or fancy careers.

In conclusion, I now understand why the reviews are so varied. Slice of life dramas are not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. You will only like this if you‚Äôre into slice of life dramas that are slower paced. Yes this is slower paced than most slice of life dramas but the acting is phenomenal, the leads have chemistry, the side characters are interesting, there‚Äôs lots of character growth, and it teaches some valuable lessons. I probably won‚Äôt watch it again because it‚Äôs a bit too calm and sedate to bring me back a second time. But I loved how fuzzy and warm it made me feel. The ending is so touching and sweet and not cheesy at all. I would definitely recommend it but only for those who like slower paced slice of life type of dramas.

This show was definitely out of my comfort zone of k-dramas I usually watch, bur I'm so glad that I gave it a chance.
It made me laugh, cry, get annoyed, be angry. I fell in love with every single one of the characters, and even if I had iffy feelings on one of them, I ended up loving them in the end. It made me wish I lived in a small town where everyone knows and cares for each other. It felt like one huge family, and made me wish I had that close of friends as well.
I loved that every single character mattered and they each had a story and a past that went into an episode. All of their relationships were given so much time, and it helped create a bond with each and every one of them.
If you want a show that can have you laughing, but then also have you crying so hard then def give this show a watch. It's so wholesome, but has moments where you have your head in your hands in embarrassment. You'll be laughing and then crying.
The story flows so well and has many call-backs to things that help give you more answers and insight onto what was happening.
10/10 amazing.

I liked it!!
I liked it a lot. Especially, since I've been watching too much of suspense, thriller and dark kdramas, this was extremely refreshing and nice. Cute and nice, this drama was really fun. It gave me butterflies in my stomach. Plot wasn't that strong, but you know what? Sometimes the plot doesn't have to be breathtaking, super duper intersting and all to deliver the little messages of life. Those kind of dramas stress me out (although I do enjoy them). I took my time to sit on a cozy couch and watch as much as I was comfortable with. Really enjoyed it. Strongly recommended!

Heart-warming storyline with realistic romance
I thought the setting in a small-town with ""weird side characters"" would bore me, but this is now one of my favorite dramas for it's realistic approach to how 2 individuals slowly get to know each other as well as what it takes to settle into a new home/community.

Very heart-warming story with great romantic development between the main couple as well as nuanced side characters with their own backgrounds (i usually think the latter is a waste, but not a scene or line was wasted in this drama!).

Upon first glance, it doesn't seem like Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho have chemistry, but you'll get small glimmers of his growing affection for her, which makes it such a satisfying slow burn. Additionally, they both judge each other off the bat but you'll watch them change their judgment of each other the more they get to know each other.

Both are warm-hearted, talented individuals who keep themselves guarded: one with a demeanor of a high maintenance ice-queen while the other keeps himself busy with work. Little by little, they become vulnerable with each other and realize that you don't have to be ""whole"" to genuinely be loved.

Additionally, each of the side characters have a story line that makes it easy to understand why they are the way they are.

tldr: If you want a drama that shows the power of a small community uplifting each other and how vulnerability can lead to love, this drama hits those points.

Absolutely beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
I wanted to watch this when it was airing but couldn't. Now that I have watched it, I loved it.
The story is not complex or extraordinary. It's a simple, sweet and fluffy show. It's been days since I genuinely enjoyed any drama but I loved this one.
Location, OST, cinematography, visuals, cast, everything about this show was amazing.
It ended so soon. I don't know when will I get a chance to watch something this good again.
There are only some shows that make your heart warm and giddy and makes you feel good and this show is one of them for me.
Also, I'm officially crushing on Kim Seoh Ho‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®

They did not lie when they promised this drama would be healing
This drama is one of the most refreshing things I've watched in awhile. It's fairly light hearted (though there are episodes that will hurt), and full of good communication and character growth and so many of those lovely things. Every couple is a delight to watch, even the ones that frustrated you in the beginning. The town and the people who live in it genuinely feel real and complex, and they get as much screen time as they deserve.

It's not nothing but fluff, but this is a good thing. This is well written and soothing and I absolutely recommend it to anyone.

Wholesome drama
While I was watching this show I thought: My mum woud love it! It is just so wholesome and positiv and its bascially stories about normal life. Stories about friends and family, divorce, falling in love, jobs, expectations of society, missunderstandings, raising a family, parenting, getting old, dealing with some kind of trauma etc. It is entertaining and kept me engaged until Episode 14... OK maybe also 15 as I did want to know what happened to Chief Hong... But like many Korean Dramas it just streched out a bit too long and the end there was just too much happy endings so I stopped 10 minutes into Episode 16. By then the story was told and nothing in Episode 16 added to it (apart from making me cringe a bit).
But yes if you are looking for some wholesome story with nice acting and beautiful scenery its the one for you.
My mum would love this and its a shame they didnt synch it in German.

LA LA LA LA LA ~ RO~MAN~TIC SUNDAY~~
This show brings fluffy sweet scenes and tropes galore! You'll enjoy it as long as you don't take it too seriously. You'll find corny wrist grabs and stumbles, sudden fevers, childhood connections, and even a white truck of doom. That being said, even hearing the opening notes of ""La la la la la Romantic Sundaaaay"" instantly brightened up my weekends over the past couple of months. Kim Seon Ho brings all his Good Boy charms here, down to his soft spot for a local halmeoni.

At its best, this show delivered emotional scenes depicting all sorts of interpersonal relationships. Bora's Umma stole the show during the typhoon, and I-Jun stole my heart during his moment in the park. I never expected this show to elicit tears from me, but here we are. Gongjin is a charming small town with a whole slew of excitable busybodies. Whether you find yourself squealing over DOS (dare I say... ""In the Soop""?!) or clapping along with the town's festivals or parties, anyone can easily find a home in this little seaside town.

My main gripe with the show comes from the minimal conflict. After roughly the halfway point, the plot dragged for a while. The Ji PD storyline was such a non-issue; I don't know a single person who felt SLS for him. We knew where things were going, and we only had the PROMISE of three mysteries to keep us going: Why did Hwa Jeong and Young Guk divorce? What happened to Dushik during the five years he lived away from Gongjin? Who won the lottery? ...And each of these were resolved right near the end, with just a little bit of time devoted to each. I wish we got more on Dushik especially ‚Äî his story ultimately made sense, but I wish we got to see him wrestle with these demons more. It almost felt like he fled and compartmentalized everything instead of learning to cope with his demons head-on. I didn't appreciate the resentment from the other parties; their non-apologies fell flat to me. Imagine if he had a scene with Do Ha's father directly!

Instead of dangling these plot points in front of us for episodes without a conclusion, I wish we got there sooner and then spent time exploring the fact that Hye Jin and Dushik came from pretty different worlds. We saw shades of their compromises: Dushik putting in effort with Hye Jin's ""friends"" on the golf course, and Hye Jin setting other opportunities aside. While that may be realistic, the feminist in me was hoping that SHE hoped for more. Her compromises felt way bigger than his, and I wish we saw a bit more give-and-take, or at least a bit more of the moments that changed their perceptions and goals.

|| SPOILER: I wish that the ending of ep 15 actually set Dushik free, so that he would be energized to try again in Seoul. Practically, it would've made sense to me if their careers flourished there, especially considering the fact that their (future) children would've had more opportunities in the big city ‚Äî yes, I was hoping for a time-skip that involved kids. Of course, this alternate ending in my mind would've still involved frequent trips to Gongjin. I think I merely wanted Hye Jin and Dushik's lives to open up a bit more as a result of their connection, but I suppose I'll have to recognize that not everyone has such lofty dreams. Some people are content to live in a small town surrounded by a doting found-family, and I suppose I can respect the coziness in that slower walk of life. ||

Still, this show offered some thoughtful messages beneath its bright, shiny exterior. I especially liked the sentiment that small actions can make a world of difference to others, like a simple text message or call during a time of turmoil; the fact that asking for help can actually support the giver more than the recipient (@ both Nam Sook and Dushik); and the powerful role that bystanders can play in someone's life (like helping someone smile in a photo that will eventually mean the world or calling to help a stranger and making sure they are safe before driving away). Sometimes kindness comes from ignoring someone's feelings rather than acknowledging them (@ Cho Hui). But beneath it all, empathy and care for one another is truly what brings a community together.

A beautiful and warm drama that will definitely bring you joy!
I just loved it. Hometown cha cha cha caught my attention because it seemed as a simple and funny drama, i watched the first episode and right after i knew it was going to be a favourite. I love everything about it either it being the characters, the story or the music everything was top tier to me.
I loved how every character had a story and how that story contributed to the build up of the whole drama. I loved how Hyejin and Dushik learned how to accept and love each other. I loved how Hyejin helped Dushik get over his own struggles and she helped him be happy again.
This whole drama made me cry not only of sadness but mostly of happiness, as i got to see everyone have their story told and as well get their happy ending. I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling on the last episode, it was pure happiness to me.. i hope that anyone who watches it will get the feeling of this warm drama. I guess i would say it helped me a lot to unravel my feelings.

Feel too good you'll dance cha cha cha
At first, I was kinda prejudiced and thought this was overhyped.

I was shocked about the casting and was doubtful as I thought they'll not be able to blend but I was wrong.
The editing was fine except you can notice when they retake some scenes. The shots were also too tight.

Personally, the main leads don't enchant me that much but I can agree they have chemistry.

Even though you're just watching you'll also feel the freshness of Gongjin.

Overall this drama was fantastic and indeed recommended if you want to refresh and feel good.

P.S: You might pass on this one because you'll think that it's just pure Rom-Com but no there's more than that so you better check this drama out.

Best drama of 2021
Best drama of 2021 and that's a fact, relative to life instead of fiction. Shin Minah is a queen and a goddess, since i saw her in tomorrow with you that was when I fell for her, she's so sexy, talented and beautiful. She always slay her roles in any drama. This is my first Korean drama that I have watched within a span of 2 days instead of years, was hooked right from the first episode,the casts nailed it and I hope they get to bag all the awards they will be nominated for especially the male lead, first time seeing him in a drama and it felt as if I have been watching all his drama which shows that he really knows how to act and deliver his roles well. Super realistic and all about life, took me back to reply 1988. TvN really know how to make a good quality drama and no wonder their dramas are all a hit. I love this drama so much, love all the casts and I'm sad that I finished it already.

Heartwarming and healing
When I started the drama, I didn't think I'd love it that much and now, I'm already missing it.
All the characters were realistic, had problems and learnt how to deal with them, the side characters weren't distraction. And even if at first I kept wanting more SikHye screen moments, I loved GongJin, cried with Gongjin and laughed with its villagers.
The plot, it was simple, it was a remake of Mr Hong they said, and the director got us with previews that let you wait worried will that happen like the movie or not. And It wasn't like the movie, it was written in a beautiful straight mature way that will raise your expectations in Dramaland. Tell dramas that we don't break up but we face problems together, tell them that facing typhoons don't matter if we're on the same boat. Hye Jin is the best decision maker FL I've seen( apart the hitting part, skip that part please hhh) but she knows what she wants, and care, support and doesn't run away when needed.
The acting was sometimes missing it but I chommal enjoyed the journey from Romantic Sunday to tearful one to satisfied one. I'll miss these Saturday and Sunday nights that showed me that waiting for the release of the episodes every week can be sometimes better than binge watching <3

A refreshing story
This drama was soo nice.

It was a very refreshing story about our FL, a dentist from Seoul, who came to a little seaside town to open a her business after some event went down at work.

In this village she meets our ML who is a guy from the little town.

There were no big fights, no angry step-mom ou jealous second lead. Everything was smooth and nice.

The ML does have a past, but it does not tarnish the sweetness of the story in my opinion.

The drama was fun, and all the characters were great.

It's such a feelgood drama that I will rewatch, for sure, on gloomy days.

Sweet healing romance that managed to be underdone and overcooked
As a rom-com I can't fault its setting, both M/FL and support casting. OTP chemistry and swoon worthy moments. They are all present and accounted for, if anything, someone must have done a checklist so that every item was ticked and double checked. The problem lies more in the show's desire to please ""everyone"". To be honest, the writer-nim largely succeeded in doing this but it was also its Achilles heel.
The premise of the show is simple, the FL is forced to restart her dentist career out in the boondocks and there she found love as well as new friends and found family. It is a well used trope and with the show navigating a fairly safe path meant that for the longest time, it never hits any real highs or lows. I think that may well be because it is the FL's first show after 2 years away from the limelight. She probably wanted a high profile hit and this definitely delivered.
Having said that, the meet-cute and the OTP's journey to true love was well done and there is always something happening to push them closer together. The seaside village of Gongjin cannot be more idyllic. It was picturesque day and night. The FL is in her 30's (ML is 1 year older), well dressed, sophisticated and pretty. She became all giggly and with aegyo dialled up after she fell in love. To be honest, it was a little jarring. This was initially matched by her best friend who also fell in love with a local and formed half of the 2OTP but she is a lot more grounded as the relationship progressed. The ML was handsome, charismatic, chilled, helpful, friendly and a bit eccentric. A total opposite to the usual cold, rich, man-child of a ML. The local villagers were a eclectic bunch. They are classy actors who knew their trade and will steal the scene if you let them. It was clever of the writer-nim to drip-feed their backstory slowly so that what appeared to be just the usual nosy neighbours and busybodies were shown to be true friends and have raison d'√™tre for their behaviours.
The deft hand of the writer-nim is evident else where. There are lots of tropey plots and clich√© scenes but they were seldom over the top to the point where you facepalm and groan out loud but they can also be undercooked so that it became a bit superficial. One area where the writer-nim went a bit overboard was the fate motif. There were just too many coincidences to be believable.
Hence, it was quite odd when around episodes 14,15 the story became a potboiler/melodrama. There were certainly buckets of tears (have tissue handy). The whole plot about the ML's role as a fund manager was overcooked. Seriously, it wasn't really his fault and certainly in regards to his friend's death. So it was drama for drama sake and not very convincing. After all the hints of a dark past, it turned out he was even more saintly than he already is.
The ""tread lightly"" approach also meant that there was not a lot of growth in the characters but more like story progression. Old wrongs were righted, broken or strained relationships were healed. Naissance love triangle morphed into a bromance. The snobbish and judgemental FL became someone who appreciates the country lifestyle and her new friends but she was essentially the same decent person. The ML stays the same except now everyone knew his backstory and loved him even more.
It was no surprise that everybody got a happy ending. Sunshine, rainbows and a herd of unicorns roamed the land. :D It was sugary but it brought the show to its own logical conclusion. At least it was not rushed and there was enough time to give everyone a proper sent off.
OST was nice and breezy. Production value was high. Quality cinematography captured the lovely sceneries. I really enjoyed this show so rewatch value is there for the swoon worthy and feel good bits but skip ep.15 if sentimentality is not your cup of chai. Almost forgot to mention the PPL, there were quite a bit of it. Not egregious but more than I'd care for.

All about community !
This is a drama that sounds like a hallmark rom-com; a city girl who focuses a lot on frames and her career moves to a beautiful small town and meets a scruffy local men that she falls in love with. But this is actually a slice-of-life story. It‚Äôs overflowing with warm feelings and wonderful, deep and imperfect characters that you will fall in love with along the way. It‚Äôs almost like a warm drink on a rainy day in kdrama form. Hometown Cha Cha Cha is one of those dramas that really moved me from the very first episode as there was something so cozy and homely about them that just gripped me by the heartstrings and would not let me go.

The story may not be big but it seems to be enough there that the story never drags it‚Äôs legs or or goes into endless circles with the plot. It spends a good time with all the characters and the introspection of those characters that takes place within the drama.

Hometown Cha Cha Cha strikes a pretty good balance between having a story that is constantly moving forward while also capturing this mundane life and the quiet moments as we follow all of these different characters and their lives in this small community where everyone knows everyone.

All the characters we meet on our way through the story are interesting and it‚Äôs fun to watch them and their impact on each other‚Äôs lives. Everyone has their own burdens and baggage‚Äôs in life that the drama manages to explore quite well. Watching people‚Äôs walls break down over time and people face their demons without it ever dragging too long or being too dramatic.

We get to see the different sides of most of all the characters and how complex and human they are. Each episode of the drama is more than an hour long, which I usually do moan about, but here I hardly felt it. Because I enjoyed the time with the characters so much.

There is almost this subdued suspense that is there all the way through the story. It never get‚Äôs too big, too dramatic or too ahead of itself. It captures this feeling that life can be messy but it‚Äôs also just a series of moments that pass and fade over time really well. Some moments are wonderful, warm and calm but some cruel and sad. But life still goes on somehow. The message of the story and the story itself is not much bigger than that, but it works really well.

So much of the romance, but also just the friendship that is going on, is just about the individual‚Äôs personal boundaries and the communication between them. Everything about how the romance was built radiated comfort and warmth in my opinion, which I found really sweet and just pleasant to watch. Like everything about the drama was. Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho, as well as all the other actors, fill their characters with life and emotions.

There is also a really good balance between the love stories within the drama and the other stories that deal more with people‚Äôs personal lives and their position in life. The love story will never be too sappy, which would not suit this type of story, but rather it seem more human and sensible. Even if misunderstandings occur it is quickly worked out and one can understands the reason why the character act a certain way because they story has worked for it. These people are complex and you get to see them from many angles.

The love story is still a very big part of the story; both when it comes to the main characters and the supporting characters. But even though the story is about them falling in love, it is also so much about these characters learning to love themselves as well as the other characters around them. But the drama also deals with loads of different themes such as loneliness in old age, divorce, there is a lgbt character, and many other things that crop up as we go through the lives of the characters of this small town as this is ultimately a story about the community.

Here fo you the best k-drama of 2021!
Yes, I say it and I'll confirm it for life, ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha"" is the best k-drama of 2021, if not one of the best in recent years. Why? Well, nothing is missing: complete characters, a wonderful soundtrack, fantastic light, colors and shots, not to mention the story! But what is it about?

The story revolves around Yoon Hye-jin, a beautiful city girl who works as a dentist in Seoul, but who is fired one day for accusing (rightly) her boss of suggesting expensive treatments to patients just to make more money. At that point, without a job, she immediately decides to look for another job, but unfortunately her sweet ex-boss has spread false rumors about her, and for this reason Hye-jin have to resign. In the meantime, she decides to take a short trip to Gongjin, a small earthly paradise located by the sea where she used to go with her parents as a child, and here she meet Hong Du-sik. Du-sik is literally the opposite of Hye-jin: a handyman country boy who is even called a ""village chief"" by the citizens precisely because he knows how to do any type of job and above all because he takes care of the village elders. The two initially don't get along very well, but over time, as they continue to cross paths, they take a liking to each other. At this point Hye-jin decides to open a dental office in Gongjin, but initially things will not go as expected due to some misunderstandings, but luckily Du-sik intervenes to get her out of trouble, and things will slowly start to settle down.

The strong point of the drama are certainly the two leading actors, who are played respectively by Shin Min-a (Oh My Venus) and Kim Seon-ho (known for Start Up). In particular, this was the first leading role for Kim Seon-ho, who I can say managed to bring out the best of himself for this rural and unconventional character, in addition to his smile that I personally find very sweet (and not only his but also that of Shin Min-a, if you want to know why I warmly invite you to see it and grasp this adorable detail that binds them). Another familiar face of the cast is certainly Lee Sang-yi (found in Youth of May), who plays a former director of Hye-jin's schoolmate who wants to shoot a new show in Gongjin.
""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha"" is one of those romantic comedies that will remain in your heart for a long time; thanks to the skill of the actors and some issues that are addressed, it will be able to warm your soul and make you feel part of a big family: the one of Gongjin. So, if you want a funny and light story, but at times also very dramatic (I cried a lot in some scenes), I recommend this beautiful k-drama, it will not disappoint you.

The Most Heartwarming Drama Ever Watch
My, this drama may beat It's Okay That's Love to become the most heartwarming drama I've ever seen. From Gongjin village, to the people, and the main characters, all are bathed in the bright gorgeous Gongjin sun and sea breeze that everything is so warm and sweet and pleasant. I especially love how the writer does not only focus on the main characters, but also gives a backstory to almost everyone that appears in the drama. Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min A are superb in their actings, their laughters and cries make your heart pour out to them. There is not a single character that is the villain in the story (except maybe the stalker) so it lightens your mood and become something I look forward to every weekend. I will definitely miss Hometown Chachacha and will rewatch with my loved ones. You should give this drama a try!

I guess this would count as a 'healing' drama, a term I see all over Mydramalist these days. There are some traumatic experiences in our male lead's past as well as some sad things in the female lead's past, and the drama addresses each of them thoroughly, but the over-arching story and the way it unfolds on screen is very much one of hope and restoration through a cozy, warm-hearted lens, hence making 'healing' an apropos descriptor. It's not necessarily a new story, but the over-all charm of the characters and the setting make it a pleasant watch.

That being said, I was personally impressed with the drama's focus on forgiveness and redemption. This is not a typical topic in Korean dramas, namely because of an aspect of Korean culture called Saving Face, but Hometown handles the subject with thoughtfulness and fairness. It never openly mentions Saving Face, but it treats the male lead and difficult past with graciousness.

Of course, it's sad that after portraying such a beautiful story of hope and redemption, the actor playing the male lead has found himself in a very real scandal of his own, and for behavior far more egregious than his character's. We've been seeing a lot of serious scandals recently in the Korean entertainment industry, and each time, there's the same conversation. Should we dump the person, should we dump the media they were part of, should we forgive them, should we believe in their innocence? For my part, I hope Hometown's male lead actor and his ex-girlfriend can work through what happened in their relationship and apologize honestly for the things that went wrong and then move into the future healthier and making better choices. It's a sad situation but not one that cannot be redeemed.

As far as whether you should watch this drama or not after this scandal, that will ultimately be up to you. I don't think it is something that should stop you if you've been eyeing this drama since it started, but you also do not have to watch it if you just can't. There are so many drama's out there. If you are aware of the scandal and are more concerned with whether Hometown will suit your particular drama tastes, then here are my thoughts: If you like 'healing' drama's, then this is a good drama to watch. It has a warm and cozy feeling with charming characters and a beautiful story of redemption and restoration and hope for the future. And if you're looking for a drama that has that perfect, gooey, romantic ending, then is definitely the drama for you. There's some straight cheese in the finale that will be right up your alley, lol.

I cried, laughed, cried, and stayed calmed
This KDrama is what it is, a DRAMA! I absolutely loved the storyline. Had me going back n forth from one character to the other. The romance stories of the town's couples... omg, too hilarious. When you thought she was going after your husband... lmao. The ups and downs for me, I actually thought I was on a rollercoaster for real. Then you things change, you have a story that will blow you out of your mind, and do not know what to think. I felt the slap, the kick, and the head butt! OUCH! I feel that the whole town needed to be the main characters. The three elderly ladies, sweethearts, just sweethearts. I love them! There were small parts of martial arts and whoever that actor was... I mean wow. The two main leads were great and all of my emotions came out. Where was my umbrella? I applaud the one who wrote this. I applaud all of the actors and actresses. I love that town... now I want to go visit.

A refreshing romantic slice of life story
I was absolutely excited seeing Kim Seon Ho being partnered up with the absolutely beautiful Shin Min Ah. The ending results was absolutely beautiful with the picturesque scenery of Gongjin highlighted with the sheer talents of the cast in bringing their characters to life. A beautiful OST to blend it all in, and a consistent calm story that dictates the lives of the Gongjin residence with care and substance is also a plus. Almost of all the characters were likable and had interesting side stories to them and Kim Seon Ho's back story (revealed in ep 15) was such a tragic story bounded with the wonderful acting performance of Kim Seon Ho. The chemistry between Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho was an absolute delightful with their hilarious banters and cringy yet endearing relationship made the show even more enjoyable. If you want a little slow burn romance with a great scenic background and likable side characters then you have Hometown Cha Cha Cha to look forward to.

Bucolic small town life
What I loved:
1) When the writing was shining a light on the ensemble cast, it was right on point. It did a wonderful job of developing the characters, allowing us to get to know and care about them. There was so much heart and humor in letting us feel what it's like to live in a small town, with its quirky characters, warts and all. To live in a place where everyone is all up in your business, but they've also got your back, made me long to be a part of their lives.
2) Overall cinematography. In general, beautifully filmed. The colors of the buildings, the boats in the harbor, long shots of the small town in the distance, combined to pull you into the drama.
3) Couple chemistry. So, I'm now going to have to call Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah the Dimple Duo!! Theirs was a sweet relationship of growth and development. The relationship made sense and they were so flipping cute together. Their smiles just lit up the screen.
4) Kim Seon Ho as Hong Doo Shik. What a wonderful character, beautifully portrayed by Kim. His happiness was almost palpable, as was his despair. The love he had for his friends and neighbors was a joy to watch.
5) Kim Young Ok as Kim Gam Ri. I want her to be my grandma! I've loved her in everything I've seen her in. She was so sweet, but she had twinkle in her eye that said she was up to something.
6) Non-triangle love triangle. I love when there is a potential triangle and the secondary person actually wants their love interest to be happy - that's love rather than obsession.

What I didn't love:
1) The character of Yoon Hye-Jin. Shin Min Ah did an excellent job, but I didn't care for this character much at all. I hated her at the beginning, so much that I debated whether I was going to be able to continue the show. Thankfully, I stuck it out and her hard edges softened somewhat. I understand the reasoning for the way she was, but there still needs to be something at least a little likeable about a main character or what's the point? Later on, when she softened up a bit, she was better, but then she started acting all aegyo and that worked my last nerve.
2) Some jarring camera angles. There were a few times when the camera angle completely took me out of the story. I think they were trying to be clever, but it was unsuccessful.
3) The idol storyline. It was done strictly to bring in more characters and then not much was done with it.

I ended up rating this show a little higher than I thought I would, based on the last couple of episodes. I felt that the last episodes really showed the heart of the show. The importance of family and friends, and the impact they have on us. On forgiveness, for others and for ourselves.

Before my considerations, I have to say that I'm happy that many things change since I made my first impressions. I'm glad that Kim Seon Ho could clarify the story that was leaked in such a careless way, but sad because the damage that this brought to him and to his ex-girlfriend is unmeasurable. A problem happened, people were hurt, and this impacted both of them. I'm cheering for Kim Seon Ho's recovery and really expect that this is the justice that many people (including me) were looking for. If you didn't read my first impressions, go for it: https://mydramalist.com/profile/8270201/feeds/47jqBiA.

If you are looking for a healing and soft drama, this was made for you. ""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" has the clich√© that we love so much in Dramaland and also a mature story for the ones who are tired of childish characters. I loved Hye Jin! At the first sight, I thought that I would hate her personality, but with the pass of the episodes, we can see a peculiar way that we don't see in many female leads. She is apparently superficial, but actually has a unique way to see the people and the world. The thing I loved the most about her was her facility to ask for forgiveness. We don't see this in many main characters. Shin Min Ah is so cute and so femme fatale at the same time! I love her since ""My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho"" and now is just another character of her that I really appreciate. Doo Shik was also pretty good to me, but I wanted a little more deepness in his character. His background was built with so much expectation, and I had the feeling that everything was solved too easily. Kim Seon Ho's great performance in cuteness is undeniably good, but I think that he shines better when it becomes deep drama. I hope that his next projects explore this.

The side characters were also pretty good. The story of Young Guk and Hwa Jeong made me melt into tears. Eun Chul and Mi Seon not so much. Ji Sung Hyun was the second lead that we love until the end, without craziness, evilness, and nothing that makes us angry. I cheer for him until the last second, not with Hye Jin, but with the OBVIOUS CHOICE (right???).

I'll give the position of pretty good to this one (‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ). It is a drama that will warm your heart and make you feel light and peaceful.

XOXO, Mari.

So relatable!
I simply loved this drama because it was so relatable. In other words, I could relate to both FL and ML as well as many of the other characters. Theirs were real situations and real reactions. We didn't have any tripping and falling into ML's arms or accidental kisses that frankly, never happen in real life. (If you have experienced or know someone who's experienced an accidental kiss by falling on top of each other, I apologize, but it's practically impossible without at least getting a bloody lip.) The romance was the slow burn kind and wasn't a bunch of hearts and flowers and unicorns. It was a mature meeting of souls and hearts, common to what you'd experience in real life. That's why the first word I'd use to describe this drama is relatable. The situations you're going to witness could happen in real life.

I could see myself in FL ‚Äì reserved, awkward around so many boisterous people, liking the finer things of life, unintentionally snobbish. I liked how the drama allowed her to have flaws, some of which were unpleasant but common. She was difficult to like at the beginning because of her city snobbiness. Even ML wavered back and forth between like and dislike. However, the viewer accepts her with her flaws just like the townspeople accept her. The only thing I didn't like about her was how she turned much too cutesy once she and ML were a couple. It was overdone in my opinion. The only thing she didn't do was pout like Chinese FLs. ML fell in love with you when you acted like a mature woman; why would he want you to suddenly turn into a little girl?

As for ML, I could understand his fear of allowing himself to love again, having lost so many loved ones in his life. I mean, heck, is this guy cursed or something? He lost far too many people ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt they have spared him losing Gam-Ri as well? But, I guess, the writer felt we needed to experience all of life in this small town by the sea. It was amusing how ML basically could do everything ‚Äì but dance. He had certificates for everything, a true jack of all trades, and I honestly felt there was no reason to change his preference for part time jobs and simplistic living. He wasn‚Äôt unemployed; he just made his living doing whatever was available, and by keeping his living simple, he didn‚Äôt need a lot of money. Not everyone defines life by a successful career. Some prefer a simple, peaceful life based on relationships. I liked how this drama didn't feel the need to turn Du-Sik into a man defined by his material wealth or professional ambition. I wish I were as brave as him. Seems like an idyllic life to me. And it was heart-warming in episode 15 how the town people had a hard time coping with their businesses when he secluded himself. It was also great how he and his love rival (Seong-Hyun) became good friends. A nice bromance.

Now, I'd like to comment on responsibility and blame. Du-Sik had a guilt complex. He blamed himself for everything. For example, he blamed himself for his grandfather‚Äôs death because he was out playing soccer when grandpa had a heart attack. Then he blamed himself for what happened during those 5 years in Seoul, which was not his fault at all. He was only coincidently involved because it was his job yet he received the blame (and accepted it) from the grieving family members. Why do these family members always have to find someone to blame rather than the person who‚Äôs really responsible? Gun-ho‚Äôs son viciously attacked ML, repeatedly calling him a bastard, yet the father (Gun-ho) was ultimately to blame for making the decision to invest in risky funds and then his attempted suicide. It wasn‚Äôt ML‚Äôs fault that the market crashed. He was even less to blame for his friend‚Äôs death yet the widow went off on him at the funeral. This blame game that relatives engaged in needs to stop in Korea and elsewhere. Sometimes crap happens, and nobody is directly to blame for it. It's just life. I was so angry at how Du-Sik was treated by these two families and even angrier when he willingly accepted the blame.

Poor Seong-Hyun ‚Äì he should have confessed to FL back in university since she had a crush on him at the time. I really feel bad for these male love rivals who hesitate and then end up losing the girl. Seong-Hyun was a real sweetie and even more outgoing than ML. I really didn‚Äôt want him matched with Ms. Wang in the end. I don‚Äôt know why some writers think everyone needs to be paired off for a drama to have a happy ending. MC couple, yes, but other couples/characters, no.

I congratulate the writer/director for being able to juggle a supporting cast of 10+ characters. It was done effectively with each character adding to the overall story. At no time did it feel like there were too many characters since each had a part to play, and they didn‚Äôt distract from the MC at all. A Chinese drama wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do this. I would love to comment on each character, but I haven‚Äôt the time or space to do that so I‚Äôll just mention my favorite of the group ‚Äì the little boy, I-Jun. He was just such a mature kid and his little childhood romance was so cute. It‚Äôs obvious that when he and Bo-Ra grow up, they‚Äôre going to be a couple. Koreans love the childhood connection thing.

Speaking of childhood connections ‚Äì I loved how ML/FL met each other throughout their lives in various situations. I also liked how at the end of each episode, there‚Äôs a short scene expanding on something that‚Äôs happened earlier. It allowed the viewer a peek into motivations and actions.

This is definitely a drama worth watching. It‚Äôll make you laugh, cry and just feel really good about living in a small town. Plus, it‚Äôs so nice to see a drama set outside a city (Seoul). I wish more dramas would be set in the countryside rather than the city.

P.S. I also loved the 'la la la' song!

Impressive actings
First time rating a drama on MDL because I'm full of emotion from the show and from the incident of KSH in real life.
Re-watching ep 16 and I appreciated the drama more. It is simple yet it is beautiful in its own way. The scene of the wedding photoshoot with every Gongjin character appears one by one (except Gamri) is beautiful, warm and full of happiness. Sikhye happiness is truly undetachable with all Gongjin ppl. At first impression they are the most nosy humans in the world but deep inside they care and love with purest intention. It is a fairy tale unlike in the real world where ppl's act are driven by a lot of motives and however long I think I can't figure out why they act that way.
I'm more of a rom-com type than slice-of-life type. I can't bring myself to watch Reply or Hospital playlists despite all the praises. I watched this for the actor but surprisedly like it.
I recall many good memories along watching the show. Almost no dramatic scenes except ep 15. As simple as the scenes are, quite a few of them like in ep 5, they solve math and play in the rain, in ep 10 the confession and in ep 16 when Hyejin says she stay because she loves and belongs to this place and Dusik hugs her, pushed my emotion so high I repeated those scene countless times I didn't even know why. In the beginning I couldn't quite feel Dusik and how he acted but after ep 15 with a good cry everything seemed to make sense, there are some things I can relate to myself as well.

I've found a few gem actors/actresses in this drama:
- The coffee shop owner Oh Joon Jae: I've never watched him before. Some ppl do not like ep 2 but i like it very much. I feel his story, the way he portrays the awkwardness and doubt about himself and in the end find hope again. He's the one who opens the door to Gongjin tales. And the real actor must be good-hearted and brave to be the first among Homecha team to secretly support KSH.
- Hwa jung and I jun: every scene between mother and son got me teary-eyed. She made me recall her role in Sweet home as a mother as well. Also the scene where she's hurt by her husband despite being the most loving and thoughtful wife broke my heart. The child actor is also a genius.
- The chinese restaurant owner Nam sook: she has weird look and annoying character but along the show we learn her hidden story, not only we sympathy but also grow to like her. Hwa jung and Nam sook both can't be called pretty yet I find two of them charming in their roles.
- Ji PD: I also find his appearance not attractive so it's a disadvantage compared to Hong ban jang but the actor has this cuteness and sincere about him. I like his face expression every time Dusik mocks him about something.

I have to admit some points many ppl criticize about this drama, they also bug me a lot: some cliches, too many unembarressing product placements, too cringy in ep 11-12 but between these there are beautiful scenes created by talented actors/actresses.
The OSTs are not incredible if it they stand on their own but they are put perfectly on the show, suit every scene they serve and shift harmoniously as the show progresses, from happy ""Romantic Sunday"" to blue and soulful ""Wish"" and other songs.

Lastly, a few words for my male lead. He has shortcomings, like all dramas he acted in have shortcomings. There are a few k-dramas i like much more than his dramas, but none of the actors from those dramas have ever made me feel like he made me in his scenes. When he acts, in his eye I see emotions, empathy and sadness. I've read plenty of his past interviews and the latest ARENA interview which he gives insight to Dusik character. I think if any of you are interested in the show, watch it first, then read his interview and second time, rewatch some eps that you liked, perhaps you will discover something that you missed the first time. With all my bias I rate the drama a 9.
No controversies could alter my impression as a devoted actor. If he's a good actor and a decent human being, that will make me super happy. But if he happens to be not so good a man, his actings that makes me believe such thing must on another level amaze me.

HONESTLY....
Let's be real. This drama wasn't perfect. In fact, it was far from it. But I don't think it deserves to be hated just because it's ""mainstream"" or ""too many people watch it"" and my personal favorite, ""just because of those dang dimples"" . If you didn't like it, or some parts of it, at least state some actual reasons as to WHY. So here's my take on it:

Negatives:
Firstly, that summary really doesn't prepare you for what's in store when you start watching, so I felt kind of deceived. By reading the summary, it makes it seem that Hye Jin is the character we need to watch out for, or focus on but actually it's not. Well, it was based on a movie called ""Mr. Hong"" which never really occurred to me, so I guess I should have expected that.

Second, there were so many events/conflicts that were introduced, but in the end became so disjointed from the main plot. Some of these had so much potential but they weren't utilized well, and it just pushed back the main plot up to the last 3/4 episodes. They became scattered fragments of a story that were left forgotten, strewn all around the main plot. I've seen this pattern in some dramas before, and I must say I always get disappointed when it happens, ESPECIALLY when the first few episodes were so darn good.

And third, with the same train of thought as the paragraph before this, I felt like we were just fed good moments, fluff, cute bickering, interesting plot and main conflicts, during the first half of the drama, just to make us stay. Just to please us with fanservice and the typical plot lines that makes fans squeal in delight, without actually progressing the story. Just giving us small glimpses every now and then, but it just kept getting pushed back.

Well, these were my reasons as to why I couldn't give it a perfect 10. But still, I do believe that it doesn't deserve anything less than a 7, at the least.

Positives:
Honestly, Hye Jin is probably my favorite FL so far. She was fairly consistent throughout. She showed growth as an individual, but managed to retain her morals, her beliefs, and her personality, despite being in an environment that may have shamed and disliked it at first. She knows what she wants, and she does what she needs to do to get it. She's unapologetic with her taste and her interests, which is so empowering as a woman. Definitely my favorite character (after I-jun of course ?)

Speaking of I-jun, I honestly LOVED the side characters and the cast!!! They played the characters so well, special shout out to I-jun and Cho Hui!!! Both characters were so well thought out and well played, and even though they didn't have as much screen time as the others, every time they were on screen my eyes were glued to them. So good! The side characters all had their moments to shine, and I really loved learning about them. Though I do admit that their stories took up so much time, which I believe caused the main plot to be pushed to the side. Still, I really do love the chemistry of all the characters.

***this is where the SPOILER is***

Third, I absolutely LOVE the fact that they made Chief Hong a normal human being. I'm glad that they didn't make him some kind of prodigy in engineering or mathematics (w/c was what I was expecting, tbh), or some kind of unexplainably lucky man that suddenly rose to power. As he said, he was just a normal person with a desk job. I love it. I love how realistic that part is. He was just a guy who studied engineering, but got an unrelated job because of a sunbae who helped him out. Honestly, it happens to the most of us, and this is just one tiny detail but IDK man, I really appreciated that.

So okay, this drama isn't perfect at all. It has plot holes, missed opportunities, it overused the leads' chemistry, and it pushed the main plot to the side at some point. But wow it was fun to watch! Sometimes when I have absolutely nothing to do, I remember some cute and funny scenes and I would immediately come back to watch it again. It's gives you a warm feeling and I'm really going to miss that warmth every weekend. La la lalala lalalala~

The Most Refreshing Rom-Com of 2021
Before the release of Hometown Cha Cha Cha, we watched K-Dramas such as Penthouse, Nevertheless, etc., and this was such a refreshing break from the genres that were airing. It's reminiscent of the old 2015-2018 rom-coms I watched and dearly loved, but instead of teenagers, they're actually adults (34F and 35M) which I am so thankful for. The main couple has great chemistry with one another and I can't help feel like a teenage girl squealing at every scene with the both of them together. I love the city girl and country boy trope too, so I already love them together. Plot-wise, as of now, the pacing is great. Music-wise, the intro is also refreshing. I can't help but keep using the word refreshing in this review, but that's what this drama is. I'll return and update the drama after it ends, but so far, it's one of my favorites.

A really heart warming story uwu
I had watched the movie before so this drama is actually a modified version of the movie. To be honest, the drama is much much better than the movie.The movie didn't have this much of story-telling and I felt there were a few scenes where I couldn't understand the reason or plot behind it.....but the drama was really amazing, the grandmas were so cute and the child actors did such a brilliant job!! And the main characters were relatable too and the story telling and set-up was smooth and amazing. Kim Seon Ho as good as always...osts were also pretty good...the dimple couple really melted my heart......overall definitely a recommendable drama <3.

Wholesome
This is one of those KDramas that is light and easy to watch. It doesn't leave you feeling like you just got off of an emotional rollercoaster, instead, it leaves you feeling happy, interested, and excited for the next episode. It has a very wholesome feel to it that makes it sort of addicting. I highly recommend it! definitely good for first-timers! It is easy to get into the story and feel attached to the characters. The acting is good but the music choice isn't my favorite, unfortunately, I feel like they could have done better here. (Sorry)I just didn't care for the intro/outro much.

Healing story that makes your heart mealt
This show is absolutely amazing. I only started watching it because of Kim seon oh, since I really enjoyed his performance in Start up, but from the first five minutes I was hooked. As someone who often feels lost in life, I can assure you this drama does a great job in portraying the feeling of starting over, of making mistakes, accepting them and trying to be better. It gives you hope, and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. The main leads are incredible, their chemistry is over the top and the dynamic between the two of them feels very real and healthy from the start. The villagers are also one of the things that make this drama so special, they're really a big family who support each other through everything, and they also add a lot of comic relief. I haven't finished the series, I'll make a better review once I do but, for now, the only thing I can say is, if you're feeling down, if you need a spark of warmth and happiness in your life, please give this drama a shot, it will be your cure.

A warm, healing slice of life drama
After draining my mind and heart with Squid games and One and Only, I just need something warm, a slice of life drama, so I‚Äôm checking out ‚ÄùHometown Cha Cha Cha‚Äù. Because of ML‚Äôs recent scandal, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to complete the last two episodes of the drama, but I think it‚Äôs still fair enough to wrap up the review.
The script is nothing new. It is a story of Oh Hye Jin, an uptown girl with a promising professional career in Seoul, but had to move to remote seashore area in Gongjin to start her new life. There she met Hong Du Shik, an unemployed man, but kind and skillful, is willing to do any kind of job to help out the people in the village. He also had his hidden past and is trying to move on and live his simple life.
Oh Hye Jin is nice, but also cold toward people. She is straightforward, calculative and practical. She has a sense of upholding justice and does not sweet talk or sugarcoat. And because of that, there was some misunderstanding and she did not leave good impression on people.
However, with the help of Du Shik, people in town started to recognize the different warm side of Hye Jin, and she got to learn to open herself, understand that ‚Äúlife is not always fair to all people and thus everyone has his own stories and difficult time‚Äù.
When watching Hometown Cha Cha Cha, it reminds me of my hometown where both definitely has cultural similarity. People in town know each other. They gather together to eat, cook and gossip, but at the same time they help each other to overcome life challenging.
Aside from our main leads, the story also emphasize on side characters. Their daily stories and challenging they emphasize were truly reflecting realities that one may see them through their characters. We learn to appreciate our partners, to nurture parents-children relationship, to have good parenting and understanding our future generations.
I especially love our side couples Mi-Seon and Eun-Chul. Their cute interaction and confession always make me laugh and giggle.
Mi-Seon and Hye Jin friendship is truly golden, and that is one that everyone could wish for.
Overall it is a good slice of life drama though there are some clingy moment, and the music is just okay.

Boring, mediocre, easily forgettable
I started watching this drama few months ago, and I dropped it after the first few minutes. Then I came back and I was ready to give it another go, and somehow I ended up on episode 11. Let me be clear, the plot is not strong enough for the amount of episodes,the unnecessary long and boring scenes that are easily skippable, pointless dramas and what not.
The leads were alright,not the biggest fan. The acting was alright but some parts were cringey.
At least I liked the music. I guess that was the only thing that was not boring and pointless.
Other than that, this is a easily forgotten drama, especially through being uninteresting or mediocre.

An enjoyable beachside romance
This drama is not overrated in the slightest.

I‚Äôm not one for romantic comedies especially in a small town setting but this one has a special place in my heart. I‚Äôll share about what was really enjoyable for me and what I felt could‚Äôve been better.

- CHIEF HONG

Every episode was interesting for me and the humour was OUT OF THIS WORLD. No seriously, shut up I‚Äôve never laughed so hard my entire life. I loved, loved and LOVED chief hong‚Äôs character. The way he managed everything in the small town and had so many official licenses. He was so cheerful and charming that I couldn‚Äôt help but adore him even if I personally am not a fan of Kim Seon Ho. His character had so much substance and humour. Plus, his interactions with grandmother was so touching and tear jerking. When he piggybacked her and that boyish laugh he let out‚Ä¶God, I was done for. When I learnt about his past and what he had gone through in Seoul, it was the only time I ever cried with a character. His backstory wasn‚Äôt what moved me but more of the way he finally let out his bottled up emotions and dropped the act. Goes to show that behind every smile, there really is something more.

- THE VILLAGERS

Every form of entertainment came from them. The three grandmothers, Bora and her family, the divorced couple with their son. All of them made a lasting impression with their funny interactions and bittersweet moments. Personally, I liked the little boy whose name I can‚Äôt seem to recall the most. He was so mature for his age and when he cried, it really stuck with me.

- THE PLOT

There wasn‚Äôt a lot of drama because this was a lighthearted watch and the events that took place were quite trivial, with occasional conflicts here and there getting resolved fast. It wasn‚Äôt entirely based on the main lead‚Äôs romance because most of their interactions were centred around things happening in the town. The main ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù or ‚Äúclimax‚Äù was really discovering about Chief Hong‚Äôs tragic backstory. Other than that, everything was enjoyable and realistic.

- THE FEMALE LEAD

Yes. I understand that in the end, there was character development but her personality thoroughly annoyed me even until the very end. She wasn‚Äôt excessive or anything but her disdain towards her was very apparent and I didn‚Äôt like how she had to rely on Chief Hong to save her ass. BUT what I did like was how realistic and refreshing her character was at the same time. Sounds contradictory but hear me out. Despite how difficult the dentist was at first and how rude she was to her neighbours, I couldn‚Äôt help but relate to her in some ways and find bits of myself in her reactions. I liked how honest and upfront she was about her feelings but yet, she also felt apologetic when she knew she was in the wrong. Her character isn‚Äôt perfect or ideal to say the least but that‚Äôs the part that moved me the most.

- THE TEMPORARY LOVE TRIANGLE

It wasn‚Äôt much of a love triangle but rather a history between the dentist and her ex classmate who after so long, still pined for her but respectfully did so. It was an unrequited love and a matter of bad timing and I do like how unlike some typical seconds leads who spend their entire lives in a one-sides love, this man got a decent ending of his own. It wasn‚Äôt rushed or anything but a slow matter of healing from his first love and embracing a new one. It felt natural and refreshing.

I‚Äôll now be moving on to the parts which I personally didn‚Äôt like but didn‚Äôt find unbearable to watch.

- THE (CRINGE) PARTS

My cringe tolerance is very, very low so rest assured it‚Äôs probably won‚Äôt be cringe for you. Just throwing this out there. I was up to my neck when they took pictures in school uniforms and the female lead was constantly whining or shrieking in ways that‚Ä¶bothered me. Some parts were okay, quite sweet but it felt overdone a little. I won‚Äôt say much but yes, that is my take on the romance and if you enjoyed it, don‚Äôt let my opinion spoil your enjoyment :)

- THE GRANDMA DID NOT NEED TO PASS AWAY

Yes. There was already enough going on what with Chief‚Äôs Hong past getting revealed and his backstory. I was praying hard that the grandma would not die when she said those sad things before sleeping and it broke me when she didn‚Äôt wake up the next morning. I felt it would‚Äôve been better if she had at least seen Chief Hong come out of his house before she passed on because the last time she went to visit him was to leave him corn on his doorstep .

Overall, this was a lighthearted drama with hilarious scenes and a perfect beachside romance. It‚Äôs something like crash landing on you with the village camaraderie and all but very different in a way. A must-watch if you‚Äôre an emotional person!

NO SPOILERS!! - the most heartwarming drama ever! perfect for relaxation. MUST WATCH!!
Even if you don't enjoy light-hearted dramas, this drama is still definitely worth watching once in your lifetime. Here are some clarifications to help you out! NO, this is not one of those ""cheesy"" dramas that make no sense and have no character development! NO, this drama is not cliche! There are parts where you can anticipate what happens next, but they're not really related to the romantic aspect of this drama. Now, onto the reviews of separate aspects!

For the romance aspect, this drama is definitely heavy. It's pretty centered on romantic relationships and progressions, but it's WELL WRITTEN! And very much realistic! The pacing is perfect, it's not a slowburn that makes you bored out of your mind, it's not so fast that it makes no sense, it's perfect. Of course, they come around hardships, but those hardships are very realistic, and you see them in the real world too. They also MAKE SENSE.

Next, the characters! Each and every character in this drama was written carefully and beautifully, from the townspeople to the children to the main leads. You can see each character's past and connect it with their actions in the present, and I really love that. It's not like the writers are trying to make some petty excuse for a villain's rampage. This drama shows traumas, pains, and most importantly, of course, realism. Personally, I value the realness of dramas, which is why I love this drama so much. It really connects with the real world, which made me extremely emotional while watching. I'll probably write another review with spoilers because I really cannot get over each character's stories. I will tell you here and now, however, that the female lead makes sense. She is not stupid. She breaks many stereotypes. She has a healthy relationship mindset. She is strong mentally, and her instincts and common sense are perfectly intact. I love that about her. The male lead is well written. He is not a jerk, hell no, he is an absolute sweetheart! His character has a lot of depth, and his thoughts and actions make sense. The second male lead is also very worth praising! He also has a loooot of depth. He has reasons for having feelings for our female lead, and he is not just there as a nuisance. Personally, I did not feel bad for him because while he has an amazing personality, so does the male lead. This is one of the very few dramas I've seen where both male leads make sense, and the male lead overpowers the second male lead. The second male lead's confession was straightforward, the female lead's rejection was also straightforward, and it's just *chef's kiss*. I love it.

Alright, the ACTING! Please, oh my god, the cast is insane. It's perfect. Kim Seonho as such a flexible range, and his microexpressions are really well depicted. You can see him reminisce about the past with a hint of sadness in his eyes. He gets that teary-eyed look when he uses expressions of affection, and most of these are similar to Shin Min-ah's acitng style as well! They are both amazing actors. I really love Shin Min-ah's voice. It's very relaxing. I also really feel the need to praise the townspeople's acting. They have such amazing duality, and they really go all out. I don't why, but a lot of times, the side characters have better acting than the leads. In this case, the leads' acting falls just a tiny bit short of the side characters. But the leads' acting is not at all bad! The side characters are just phenomenal.

Slice-of-life aspect: Apart from all the romance and stuff, what made me most emotional was how realistic this drama was. As the synopsis states, our female lead, Yoon Hyejin, moves to a small seaside town named Gongjin due to some personal issues. Now, the town Gongjin is very well depicted. They live traditionally, but you still see hints of modern-ness around. Like Juri stanning a K-pop group and the presence of technology. It's not like she went to the stone age, so I appreciate the realness of it. It's hard to write about this without spoiling anything major, but I'll just say that I really respect the authors of this drama for the realism. I love it when things are realistic but spicy.

Lastly, personal opinions. Personally, I tested positive for Covid and was quarantining, so I thought I'd watch this drama because I've seen it around a lot. And at first, I thought it was a cheesy cliche drama, haha! But I was watching Lawless Lawyer, and I got a little tired of all the scheming and stuff. I appreciated the romance in Lawless Lawyer, but like... I didn't really want to watch two people being affectionate when there's people trying to murder them all around. So, I sought out something more light-hearted, and tada! I ended up with Hometown Cha Cha Cha. And I am honestly so, SO glad I decided to watch it. I actually pulled through with it, because it got interesting right after the first episode, and it just kept getting more interesting. No disappointments whatsoever, at least for me. I think I'll end it here, HAHA. I rambled off. All in all, this is definitely worth watching. I gave it a low rewatch value because I still haven't recovered from crying my eyeballs out over it, but I know I'm definitely going to rewatch some parts, maybe even the whole thing. I just love it so much. Be sure to check it out!

A Good Rom-Com Series!! Will surely make you fall in Love ‚ù§
a good rom-com series to watch ! loved the chemistry between the female & male lead in this series. besides, the overall theme of the series was interesting & really good. moreover, the side characters were also given the appropriate time to show their acting skills n they were good too.... a little over the top i would say, because there are some elements that we don't see around us usually, like - the town helping n caring for you while leaving their work behind as if their works isnt important. but hey , besides that the series is definitely a good to series to watch n will definitely recommend it!!!

Perfect Chemistry In This Touching Opposites Attract Series!
We've seen a lot of opposite atracts shows, series, and films, but not many of them are drawn up quite so wonderfully and heartfelt as this one. Much of the success of this series has to go to Mina Shin and Seon-Ho Kim with their incredible chemistry.

Dr. Yoon (Mina Shin) is a successful dentist who loves living the good life full of fancy clothes, expensive cars, and everything else that goes with high-end living. She makes no apologies for her lifestyle. Perhaps it's because she's really known nothing else.

Upon leaving her job, due to conflict with her boss, Yoon leaves for the small seaside town of Gongjin. The last place she felt happy as a child. There, she meets Chief Hong, a man who seems capable of doing literally everything! He works a slew of jobs, all for minimum wage. In short, he enjoys the simple life of service.

Of course, at first, these two opposites do not get on very well. Yoon finds herself stranded in the town on her first day without money or even able to get funds due to a power outage. She's soon at the mercy of Chief Hong, who ends up putting her to work pulling the guts out of squid with the local women. You can only imagine how well Yoon is able to adapt.

Without a job and a town without a dentist, Dr. Yoon decides to open up a dental clinic. The series is much about Yoon learning to appreciate a different lifestyle that is very different from anything she's ever experienced. This, of course, includes Yoon learning how to be a team player and adapt to the locals as well as the town itself. ""Grandma"" Gam-ri all but steals the show and our hearts.

As you can imagine, Yoon and Chief Hong soon become attracted to each other. However, Hong has a dark past that he soon finds is catching up with him. The question becomes: will his past destroy things with Dr. Yoon before they've even started?

Dr. Yoon represents those people who can only think about themselves. She comes off initially as fussy and conceited. However, the longer she spends in Gongjin, we see her begin to learn how to love and appreciate others. And Mina Shin has that million dollar smile and those golden dimples to brighten our days with!

Chief Hong is a man who is a complete opposite. He thinks mostly of others, even at the expense of himself. In short, he doesn't believe himself to be truly worthy. And he has no idea just how much he's loved and adored by the people of Gongjin.

Both are two sides of the same coin. Both have to learn how to adapt. You cannot love others without first loving yourself. And you cannot love others at the expense of yourself either.

Of course, as Chief Hong's secret is uncovered, only those who see him for who he is--by his constant example of a man with a good heart--we know that he was not responsible for what happened. Those unable to forgive him are simply cowards who decide that it's easier to play the role of the victim rather than take any responsibility. I was slightly disappointed in Dr. Yoon's reaction to him; that she didn't seem to know him nearly as well as those he's lived with in Gongjin. Everyone else tried to check up on him. She didn't. It's easy to be there for someone when things are good. It's challenging--and even more important--to be there for someone when things are difficult. Also, one should never put pressure on someone to reveal that which they are not ready to tell. Yoon was quite selfish in her demands. Fortunately, she wisely realizes her mistake and tells Chief Hong that he can tell her when he's ready.

We get a lot of laugh out loud moments as well as some truly touching ones that are sure to tug at your heart. Koreans are masters of incorporating both elements into their stories. The people of Gongjin will surely warm your heart and perhaps make you even wish that you lived in such a community!

All in all, this is a fantastic and delightful series! I loved and adored all sixteen episodes! And it's proof that you can have good and likeable characters still, in world that seems to want to bombard us with dark ones. This show was refreshing like a wonderful day at the beach, which only made me wanting even more!

A few flaws but still refreshing
I knew I would like this drama since the beginning and they really captivated me. I mean, how can we not be captivated by such cute village? Gongjin village really made me wanna visit and live there. And the characters here are really charismatic too, with only a few ones that I found irritating. Let‚Äôs talk more about them and the drama‚Äôs story below.

First, Dusik is probably one of the best male characters of the year. I loved this man SO SO MUCH he was so real and a perfect mix of a cutie and a intelligent wise man. Hyejin on the other side was difficult to love at first because the way she treated Dusik was pretty annoying. But she got better in the half of the drama and I liked how she was there for Dusik when he really needed as he was there for her when she needed too. And althought I think she was annoying in some scenes, I still found her character relatable in many others. The couple omg‚Ä¶I DIED IN ALL THEIR SCENES!!! They had such a good chemistry, I loved them. As the other characters, I really liked them especially the grandma, Hyejin‚Äôs friend, the policemen, Sung Hyun, Chun Jae and his daughter. Actually the kids here was amazing I loved all of them. I need to talk more about Sung Hyun because it was such a lovely character. I liked how he respected Hyejin‚Äôs decision and made a friendship with Dusik. I hate love triangles in dramas so I really liked this. The only characters I found annoying was Nam Seok and Yeon Duk. At least Nam Seok got better later‚Ä¶which I can‚Äôt say the same about Yeon Duk because I still didn‚Äôt liked him even in the end.

Talking now about the story, it‚Äôs pretty simple actually but I was really addicted, maybe because it‚Äôs a refreshing environment with a lot of different characters. But I can‚Äôt lie, some things bothered me a little and I got the ‚Äúit could have been better‚Äù feeling. Dusik‚Äôs past for example. For me, I had the feeling that everything happened too fast and it was resolved too fast too. And I don‚Äôt know if it was only me but Hwa Jeong and Yeon Duk getting back together too was so ‚Äú?‚Äù for me I HATED! Maybe because I didn‚Äôt liked this character but it seemed too forced for me. Other thing that made me really angry was grandma death. I think the writers wanted Dusik to see death as a thing it‚Äôs not related to him but seriously he could have seen that without making the grandma die. For me it was such a needless move, and it was done in the last episode too which seemed a little forced as well.

Besides these flaws, I still liked this drama. Gongjin‚Äôs scenery, the cultural, the local food, the characters, everything in this drama it‚Äôs really refreshing and if you like dramas that are focused on people living their daily lifes I really recommend this. Hometown Cha Cha Cha it‚Äôs a refreshing and healing drama and for sure it‚Äôs going to be remembered .

PS: I loved the OST as well for sure It‚Äôs going be one of my favorites of the year.

Enjoyable rom-com with with slice of life
I enjoyed Hometown Cha Cha Cha, this drama was a very good Rom-com drama that had sweet likeable characters with the leads and all of the villagers. It had sweet, sad, and tragic moments within the drama. I cried during the last few episodes. I liked all of the friendships within the villagers and how they were all there for each other. I didn't binge watch this, this was one of those drama's that I enjoyed relaxing and watching , and smiling at the those adorable dimples on our leads! This was also a slice of life drama that when it was over I felt like I was missing friends and families.

Something different, relatable and refreshing..
I love the story, though not perfect but it is fan to watch. Every episode has a lesson to teach. And each characters' stories are inspiring.

I love how Actors portrayed their roles. Each characters are important and each of them did amazing.

At first, I hate Hyejin's character. She's just too much. But as the story goes, you'll understand why she's like that. Chief Hong's character is so lovable. No one can hate him, he is every girl's dream. He's just too kind. But the characters I really love are Ijun and Ji PD. Ijun is just a kid but his acting and his role is super cute and I really love how mature he is. Ji PD is just so kind, the bromance between him and Chief Hong so cute.

What I am kind of disappointed was the last 2 episodes. They could have made it better. But I think it is the Director's style to drop everything in the last episodes. Anyway, overall I enjoyed it.

Acting genius
The chemistry the storyline the acting the cast the production, everything about this drama is superb! Not a typical love story!

This drama shows how healthy a relationship is, no matter it‚Äôs a man woman relationship, parents child relationship, friendship, neighbors, one sided love, everything! Everything is so healthy! Everyone should watch!

The chemistry between the cast, main cast and supporting cast, they did such a very splendid work! This drama really worth your time!

Acting genius for main casts because of their nonstop adlibs. The whole story felt so smooth and calm, thanks to acting genius Shin Minah and Kim Seonho!

A drama that can make its viewers feel a myriad of emotions. And plus points for high rewatch value!
If there's one thing I can say about this drama, it's that ""by the time you finish it, it feels like home.""

The characters and the Gongjin setting are HCCC's biggest strengths, imo. From the first two episodes itself, it sucked me in with the variety among the characters we see- kind and caring but kinda stuck-up Hye-jin, handy-man Mr. Hong who goes around doing odd jobs for people, and of course, the Gongjin folks. I hardly ever rewatch dramas, but this one was a wonderful exception- I rewatched it straight-away after the drama finished airing! And I have feeling I'll be rewatching again, sometime soon.

The lead actors' chemistry has to be one of the best ones I've seen in a while. Be it their playful banter, or bickering, or being all cutesy while dating, to the sad scenes.. it all felt so unforced and natural. Especially the cutesy scenes were so SO adorable to watch, I couldn't help but squeal. The love triangle was handled excellently (and healthily) as well, and the bromance between the two male leads was just * chef's kiss *.

If there's any complaints I have about HCCC, it's probably the way the reveal of Du-sik's backstory was handled. The build-up to it felt a bit too long, and it would have been nice if at least two episodes were focused on it, instead of wrapping it all in episode 15. The show still delivered though, and considering the reveal happened in a single episode, it was handled really well! And while I do think it could have been done better, I still loved it. haha.

To anyone who wants a fun little rom-com with a good punch of the feels added to it, just jump right in. You won't regret it. <3

Warm-hearted. Highly recommended with all of my heart!
When I was at the middle of the first episode, my heart has already put 10/10 score for this drama. It might be too early to say that but I was never disappointed after finishing all eps.

Thanks to all the cast & crew who worked hard on this drama. I really enjoyed it. I laugh a lot & cry more. it's not a sad story but the story is about lives. People around ml&fl have their own stories and destiny chained them together. They went through all thick & thin, solved their problems e.g. mental health, family, relationships. All characters have been developed very well.

I feel like some parts of this drama may hit viewers' hearts. Some stories may be similar to someone's. I also feel familiar with some parts of them. That's why I cried a lot because it reminded of my own stories and it healed me. One of the most favorite things about this drama is warm-hearted dialogue. I like many of them. I will rewatch it to read those dialogues again and again, I hope those can help me on both good & bad days. I searched for the writer's name to say thanks (in my head). The series, written by Shin Ha-eun, so thank you for your hard work.

Sweet hometown romance
Beautiful sea, a lighthouse, seaside hometown, chaotic neighbors, amazing friendship, cute romance and lots and lots of sweet and touching moments sums up this drama.

This drama is based around the lives of people in a small seaside town. The ML is a jack of all trades who is the life of the town, and the FL is a skilled but impulsive dentist from Seoul who moves to a small town for a fresh start. The drama is sweet, cute, romantic and touching. Some of the side characters were a bit unbelievable but they complimented the drama nicely.

The chemistry between the two leads was great and it was great to watch the development between them. The whole process seemed smooth and it flowed naturally and didn't seem that forced. Things did seem a bit forced at the last few episodes but it was bearable.

Speaking of bearable one thing that was a bit unbearable was the blatant and frequent product placements. But as k-drama viewers it is a curse we are fated to bear. But it was a bit too much in this one imo.

The story was quite good. Even though it wasn't ground breaking story the story flow was quite good and kept things interesting and made me look forward to what happens next.

The music was beautiful. There weren't too many songs but the ones they had went nicely with the whole thing.

The actors were nicely cast specially the few important characters were quite good and did a superb job. Shin Min Ah was beautiful in her character and Kim Seon Ho seemed perfect for the male lead's character.

This drama was very good. For people who likes sweet rom-coms this is definitely a good watch.

Finished this kdrama and definitely recommend!!!!!!
The character development... Just the way everything felt so realistic and so unique is just everything!! Honestly every time Netflix realised a new episode I couldn't wait to wait and scream whenever I had to wait s few days.
The ending was satisfying but I wish to see a season two to see their lives with two kids XD
I cried because I could relate to the story of Du-sik and Mrs Gam-ri's son when he cried around her funeral.
Honestly, this is one of the best k-dramas I've ever watched.

At first it didn't look as good because hyejin had that bratty attitude people didn't like but around the end of the series her character changed a sweet but yet stubborn character which I liked.
I was so curious of Du-sik's life and what happened to him as he was secretive and introverted than he looked.
He.... Really reminds me of myself, also keeping it in and not telling people what I go through everyday that's why whenever the scene of du-sik cries or struggles; I cry on the screen feeling so related to him.
Kim seonho did well on this character and how his character opened up to someone he can trust and love.

I LOVEEEEE the actors and actresses in this k-drama, not only you see the story of the main characters.... But you get each of the characters story and how they get to resolve the problem they faced.
I love the town people, because they were like one happy family. Always there for each other everyday and all the time.
Always sharing their emotions to one another

I loved miseon and euncheols relationship!!! Wish to see a literal drama of them XD
I definitely recommend this K-drama, it's realistic, relatable, down to earth and just sweet.

average not as lighthearted as I thought | some hypocrisy for drama
Life is too short for stressful drama. Why spend all that time watching and be stressed? Don‚Äôt our lives already provide enough of that?

Summary of the series:
- Not as Light hearted as I wanted from a rom/com; series had slow sections
- simpatico characters
- there weren't villains but more like distractions to add stress, there are some short struggles, calamity and miscommunications to cause more drama and some stress
- seems like they gave stress to the FL in the beginning and to the ML at the end; the beginning I had to skip since they made it so hard for the FL; the end they threw in the kitchen sink for ML in the last 2 episodes to close it out
- story was ok, simple; FL is pretty straight forward, ML is a vocal clear to the point character but cant speak of his past; they needed to create the drama here with some hypocrisy
- as you can see, the show squeezed all the ML story to the end, so you can imagine how rush the ending is and basically no enjoyment really after they get together except a few scenes here and there

still some joyful parts, some stress and slowness for this series: recommended to watch if this fits you; its not a rewatch for me for sure but good to watch once if you have watch the better ones

Like a hot cup of tea on a cold winter evening!!!
So I finished watching this just now and it took me just 36 hours to complete this ...the way I binged it..I started this show with no expectations at all.. I had heard about it and saw the rating quite high here on mdl so decided to watch 1 episode to test it and then 36 hours later here I am!! Words cannot describe how much I loved this show!! I can go on and on about the story acting direction etc but that is true for many other shows especially Kdramas..what made it stand out for me was the way it made me feel...like I am going through something right now personally and this show just calmed me and made me feel so warm from inside ...ultimate comfort watch!! I cannot give it a higher praise than this!! I could not find one fault in the show..like come at me me with a criticism and I'm sure I will be able to defend it!!! Kudos to the entire team!! Also thanks to this show for introducing me to the most adorable cutie pie/sexy man Kim Seon Ho!! 20/10

I like it
I've always liked Shin Min Ah. She's been acting for a while now and I've always felt she's been ahead of her time and this was a very good performance from her. Her character development was beautiful to watch. Even though she wasn't exactly who she was at the beginning compared to the end, she was still who she was. It's not like one of those dramas whereby someone's love interest completely changes their personalities, interests, likes, dreams etc. There was a bit of that but there's a balance to it.

The male lead did a good job as well. Not a job another actor may not have done better but he was decent. However as I watched I kept thinking to myself ""wow, this guy is too good to be true"" and that is exactly why I loved the character. The reason we love stories and clich√©s is because the characters do not only reflect who we are but they also show what we want to be.

I love shows with communities that yare bound together by love and loyalty be it family, friends, neighbourhoods etc and this show has a great collection of characters that deliver that. It was boring to watch.

Definitely recommended. Good laughs. Tears. A bit of mystery. Good show.

I'm you and you've become me
I loved it!!!!! Everything about this series is amazing! From the story (though it's a remake of a movie), characters, actors/actress, sceneries, lines, OST, and just plainly camaraderie of everyone involved in making this wonderful series.

Every episodes are relatable, not far-fetched, well-acted, deliveries of lines, character's development and side stories are all heart warming, tear-jerking, sweet, funny, frustrating and just simply what it's claiming, a healing series.

Actors/actress gave their best, delivered their lines, showed us how to react: whether to cry, smile, squel, laugh, get angry, frustrated and just simply enjoy the series. I'm always a fan of Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon-Ho, and was happy with this great pairing.

I will miss my ""Shik-Hye"" couple and everyone in Gongjin neighborhood. It's like I've become a member of the community and now I'm saying goodbye to them.

Also, I love the OST of this series. I've downloaded it already so I can listen to it whenever I want to.

Anyway, if you haven't watch it yet, you better start it now. Definitely worth the time and effort!

A breath of fresh air!!
I can finally breathe after watching the final episode! So full of life and rich characters and story plots. Absolutely love it!! A romantic comedy that is also full of drama! Real life drama! I love it as the themes of love and friendship spans across age and the script confronted well the complex feelings of grief, guilt and regret!

It gives so much hope to the darkness of life and offers the possibility of fate and luck that brings people and life together again!

I will recommend this 1000% and will definitely watch again many more times!!! Well done!

Diamond in the rough
At first I didn't plan to watch this drama. But suddenly I started watching it when the airing started. The main thing that I want to share is that ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". This drama is the perfect example of this phrase. We all have watched many supernatural, horror, thriller kdramas, but if you want something out of the box then I recommend to watch ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha"". The story is simple and there's no supernatural things, but still it stole my heart. I never write a review. It's really not my thing. But see I'm here writing a review today. So, that tells a lot why should you watch this. This drama brings happiness and pleasure from our daily life that we found very boring. Still believe me after you watch this drama your boring life can become attractive. It will change your point of view.

This drama will stay with you for a long time.
I started this drama without much expectations and in fact the first couple of episodes didn't provide me with the hook. But every week, it got better and better and today this is my favourite Romantic Comedy drama of all time, being the only drama I've ever rated 10/10.

Here's why you should watch Hometown Cha Cha Cha:

1. The characters and the acting
- Every character in this drama was loveable. Each had their flaws but we love them regardless of it because we know everyone wants the best for each other. I loved how the drama portrayed this so deeply in small scenes throughout the episodes. The casting and all actors were truly a perfect fit.

- But ultimately, BIG kudos goes to Kim Seon Ho, where I couldn't help but be magnitised by his character in every one of his scenes. His experience as a theatre actor clearly came through, and you could genuinely feel his emotions through it all. I think this is his best role yet, and I can't wait for his future works and continuing to support him in 2D1N!

2. The visuals
- The aesthetic of the drama was the most healing. The blue skies, seas, b-rolls of Pohang and the small details made Gongjin feel like the most heavenly seaside town. Being in lockdown this year, this drama has given me something to look forward to for the past 8 weeks and I couldn't be more grateful to feel myself being transported there. It also made me feel more grateful for the place I live in as well and look for these small moments that make the most out of what we do have.

3. The plot
- On the surface, the drama might feel simple with a slice of life storyline. But there's so much more to that. Every scene and little detail felt intentional as I rewatched the episodes. Cliches were shown in fresh ways. The themes of love, community, people - appreciating how the small things in life are actually what makes life worth living were perfectly portrayed.

- I also loved the tension and mysteries throughout the episodes that made going onto Twitter fun to see what theories people had.

- You will definitely be on a rollercoaster of emotions, but just let yourself feel it all, it'll be worth it!

Overall, I highly recommend you give this drama a try! Thank you to the Hometown Cha Cha Cha team for giving me a drama that I'll always remember fondly!!!

A roller coaster of emotion
I had never watched a series and go from smiling to crying in the end. This is (I thought) a light hearted drama but little did I know it touched on so many realistic issues of the society. It hooks you in at first, and reveals everything at the end naturally. I fell for it!

I had never felt so much emotions and growth for all characters in a drama! When they cry, I cried, and when they smile, I smiled like an idiot. It was as if I am there witnessing everything.

It is really heart warming watching this series. I want to travel. It destresses me. It prep me so well for Monday blues. I love the OST Romantic Sunday especially, it is on loop in my head. First part was cheery and merry, middle was all about understanding, third was letting go.

Individual episodes can be considered a story on its own, yet it still makes me want to watch it every weekend. I had so much withdrawal symptoms after every weekend. I would not want this drama to end. It can go forever. Although they only addresses everything towards the last 2 episodes (I cried like mad when the kid cried and grandma having her last words), it don't seemed strange.

Leaving the ending happy but vague (everything is solved but not solved vibe) is surprisingly comfortable to me! They will marry but they did not show the ceremony and miseon's wedding, interview with oh yoon, the teacher... but it was still the closure I seek for in my heart. It warms me very much. It thought me to appreciate everyone around me, and give myself love.

Love is the greatest gift for yourself, and health. I will definately watch this again soon! I couldn't get over it!

Refreshing
This drama has the charms I was looking for. It was light, fresh, new, chill, and definitely teaches you some things about life. I really like slice of life dramas and it was to my taste. The couple were so cute. Hong Du Sik's character was new to me as I've never seen any male lead of such traits and characteristics. He and Yoon Hye Jin really is a match made in heaven. All the other side characters too were likeable. Each one of them was given spotlight and it was heartwarming to see them gather and talk like a whole big family. This drama gave me a Reply Series vibe and I'm not complaining. Definitely loved watching it and would rewatch if given the time.

Sweet and Sassy
This heartwarming drama with perfect comedic and tear-jerk timing was so fun to watch! I had to give it a 10 overall. The ensemble of characters brought to life a small seaside town that you would want to live in. I enjoy dark, thriller dramas too, but sometimes you want to enjoy simple stories that are relatable and thoughtful...and don't have someone out to ruin someone else. This well-written script had the perfect balance of sweetness and sassiness that either made you laugh out loud or say ahh or bring you tears. Hence, I don't need to do a deep dive on the story or characters. All I want to say is if you want to laugh, cry, and smile then this is the show for you. I will definitely keep an eye for other dramas that the screenwriter has written.

One of a kind drama
This drama has been exercising my face every episode! From smiling too much. pouting my mouth, laughing my mouth widely, and crying too much. This drama has been a roller coaster, every episode has been worth my time. The drama made me feel good about myself as some of the characters has the same situation as me and it comforted as I have no one to comfort myself with. I'm very thankful that this drama existed cause I think my life wouldn't be complete without it. As for the acting, they are superb. Their acting really got me as if it happened naturally. The scenery was just perfect, the sea, the markets, house everything was just memorable and calming. The plot is just incredible, it was perfectly aligned, rich, healing at the same time. I hope I could watch this for the first time again. I think this has to be one of the best drama ever made.

Worth watching as light hearted simple drama.
It's been so long since I have seen a Rom Com without too many cliche scenes. The drama is so simple, it doesn't have any dramatic thing like twists, secrets kind of things. So unless you are the kind of person who loves intense drama, you will like Hometown Cha Cha Cha.

Some people say it is a predictable story and I 100% agree with that. But does it mean will it bore, I would say it doesn't.

The only two things I have to complain about this drama is certain times I felt the pace could be a little faster, but still the pace didn't bored me at all. And also Du shik sad past, I felt the writers could have done it much better. I felt the writers took a safe route in that writing.

The best thing about this drama personally would be Shin min ah role, she was immature in beginning, but the way her character grown and handled certain situations is incredible. And also this drama doesn't have any stupid love triangle at all.

Overall it is a good drama.

Slice of Life in Small South Korean Village - heart warming romance
10/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Romantic Comedy with 16, 60 minute episodes.Alternatively known as Seaside Village Cha Cha, Seashore Village Cha Cha and Fishing Village Cha Cha.

Yoon Hye-jin's (Shin Min-a) life takes an unexpected turn when she decides to stand up to her employer for overcharging their dental patients. After outing her employer on social media she find she has been blacklisted in the Seou

l dental community and decides to take a trip to Gongjin, a coastal town where she had found memories as a child. Once there fate seems to step in to keep her there as she loses access to her money and her car suffers mechanical difficulties. A city girl with little skill for country life she finds she has to ask the go to guy of the village, Du-sik, for favor after favor. Hong Du-sik (Kim Seon-ho) is not only the top bachelor in the village but also an indespensible member of the village community. If it needs solved Du-sik can likely solve it, and if it is broken he is most likely to fix it. One thing the village lacks is a dental office and Hye-jin is a dentist that needs some work. Not only does fate decide to continually throw Hye-jin and Du-sik together but it also has landed her in a town in need of her skills. Will this sleepy seaside village be that little something in Hye-jin's life she didn't even realize she was missing? Is there a future for these two very different souls that fate has thrown together?

I rarely find a drama near perfect. There are just so many out there and always aspects that could use improvement. But I have to say, on this one, it is near perfect. I liked how the characters were complex and showed good character growth. The various stories of the people in the town kept it interesting. The romance was very heart warming. They are both amazing actors and had good chemistry. I did not feel too bad for the second lead even though I liked him a lot. It ended well and was neither too drawn out nor lacked in completing the story. The one very minor thing I was not a huge fan of was the romance with the 2nd guy and his writer. She was just a very flat, and I felt, somewhat cold, character. I could not get behind their connection as she seemed like someone that was not very compatible with him and all it seemed she did was nag at him a lot. It was clear she was jealous and a lot of her behavior was around her. If you want a feel good, slice of life in a small town, romance then this would definitely fit the bill.

like a breath of fresh air
It was just fantastic. You say chemistry,ost,location,story everything was so beautiful. The most amazing quality was it felt warm and was heart touching. It would touch your heart like a lil peck and you would be surprised to feel the warmth and sudden surge of emotions.

I loved the acting neither of the cast lacked in that area. The scenery, the ocean, the house, the supermarket,restaurant,clinic ..their little house and especially the bormance...everything was perfect.

Our sikhye couple nailed it. I am glad the divorced couple could resolve their misunderstanding and the guy realised his mistakes. I was surprised when they showed a lil bit of queer community. Our second couple was also so cute.

The halmonis', the owner of shops and bars...everybody was great...and ofc my special love ji pdnim??‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Two less lonely people in the world
Hometown Cha Cha Cha (2021)

Likes
1. Loved watching the villagers live a simple life in Gongjin with the beautiful scenery and yummy food.
2. Hyejin and Dusik's rollercoaster romance, and how they supported and healed each other, although their sweet moments were OTP cringey.
3. Euncheol and Misun's relationship was low key and adorable, i loved them (sometimes more than the main couple). And i got it right, Euncheol was the mystery lotto winner ?
4. Another fave character is Hwajeong. I cried for her when we found out why she divorced her husband. I'm happy they got back together, just wished they showed more sweetness and more groveling from the husband to make up for the 15 years he treated her bad.
5. Of course Hyejin and Misun's friendship, Misun following her friend to the seaside, though still cant get over Hyejin leaving Misun in Seoul after planning an overnight girls night out to go back to Dusik!!
6. Seunghyun is another fave character, though I didnt think he really had to end up with his writer - they could have continued being partners producing great shows without the romance (or maybe they could have gotten someone prettier to match him *sorry*)
7. Gamri ? whenever i see this actress, im scared that she will die by the end of the show or not.
8. Lalalalalalalalala...romantic sunday ??? will forever be embedded in everyone's minds

Dislikes
1. I didn't like the first few episodes because I thought the villagers were all rude (esp Dusik) and always made Hyejin feel like she was a horrible person. And the nosy Namsook. There's no excuse for gossiping about other people.
2. The middle part felt too long and boring, i was sometimes half watching half using twitter. But i didnt fast forward any scenes.
3. The too many coincidences. From Hyejin and Dusik meeting 4x, Dusik's trauma is connected to Seunghyun and his assistant's family all felt convenient.

Rating: 8.5/10 (because i liked the ending despite the flaws and this was the perfect weekend watch)

Healing.... Refreshing.... Loving.... Understanding
I really love this drama. Hometown Cha Cha Cha, is a drama that I wish I could watch first the first time again.

Watching all of these characters has made my heart feel so warm. I've learned a lot of important lessons. This drama is one that I will never forget, one with its soft warm fluffiness that keeps you smiling until your cheeks hurt, that teaches you lessons about appreciating life, all the big and little things and about forgiving yourself. And most of all, despite everything, still try to live as happily as you can in the end.

I will miss looking forward to smiling, laughing and feeling fluffy inside every weekend. I'll miss the anticipation in waiting to figure out what will happen next. The ending couldn't have been more perfectly beautiful, but despite that, I will miss it, greatly. My soul was deeply touched by the characters, their stories, their struggles and most of all that despite each having their own battles, they stuck to each other so closely, constantly being a support for one another.

The bond that all the residents of this beautiful village by the sea have, is what I love most about this drama. I will forever carry the warm feelings they gave me in my heart. I too, have fallen in love with Gongjin.

A thank you to the wonderful and utterly talented cast, director, and all the other talented people who helped create this beautiful ride for so many to hop onto.

Without Hometown Cha Cha Cha, my weekends will feel a little empty now, I'm glad that out of the blue I clicked on that first episode. It's been a wonderful experience <3

I already missed hye jin and du sik and all characters

A beautiful story and A good Life Lesson
Like the most Kdrama It didn't get too much complicated and boring. Yeah there was some suspense and it was needed but it blended in with the story. Overall I loved this show for it's simplicity . I personally don't like too much melodrama or excessive romance but it will surely make you feel good. I liked all the characters but Gam-Ri(Kim Young Ok) she really changed the scene and managed to play her role . And for the KidJang Yi Jun(Ki Eun Yoo) .This kid Is something else. He really grabbed some attention with his acting .It teaches sometime you should just take the life easy and let it be

I have experienced this drama as I was also one of the residents of Gongjin.
This drama will remain in my warm memories for long time!

The actors/actresses, casting, director and writer have done an excellent job to portrait beautifully this storyline.

Indeed, it¬¥s a healing drama that I recommend without hesitation.

For those, who shared the painfull memories of Start up, will find in this drama the healing to ovepass those injustices done to Han Ji Pyeong, finally!

Totally worth binge watch..!
I liked the MC's characters.. One is quite bothering type another is patient type.. I love the way he thinks his helping nature his tolarence.. Everyone needs a person who gives us a shoulder to lean on and ""everything will be okay, even its not now it will gradually.""
I cried I don't know how many times while watching this as well I laughed heartly. I was stressed due to my routine but while watching this drama I completely forgot about the rest..
When gam-ri died I felt really bad cause he was already going through bad time... He was suffering bad even though its not his fault this whole time..
U should totally go for it.. Thanks team for producing such a healing drama.?

Enjoyed every minute of it
Unpopular opinion buuuuut Hometown Cha Cha was a 10/10 during the first part and then not as good. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED IT. I squealed, cried, shipped, cried again, laughed. It was a whole rollercoaster. But the last few episodes had wayyyy too much to cover and it wasn't spread equally. Like till Ep 10, the mysteries of Gongjin remained mysteries and then in 4 episodes they covered it all. Also Yoon Hyejin changed a way too much. I wish they kept a lil bit of her snappy, judgy side along with the cute side.

But it's still one of the best shows I watched. Kim Seon Ho absolutely KILLED it. LIKE KILLED IT. He is the ideal boyfriend for anyone. Dusik can just run me over with Hyejin's Audi and I will say thank you. He is amazing. So is Hyejin. She was judgy at the start, but so realistically done. Her character was such an everyday gem. She wasn't the Cinderella type nor the Supergirl type. Just an ordinary, extremely pretty girl with realistic views of the world. THEY WERE SUCH A CUTE COUPLE.

One last thing, I wished they had a lil less of the Gongjin villagers. I loved their storylines and would defo want them in the drama. I love Bora and Injun and everyone really. All their storylines were necessary and personal and emotional. But I wish they all didn't appear everywhere like at the SikHye wedding randomly. It seemed a little too planned and too cliche to my tastes. Also the random emergency at the wedding gave me MAJOR Descendants of the Sun vibes.

OVERALL

It's a pretty relaxing drama talking about trauma and love of different types. It's really beautifully done. The shots are stunning and so is the town. Every character talked about important things and about healing. I would 100% recommend this to anyone.

drama of the year 2021! i said what i said
so i watched this as it was releasing and i found myself excited for every Saturday. the whole premise of the story seemed really interesting to me so I impulsively started it after watching strangers from hell.
this show was so heartwarming and made me cry, laugh, cry-laugh, kick my feet in the air. i loved the tight-knit community and how everyone in the village had their own story and struggles. they didn't just focus on the main leads, we got to see the children, the adults, the elderly live their lives. it was very simple and healing. i could definitely see myself rewatching this in the future and i am wrapped around its finger.
also kim seon-ho's smile!!!! the cutest thing ever, it was so contagious AHH. him and hyejin were adorable idc what anyone says. sure hyejin did some cringe aegyo but i was able to look past that honestly because regardless, i thought they were really cute. i also love bickering couples lolol gives them more personality which was the case for homecha.
the love triangle in this was actually done right! the second lead wasnt pushy or annoying and he got along with the male lead (for the most part lolol). there was no toxicity between the SL and FL and no confusion. very refreshing!
overall, the scenery and music were really beautiful. i loved the location of the village and the sea, it was truly an experience to watch this for the first time just admiring the views. i dont think any other drama of 2021 compares to this. I highly recommend it!!

Relaxing drama full of emotions
l don't know where to start with.

l just finished the drama and l really loved this one. It has to be my most favorite drama of year 2021 coz' it just has everything l expect from a drama.

Starting with the story , l think the kdrama writers really know how to just play with our minds. sometimes they just make us feel so overwhelming that you just cry along with the actors but thenext minute there comes a character with enough humor to just make you smile.the only thing l didnt liked was the backstory of du-sik as that wasn't in need of being so harsh but still the end neutrilizes it.

The cast and chemistry is the best thing this drama has. l love all the couples and even the kids.Every character involved is worth appretiating. I have not watched any work of both the main leads but l seriously love the dimple-couple and now, l'm really a big fan of shin min-ah. And not to forget the best part , ahjumahas' trio. they are literally the best one l have seen after from the one in reply 1988.
Their chemistry was awesome and their story literally made me cry.

The only thing which at first attracted me towards the drama was the gongjin village.
l love nature , especially the water bodies. Everytime the sea or the mountains were shown in the scenes paired with so relaxing and calm OSTs, l just use to rewind those for like most of the times.

Overall a relaxing drama to watch when you want to feel some realstic emotions and some lively time alone but l would really recommend to watch this one with your partner!!

l don't mostly advice rewatching it coz' l know sometimes we just feel to skip after we watch like 4 to 5 episodes when you already know the plot so when you are watching for the first time , relax and enjoy watching it peacefully and don't worry even if you missed the premiere coz' that really doesn't matter!

These were my honest opinions by the fangirling drama-addict part of me.

l really don't bother about budget and all coz' it doesn't even matter to me and l am sorry but l'm not well known with the directors and writers.
This was my first time writing a review and l think this was is a good one to start with.

Have a great time watching !!

For the longest time I‚Äôve been looking forward to this show to finally finish airing. Having looked up some spoilers in the comment section, things seemed more than great, yay happy ending, yay no breakup, yay wholesomeness. As such I could not help myself and hopped on the hype train and so I ended up having too many expectations leading to some disappointment. Don‚Äôt get me wrong HomeCha is a great kdrama, but it‚Äôs not nearly as great as I hoped it would be.

About the Kim Seon Ho - Shin Mina OTP pairing, I can only say that I have seen onscreen couples with better chemistry before, but it was fine. The rest of the cast did a phenomenal job. I liked every single supporting actor with one exception and that exception is only due to my personal bias, so I won‚Äôt elaborate on that. Even the child actors were surprisingly good.

The story is typical romcom story, without the downright magical setting I don‚Äôt think I would have praised it, but It worked very well for the most part.
I have two major problems with the story. Firstly the love triangle felt very artificial. Yes it‚Äôs great how and how fast they wrapped it up, it‚Äôs also great how civilized the characters were about it and even the bromance aspect of it was decent. I felt the only point of the triangle is that Soompi could write an exciting article about how we should look forward to it. Oh well, I realize I‚Äôm probably being unfair with this statement. So feel free to ignore this point, overall this triangle execution is still above average. The bigger issue is episode 15, or more specifically the reveal of the main mystery, why is Hong Doo Shik living the life that he is living, why did he retire to his hometown. Frankly the whole explanation made me angry. It‚Äôs beyond nonsensical. Not only did he turn the other cheek again and again whenever someone blamed him, but he also blamed himself for such a stupid noble reason. I guess I could say that I had my concerns about his characterization before, but when the final reveal came I could only roll my eyes in frustration. I think the writer herself had no idea what tragic backstory she is going to go with up until that point, so she kept procrastinating as long as she could and in episode 15 she handled it like a technician, by then knowing that the show was already an unbreakable success. I wish I had known in advance, I would have just fastforward buttoned all those flashbacks, oh well.

The product placements were often pretty immersion breaking. The writing interns were not on top of their game, at least when it comes to the smart incorporation of product placements. PP should be out of the way, not directly influencing a main characters personality and that‚Äôs exactly what happened here. The whole explanation about Hye Jin liking brandname stuff, designer bags, designer shoes is just too much. There is also that scene, when she bought a 5 million Won necklace, despite being in the red. (and later on said necklace reappeared again in a comparably stupid way) So yes the drama is so full of product placement related content, that at times I felt I should be paid for watching it, not the other way around.

The most comparable kdrama that I‚Äôve seen is When the Weather is Fine. The story is pretty similar overall, but I think that drama is much better up until the production team COMPLETELY ruined it somewhere near the end. Homecha despite not being quite as good in the early episodes at least provided us with a nicely wrapped up happy ending & I can grumble about ep15 all I want, but that‚Äôs not nearly enough to ruin the drama for me, so with that in mind I‚Äôll go with the rating of 8,5.

A very good time spent!!!
Is it possible to have a drama without so many clich√©s and be wonderful? I think it is.
Even this drama has the boring love triangle (very slightly) and a criminal (also dispensable), the mais story is simple. And, in this kind of romantic dramas, simplicity is the best.

STORY - an heart warming story, with two beautiful people surrounded by nosy, loud, crazy but wonderful neighborhood!
And that's it! Even if the main couple is sweet and interesting, the other couples and people are amazing.
We have the girl that is a k pop fan, the old singer with dreams of fame, Hye Jin best friend and the police relationship, Director Ji and the filming stuff, and lots of friendly characters and stories...

ACTING - wonderful acting by almost everyone

MUSIC - good music also

REWATCH - why not, in front of a fireplace and a glass of wine and good company

OVERALL - a nice and cosy drama to have good feelings. As I always knew, I don't have to be stressed by criminals, love triangles or squares or pentagons or other boring clich√©s to have fun.
Please watch

Just the right amount of everything
I had to wait until it's last wk of showing to watch this series on NF. At the time i was watching Squid and Mad Dog, both heavy in their genres. So when i was done i was quite ready for a refreshing, light watch. Hometown couldn't be any more perfect for that!

And i found it to be really refreshing, first literally. I mean views of the sea, surfing, laidback country life are my absolute definition of refreshing. Of course there will be plenty of old folks, gossip and cliches. The series made sure each episode has all of those. Emotionally, there is nothing overpowering until towards the end. We should all cry at that point if we are human! But we don't dwell and soon flowers are abloom again!

I have to confess i wanted to watch this so i can finally feel at ease knowing Good Boy (Start-up) can get his girl. I wanted so bad for him to get his love! I have a feeling it's not just me. This actor can really effectively win you over to his side to root for him. His overall visuals in this show is also quite refreshing.

The lead actress in her role here is a far cry from the mischievous Gumiho, chubby Venus, and brokenhearted wife in Tomorrow with you. She's a more regular person here, and very relatable. I mean we all had to run away at least once in our lives to get away from so much stress. And we all are guilty of being snubby at least once too. So i could very easily see myself in her.

The things that our minds can do to us! And the things that our hearts can do too! That's why i love this series.

Satisfied!! Loved it!!!
I have no words to describe what im exactly feeling after i had finished the 16th/final episode. All i can say is im satisfied....there is a relief that all end well in du sik's life (chief hong) !!!!

What i loved is it stick to its story conceot didnt drift away...its sure a healing drama but one of my reasons overall and rewatch value,i gave 9 is because triggering scenes like especially 14 and 15 i could only watch twice time but then at the end i wouldnt watch that part after a certain times (i hope you can understand)....i cried with hye jin and du sik those who have watched it may relate to this.

Story concept and its direction and production was very good. No doubt that all actors and actresses put their level best in their respective chatacters.

Each character in this drama had a story or something to learn from and the story had everything it didnt leave out or miss out any characters story plot till the last episode. At first i found loop holes some questionable doubts. Tbh at the 16th episode i dont even remembers those loop holes or que....it doesnt matter too. At the end that didnt matter coz i felt satisfied. This is like for me one of the kdramas i see in which the finale episode is so precisely shot. In 16th episode , we get to see almost characters ending plot as some of them had their in few episodes early but at the they all have a scenes which makes it special....everhthing is special.

This drama will gives you happiness, cringiness or shivers or hair standing on your hand ( coz of cuteness overload of hye jin and du sik which is still so CUTE) ,overload cuteness and love but also a trigerring points or downfall of that person too...what they are always outside cannot be always be same in inside. Everyone has different healing methods. And this story/kdrama showed it PERFECTLY!!!

I at first didnt like when du sik kept on blaming himself but in 15th ep i was able to connect the dots and understand well well. The story was detailed and very nicely written. Even if you find loop holes ,it may be not important or doesnt bug you much.

Ost is just amazing matches very well with the scenes. This songs are so soothing , jusg live it!!!! All im wanting is the cute dimples of the main leads.

From 1 to 16th episode ,idk how it went by tbh. I wasnt even planning to watch but when i saw multiple clipping od hometown cha cha clipping i just couldnt resist but try out the 1st episode and hear i am, I actually wait for drama to finish but for this i waited eagerly for weekends to watch this. It kept my mind light but at the same time what happened to du sik made me sad but i was happy for to hye jin at the same time. And du sik influence hye jin's life.

Its worth watching, ome of the best healing kdramas you can find...try it out once if you havent and you wont regret it!!! There is more to write but if i keep on writing it will turn into a book. So try it out. I hope you all like it !!!

Refreshing and new story line with lots of cute support characters
Refreshing story due to the plot and scenery. Watched this during COVID and it uplifted me to see the scenes near the water.
This story is more like real life in that we are friends with people of all ages and enjoy community activities. Maybe it is my Western way of thinking, but the ML should not have felt responsible for the impact of the loss of money of the security guard. He freely chose to put his savings on the line. Why do the blame the ML ? Also, the car accident wasn't directly his fault. I am not saying to not take responsibility for your actions but really...... he was not the cause of the problems of others just a cog in the wheel. Both leads and the other actors were interesting characters to get to know- did not fast forward at all. The problem now is that this is not such an enjoyable show to watch again due to knowing the background on the ML. no surprises now.

a light, warm-hearted, sweet healing drama but with deep stories behind each character
‚Äî you will see yourself laugh hilariously and cry like baby!

You know, to be honest, this drama is actually my weekly go-to sweet-healing drama, however never I would expect this will also make me cry a lot. Yes. A. Lot. Especially in Ep.15 to beginning Ep.16. I never expected scene after scene from that specific eps would make cry like a baby!!!

When you thought you already cried a lot from one scene, but the next scene would make you cry even more!

I hate that. I hate the feeling that the story is just so realistic and relatable. Each. Lines. Are. Just. So. Deep. That. Will. Strike. Through. Your. Heart. Whether you like it or not.

But overall, I love how this drama is well-planned, well written and well executed.

Having alot of characters in a single drama (not just 4, but 19+!) will never be easy‚Äî bcs it might confuse the audience if there‚Äôs at least even one mistake in the flow of the story ‚Äî

But this drama is exceptional although all these 19+ characters has its own story to tell ‚Äî not just a typical story but a realistic, relatable and deep story to tell! ‚Äî the director & screenwriter of this drama, most especially the actors really did a great job!!!

They are so consistent from unfolding each characters‚Äô purpose and story to wraping the story. Plus the cinematography + bgm are just so accurate and perfectly matched with the story! Which makes it more enjoying to watch.

I am just thankful they produced this gem-like kind of drama in the middle of pandemic crisis where all people have a lot to take on their everyday life. Thank you for comforting me for 2 months even you made me cry so much in near ending!!!

Probably, if I‚Äôm going to rewatch it, I‚Äôm for sure going to end it at Ep.14. Hahaha I don‚Äôt wanna cry again.

But if you want some refreshing and relaxing drama, this one is for you! Go and watch it now.

Love love love
This show is my life. I love it more than words can express. It made me sob, it made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt. It was everything. And I will absolutely not settle for anything less than a Hong Du Shik for me. The main leads chemistry was fantastic. The side characters were all so love-able. Even the ones you were sure you would despise to the very end, they made you feel sympathetic towards. The ending episode‚Äôs pace and execution wasn‚Äôt exactly how I would have done it, but it still was happy, so no worries! The second to last episode was the most amazing episode ever though so it‚Äôs all good. Literally this show is all good, I love it!

Well, I won't write a lot. It was a rom-com that is actually interesting and really funny. It makes you log for a cute country side little town in Korea. Maybe the scenery is a bit idyllic, but they don't romanticize the country life (for example, they don't have a dentist). Also, the romance makes sense and it is well written (also thanks to the amazing chemistry of Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho).

But what I love the most are two things. First, the supporting characters were amazing. They weren't just a comedy relief or fillers, they actually had their own stories and lives to lead. Second, the strong female characters, from Yoon Hye Jin who does everything without thinking about the other's opinion and is ahead of Chief Hong, to Pyo Mi Seon, who is older than Choi Eun Chul and has to teach him about relatioship, to Grandma Gam Ri, to Yeo Hwa Jeong and all the others women of Gongjin, which everyone is a strong indepentant woman and dictates herself her own life. Some are strict, some are sensitive, some are a bit too much, but everyone is strong in her own way and can take care of herself. Also, the series speaks a bit about some social problems which is really positive. To summarize, Gongjin is actually a miniature of our society with everything a reallistic community would have.

10/10, you NEED to watch it
I've never written a reviews, but this kdrama was just too good to not write one.

I really got extremely attached to the characters, I felt sad when they felt sad, and I felt happy when they were happy. I really came to love all the characters in the show in a way i've never done before with another drama. The acting was perfect and the story didn't feel dragged out at any time. This drama made me rethink my life and values, just as much as it made me smile, laugh and cry.

10/10, i will be recommending this to everyone i know

This show was such a treat ‚ô•Ô∏é the vibe is so refreshing and good for the soul. I already miss it.

First of all, love seeing my angel Shin Min-ah back on screen. And even happier seeing Kim Seon-ho be cast as a male lead! He‚Äôs been second male lead after second male lead - it was his time!! And their chemistry, omg they are the gold standard.

Their love story is the heart of the show but you also get to watch the lives and stories of the other main residents in town. I‚Äôm not usually one for lots of side stories but as the show goes on you do get more attached to the townspeople and seeing their stories progress truly brings a smile to your face. I was especially a sucker for Mi Seon and police officer Eun Chul, they were adorable.

Although do be prepared for some heavy topics, and it can come as a bit of a shock when it‚Äôs right after episodes of fluff and happiness. Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a love story but it is also a story of healing. The burden and trauma that Hong Doo Shik carried..no wonder it was so difficult for him to open up after a life of those around him leaving him. I‚Äôm so glad that Hye Jin was there to be his rock so he could finally learn to forgive himself.

On the whole, a really beautiful show and I‚Äôll miss the seaside town of Gongjin and its characters so much. I really want to go to the beach now ^-^
I‚Äôd highly recommend this show for viewers looking for something light and easygoing but who are also prepared for the angst and trauma that comes before healing. I promise the payoff is worth it!

I loved it. It made me laugh, cry, and feel healed all at once. Around episode 13 I got a bit worried about how they would answer all the leftover questions but it was wrapped up well. The plot and character development was probably my favorite thing about this show, they didn't push it too quickly and let it happen naturally unlike some other shows. Also, I liked that they showed both sides of Cheif Hong's backstory equally to allow that balance between the emotions of the characters involved. Lastly, the cast did such a good job at bringing these characters to life that you couldn't help but like them all at least once. Sikhye couple and the people of Gongjin I love you, I'll miss my romantic Sundays <3

edit: my opinions on the show have not changed despite the issue because character ‚â† actor (i don't condone or defend his actions though)

Amazing cast & osts
Yes this is a very light romcom. & as a big fan of romcom its perfect for me. Don't come to me with cliche predictable comments because most romcoms are supposed to be like this. If you don't like these then romcom isn't your cup of tea.

However this drama was a breathe of fresh air to me. It taught me about the importance of society & people around me. Sometimes i envy the neighbourhood du sik & hye jin have. I wish i lived in the same society as them. I wished i had same fun in my neighbourhood. Unfortunately people Around me are way too difficult. Real life is quite hard istg. But overall this drama made me feel really nostalogic. It made me want to go to the Countryside. The lead's chemistry was awesome. The Osts omgg. I loveee the osts. Specially ""Romantic sunday"". It reminds me of sea. I love seas & beach a lot. Overall a perfect drama for timepass & relieve your stress.

Homecha-Best drama ever
So it's really true when seonho said homecha is a healing drama, even bts is healing, photoshoot is healing, interview is healing, presscon is healing, script reading is healing, reading reviews from others is healing, everyone is healing and this film has good storyline, well-written, good ensemble cast, powerful acting, and homcha is really one of the best kdrama in 2021. I used to read somewhere that "" So yes, Hometown Cha Cha Cha really enveloped me in its world, I cared for all of the characters and their stories. There were times I laughed, times I cried and times I just enjoyed my time with them. Even the second lead was nicely written and it was so refreshing to see everything develop in such a mature and civil way. I also think this was the first time we saw a female lead‚Äôs previous boyfriend without him being part of the main story. Progress everyone! We are getting somewhere."" Yes, I agree. I love Homecha so much, i love KSH and SMA too because they play their character so well. I hope to see KSH and SMA receive more awards with HomeCha because they deserve it

A SPECTACULAR drama after a long time
Well, what must I say?

I didn't watch the movie this drama is based on, but I must say... I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED THIS. It had everything. I loved how the writers developed it. They not only included the main couple's stories, but also the others from the neighbours from Gongjin.
At the end of the drama you feel like you're part of it too.

I also loved how the Hyejin's (FL) character developed and grew, and also her reaction to Hong's past (ML). It was so realistic.


And what about the ending??

Well... It couldn't be any sweeter!! üòçüòç I LOVED how everything was put in place. They didn't let any loose strings or plot holes. This ending was just PERFECTION. I mean, THE WHOLE DRAMA IS PURE PERFECTION.

They even took the chance to take care of details. ****SPOILERS AHEAD****

Chief Hong could properly mourn grandma's death, the dual proposal from Hyejin and Chief Hong plus their unique wedding pictures scenes, the 3rd mystery revealed, Director Ji didn't miss his timing with writer Wang, all the peolple watched the premier of the show together and Oh Yoon had his opportunity to make his comeback

Aah! This ending and drama couldn't be more perfect! I will definitely rewatch this in the future. üíØ% RECOMMENDED! üòç Aftee a few years I'd definitely rewatch this dramaüòçüôåüèΩ (I don't usually rewatch dramas)

Heartwarming show that you only need to watch once
A must watch if you are a fan of Shin Min Ah or/and Kim Seon Ho because they look gorgeous; I have watched the behind the scenes and have been following with new episodes every weekend but I hate to say despite the whole hype of this show, it won't be a show i will choose to rewatch.

PROS:
- Good acting from all the casts in the show
- Chemistry between both lead actor and actress (and VISUALS wow)
- The setting is beautiful and makes u wanna travel there
- Stories from other characters in the show
- Mature conversations with no push pull kind of thing, FL apologise for things she said/done and is not afraid to communicate with ML what she feels
- (For me was a bonus) Shin Min Ah/FL being cute in relationship


CONS:
- ML trauma is quite draggy and keep u in suspense for a long while
- 2nd ML (Ji PD) romance with the female colleague was kind of not needed and came randomly (since he liked FL)
- Personally prefer the chemistry between KSH and SMA offscreen and all their interviews, BTS, etc. MORE THAN the chemistry they have in the show (aka. Dusik and Hyejin). I was quite disappointed that i don't feel the ML's love as much as the FL in the show.. hence putting this point under the con

FINAL VERDICT: worth watching once if you have time

good combination of great cinematography, directing, writing, and acting.
I watched it religiously on Netflix since its pilot episode. But I never expected to love it as much as I did now. hometown cha cha cha is a refreshing and feel-good drama. In this year of pandemic and dark-themed dramas, this drama healed me and became my source of comfort, it‚Äôs something to look forward to every weekend after an exhausting week with studies/ work. There was never a dull moment, something is always happening that could either make one laugh, cry, and make hearts flutter to the brim.

I haven‚Äôt smiled so much watching two characters fall for each other until dusik and hyejin. The romcom surely didn‚Äôt disappoint. It was written with all the clich√©s but also uniquely flavored. It subverted all those romantic tropes. The chemistry of the leads helped a lot too.

As to the slice of life genre part of the show, each story is enriched to the point that it makes us reflect the values we hold dear in our lives. It‚Äôs full of situations where we can relate and learn lessons. The acting of everyone makes one immerse in their stories like the characters in gongjin are so real. One just can‚Äôt help but root for everyone‚Äôs happiness especially seeing so many good people in the village. Plus, the setting itself (the sea, the nature) is healing in a way. And even though the plot may appear simple, nothing complicated, there‚Äôs the mysteries of gongjin which added to how engaging the storyline is.

The whole storyline is written with every detail well-thought of. It shows as each story unfolds every episode. It‚Äôs so engrossing that I never would‚Äôve reacted this way if I wasn‚Äôt so attached to the drama. I love this drama, thank you for existing hometown cha cha cha.

Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha is such a refreshing drama, with more layers than I expected and a beautiful seaside backdrop. I loved all the supporting characters so much, and honestly liked their storylines more than the romance between the two leads. Hwa Jeong and Yeong Guk's storyline was so memorable, Eun Chul and Mi Seon had such a sweet storyline, Gam Ri and her friends, and the two adorable little kids and their friendship! And yes, I absolutely had SML syndrome because Director Ji was so delightful and charming. I loved his friendship with Doo Shik.

But about Doo Shik and Hye Jin: yes, I know Hye Jin is a prickly sort of character who seems superficial on the outside but is very warm-hearted inside. However, I couldn't help but wonder what if Doo Shik hadn't graduated from such a prestigious university?! Would she have changed her mind so quickly? This drama definitely saves its most dramatic, emotional storyline for the last few episodes... and yet the moment that brought tears to my eyes was actually because of a supporting character.

The cast was excellent and I really thought Kim Seon Ho shined as Doo Shik. One last thing though.. it really makes me roll my eyes when there is an overabundance of moments where it turns out the characters had met in the past. Please.

P.S. I love DOS and their song. Where is the full version!!

YOU Better read this, I put all my mind on it. hehe
I started this drama because of the good reviews and eventually started watching it. To be very hones, I am not very into it at the first half, I mean I liked it but not that much but then they poured out everything at the end. This is like a set of many bomb that has been ticking for a very long time and accidentally explode at once. I just thought that they have been putting a really really calm story but then it burst out like a storm at the end, I think that it is better if they slowly addressing the issues one by one not bombing us at once. I don't know but they gave us so much at the end that I don't know if it is still part of the story. But that was only my negative thoughts, I mostly liked it ,really much.

Firstly feels of this drama is like you are at that boat on the mountain where you can view everything, the drama is like a documentary is a countryside covering all the stories of the neighbourhood. I can relate to this because , I was raised in the province and I found that the traits, characteristics and attitudes of the neighbours is quite the same as my hometown. It is refreshing with the view of the oceans and mountain every episode and not those tall buildings and exhausting traffics in the city.
There are so many story in this series like everyone has their pain, happiness, sadness and problems and they all gave them a happy ending at the end.
I love the friendship of the three grandmas, they always bicker but we can see that friendship and their relationship is pure and honest. The death of Grandma Gam-ri reminded me of my grandma who also passed away for sometime, like Du-sik I did not cry but I know and remember all the memories we have together, she is really like my grandma who keeps on cooking and forcing me to eat them.
I find the two kids really keopta and adorable, they are really great with their acting. And all the neighbourhoods different stories will touch you, it depicts about their past pains, their family relationship, work management and how can they maintain a harmony within all the neighbours.

I also find the story of the police officer and Minseo really cute and adorable, I always laugh because of them, even though they have less airtime, they are my happy pill on this series. Their love is really pure and full of understanding hehe.

And of course the story of our Chief Hong and Ms Dentist. They have a really simple love story but they both have a dark past that is not easy for them to let go and that made their relationship a bit complicated. Ms Dentist has a very sad past but she is very open to share her story so that someone could could hear it and that made her to never forget how her past was like. I know she is very selfish at first but that is because of her past that made her that, that she is selfish in a way that she could also teach the others to at least give love and care for themselves so that their relatives won't be very sad if their gone. For Mr. Hong, he is the kind of person who will keep everything and accept everything then hide it in his heart and that made him live a very sad life covered with the smiles, laughs and happiness he gave to his neighbourhood and Ms. Dentist was able to remove that bandage in his heart to let him open it and let it flow so that they could go out of him. And because of them, I smiled everytime.
I liked how they chose Gongjin as the destination because it is not so famous site and not so busy and that made the story more natural.
I first thought this as a comedy but who would have thought that it was full of sad stories that is why I put my rating on re-watch value lower. I recommend you to watch it and hold until the end and you won't regret it.

Let's say thank you Gongjin.

Absolutely brilliant - one of my favourite dramas in 2021
This drama had me hooked from the beginning. They did such a great job in introducing the characters, showing their development and completing each story line. It was a refreshing, feel-good and realistic drama. Each episode was exciting and I was never once bored.

The relationship between the main couple was very well developed. They showed us that they talked a lot, they laughed together and first became friends before anything else happened. Also, they did not use the typical plotline of misunderstanding because they actually talked with each other.
I really enjoyed that they fought society's stereotypes such as the man has to confess, the man has to propose, the woman has to do all the house chores and even that they both wanted to be intimate with each other and not only one person. Their relationship felt genuine and they had awesome chemistry. Additionally, I enjoyed that there was a lot of skinship. It made everything more realistic.

The only thing that bothered me was that once the couple got together firstly, that the female lead changed a lot. Of course, it was to show that she was in love but it did not do justice for her strong and fierce character that she was before. Also, that they included her hitting him because they did not want the others to find out about their relationship was too much for me. You should never hit anybody to that extent.

Furthermore, the other storylines kept the show interesting. The ratio between the main couple and the side stories was well done. They included topics such as sexual harrassment, marriage issues, being old, sexuality and many more. In general, the stories of the neighbours were interesting and also well thought-through.

All in all, the show was considerate of the current times and more advanced than other dramas I have watched. It was refreshing to see a more realistic story. I absolutely enjoyed this drama and it became one of my favourite dramas. The last few episodes made me cry so much but in a good way. It is definitely worth the watch.

what most romcom kdramas aspire to be
If you want a high quality romance kdrama with a good buildup, then Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha will not disappoint. The atmosphere and setting is beautiful, the leads are flawed but charming, and the story between them and the town is so heartwarming to watch. While there are definitely some sad parts (read: obligatory traumatized male lead), it never strays into heavy angst that feels hopeless or overtly dark. This is a drama that is first and foremost about healing, and it never forgets that.

Now a few reasons why this is almost a 9/10 but not quite:
- After ep 10, it's not as good as the first episodes
- While I liked Gongjin, I never became super attached to any of the stories of the townsfolk
- There was a really good opportunity for a wlw couple to take the stage but the love story was instead given to a less-than-stellar ex-husband
- Dusik's past was built up a bit too suspensefully for the pay off

Despite this, it wasn't enough to bump the rating further down, especially since it never got boring, which, to me, is one of the biggest flaws a show can have. It's still a great kdrama to watch when you just want something fun, sweet, and romantic, and I'd highly recommend it, especially if you're the type to be picky over romcoms. The ending was also very satisfying to me, which is a rare find.

One of the lightest and most touching dramas of the year!

In a world where everything is stressful, I‚Äôm so thankful for a drama like HCha to exist. It‚Äôs such a breath of fresh air seeing everyone interact in their own way. The characters are all fully fleshed out with their own side stories to make you fully immersed in the village of Gongjin. At moments the drama touched on several life lessons, each of which where very touching- you could feel the characters‚Äô emotions (and admittedly I teared up quite often). The sad moments were contrasted by lighter moments to have you ROTFL ?

Props to Shin Min-ah and Kim Seon-ho for bringing Yoon Hye-Jin and Chief Hong to life! I loved seeing all their bickering and banter turn into a light and fluffy romance~

The drama did hit a few minor snags along the way, such as a few characters making questionable decisions. However, it was very in character- so although there could have been different decisions, everything flowed together naturally.

By no means is HomeCha a perfect drama, but for what it is, it‚Äôs excellent. If you‚Äôre looking for something to destress, have at it!

Great complement for weekend relaxation.
Personally, this theme feels like a breath of fresh air since we've been fed with a lot of dark-nerve wrecking dramas for the last 2 years. (Vincenzo, Flower of Evil, Mouse, The Devils Judge, Beyond evil etc).

Too put it simple, it doesn't stress you out. A lot of happy moments and a little here and there of every other emotions.

Pros:
A lot of life lesson. Warm and touching. This drama perfectly present POVs from a hardworking wife, a husband, a single dad, a stepmom etc that people always bottle up and avoid talking about it.

Aesthetic-served. Cinematography is similar to Lovestruck in the City.

OSTs just stuck in your head.

Cons:
But, I personally felt like there's something missing towards the end of the story. We've been reminded on every episode how Du Sik suffers from trauma but it was just at ep 15 when everyone half-assedly apologize and he seemed rather fine all of sudden? I don't know.

Every conflicts seemed to be unfold and resolved on ep15 and 16 like and that's it?

Some episodes on second half felt like fillers.

Also SikHye romantic moments are a little too much/cringey for me.
__________________________________________________________
Anyway, I'd still recommend this to someone who needed something light for their weekend.

Easy Watching Feel-good Romance
This was the first K-drama that I actually watched through to completion so I wanted to watch some more (I am now a complete addict) before writing a review so that I might have something to compare against. I've been rather spoilt by the series I subsequently watched, picking those with the highest ratings here on MyDramaList so Hometown Cha-cha-cha has some stiff opposition to be compared against and overall it came out well enough.

Like many people I suspect, I turned to K-dramas for some much needed escapism durin these difficult times. In particular I wanted something feel-good and ""easy watching"" where I wasn't going to be put through the emotional wringer and this fits the bill perfectly. The downside to this would be if you are wanting to be challenged, thrilled or otherwise stretched in some way then this probably won't do it.

So the basic storyline is straight-forward enough: Yoon Hye Jin, an intelligent and successful Seoulite dentist who is likeable but somewhat uptight, makes an unfortunate drunk internet posting mistake which sabotages her job. She therefore ends up in the seaside backwater of Gongjin where she meets Hong Doo Shik, a jack of all trades and the cornerstone of the village. Despite being a well educated professional he has ended up making this village his home doing simple jobs for a minimum wage in order to escape from some dark incidents in his past. The story follows the obvious arc with the charm of the town and the warmth of ""Chief Hong"" gradually softening our heroine who learns to relax and prioritise different things in her life. As they are drawn together she in turn tries to persuade Doo Shik to face his demons so that he can move on.

As I said above, this is ""easy watching"" - there are no blinding plot twists and everything proceeds and an enjoyable gentle pace to its obvious conclusion. There are a lot of the standard K-drama cliches: a love triangle, the usual standing and staring into eachother's eyes for an unrealistically long time, lots of ""will they, won't they"", some falling over and being caught in the arms of the other etc. There is a bit of drama with a serial stalker menacing the town but never anything too taxing. There are enjoyable side stories from the various villagers whom we get to meet and as our heroine learns to love the town and its inhabitants so do we too.

Like a lot of K-dramas, I find that there is a certain amount of ""fat"" in this that could have been trimmed. The necessity of spinning things out to the stanard 16 episode did make for a couple of really poor episode in the middle which really jarred. They were supposed to be cutesy-wootsy as the two leads start to do things together but Hey Jin behaves so out of character that Doo Shik must have been left wondering whether he actually wanted anything to do with this person! Still, after that bump we are back on track and everything proceeds smoothly. The pace does race ahead toward the end with a lot of chief Hong's back story to get through at break-neck speed but it all wraps up smoothly in the end.

The cast were great with our two leads having good on-screen chemistry and both fitting their roles perfectly. The supporting actors all did a great job despite an occasionally creaky script. So all in all, it's a very enjoyable, untaxing easy-watching romance and if that is what you are after then it fits the bill nicely.

Best rom-com and slice of life!
~One of the best mix of romantic comedy and slice of life drama
~Beautiful character growth and engaging plot lines
~Few cliched plots but executed to perfection
~Powerful female-centric characters
~Amazing narration and handling of sensitive issues and stereotypes
including mental health, LGBTIQ, pregnancy, divorce, aging parents etc
~Filled with life lessons and beautiful outlook on life
~Second male lead storyline handled impeccably well

I laughed , I clapped, I squealed, I screamed and I also cried a lot. I was thoroughly attached to the Gongjin villagers by the end of the drama. This drama will stay with me for a long long long time. Thank you to the amazing writers and directors and the talented cast who made possible this heartwarming show in the middle of the pandemic and gave us all so much comfort.

Great but
This drama is great, NO DOUBT. I would for sure recommend it if you enjoy slow family, community vibe dramas with no dramatic plot or ""bad guys"". It's a feel-good romance and the chemistry between the leads was great Until they got together. I don't know what happened but the fl suddenly did a 180 on her personality and the way she interacted with the ml, yes understandable now they are dating but it lost the spark/ banter they had before they got together. She was VERY, EXTREMELY CLINGY and HER VOICE irked me so so much it was honestly very hard to watch yet I kept going because I am guessing it is ""normal"" for the start of a relationship but it's not that fun to watch. I have noticed her calming down and being more herself again as they go on but this is just a warning for the ep 10-12 at least like it's a lot.

Otherwise, definitely watch this drama it's so fun and everyone is so likable.

What a Beautiful Masterpiece
Indeed the perfect pair of the year. ?
The casts are well suited with their characters.
The dimples of the main leads are kind of distracting.
You will just see yourself smiling because of this show.
I love everything about this show.
SLOW CLAP FOR EVERYONE WHO MADE THIS SHOW COME TO LIFE.
No dull moments in every episodes. It may feel slow sometimes but the FL and ML always saves the show.
The OST are addicting too. It's quite funny and super catchy.

A slow-burning romance in a country side
I love slow-burning romance dramas that are executed nicely. And that is exactly what we have in this drama. Two great main leads with a great team of supporting characters, great cinematography, and a storyline that fully holds up this beautiful drama. First of all, I loved our dimple couple in this drama. Their chemistry was off the charts. I loved how they slowly got to know and love each other.
I liked how all the characters had an emotional side story. It helped me connect more with them and also get to know them better. Even though the drama is light-hearted and funny for the most part of the drama it is also emotional at times. And I rate emotional scenes over funny scenes any day. As it is easier to make a person smile rather than making them cry for a character. As the story needs to touch the heart of the viewer for them to become emotionally attached to it.
There is only one thing I disliked in this drama and that is the love triangle. I know that it was good, as it made the ML realize his love interest in the FL and made him more active in pursuing the FL during the story. It was like a wake-up call for him. But still, I don't prefer love triangles.
Apart from the love triangle, I loved the drama and its beautiful cast. The drama is still ongoing let's see how it turns out to be.

YOU MUST WATCH THIS DRAMA AND HERE'S WHY!
I never write reviews but for this one i strongly felt like i should because i dont want people to miss out on this drama if they are having second thoughts about starting this one . Following reasons are why i am loving this drama so far

1)Cinematography- There are some absolutely breathtaking wide and drone shots of the place Pohang where the drama is shot makes it such a visual treat. After watching this you will definitely want to put this place down in your wishlist of travel destinations. The setting of the drama with its picturesque landscapes, sunsets at sea will give you healing vibes for sure.

2) Cast and Characters(Both main and supporting cast)- I will admit that i was looking forward to this drama because i have been waiting for shin min ah's return but i was pleasantly surprised to see how well the rest of the characters hold their own, its not a drama which is all about the two leads ; its also very much about the people around them the actors all have done a really good job so you do become invested in their stories and struggles as well . Even the child actors give really memorable peroformances in this one .

3)Main Leads- The chemistry is so present but unlike so many rom coms this drama will give you time to like these two as individuals before they get together as a couple(which as of now they havent) . I like how both of them are not perfect but that is what makes them relatable and you will soon find yourself rooting for them.

4)Story- Even though at this stage a large chunk of story is to be seen but i like that there is an actual story to look forward to especially about the lead actor's past. This drama was already good because of the previous points but the compelling stoyrline that they have been teasing in the first episodes is such an added bonus that makes this one a complete package.


HOPE YOU ENJOY WATCHING THIS HEARTWARMING DRAMA SET IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE AS MUCH AS I DID !! :)

This review may contain spoilers
It‚Äôs a healing drama like they said it would be.
This is my first review so I hope my thoughts aren‚Äôt too scattered.

Get ready for a slice-of-life, rom-com, and healing drama! It has a lot of k drama clich√©s which is something I enjoy and I think that‚Äôs what draws a lot of people to k dramas. Having said that, it also defies a lot of them which made me really happy because SOME clich√©s are just plain annoying.

Slice-of-life
For those who are new to k dramas, slice-of-life might not be something you‚Äôre used to but it grows on you. It took me a while to get into Reply 1988 and I wondered why so many people liked it because I found it hard to get into the first few episodes but after a while, it grows on you and you become part of their life. That also goes for this drama. With each episode, you get to know the daily lives of the people of Gongjin and it surely is a great journey learning about their lives and relating to the struggles they face and seeing them overcome it.

Rom-Com
This drama is filled with rom-com elements. There are many scenes that make your heart flutter and make you smile from ear to ear. Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho have amazing chemistry and you really fall in love with them and their journey. So if you‚Äôre here for some rom-com, you‚Äôll definitely get a lot of it and some say too much of it from Episode 11 and 12‚Ä¶ haha I enjoyed those too much though but it was not for everyone.

Healing
This drama has been advertised as a healing drama and it‚Äôs true. The healing part actually involves all the characters of the drama. Although the male lead may be seen as the one with the biggest problem, each character had something to heal from and we get to witness how they dealt with it. I really like the pace of the drama and how they realistically portrayed the struggle of someone who has faced trauma. The ML suffered a lot and it took many episodes before we even find out why but that just shows how long it sometimes takes for someone to open up and face the trauma and choose to move on and be happy. It‚Äôs as though the writer took us through a journey of healing and that involves the good, the bad and the ugly. So prepare to go on a roller coaster of emotions because that‚Äôs what healing involves. Facing all the ugly and finally coming out beautifully. Some might quit because it gets too heavy all of a sudden but for those who choose to stick around and get through the pain, the end will be rewarding.

Favourite Character
I would have to say my favourite character is the female lead, Hyejin. She showed a lot of character growth and she definitely defied a lot of the traits that I dislike about female leads. She knew what she wanted and she went for it. She also wasn‚Äôt afraid to admit her mistakes and apologize. You will find yourself applauding and wishing you had a person like her by your side. Thanks to Hyejin, we didn‚Äôt have any noble idiots around here.

Although Hyejin is my favourite character, the whole cast is amazing! Like ALL of them! The acting was top notch and this drama made me a fan of a lot of them. I initially watched this for Kim Seon Ho but I started watching a lot of Shin Min Ah‚Äôs dramas while waiting for the episodes to come out. Also, if you felt disappointed with Han Ji Pyeong‚Äôs fate in Start Up, this would be the drama for you!

Finally, if you haven‚Äôt already watched this, just give it a try! It‚Äôs a slow-paced drama that is designed to portray what healing is like. It‚Äôs not quick, it involves daily struggles, and a lot of pain. However, when you get through all of that, you can finally smile without reserve.

a balm to the soul
This charming show about two dimpled sweethearts dancing around their growing feelings for one another in an adorable seaside town is literally the best medicine ever invented to cope with our stressful lives. The supporting characters are fully-realized people, and I was invested in all of their lives from the first episode. I watch most of the show with a huge grin on my face, and finish each episode happier than I was when I started (though things are starting to take an angsty turn now that we're at episode 6).

The only thing I don't like about the show is only two episodes come out per week. Waiting is torture. I want to inject all of it directly into my veins right this second.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not feeling it‚Ä¶‚Äù
This rom-com is already halfway through and yet I still fail to see anything to greatly fuss about except for Kim Seon Ho‚Äôs charming dimples.

It‚Äôs a lamentable waste of time, talent and location when a storyline is insipid. I frequently find myself dozing off in-between the scenes as the dull turn of events and boring dialogues fail miserably in capturing my attention.

Nevertheless, I remain hopeful that the next half of the series will reawaken my interest and give me something to finally fuss about.

Fresh story line, but extremely annoying and childish female lead
Since seeing the poster and the name of this new drama I got very interested. The title is pretty original and meaningful - it reminds of the funny dialog the two main leads had.
The first episode succed to get me into it. The retrospection after it, showing how Yoon Hye Jin got into this place and mess with the villagers was also prosecuted well. I didn't liked the 5th episode though. It was exactly copy-paste of the 1th one. The writer could have done better, same as the drama director. A cool effect going back in the 1th episode, without going again through all we've already watched could've been better, but still I can understand that maybe they wanted to continue the story line more natural so they did it this way.
In the episode 6 I got very disappointed though by the acting of the main female lead - Yoon Hye Jin. I'm not referring to her actual drama acting, but the character she is portraying.
By the story we got introduced in the begging, Yoon Hye Jin is mature, strong woman that went through quite a lot during her life. She was acting pretty ignorant and cold, but still was trying to be polite and hold herself back on some terms.
Of course after getting close to Hong Du-Sik she opend herself little to the people living in the village and to him, BUT I just can't understand how she got in episode 6. For me it was such a turn point. I dont understand why the writter decided to portray the main female lead so childish and unreasonable. Getting so petty over something that happened when you were drunk and showing that so passively aggressive on many ocassions in the presense of the other villagers doesn't suit a woman at that age, with this kind of profession and past. I couldn't help but compare her with the teenage daughter of Mr. Oh Chun-Jae. Both of them were in a way on the same level of immaturness.
I understand that she is still young at heart and we witness many sences where Yoon Hye Jin got emotional and cried, but still I personally can't handle such a mindset and behavior. It might be just my rational view and taste.
The main male lead on other hand - Kim Sun-Ho (playing Hong Du-Sik) is doing his job pretty well. I like his character. He is still pretty mysterious, but I can't help, but to fall for his sence of humor and straightforwardness. I'm looking forward when we will get the chance to watch his story and what he is actually coping with silently.
The person whom I was so happy to see in this drama was Kim Young-Ok. I loved her in all her previous dramas, I love her here too. She is portraying such a lovely old lady, who unfortunately carries her emotional luggage too - her bad relationship with her son. But the author compensated her in a way making Hong Du-Sik so kind and attached to her. Their interactions together are always bringing smile to my face and warm sensation to my heart.
All of the villagers are having their own story and a past that still is hunting them. I'm happy that the writer and the director are giving them fair screen time so by watching them grow and heal, the viewer can experience the cathartic feeling too.
Its refreshing when they switch from one hard scene to another light and bright one.

Overall the plot is good, I do like it so I'm not gonna stop supporting the drama and I'm goint to keep watching it.
I'm still hoping that it will grow more one me by the time when the rest of the episodes will be released. Same as Shin Min-A's character.

Great acting
I am really enjoying this drama. The actors have great chemistry. All are very good looking and talented. I find myself counting the days until the new episoide come out. Great story line. and the translation is very good. Love it so much. Even my husband watches it with me.I like the way all the towns people come to her dental clinic. The grandma is so cute but she is tough. The divorced couple are so funny. The chief is so smart there is nothing he can't do.All the beach views are breath taking . The water is so beautiful. It reminds me of my country.

Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a refreshingly feel good series.
Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a refreshingly feel good series. Maybe it's still too early to say since I've just watched four episodes out of sixteen but this gives me a feel good vibe that helps me clear my head away from the chaotic new normal we have now. The way things are going on, it's very refreshing to go away and take a break but it still impossible to do that, good thing that the setting of this light drama with a sweet comedy is a seaside village with a panoramic view. I could only imagine the breeze brushing off all my worries and pains!

As expected the dimpled duo has a perfect chemistry on screen, Kim Seon-ho still carries his good boy charm (remnants of Start-up) plus a silly child-like but cute beam (reminds me of Waikiki 2) whenever he watches Shin Min A from afar. The way he smiles when he looks at Hye Jin from afar makes me feel tiny pinches inside my chest. Hye Jin's character is a fussy city girl who really needs a character redevelopment and let us just watch how the Jack-of-all-trades Du-sik is going to help her repair her flaws. The village peeps also reminds me of the quirky gang of ""corn salad"" Vincenzo of how they unite and stay loyal to their peers which was shown when someone from their village has been through an ""accidental"" ego attack.

This drama is like a seafood platter with a variety of flavor. Can't wait for the next episode.

Honestly I was skeptical at first because both of the leads seemed to be pretty rude and it wasn't really on that cute bickering level. She's really judgmental and is classist while he was just completely rude to someone he'd just met. Even with these qualities, the drama had me really curious about what was going to happen next. It includes a lot of cliches but cliches never fail so it's not a problem. I hope that the two can grow into better people throughout the rest of the drama. And of course the OSTs so far are catchy as hell.

A drama full of life lessons
The drama in general is already perfect in every aspects so i wont discuss much about acting, plot, ost etc.

What made this drama stand out is the life lessons the writer and director managed to incorporate. The drama was highly anticipated because of the leads but as the drama progressed it was no longer just about chemistry and typical romcom that we watch to free ourselves from stress. It has become the light and reflection of our past our present and our future. When i watched this drama it had me thinking of the life choices i made. It is very rare for a drama to bring an impact on viewers and having read alot of comments im not the only one. Im so proud to the whole production of this drama. I wish nothing more but for more dramas like this.

The best Korean drama i watched.
I loved everything.
The main leads were AWESOME.
ESPECIALLY Kim Seon-how's acting. He done the job perfectly. I felt everything, his character hit me so deep, simply he became one of my all time favorite actors. I will watch everything he's in.
Believe me when I say you will not regret if you chose to watch this drama, it delivers everything from romance to comedy to some darker tones, I don't wanna spoil but believe me it is so satisfying. And the other characters are well developed, at the beginning I didn't like them but through the show I grew to love them. Everything was perfect.

This review may contain spoilers
Oh Man How Deserving This Hype Is
Some people are soooo bitter about Hometown Cha Cha Cha mann. And then there's me who has only seen 1 episode so far but knows it will be a 9 or a 10, lol. Apparently there's no interesting plot or compelling characters, meh romance, no villain, tooo many episodes so too long (which I absolutely don't agree with).

*me talking to my friends about it since they've en it as well and are wondering how I avoided spoilers* I have avoided spoilers for it really well. I only know there's something about a baby/kid and a wedding. Why does this sound like his ""scandal"" that was fake (JUSTICE FOR THIS PRECIOUS PUPPY).

I am just gonna binge watch some cha cha cha to cure my youth of May depression.

Hometown cha cha cha is sooooo cute. Instant serotonin.

I'm now at episode 5 and this is just pure happiness.

Apparently dramas set in small towns are my shit because I'm like loving the shit out of this and it's like the 3rd or 4th show I've seen that takes in a small village that I'm loving. It's sooo healing.

I dunno if it's just me BUT OMG WHY DOES SHE KEEP WEARING SUCH HORRIBLE UGLY OUTFITS IN CHA CHA CHA!!! WHO ARE THOSE STYLISTS!?!? AND HOW CAN I FIRE THEM!! HOW CAN HER OUTFITS EVEN GET WORSE?

OMG NOOOOOOOOO!! You don't scream or run at your oppa like that. Ju-ri why u screaming at your kpop idol like that. Whaeeeee..... I feel so bad for idols or any artist who receives treatment like that. Looool if I would meet famous people like that randomly and loooove them I probably would say or do nothing at all. He was sooo kind though.

I still hate our female lead's outfits. Don't even get me started on the make up.

Lowkey funny how two of my friends who don't watch dramas as vigorously as me, have seen it before me.

The dimple couple is toooo freaking cute.

That moment that I'm even fluent enough in Korean to know when Netflix mistranslates some stuff.

Poor chief hong crying ): If his backstory will be even more sadder then I'll be even more sadder than sad.

I'm also sad. NOBODY IS ALLOWING ME TO BINGE WATCH HOMETOWN CHA CHA CHA LIKE I WANT TO ):

Nooooooooo why does baby say everyone he loves dies and that it is because of him? Chief hong is tooo precious. My poor baby.

I'm dyinggg :') Chief hong is right though. If you don't read a lot of poetry or just reading in general, poems are the way to bore people into Falling asleep.

I DOOOOOOOOOOOON'T LIKE HOW THEY MADE THE SECOND MALE LEAD SOOO GOOD AS WELL.

Why are the two best friends such soulmates. Their love for each other is just uwu. Best sismance ever.

I'm dying :') our main girl forgetting to unplug her hair curler reminds me of my sister when she still lived at home. I literally have gotten THOUSAND OR MORE texts from her asking me to check if she unplugged her hair straightener :') This is too relatable. IT IS EVEN FUNNIER THAT IT WAS UNPLUGGED, which was always the case with my sister as well.

SHE CONFESSED FIRST O.O

I'M SLOWER THAN I WOULD LIKE TO BE! I'm only at episode 11 and I almost cried but gotta continue and finish it tomorrow because lucky is like WOMAN I WANT TO GO TO BED!

I didn't love episode 11 as much as the others since it kind of annoyed me how our girl always hit chief hong when she thought someone almost noticed them being all lovey dovey.

Uwu uwu Emma is almost crying. Why are they so fucking cute? Why is my dimple couple so fucking precious as well. My heart is melting.

They did not have to do us sooo dirty with the last ep. That was such a rollercoaster. It was soooo emotional, like so emotional. I wasn't expecting to be so emo.

Also looooool 2021 kdramas is apparently all about dem gay female side characters. It's like the third or fourth mainstream drama of this year that had a gay woman as a side character(s) and stated it (I definitely suspected she was not straight). It honestly was one of the most diverse years of kdramas imo.

My favourite drama (and most likely show in general ) of all time
Hometown Cha-cha-cha was truly amazing. It's the closest thing to perfection I have ever seen. The story was impeccably told and the writers and producers did an amazing job of bringing the story to life. Never have I gone through so many emotions in one show. You end up falling in love with pretty much every member of the main cast and the entire story itself. The show managed to avoid many of the sometimes frustrating tropes associated with many dramas. I just finished the series and I would watch it multiple times over in a heartbeat. Truly a must-watch for everyone and my favourite drama (and honestly, show) of all time.

I enjoy watching this drama. I'm not really into slice of life genre but I'm surprise that I am loving Howetown Cha-Cha-Cha. The cinematography is therapeutic. Just perfect after a hectic weekdays. It is wholesome that every member of a family can watch together. A healing drama in the weekend is a great family bonding. I watched just 2 episodes but it already gave me so many realizations and life lessons. I am looking forward to discovering each of the characters story and the lesson it will give.

Come for the laughs and stay for the chemistry.
Both the actor and actress were perfectly
casted for this show. The chemistry between Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah is great. The back n forth between the two makes for some good dialogue. Defintely something you want to
watch if you want to smile. If you are looking for something light hearted with some good laughs. I highly recommend that you watch this show. Especially if you are looking for that feel good romantic comedy of the summer. I can't begin to say enough good things about this show. I know it is still early on but this show is everyrhing it was promoted to be.

Reminds me again of CLOY :)
Highly recommended watch!! It‚Äôs got people from all ages- grandmas conversations, town gossip, the divorced couple, the nosy and loud lady, the retired musician/ single father, the pregnant lady and ‚Äúno-good‚Äù husband, the kids... and then you have Hong Du-shik <3<3<3

He is such a dream!!! Kim Seon-Ho played his character extremely well!! With his Okay! Cool and Thankiew!!! So adorable ;);) His smile and his dimples will just melt your heart. His chemistry with Shin Min-Ah is off the charts! I know she already has a bf, but on set they look so comfortable and cute together :) Relationship development was done so right! (Spoiler: and I just loved the proposal scene!!! Soooo cute!) Love triangle was also done well and the bromance between the two gentlemen was friendship goals.

I admit I did skip some of the town gossip lol... it was just a tad blah blah... too loud and too naggy hahaha. Towards the end you will have your typical Kdrama cliches- the past is revealed, lots of crying moments, but the ending was done very well, nice closure to it. You will also see Cliche coincidences, just don‚Äôt mind it too much.

The one criticism I will give is Shin min-Ah‚Äôs dressing on set. It was horrible in my opinion! (Spoiler: especially the green dress she wore for Chief Hong‚Äôs birthday! WHAT WAS THAT??? For someone who can afford Dior and expensive shoes, please dress better!!) Most of her dresses looked like grandma‚Äôs table cloth (sorry!!!)

A wonderful, feel- good rom-com!! I laughed a lot, cried a lot, and replayed the romance scenes a lot! :) :) :) GO WATCH IT NOW!!

Solid half light drama!
Hmmm my feelings towards this drama...

I think the cast is actually amazing. There some actors that I wouldn't imagine playing this kind of light funny characters as they usually play these heavy bad guy roles. But the show started out pretty slow, it felt like it was a drag. But as the male lead and female lead meets, that's when it starts getting good, I'd say it starts getting good at around half through episode one.

In this drama, I have a hunch that this drama is going to teach us about the hardship we face but we must go on. Because although we lose things, we also gain new things and new experiences. We may struggle to adjust ourselves in environment but if we show kindness and perseverance, we will be able get along with anything. Although, I have another hunch that this will have some aspects of darkness to the story later in the episodes.

I'd say if you want a half light funny drama about overcoming things, this is for you.

heartwarming, light and fluttering
Finally the most awaited drama. The plot and the cast looks really promising. If you are in for something cute and light, definitely give this a shot. Everything looks very realistic and the funny scenes are just cherry on top. Humor of the ML is top tier and the dialogue delivery is so effortless by all the characters. I am rooting for our dimple couple!!!
The plot is simple but even in the starting episodes, it has firmly gripped the base. The ML was ""Good Boy"" in Start up and here every granny's boy. lol
The setup gave me when-camellia-blooms VIBES. I love himmm. His character is just so naturally bubbly and lovable ahhh.

Feels like a Hallmark movie. Not for me
I didn't really like how unnecessarily rude the Male Lead was to the Female Lead right from the start.

Also this show kind of seems like a Hallmark movie lo. Like: beautiful lady from the big city goes back to the small town she went to in her childhood and ends up falling in love - with a local man and with the town itself - so she decides to stay. Nothing wrong with that premise, of course, it's just not my favourite type of story, and I've seen it a million times in cheesy Hallmark films. :|

Perhaps I'll come back to this show at some point.

I never expected to like this drama as much as I did. I expected it to be a repeat of ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-joo"", and although they both have general romcom similarities, and strong female leads, they are totally different. This is really a superhero story as much as a romcom. Bong Soon is one of those characters that's easy to like and will be hard to forget. The show feels more like a comic than a drama and takes multiple genres to the extreme... it's an action-romance-thriller-comedy... and viewers should be warned that everything about this show is waaaaay over the top. I suggest not taking anything too seriously and just enjoying all the craziness this show has to offer.

Do Bong Soon is played by Park Bo Young, who was in one of my favorite dramas,""Oh My Ghostess"", yet I didn't recognize her at all. With her super cute bob haircut, her amped up adorable personality, and her petite stature, it was exciting to see her character with this unexpected superhuman strength. I loved her character's origin story, and I'm always a fan of the anti-damsel in distress, so I was already interested in this drama from episode one. She really plays the sweet girl you don't want to mess with role extremely well.

She is matched with Park Hyung Shik as Ahn Min Hyeok, and I don't think I can accurately describe with words how charming, and just beautiful to look at he is in this role - it's *swoon* overload. He is not even my type, at all, but it's like they put a special perfection filter on him, and he played every scene in a way that made it impossible for me not to fall for him. Together their adorable couple rating is off the charts! Their chemistry is perfect, so perfect that the cheesiest scenes and moments still worked for me, and soooo many scenes were extra cheesy. He is also so supportive of her, which makes the traditional role reversal refreshing to watch. To me they came right up to the border of being obnoxious in their cuteness, but never crossed it, because they were such a good match.

The rest of the cast was mostly awesome too, considering all the genres that they had to cover. Ji Soo as In Gook Doo completes the love triangle, and plays his part really well, although I honestly couldn't stand how the actual character behaved. Gook Doo may inspire 2nd lead syndrome in some, but he was too controlling and self-righteous for me to really root for. I loved Bong Soon's family, BFF, and especially grandma. I also really liked the villain, who I think was played by the actor better than the character was actually written. He was creepy and sinister, yet kinda seductive and attractive, which I think is a recipe for an excellent villain/nemesis. Then there is the supporting cast MVP Kim Won Hae. I didn't love him in his first role, It was just too corny and gross for me, but his second role was hilarious in its absurdity. I applaud his ability to take both roles to such extremes. The cast is definitely full of memorable characters.

Part of the reason I deducted some acting points was because a lot of the comedy just wasn't my to my taste. Korean humor can get too silly for me sometimes, which was part of my issue with some of the performances. There is a whole gangster subplot that annoyed me. There is a Monk that is completely ridiculous. Then on a more serious note, Seol In Ah's role was pretty useless, and forgettable. There is also a family drama plot that I forgot all about until the end when it's obvious that they were missing. These criticisms are because of the writers, more than the acting, which is why i deducted even more points from the story. Don't get me wrong, I liked the story a lot, and loved watching Bong Soon become more confident and evolve into a Shero, but the story as a whole is all over the place. The thriller part is intriguing enough to drive her motivation, but it went from being seriously creepy to resolving with a more comic book feel. There are a lot of parts of the story that I felt were left without a real explanation, or resolved too quickly, but all of this was forgivable because of how much I still enjoyed watching every episode.

I also forgive the last episode, which had mostly filler, but I loved the very end (obvious but perfect), which made me very curious about what a second season would be like.

The OST was good, and matched the show well, especially the ""Super Power Girl""Theme! However, I did not fall in love with any of the songs, not even Park Hyung Shik's ballad.

Now comes the highest score for me - rewatch value. I gave it a 9.5 because I could definitely see myself watching this more than once. With all it's flaws, and silliness, I just had so much fun watching, and couldn't wait to watch the next episode! I almost gave rewatch a 10 but I would definitely skip through some of the comedy scenes.

Overall, I would recommend this as a cute twist on a superhero story that encourages female empowerment, not in a subtle way... in a walnut hammer over the head way! I also love the message of not underestimating someone based on appearance, and helping others selflessly. I think it's best to just embrace that the plot is chaos, the comedy is ludicrous, and enjoy the fact that it may not always be coherent but it all supports this character's journey to her destiny (well, maybe not the stupid monk). I also highly recommend it to anyone who is on the lookout for a talented and crush-worthy actor, because I think Park Hyung Shik definitely fits the bill.

If you're looking for maturity, a substantive plot, characters with great depth, and no clich√©s or exploited stereotypes... back away from this drama slowly and don't come back to it until you're in a lighter mood.

This is the drama equivalent of a bag full of candy! Not every flavor in the bag will be good, but most of it is delicious, and the sugar high makes it all worth it!

Oh, and if there was a Bong Soon video game, I would totally be excited to play it!

So how would I describe this show? This story tried to be too much. It was a romance mixed with slapstick humor, and dark thriller. How did those elements combine? Not too well, actually....but the parts that were good were good enough to keep me watching until the end. This show started off strong and I was loving it up until about a little over halfway, when it dawned on me that the story was just kind of nonsense. But the leads are so freaking adorable (and probably every teenage girl's dream fantasy romance) that they kept sucking me back in every week. I think Park Bo Young may have reached 'girl crush' status for me. And Park Hyung Shik is almost too pretty - but his acting as Ahn Min Hyuk crushing on Do Bong Soon --- I just ""can't even"" with him. Too cute for words. They were so cheesy together, but this ahjumma was eating it up. Seriously....this romance is what the show has going for it. But even that is unrealistically done. This show is just fluff....lots and lots of fluff. The story line is chaotic. There is an evil villain that is just too horrifying to be in a rom-com. It was very jarring to go from sweet romance scenes to a creepy masked kidnapper who is terrorizing young women. And the slapstick antics of the gangsters and the high-school gangsters and the screechy femme planning team leader was funny the first time but became just useless filler that was pretty annoying fast forward material. And a lot of people hated that, although played for laughs, the mom seemed abusive (may be why the writers tried to explain that one away in the final episode.) There were funny parts, sure, but they overplayed their hand with them quite a bit. The only thing I would rewatch in this show is the moments with Min Hyuk and Bong Soon. Would I recommend it....sort of. I mean, you'd have to know going in that the story makes no sense, but as a backdrop for a super cute, cheesy beyond belief romance...if you can deal with that then, yeah, go for it. I was entertained for sure (otherwise the rating would be like a 4). But if you need a plot that is logical and a more 'mature' (not THAT kind of mature, but more grown up) romance, then this one won't be right for you.

This review may contain spoilers
Actually, first episodes had me hooked. I liked that the heroine was more like an ""anti-hero"", selfish and a bit rude, the contrast between thriller and comedy was interesting at first, but then...I don't know, I got confused. There was too much stuff in there, and none of that was developed the right way.
The comedy was horrible. The gang (the poop liquor and the beatings. UGH just NOPE), the monk (I mean what's the point of introducing a new irrelevant character at almost the end of the show??), the abused father...what's funny in that? I can save the gay misunderstanding only because both male leads had great chemistry LOL
DBS's mother was the worst mom I've ever seen so far, mine included. She abused the poor husband and told her daughter to force herself on the male lead :/
Also it bothered me a lot that DBS never took her job seriously (well it's HS in the first place who hired her just to have a children-sized desk in his office -.-''') or seriously get a thought about her powers and responsabilities.
The thriller part was the one that got me disappointed the most. Basically the culprit is a random psycho dude and he has really nothing to do with DBS except for they live in the same area...
I think this show could have been something but it just tried to be so much things and failed everyone, except maybe the fluffy romance

The production and cast were promising. The storyline was quite messy.

The entire artistic production would receive 9/10 from me for a romcom drama like this. The direction was great; the set and props were outstanding; the cast was full of both eye candy and skills. The cinematography was amazing. It was good to look at. I just wish they gave much more effort into blending their multiple genres together.

THE CAST:

I'm never a fan of any of them, but I believe they did a really great job. The set of 3 leads owned their roles. I even believe that the writers wrote this story with Park Boyoung in their mind. Tiny and cutesy role is definitely for her, and she's a good actress as well. This is only my second drama with her, however, and I believe that the next one with her is gonna start boring me a bit. Her tone and acting is just so *her* like she was in Oh My Ghost. This happened to me with Hwang Jungeum in every single drama she was in as well.

THE STORY:

The story, however, was a strange mix of romance, comedy, supernatural(?), police investigation, and even bloody thriller. How would they mix into a good storyline? There's no way. I believe they needed to take out at least one, or tone down each of them to make everything flow.

The dynamic of this storyline is super strange. It was like an incredibly bumpy road instead of a smooth rollercoaster. The comedy element was almost too forced that it wasn't funny. Some parts were even disgusting that just made me fast-forward throughout the show.

The thriller part started out really strong in the beginning which tipped off the consistent cute and comical tone of the entire Do Bongsoon character. That villain character was just too over-the-top that the entire sub plot around this guy doesn't fit in with the tone of this story at all.

Plus, the entire reason Bongsoon and Hyungshik got together was because *his* case, not the one in her neighborhood. He was being threatened, and that case was solved so easily and quickly. It was definitely just there to bring the two together.

The love story between the two/three leads was nothing special. Nothing really developed or had an impact on any characteristic change. It was just there out of nowhere. I have to admit that they were cute and fluffy together though. They were almost too cheesy together and I usually don't prefer that kind of super cringy stuff, but I believe it helped even out the darker tones regarding the villain. It still isn't the ideal way for such purpose.

But all in all, I wouldn't keep watching until the end if it wasn't entertaining. Like I said, I liked the cinematography and the cast a lot (surprisingly, given that I'm never a fan of any of them). It was something to watch in my free time and I did take my time to finish it. The bad parts weren't soooo bad that it let me down. At least the first episode started off nicely. If you wanna see for yourself, I don't recommend you against it. I have a reputation for dropping series halfway through if the first few episodes are slow and have too much flashback. This one was fine.

I am still extremely baffled by the amount of praise and high rating this drama has gotten. I heard so much hype about this drama being good that I had high expectations coming in and sadly to say it didn't live up to its expectations and I did not enjoy it.

I thought it would be a light romcom but it turned out to be such a weird amalgamation of thriller-romance-comedy-mystery-supernatural that it was gruesome to watch. First of all, there is no plot in this drama and its all fluff. There is no build up to any climax and it falls very flat after first few episodes. All the episodes are the same and have the same format that there was no compelling reason for me to stay even though I ended up pulling through to finish it. They go on dates, look for the culprit, and show some slapstick humor with guys in suits (and that wasn't even funny). Was the mystery aspect worth staying for? Not at all. It was so poorly written, predictable and weird. The suspect is a psychopath who targets skinny women -- this was discomforting and out of place in a drama that is supposed to be a romcom. Because it tries to be so many things, all of its ""subplots"" it attempts to execute is poorly done and awkwardly paced. It goes from cute and fun to outright disturbing and ridiculous farce. I ended up skipping over parts of the drama during the parts where there were just a bunch of random men trying too hard to be funny with their buffoonery and horseplay. It was just so immature and hard to watch and was completely irrelevant to the plot and characterization. Many of the ""plots"" are so insignificant, such a letdown and not worth staying for at all either. For example, when the person who was making threats to Min Hyuk was finally revealed, it is then forgotten about for the rest of the drama. It was pointless and anti-climatic. A lot of things happen in the drama without meaning. The drama was not mentally stimulating even though it was mentally exhausting.

Don't get me wrong, I do like romcoms but this was just too messy and predictable that I couldn't enjoy it. There are some cute moments with Bong Soon and Min Hyuk and they do a lot of aegyo if you're into that. It tries to appeal to the audience by being intentionally cheesy but I found it cringey and clich√©. In addition, I was initially looking forward to seeing two of the male actors I love in one drama but even their presence there wasn't enough to make me enjoy it in the slightest. It was just so boring to watch them in that stupidly predictable love triangle. It would have made so much more sense to have Bong Soon and Gok Doo end up together, especially after they had been crushing on each other since high school. But somehow they just keep missing each other by the second. It was frustrating to watch even though we all knew the outcome of the triangle. Gok Doo, one of the main characters, felt like a side character and he literally has one emotion throughout the entire drama. Everyone in the drama just felt so insignificant and static. I know having the gay man in the drama was supposed to be funny but it would have been offensive since he was portrayed in the most typical way ever and I swear he screams everytime he's on screen. It felt like I was in some sort of replay loop whenever interactions with the side characters came into play. Bong Soon's mom was the most useless mom I have ever seen and I hated how dense and simple minded she was portrayed as even though an attempt was made to justify her actions towards the end. I also found Bong Soon so annoyingly reckless and discreetly pretentious everytime she whined about having her power yet flaunting it to other people and even abusing it while being unnecessarily disrespectful to the employees of the company. She was so childish, naive, and high maintenance and I just don't get that it's the reason why the two boys are heads over heels for her. The way she and whines cries reminds me of a child that you want to slap but you just can't because they're a child. I didn't have much patience for her even though everyone found her cute. The cuteness and fluff was just way over the top that it left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.

Unless a drama has particularly beautiful OSTs, I usually don't pay too much attention or notice it. But I absolutely hated the music here, and maybe it's because its associated with my dislike towards the drama itself. It was so annoying to listen to that I'm so glad its over now.

Overall, this drama was a letdown and caused me a lot of grief, I don't even know how I didn't end up dropping it after episode 6.

Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is a hilarious rom-com, with an undertone of gender issues. The show has the usual k-drama tropes; the ‚Äúrich and good looking‚Äù chaebol heir, his antagonistic family, the sassy female lead, the love triangle, and the ‚Äúboy gets the girl story‚Äù after overcoming difficulties and obstacles. However, surprisingly ‚Äú Strong Woman Bong Soon‚Äù was able to deliver a fairly impactful storyline and sociocultural critiques about issues in South-Korean society also.

Do Bong Soon (Park Bo Young) is a woman born with superhuman strength. A hereditary ability running through the matriarch line of her family, it can only be used for good or she can lose her strength forever like her mother ( Shim Hye Jin) did. Despite her abilities, Bong Soon adores her father ( Yoo Jae Myung) who is a gentle warm character, and her twin brother, Do Bong Ki ( Ahn Woo Yeon) , who works as a doctor in a hospital. However, our heroine often struggles to tie down a job as well as desperately yearning to be a game developer .

There are two other men in her life. One is her childhood friend, Guk Doo , a stern police detective played by Ji Soo who has been her long-held secret crush since their teen years . Also she hides her strength around him, since he claims to have a soft spot for tiny, fragile women, just like Bong Soo seems to be at first glance. The other man who enters later into her life is Ahn Min Hyuk (Park Hyung Sik) the baby-faced CEO of AINSOFTware, a gaming company. One day he witnesses Bong Soon's superpowers against a group of gangsters, and he hires her to be his personal bodyguard to protect him against an anonymous caller, who has been making death threats against him. At the same time a serial kidnapper starts taking tiny, fragile women off the streets as Bong Soon soon finds herself finally using her powers for good by trying to hunt down this mysterious criminal .


Written by screenwriter Baek Mi Kyung, ‚Äú Strong Woman Do Bong Soon‚Äù is a fairly mixed blend of slapstick comedy, old fashioned romance ( with various successful and questionable effects) and a refreshing look at gender roles and sexism . The series does not sugarcoat delivering criticism towards chauvinism associated with the South- Korean Patriarchy: the police office, the youth gang, the gangster mob in the local vicinity , and the patriarch of the chaebol's family, are all absurdly dysfunctional and over-the-top to highlight notable critiques of gender roles within South-Korean society .

Park Bo Young was undeniably a delight as the petite super-strong female lead with line deliverances that were pure comical gold in a similar manner to costar Park Hyung Sik. As a character, Bong Soon was fairly intriguing by challenging traditional gender stereotypes, however, she wasn‚Äôt inherently a perfectly-written character either due to often being a little boorish and fractious at times ( especially with her treatment surrounding Ahn Min Hyuk early on in the series) which may annoy viewers in the beginning. However, Bong Soon does grow as a character by learning to mature , respectful herself as an individual as well as develop an endearing romantic relationship with Min Hyuk.

Similarly, Ahn Min Hyuk isn‚Äôt without his faults either. He is often slightly naive, sarcastic and equally fractious as Bong Soon. Nevertheless, Min Hyuk is given an equivocal chance like Bong Soon to grow as a character from seemingly shallow at times, towards having a more complicated familial scenario and circumstances.

The side characters can be a bit of a mixed-bag especially in regards to the second male lead and Bong Soon‚Äôs mother. Admittedly, Guk Doo does become inherently more respectful towards Bong Soon as the series progresses, however, his early treatment of the main heroine by putting her down often from her physical appearance and emotionally flaring up in her face at times did become slightly irksome. In a similar manner to Guk Doo, Bong Soon‚Äôs mother was equally frustrating at times by her problematic treatment towards her own daughter. Whilst the circumstances were suggested and put forwards to some extent for viewers , her overall relationship development with her own daughter seemed slightly lacklustre.

In addition to this, it is arguable that the ending was a little anticlimactic as well as finally putting a stop to the seemingly ‚Äú unstoppable killer‚Äù did feel a little disappointing . Nevertheless, ‚Äú Strong Woman Do Bong Soon‚Äù may not have been flawless within its delivered problems of characterisation and comedy ( at times), but it was inherently a lighthearted fantasy, romance tale with intriguing characters, a fairly well-written heroine and romantic pairing as well as prominent messages and critiques towards gender in South-Korean society.

A short review of Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.

A very cute, funny, romantic and really well put together drama. The story was fluffy and dark at the same time. I really liked it. It's fun to watch. There were really funny characters. Funny scenes. And a beautiful ending.
Let's not forget about the chemistry between the two leads were fire hot... *the kiss in ep 15*

I started this drama because of Park Hyung Sik. For me he stole the spot light in 'Hwarang' and when i found out that he was the lead here. I had to watch it. And I'm glad that I did. Because he was absolutely amazing. He was cute, cocky and so so sweet. But in episode 14 he just became 100 times better. He did all the right thing with his lines, his delivery and with his expressions. I loved him in here. I love him everywhere. Just look at the guy's smile!

Same goes for Park Bo Young. This is was the first time I saw her. And I loved her. She is cute and on the money with her acting. She made this character look effortless. Her acting in ep 14 was wow.
And the new guy Jang Mi Kwan! Loved that physo killer.

The music was beautiful.

It's a beautiful drama. And you will love it. It's really funny. And really sweet but not over the top. It has a weird balance to it. That will make you love it. If you are into RomCom then this is your drama. And Park Hyung Sik looks awesome in here!

As soon as you start the first episode you'll be swept away by the awesome female lead, swoon worthy male lead, and the hilarious situations that ensues with the characters around them. But I always say that you cannot rate a drama only on its beginning. Though Strong Woman Do Bong Soon never started out as a perfect drama, it starts to struggle towards the end of the race.

SWDBS follows Do Bong Soon, who has a supernatural ability that gives her incredible strength and it runs in the females in her family. Combine this with Park Hyung Shik as the leading male with hilarious side characters and it seems like it will be a match made in heaven. But this drama from the beginning has always suffered from tonal problems because of its other plotline that has to do with kidnapping. With one half of the show so cute and funny, it does not blend with the other half of the show that happens to be very serious. The writer had a hard time blending comedy and thriller together and the drama starts to suffer in the end because of it. Even with these problems I still believe that you will have a great time watching this drama, especially the first half but you might become frustrated towards the latter half.

It also suffers from pacing problems and at times it will linger on scenes that do not move the plot forward. And also, the kidnapping plotline itself is just not strong. There is nothing really exciting about it because everything is really obvious. The best thing about the plot itself is the romance between the two leads because everything else is not as strong.

The cast is hands down the best thing about this drama. I came in knowing that Park Bo Young will be great. She is a really good actress and I've always felt that she has been able to add a lot of depth to the characters that she is given. Park Hyung Shik was a surprise for me. I've never watched him in a drama before but after this I know I'll be watching all of his past dramas and future ones too. As we know, a lot of idols are cast in leading roles because of their popularity and looks but Park Hyung Shik is not just a handsome idol (and he is handsome!) but a really good actor and he showcases that in this drama. He had a lot of strong scenes that surprised me and I‚Äôm already looking forward to seeing him in something new. His character Min Hyuk will make your heart swoon. If you watch this and don't like the plot, I will guarantee that you'll love his character. The way he looks at Do Bong Soon will make your heart melt.

Ji Soo will be a bit of surprise for many if you seen his past work before. Ji Soo is usually the guy to give you second male lead syndrome but he definitely is not able to do that here. Unlike others, I did not have that much of a problem with the character itself. The rest of the cast is good too. They are hilarious and it‚Äôs a joy to watch them.

I will give fair warning to people. If you get offended by some jokes then this will not be the drama for you. There is a lot of gay jokes and people weren't particularly happy with the domestic abuse either (and with good reason.) So, if you are bothered by gay jokes, I wouldn't suggest watching this because they never really let up on it either. It's not just one joke but multiple ones.

Overall, I must say for myself personally I really liked this drama and though I think it started to drag towards the end, I still really enjoyed it. It's a drama that you'll have a lot of fun with. I think if you pay attention to the leads and the hilarious moments then you'll really enjoy this drama. My best recommendation is to not pay much attention to the kidnapping plot line. I really feel like it holds the drama back from being really good. Despite the story not being strong, I think a lot of people will still enjoy this drama. I think this is one of those dramas, that you have to watch without paying too much attention to the plot and just enjoy it. Because once you start to pay attention to it, it will fall apart.

That being said, if you like a swoon worthy male lead and a badass female lead who kicks ass then you'll love this drama. If you like your story strong, tight, and with good pacing then this might not be the drama for you.

This show was trying to go in too many different directions at the same time but ended up being a heavy-handed romantic snooze fest with flashes of mostly bland humor and drama.
There never really seemed to be any sense of urgency to catch the bad guy.
How inept and pointless was that police force?
The real villains of this show are the writers by keeping the character of Do Bong Soon subordinate to the male lead whom she eventually marries, which shows a severe lack of imagination for a female character with super human strength.
I expected more ""girl power"" and female badassery from this show.
Other than being physically attractive, I saw no reason for the leads to be together.
I lost it when the bomb transformed into a fireworks display.

This drama was a total chore to finish. There are several flaws, main one being the writing. The different aspects of the story/plot do not mesh well at all too many different genres are thrown into the mix (thriller/detective/gangsters/comedy/romance/drama).

The thriller aspect with kidnapper storyline just becomes tiresome halfway through, with the usual moronic police investigation/constant mistakes in capturing the uninspired villain.

I found the comedy scenes totally unfunny and embarrassing.

The romance was ruined for me by the coy and overly cutesy acting by Park Bo Young. I am not a fan of ayego.

My biggest problem with this drama was the main female lead Do Bong Soon. I disliked her thoroughly and cannot understand how others found her likable and described her as an admirable strong woman. For me she is nothing but a two-faced, passive aggressive bully. She casually assaults people and then acts all sweet and innocent as if butter wouldn't melt. I found her hypocrisy a total turn off. She is smug and rude to her superiors at work. She bullied and assaulted people everywhere she went, if it had been a man doing these things everyone would have been up in arms . By the end of the drama I started to dislike the actress as well - as it is her portrayal not just the writing that i found so unpleasant.

Other things I did not like:-
- the contrived love triangle which went nowhere and made me question why it was introduced it in the first place.
- the way DBS mother treated her husband was totally unacceptable. If I were him I would have divorced that useless harridan in an instant.
- the main male lead's besotted act went rapidly from cute to cringe.
- the cliched depiction of the gay character.

All in all an utter disappointment I had looked forward to this drama as the 3 main leads were all on my like list but after this debacle I will have to rethink my stance.

I am not very sure why this drama has such high ratings and reviews because, frankly, I was very disappointed. To be fair, I was coming in with expectations that this drama would be memorable and one of the best I have ever seen. It was neither. Was this a comedy? No. Was this a thriller? No. Was this a romance? I guess, but no. Was this a romantic comedy? Not really. Cause the comedy did not have anything to do with relationships.

The strengths of this drama:
1) The actors played it very well. The main ""love triangle"" and the antagonist were done quite well. This is mainly because of acting ability and not due to the writing of the drama.
2) Even though common troupes were used, they touched upon it in a sensitive and realistic manner. To expand upon this point, when the second lead's girlfriend began to ""waver"" she did not straight up just cheat on him and his friend did not automatically turn his back on him. She was up front with her opinions to her current boyfriend. He was also hesitant to pursue anything since he was friends with her ex-boyfriend. Often times you see characters that just follow the plot and don't follow logic. My second point is the common troupe of the second lead that realizes his love too late. This is one of the most over-used plots in dramas and should be done away with. However, they added a nice touch by focusing on his anguish and how he expresses his feelings to both partners of the new couple.

My main problems with this drama:
1) The lack of defined plot. There were approximately 3 main plot lines and 6-8 side plots that were just poorly written or poorly handled. Can any viewer definitively tell me every plot and its resolution? I felt the need to skip over certain plots because they dragged on and did not have any importance or significance to the story at all. Firstly, as soon as I started watching I knew that the two leads would end up together and the second lead would get snubbed. Not even trying to change the plot line. Of course it had to be selfish rich guy that changes and cares only for her and does things behind her back until she coincidentally finds out and they fall in love. Instead of the person that she had liked for 7 years and just missed saving her by a step. Always. I could have not watched this drama at all and told you the plot ""twists"" and ""endings."" Oh wow, family issues when it shows that her mom does absolutely nothing and emotionally abuses her father? Wow, how new and insightful with 0 character development or relevance. Oh wow, it turns out she gets her powers again and instead of living in fear of using it, which she never was by the way, becomes a hero and helps people. Wow, so new.

2) The amount of random comic-relief side characters is ridiculous. The only serious characters in this story are the main three characters, the serial killer, the brother and his love interest. Every single other character was there for comic relief or not relevant enough to remember their names. I don't know what the purpose of all these characters is. And I don't understand how this drama can confuse quality characters with a hundred random useless characters. Can anyone tell me the name of the mob boss? How about the secretary's name? How about the name of the school gang leader?
3) This drama was boring. There were definitely highlights and extremely important moments to remember but the fact is that due to the mixing of multiple overall plots and the usage of comic relief characters, it takes away from the character development of the main characters and the main plot. After watching the thrilling portions of the drama, didn't you want to know what happened next? Not wait until next episode for there to be development and have to wade through a sea of nonsense and random fighting or shopping scenes. How about after a romantic scene, shouldn't there be build up towards the main plot? However, every time there was a transition between genres there was meaning lost. For example, do you remember why the murder killed the first girl? Most people will forget that important plot point cause it was submerged under a ton of other nonsense. Secondly, do you remember who was the first suspect for threatening the President (Hyunsik)? All of these major plot points become nothing once you have a hundred of them that drag on and do absolutely nothing to build upon each other.

Overall, for everyone saying this is worth watching, let me ask you this: is this a drama that you would watch again? Is this the drama you will remember in 10 years? I don't think so. There are many better dramas than this. Just because you like Hyunsik or Ji Soo or Park Bo Young does not mean this is a good drama. In my personal opinion, this was a very poorly written drama that could be fleshed out and narrowed down.

I don't even know where to being omg.
The first two episodes were nice, the story started good and at the end we were given a side-plot that looked very promising -also it was interesting to see something completely different from the cute, lighthearted main plot.-
As the episodes progressed, the problems began.. on one hand we had the queerbaiting and homophobic comments, on other hand we had the domestic violence thing; which I don't think should be a theme to laugh at. (I mean, if you're going to have it in the story, make it a way to bring awareness to it, don't use it as something that's supposed to be funny??)
More episodes in, the interesting side-plot I mentioned before turned into something completely creepy; and the contrast with the main plot was huuuge (plus if you were looking for an easy to watch, lighthearted drama, trust me this isn't it.)
And of course, to make things even worse, the fillers that no one cared about turned into another side-plot, yay! but nooo this time it didn't even make sense at all ?? you can totally take it off the drama and it won't change anything (trust me in this one, starting from ep 10 I think, I started skipping it and surprise surprise nothing changed)
Everything in this drama was a mess, the storyline got completely wrecked and by the end nothing made sense. The only thing that made me keep watching was the main couple (trust me, I included it in my otp list on tumblr) but not even that was enough to save this drama.
It's a shame such a good actors and such a cool pairing with a lot of chemistry was stuck in such an awful drama, I had a lot of expectations for this one because hell yeah a super strong woman as main character is something I wanted to watch, but, as I said earlier, not even the actors or the chemistry between them could save this for me.

Lots of slapstick without much growth
If you like slapstick comedy and silly misunderstandings as the basis for relationships, then this will fit the bill. This type of set-up isn't my cup of tea and I find it rather annoying because it doesn't fuel much depth or growth in or between characters. I don't mind a little, especially at the beginning of a show, but then I prefer a show to move into more meaningful interactions as characters build relationships with each other and share their stories and thoughts with us.

Even with the overuse of slapstick and misunderstandings, this show could have been great if each resolution to a misunderstanding included a script with depth in which the characters share their true feelings, insights, and histories with each other. Unfortunately, the interactions and dialogue stayed very shallow. We never get to understand the characters' perspectives on their family drama, their own insecurities, or their feelings for each other. This simply isn't written into the script.

Despite the high ratings, this was a disappointment for me. I kept waiting for a deep conversation where the characters actually learn about each other, have heartfelt conversations with their families, and grow more in love, but it never came.

This was all set up to be one of my most favorite dramas ever! So how did it only make a final overall of 8?



Story (7.5):

I'll start with that I really enjoyed the first half more than the second half, even though the blossoming relationship was really great to see and there was great chemistry between the actors that didn't show up as much in the first half.

However, there were just enough overly ridiculous elements to this drama that it just couldn't get the 10 I so wanted to give to it after the first few episodes.

The main reasons include: stupid gangsters, stupid police, stupid ""professional"" workers, stupid comedy, stupid monk, stupid jokes...

The other reasons include: unnecessary gangsters, unnecessary ""professional"" workers, unnecessary stupid comedy, entirely unnecessary monk, unnecessary stupid jokes... And too little Ji Soo (only kind of kidding).

I enjoyed some of the comedy and loved to laugh at this drama, but it just got more and more ridiculous.

I don't want to bash on this drama too much because I really, really enjoyed it especially every scene that had: Park Bo Young, Park Hyung Shik, Ji Soo; and also didn't have: Kim Won Hae, Im Won Hee.

However, the final deal breaker was the final scene of the final episode, which episode I really enjoyed on so many levels and really didn't enjoy on some other levels.

It was great to see some last scenes with a sadly 2d but amazingly acted villain, and the result of relationship between mains was just the cherry on top... But then they had to go in and throw that last scene in which you see some irresponsibility with some mumbo jumbo about the world which I admit looked cool, but the more I thought about it the more I felt it didn't fit with the character...

*SIGH* That probably took away at least 0.5 off of my final score.



Acting/Cast (10):

Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Shik were aMAzing together, and having Ji Soo in there was just a great plus. The rest of the casting was great too, especially from the villain! and even from the overly ridiculous characters as they played it how they should have, even if I didn't exactly enjoy it all.



Music (7.5):

I guess I should also mention the music... It wasn't anything spectacular that I loved; the Love you love you song was fine and actually a really decent song, but nothing unique. Some people may like the Trouble song too, but not my cup of tea.



Rewatch Value (8.0):

For rewatch... I could re-watch a lot of the scenes over and over, and in truth I watched the majority of the drama twice, one raw and once with subs; but I think most of my rewatching will only be done on the first half, especially if it's full episodes.



Overall (8.0):

Wish I could have given it a 10, but had enough filler comedy I just couldn't deal. Still a great drama and recommended!

As another reviwer had already stated, this show tried to be too much. Though I did enjoy the first couple of episodes quite a lot, the second half of the series just seemed to he quite a drag, and at times I found myself quite irritated at certain episodes, so much so I decided to just skip through each episode to find the satisfaction that I had from the first half of the series.

Seriously though, you have a plot that appears to be solid when in reality it was actually very flawed. Majority of the characters ended up just being annoying. Basically, the whole premise of the show was terrible in my opinion. Here you have a psychopath who ends up abducting girls with the reason being that he was a fan of play, then you have a bunch of stupid police who cant keep up with the criminal; constantly making mistake after mistake. The girls being abducted are done so (not coincidentally) IN THE SAME AREA, though nothing special has been done to prevent further crimes and so more abductions occur. Then you see a seemingly rebellious Gook Doo who, even after being told not to do certain stuff, does so anyway (spoiler) and apparently he just isnt resilient enough, loses his objective at hand, BECAUSE, fFS, if you notice THE AMOUNT OF TIMES that sOooOOO MANY people have looked into the junkyard to no avail, omg, that irritated me soooo much, lile, if you're going to be a rebellious cop for the good of the town atleast be thorough with it and don't do a half assed job.

Moving onto Bong Soons mother... wow... at the beginning I did see how her attitude towards her husband was an attempt to be comical, then after a while it was just plain abuse, wtf xD, it was legitimately only an abuisive relationship; it was funny the first time, but when that sort of irrelevant thing is included into a show, not only does it get irritating from being repetitive, it actually is worrying ahaha.

I fail to understand the hype over this drama; granted, the cutesy relationship between AMH and DBS was worth watching, but Ifeel like people overlooked the fact that the plot was terrible

I am extremely surprised by seeing the amount of hate this drama is getting. I mean its not even that bad.
it has a nice comedy, romance and thrilling experience.
Both the protagonist did a great job, acting/cast was a 10/10. park bo young and park hyung si are both such sweethearts.
You will fall in love with the characters.
Music was also good, I really liked the heartbeat song, it was a bit catchy.
Okay I agree that the story was a bit all over the places, and could have been more definite. They mixed a lot of plots and tried to make it interesting but still you can watch it.
It's a sweet and simple drama.
I can rewatch this because the chemistry between the characters is strong.
Also if you are looking for something not too much, just something simple to laugh and swoon on,
strong woman is for you.

Park Bo Young and her dramas have been a revelation of sorts.The first Korean Movie i liked was Speedy Scandal/Scandal Makers and she had a main role in it .While she was good,she looked pretty raw in it and her come back in dramas (Oh my Ghostess and now this show) show a sea change in her acting abilities .She can now lead shows effortlessly and SWDBS will be one landmark female empowerment show!

Pros :

1. Superb Direction :The director never treats this as a TV show and fills in visual after visual of great beauty and marshals his actors so well.I am now committed to watching any show this PD makes (recently watched Miracle we met!)

2. Casting and Performances : PBY was superb and I also found Park Hyung Sik underplayed his character (he was basically the damsel in distress in this one!) It takes guts to take up this kind of a character and he did it with aplomb.Jin goo also acquitted himself quite well.The support cast was awesome too.

3. Story and writing : This was the first tv show to warm me up to the idea of female superheroes and a lot of credit goes to the writer's efforts who made the character of DBS so interesting

4. OST : Some of the songs and their use was awesome in this

5. Excellent comedy : The comedy in this is hillarious and the scenes bring a smile to your face instantaneously

6. OTP : The initial pics never showed a great pair potential but both the leads worked superbly together

7. Great Ending : I have seen many great dramas run out of steam at end.The ending of this show satisfied me while still looking forward to a season 2..

I have to say I totally fell in love with this drama. But it does have Park Bo Young in it and she floors me! There have been so many reviews on this I would really not go into much detail about that except a few key points. Park Bo Young Plays Bong Soon, the super strong heroine that is so adorable and lovable that when she cries a piece of you dies inside! Park Hyung Shik plays Ahn Min Hyuk or Min Min, Bong Soon's handsome lovable boss, he is actually a pretty fun love interest I definitely rooted for throughout the show. Besides this there were quite a few interesting characters that were super fun or you would just like to disappear like Jang Mi Kwan who played Kim Jang Hyuk the main sicko bad guy! I love Bong Soon's family, the dynamic between the mother and father was quite amusing. One person who keeps popping up is Ji Soo who plays Guk Doo, Bong Soon's childhood crush, he annoys me only because he keeps getting in the way of Bong Soon and Min Min. But from this point on I will refer someone who has been friend zoned as being gukked lol. One other character I would like to discuss is Kim Won Hae who plays Kim Kwang Bok [Baek Tak Group gangster] and Oh Dol Pyu [Ainsoft employee]. Now I saw him in the drama Black and loved him as the hard ass detective in that but oh my he plays a different part in this which was hilarious, totally loved it!!!!!

Anyway I had a really great time watching the whole drama unfold especially the romantic interests between Bong Soon and Min Min, Min Min was hilarious later in the relationship you could tell he was really smitten with Bong Soon but really who wouldn't be. It's funny, more than a few times in the series when Bong Soon rescues people she is described as and angel when people give their account to the police and really that may be a perfect description. Just like in Oh My Ghostess it is hard not to fall in love with Park Bo Young's characters, she just is that damn good!

Now I'm just going to sit around missing all the characters wishing they make a part 2 but knowing they probably won't :'(

It's my 3rd time watching Strong Woman Do Bong Soon as I'm writing this review.
 In order for you to find this drama enjoyable you must consider what type of drama it is. As you already must have seen, the drama is under ""Action, Thriller, Comedy, Romance, Supernatural and Investigation"" which might sound pretty much like a big mess. But personally I think they did quite a good job including all these genres. The drama has the typical Korean drama love line. If you enjoy the typical love triangle and the main cast falling in love with each other, this drama might be your new love! Do you enjoy cute things? If so, I believe that is one more reason for you to love this drama. Especially the main characters and the music in the drama is very cute. Do you enjoy super hero stories? Do you like to see once in a while a strong female character? Do you enjoy watching crime/investigation scenes? (But not to the level of crime focused dramas) Then, again this might be the right drama for you to watch.

Some more aspects:
Characters: Cute main characters, very interesting variety of supporting characters.
Character development: Not that much, most characters seem to stick to their personalities (which could be a positive thing as even in real life people don't change that easily)
Story line: Slightly messy, but acceptable for its genre that is not to be taken too seriously. Quite predictable, which might be a big minus for some people expecting more creativity with the story line.

Overall, I think this is a type of drama that you could know from the very first episode if this will be the type of drama you would like to watch. It's not the case with all the dramas, but in this case it seems to be possible to judge based on the first episode.

This review may contain spoilers
weak weak writing
The reason I decided to write this years after it was released and years after I watched it because I keep hearing the main characters name as the poster child of strong women. And as per usual for ranting reviews, this is pretty spoiler heavy.

Romance parts were your run of the mill, cliche, tried and tested kdrama formula; it was cute, it was fun and it was light.
The rest, I had a lot of problems.

A user said that this was an easy-to-watch drama. I disagree. It was very hard for me. In fact, I rated screenwriter Baek Mi Gyeong bad after finishing this. A lot of things in drama were either plain wrong and/or used for cheap laughs.

From now on; my rant starts.

Do Bong Sun's desk at the company. What the hell was that? It was a toy desk, maybe suitable for children going to primary school or younger but no older. From my point of view, giving her that desk was the same as saying ""I do not respect you or your work but I am indulging you"". It was like those punishment rooms I heard about korean companies that they send people to drive them to quit. How can anyone feel respected and wanted working on a desk like that when everyone else have.. appropriate working environment?

Hospitalized gang and the school gang. Why oh why did they keep showing them? It was not funny seeing a grown man salivate and people groaning or keep getting hurt. It was definitely not sad or impactful (the way it was presented).
And the school gang.. I first thought oh she is going to reform them, teaching to be valued members of society or something. But then they kept showing them acting like delinquents; shouting, fighting gangsters, skipping school... you know, the reason she beat them (and then took them under her wings) in the first place. So, the way it was presented is like She is enabling them instead of showing her affecting her surroundings positively. Intentional?

Only time those groups were ""arguably"" important for the story was the first encounter of the gangsters where Min Min first saw and became intrigued about Bong Bong, and the last scenes where gangsters told them how the criminal was going to escape and that he has a sniper rifle, and when Bong Bong asked school gang to post the criminals pictures online.
All the rest of the scenes with these groups are in are either filled with saliva, pain or acts of delinquency; all of them played for cheap laughs.
And the thing is; all the rest of the time you showed us these groups could have been used to show more important things (IMO). Like Bong Gi and Hui Ji. They seemed to be more mature than our mains and I can't help but think that their story and resolution would have made the drama richer.
Or the parents. They kept showing Chil Gu bruised right until the end and at the end they just told us ""no, Jin Yi was not beating him"" and then just let go of that story. Why not show us their relationship?

Oh and just to be clear; the character Bong Bong is not written any good either. The mechanics of her power is all over the place. Bong Bong bullied, hurt and scared people using her power from the first episode and the ONLY time she was unaware she was using her power on an undeserving person she lost her power? So it doesn't matter if undeserving people get hurt with her power unless the scene is funny? Or everyone who is mean to her deserves everything that happens to them? Her uses of her power ranges from scaring, bullying people to practically crippling them.

All I can say is;
Weak writing Ms. Baek Mi Gyeong.

My favorite drama of the year so far. I love the cast and the way everyone works so well with each other. The chemistry between Bo Young and Hyung Sik really got me shook to the core. I found certain aspects of this show lacking, but honestly I was willing to overlook it because it wasn't anything that I found extremely alarming. I will say though, these damn drama cops are really f*cking stupid?! But also I had another issue with how it seemed like they suddenly dumbed down the culprit to get to the ending. Especially as he was working them and deceived them so well. Also [redacted] was kinda frustrating because [redacted] eventually happened therefore I find it so unbelievable that it even happened in the first place. But whatever let's talk about how Ahn Minhyuk is THE PERFECT boyfriend! Ugghhh I love him. JiSoo baby, you'll get to be the first lead one day and you'll get the girl but at no point was I rooting for you to get Bong Soon in this series, not even remotely. SUCH A GREAT DRAMA THOUGH. WATCH IT.

Shows like this are why I watch Asian dramas. No, there are not a lot of shows about pint sized female superheroes, but there are plenty of shows that make me laugh, swoon, and cheer. Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is such and adorably entertaining show, you almost forget what a great message it contains about not judging a person's abilities by how they look. I always love a strong, positive message that never comes across as preachy.

And, what a sweet romance! Not only did the man fall in love with her at first sight, but he also knows about her abilities from the first episode and finds her more attractive because of it. It's also nice how patient he was while Bong Soon sorted out her feelings for another man. The Male lead in this drama was definitely too sweet to be true.

I DIDNT FINIISH THIS DRAMA. Okay there's your warning. I got to like ep 6 before I dropped it. I just found this drama highly offensive. Yes I know it's a comedy, but so is weightlifting fairy and sassy go go, and I wasn't offended by those. Why was I offended? One was bong soons character. Yes the everso adorable bong soon. Being cute doesn't make you a good character. Sorry. I have seen super hero movies and you know a pattern I've noticed super heroes typically deal with super villains, as in their strengths are matched. But let's say you're the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and deal with smaller crimes, spider man still manages not to put people in the hospital for 6 months even tho he could. Cuz you know thievery just doesn't really equate to a six month hospital trip. Yes she fights for justice, but the way she does it I equate to the people that cut off someone's hand for stealing something (ok not that bad but you get the point) the punishments she gives doesn't match the crime. ""But she hasn't learned how to master her power!"" people say. HOW OLD IS SHE??? How has she NOT learned to master her power?? But that's enough on bong soon, let's move on to min hyuk. He drove me crazy too because in his own way he was pretty sexist too (yes gook du isn't the only sexist male on this show). He hires bong soon basically because she's pretty, and from what I've seen, doesn't even require her to do her job. They basically go on day long dates. Oh and when he's actually in danger he protects her!!! As a woman I find this offensive that a male would hire me on looks, and not on skills. Or even worse knows I have the skills but won't let me use them, so he can ""protect"" me, even though it's MY job to protect HIM. And the whole gay thing. If I was watching and was gay I'd probs be offended ""I'm glad my sexual orientation is one of the only means of humor this show can think of...thanks..."" speaking of gay, gook du. I'm pretty sure he was secretly gay, cuz man some of those scenes...also I started this drama for ji soo, and you give me THAT character??? No personality, is incredibly sexist, boring, and overall a jerk??? Like I can't tell if it was bad acting or writing. Either way I expect better. You know who was another awful character? The mom. She literally suggested to bong soon to rape min hyuk. ""Use your power and get him laid!"" Ummmmm they think he's gay at this point...so he wouldn't be willing....so that equals rape. But I forgot this is comedy, how dare I be offended by this. Apparently I should take this as comedy but be enraged by Trumps locker room talk. How I love double standards *sarcasm* last but not least the pacing sucked. One moment it's slapstick the next its thriller. I've been noticing this blend in dramas lately. DRAMA MAKERS THIS IS A TERRIBLE COMBO! Just please stop it, do us all a favor. Alright that's the end of my review/vent. Overall despite its supposed cuteness, I found this drama to be downright terrible and offensive.

This review may contain spoilers
I honestly have no idea how I was able to continue watching until the end.
*contains a lot of small details that may be spoilers. Read at your own risk.*

There are so many little details to criticize and talk about in this series that would probably take me hours to write, so I'll just pick out the most important parts and summarize it. But with the mixed reviews of high and low ratings, I understand that it depends entirely up to each person's preference and personal taste. Here's my personal take.

THE ROMANCE:
I can enjoy some cliche and endure a little bit of cringe so I was able to stomach those moments and just gobble it up as it is. I found Bong Soon and Min Hyuk's relationship at the end pretty cute despite being over the top sugar cringe for many. I personally think their relationship gradually blossomed and it was a natural (and quite predictable) course of events. I think that was the sole focus of the whole story and therefore has the most proper development. BUT, before I got to enjoy that taste, I had to endure the horrifyingly out of place and annoying love triangle. I'm a HUGE sucker for well-done love triangles, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't even bat an eye on this one even if I wanted to. The love triangle scenes got my eyes rolling I just wanted to get it over with. Gook Doo's dense character felt unnatural and was a bit hard to sympathize with. It just didn't feel right. The other characters' romance were barely given any screen time, and rightfully so cause it wasn't even... anything special. In fact it was so shallow. Some guy holds someone else's girlfriend's hand and just like that she's in love. Girl you thirsty??

THE COMEDY:
The slapstick comedy is a hit or miss and is solely reliant on each person's sense of humor. I would admit that I laughed out loud on some particular scenes, mostly on the circumstances and their facial expressions (like Min Hyuk's secretary's high-key scared expressions, or the gang in the hospital's interactions). I know my boyfriend is a huge fan of exaggerated comedy like this, and when we watched a few of the hospital scenes together (Kim Won-Hae is one of our favorite actors) he was dying on his chair. After awhile of being repetitive though, it gets tiring and unnecessarily placed in awkward transitions, so I personally skipped them because it served no actual meaning or purpose to the plot anymore. Most of the side characters are there for comic relief, and tbh some of it is actually unbearable. I think they tried to make Bong Soon's parents' relationship one of those comical gags, but the portrayal was plain domestic violence and made me feel more concerned instead of relieved. Some of the characters were also static and exaggeratedly stereotypical that their sole purpose of existence was just that, to be pointless comical background characters with no personality aside from that one trait or stereotype they were given. Other than that, they are not memorable and the plot would've still moved the same without them. It's quite sad.

THE SUSPENSE:
The first time they laid out the mystery, it seemed exciting. The president needs a bodyguard, meanwhile the neighborhood is having a dreadful serial kidnapping case. Who could this person be? Is it connected?
I was hoping there would be some grand plot twist in the end. But all we get is an underwhelmingly forgettable mystery plots. The president's mystery case had very little impact and was painfully predictable (Oh, did you say he trusts one of his brothers? You don't say...). The other mystery was also not very memorable and was there for... basically nothing?? The motives behind the culprit was just... questionable. It'll leave you asking... that's it? that's all there is to it? It was beyond underwhelming. Imagine you were having a good night sleep and dreaming of something really nice and some random drunk dude decided to wake you up. That's how aggravatingly useless the point was.

THE CHARACTERS:
Honestly, this whole series revolved only around the relationship of the two main characters Bong Soon and Min Hyuk (just their relationship, barely the character development). The rest of the characters are given one trait that you could summarize in one sentence and that was that. Gook Doo is a dense and upfront policeman who only realized he likes his childhood friend too late. The mother is an abusive b*tch whose actions are never justified and her whole character is intolerable. The father loves his daughter very much and is constantly abused for.. being a good father and hardworking husband?? The brother is a nice doctor. Gook Doo's ex being lowkey thirsty. The gay employee being... gay? Yah.

THE GAMING COMPANY:
Okay so I'm fully aware this is the most useless subplot they have that people shouldn't even pay attention to and blindly follow through, but as an artist who knows a thing or two about game development, I felt really confused and triggered about this whole subplot of Bong Soon wanting to work for a game company. She wanted to develop a game with herself as the main character. First of all, as far as I know, you can't get hired for just your ideas. You need to be able to DO something. What exactly can she do? All I see was her trying to decide on weapons of her character model by clicking the screen... I have so many questions... Is that on photoshop? What exactly are you clicking? Who drew your model? Are you the artist? Then why is she drawing with a goddamn MOUSE??? What exactly is the planning and development team? Planning sounds like project management, development sounds like programming.. but those two are usually different teams as well..? I'm a little confused.
The most accurate portrayal was Min Hyuk drawing her character on a tablet. Yes, that's how you do digital art. Wait, the president can draw--?? Is that what he contributes to the com- WHAT?
Holdup it's not even the biggest bullshit I've seen: After she pitches her game, few weeks later it's ALREADY OUT? Do these people know planning takes months and coding can take years??? How is it out alre- HOW??????
Anyway, I know these are very minor details but I would have at least appreciated if the writers did a little research on the basics of making a game or at least consult someone who works at one.


OVERALL
Overall, I think the bad outweighs the good points in this drama. There were too many things that the writers wanted to do and so they packed almost all the genres in this drama and it just became a complete chaotic mess. The main plot was underwhelming, the subplots were pointless, the characters forgettable and underdeveloped, the comedy and romance were tolerable at best. The transitions were jarring and sometimes confusing. Every theme was fighting each other to overpower the other but they all ended up mediocre and exhausted.

Halfway through I asked myself why I was still watching this, and I really thought about the answer. There was nothing that kept me going. Nothing that made me want to continue. I was simply bored.
I've given my two cents and have stated my concerns/opinions so you can figure things out on your own.
The verdict of this is drama being worth a try is entirely up to your taste.

Quite disappointing
Story: A love triangle mixed with gangsters & a serial murderer. A superhero theme with mediocre plot and too many unnecessary side characters. Bong soon‚Äôs character wasn‚Äôt loveable but I forgive her because she‚Äôs too cute. I love PBY but I really don‚Äôt get how she chooses her scripts. Her characters are always terrible. The only good thing about this drama is PHS/Min min. All side characters are skippable. Disgusting, even.

Acting: Acting wise, they all did good. The plot is just what‚Äôs wrong with this drama. Such a letdown.

Music: nothing worth remembering.

Rewatch value: what you see on Instagram reels, short clips on YouTube or tiktok, those were the only highlights of the drama. Nothing much to see, unfortunately.

Overall: A 4-5 for me. Min min saved this drama along with bong bong‚Äôs cuteness even when she was being annoying. That‚Äôs it. I hate to review this but I felt like I wasted a day of my life from watching this. Those short clips you see online would make you look forward to this but ended up being disappointed because it has nothing much to offer. If I have to summarize the message of this drama it would be about not bullying the weak and policemen are useless.

First of all: If you don't like exaggerated special effects and a woman who doesn't need help of men, then this is not your drama.

And now, let me start praising this wonderful drama.

Storywise, it's a mix. You won't find one consistent story, it's more like multiple storylines progressing separately and slowly connecting to each other. I personally, in comparison with a lot of other people here, though that this was really well done. I loved the mix of funny, cute and super tense and gloomy scenes. Since yes. There is a crime story and in my eyes it was a really great one. I also am a huge fan of the ""a woman who's not weak and helpless but actually is there to save the dudes"" concept. And even tho she's like that, the romance is super adorable and cute and even as a not hardcore romance fan like me, it was really enjoyable because their chemistry is great.

The cast was really good, there wasn't a single actor I disliked, everyone fitted their roles and did a good job. I also loved how their offscreen chemistry was really good. And btw, I think this drama had one of the most impressive antagonists (the kidnapper) ever. The actor was amazing.

And now. The soundtrack. It's really really really really amazing. Each song is great, and there truly are a lot of songs in this two-part OST.

So in total, this was a cute, funny drama, with a lot of exciting and shocking scenes. For me it was a perfect mix and guys I mean: A handsome man being the CEO of a gaming company? Dream husband. In general the setting in the gaming company was just perfect, I loved all the funny scenes and cracked up quite often. And let's not forget about the bromance scenes....which were quite interesting...
Thank for this drama, and may you always be the superhero the world needs, Do Bong Soon.

cringefest
rewatched it after 2 years because despite disliking it in the first watch, my friends were crazy after this show and i wanted to understand the hype and what i was missing. but my ratings dropped from 7 to 1. gets as cringey as it can get. worst comedic scenes i have ever seen had to skip most of them because of how embarrassing they were. plot literally made no sense at all. and the couple was honestly way too over the top. i am sorry but the female lead acting like a 5 y/o talking in an extremely childish way does not make it adorable for me lmfao. and their relationship literally had no growth too like what exactly did they do except missing their work all the time to go on dates and they got married after like one month of knowing each other?

Had a great starting but was disappointed towards the end.



Lets talk about the positive points of the story first:

Starting was really good. It was comical, absurd, funny and interesting. The theme itself is interesting and the character of Bong Soon was well thought. I can see her character development throughout the drama and it kept me going. The ending was wholesomely satisfying with conclusion for each character. It's generally a light-hearted drama with exaggerated comedy. There are many fluttering moments for the two leads that you'll enjoy as much as I do.



Next, the negative points:

I felt that the drama wasted so much time on other unnecessary details/segments like the gangster and high school students part (especially the monk). I understand that the writer may want to lighten up the mood, with drama going on for other characters, but then its really excessive. They could have put the time into creating more detailed and intense climax. Every time the leads come across the kidnapper, the details become so slipshod that I cannot ignore the loopholes.

Other story that could have been more detailed: Hee Ji's presence, Bong Soon's parents' cold war



Like many others, I really love BongBong (Boyoung) and MinMin (Hyungsik) so much. To be honest, the romance and chemistry between them is the major point that kept me going after episode 11. Gookdu (Jisoo) is kind of being wasted in this drama, he is just there as a catalyst for the leads to fall in love, I wasn't able to see Jisoo's potential as an actor (hope he will get a better character next time). Casts did generally OK and suitable to their roles. Characters that shone in the drama are BongBong, MinMin and Oh Dol Pyung and the respective actors did well!



The OST Superpower Girl is super super suitable for the drama, fun and positive, really suitable for whenever Bong Soon is displaying her strength. Songs are apt to the situations in the drama but there aren't any outstanding OSTs (only Superpower Girl).



I have enjoyed it in general, did not regret watching it despite some major disappointments. And that game Super Bong Sunnie looks really fun.....

I do not get why this show is so overrated. It‚Äôs quite boring to me. This show is nothing more than a typical stupid love story of a cute girl and a rich boy. The only plus to this drama is Park Bo Young cuteness and the main couple chemistry. Instead of wasting your time watch the whole series, I would recommend you guys to go on YouTube and watch the Cut videos of this series. After 7 or 8 cuts of 5 minutes each, I believe that you have finished The Whole series.

Okej that the first thought that comes to mine mind when somebody asks about this drama. Just ok.

Cute, charming actors... relatively satisfied with their performance.
The story itself had a few flaws, but it's nice for a change that the female is strong enough not to be pulled by her wrist.

Well, good to past time when you have nothing else to watch. I don't know what but something is missing

This is actually a good korean drama. Not that great, but it's good.

The story is not that great actually. However, I do like the idea of DBS who is a strong woman and it is focused on women empowerment. I just don't like how there are scenes that is actually not needed in the second half of the drama, makes me feel like the writer got lazy on making surprising and unique scenes, there are also cliche outcomes on some scenes, that's why I already expected what is going to happen and it really did. The gang scenes are funny at first but in the second half of the drama, it is pretty annoying now. But other than that, the last 2 episodes had a great improvement. I just wanted unique that can make the viewers go ""WOW!"". There are some gay jokes that is a bit offensive but some of it are funny. The funny scenes really made me laugh out loud though and some scenes made me cry. What I love the most are the couple scenes. They are so cute and they have a great chemistry. When it comes to the cutest couple, it goes to DBS and AMH. I would've wished that they minimize the gang scenes and focus more on the couple and the thriller scenes.

I love their acting! I love the chemistry of Park Bo Young and Park Hyung-sik. It felt like they are couples for real that their acting is so natural. THANK YOU FOR PAIRING THEM. Park Bo Young is the cutest woman alive and Park Hyung-sik's smile and stare is so adorable, cute and charming! Other casts did so well at acting too.

Some songs are cute, some songs are great, some songs are not memorable.

I would rewatch for the 2nd time, but if I can watch for the 3rd time and so forth, I would skip some scenes that are not needed. I just can't help but watch the cute couple!

This a very typical and predictable korean drama. What you see is what you get. It has many funny moments but the story is extremely stretched out that it gets kind of boring at times. The characters are interesting and the acting is amazing. However , I personally didn't enjoy it much since I felt like I already watched it a thousand times before. I would recommend it if you're new to korean dramas and haven't already watched many romcoms. Overall , it's has an original plot but lacks originality when it comes to the progression of the story. 4/10

The plot seemed promising, but the chaotic writing ruined the potential of this drama, in my opinion. The dark plotline with the serial kidnapper didn't fit in with the rest of the drama at all. It made the whole thing too messy, giving a weird feeling to the viewer, instead of completely pulling them into the story .
The cute moments sometimes seemed like they were coming out of nowhere, which made the blossoming of the romance feel a bit out of place. That was made worse by the love triangle, that was installed, but barely used (waaaaeee?)
By focusing on too many  plotlines with very different genres, the writers made it difficult to get into the story and I ended up finishing the drama by skipping most of the scenes.

I was also really annoyed by the underlying homophobia in this drama. I understand that homosexuality is a taboo subject in Korea and LGBT people aren't easily accepted by their peers yet. But I found the lame jokes and ridiculous portrayal of gay men simply embarassing to watch (and not funny at all).

The competitive relationship between the male leads  was fun to watch, but the love triangle was forgotten quite quickly, as Gook Doo got absorbed in the ""crazy criminal"" plotline.
The setting of the drama got me really excited at first (Ainsoft / video game making), but it didn't add much to the story in the end, which wasalso a bit of a waste.

All that being said, I thought the two leads were really cute and I did enjoy their scenes together (lots of fluff!). They made a really lovely couple and their cuteness is what made me finish the drama, even though I wanted to drop it.

Basically, I believe this drama could have been a great rom/com, if the numerous plotlines and inconsistency in the story hadn't messed it up. If you love cheesy romance and don't mind the messy writing / not always tasteful humour, you'll probably enjoy it.

An insult to women and men at the same time
This is surely the worst drama that I have ever watched and it's not because of the production value (which is very impressive sometimes), it's because of its awful writing. This drama is an instant drop in the first two episodes. I dropped it when it came out in 2017, but I made myself a promise to finish it one day, so here we go.
Let's start with the bad (there's a lot ‚Äì I should have made notes while watching):
- Do Bong Soon's character is the typical fake strong female character. We start with Do Bong Soon helping an elderly man and saving a bus, which are very heroic feats, but the character goes downhill very quickly. Do Bong Soon eventually becomes CEO Ahn Min Hyuk's bodyguard. She completely fails at being a bodyguard. She lets the CEO get hurt because of her, she lets a cop get hurt and she also lets the villain escape multiple times. The writers completely failed to recognize that she heard the main villain's voice at a pharmacy. When girls start getting kidnapped in her neighbourhood, she does nothing. When her friend almost gets kidnapped, she lets the kidnapper go even though she could knock him down in one hit. Why? After some time, Do Bong Soon is an intern at her own personal Planning & Development department with the CEO. Once again, we see her doing nothing all day. If she is shown doing anything, it's working on the same character model and drag and dropping things into a presentation. This was a missed opportunity to show women working in game engines and programming, but instead they showed us a pathetic character who thinks she deserves to be in the actual Planning & Development department without any actual skills... After Kyung Shim gets kidnapped, she goes to beg Min Hyuk for help and then completely invalidates his feelings. After Do Bong Soon rescues kidnapped women (at a location which only took everyone ages to figure out), she goes on to confront the main villain in a dramatic way that makes her lose her strength (even though she basically abused her power all throughout the drama and even hurt innocent people). After losing her strength, she is absolutely useless. She goes unconscious from two blows to the chest and she doesn't even try to free herself from her restrains at the brink of death. She does nothing but cry even though she received training in combat from the CEO. After escaping from her death, the three leads formulate a plan to catch the killer by exposing her out in the open to a sniper rifle while only she wears a bulletproof vest. I suppose headshots don't exist in her universe because that was so stupid.
- Do Bong Soon is not a strong character. She couldn't even tell the man she liked that she liked him. She is very childish and doesn't have much personality outside her powers.
- Na Kyung Shim (Do Bong Soon's friend) only cares about her face and looking pretty after being beaten up by the serial kidnapper / killer.
-Do Bong Soon's grandmother enters the scene at some point and beats up some goons. Which is fine and all, but the first thing she does when she visits her grandchild's home? She verbally abuses Do Bong Soon's father.
-It's inconsistent powers-wise. Do Bong Soon can't run, but she can jump high and basically fly as shown in the last episodes?
-Bomb designed to kill Do Bong Soon explodes into fireworks... What??
-Domestic violence. Do Bong Soon's mother is seen regularly abusing her husband, both verbally and physically. This abuse is sweeped under the rug with comical music played in the background. Even though the writers seemingly tried to redeem the mother in the last episode as having pushed him only once, it's just not believable. She was also physically and verbally abusive towards Bong Soon.
-Extreme homophobia, awful representation of LGBT community and queer-baiting in almost all of the episodes. It's so toxic that it took every ounce of my willpower to get through the scenes.
- Bong Soon and her mother and basically all the female characters are obsessed with Do Bong Soon snatching away Min Hyuk and having sex with him and basically raping him. These are not strong women.
-Min Hyuk goes to convince Do Bong Soo's father Do Chil Goo to return to his abusive wife because he cannot marry Do Bong Soon in such a situation. What a sad moment.
- All three leads are very misogynistic in some scenes. Do Bong Soon's character is misogynistic in itself. She is the opposite of strong and actually serves as a bad example for women.
-It has Kim Ji Soo, who is a known bully, but that's not really the drama's fault, so I would be willing to let that pass.
-Do Bong Soon has her own gang of high school kids.
-The characters are absolutely brain dead most of the time with no logical sense.
-Poop jokes.
-Racist representation of Indians with random Buddhist monk a.k.a. the scammer.
-There is no natural comedy in the situations, only poor writing. The romance was just pure fluff, nothing more.
-Min Hyuk and Bong Soon were extremely possesive.
-Useless police as always.

The good:
-Hee Ji's character was the only normal female character in the entire drama. I wanted to see more of her, but we got very little of her.
-Excellent villain who deserved so much better. He was the only consistent character and the reason I kept watching, but sadly writers didn't allow him more time to shine. The actor's performance was absolutely amazing.
-Some scenes were shot in a beautiful manner, but this got overshadowed by how despicable the characters were.

I need to cleanse my brain from this drama.

Sweet... but wait... that doesn't make sense
What a sweet ending.

This show felt like two (sometimes three) different shows in one. The romance stuff was very cute and our leads definitely had chemistry and it was just fun to watch them interact and fall in love. Then there was the crime/thriller part which I thought was done really well in the beginning parts but really fell off at the end. Then we had the comic relief, the storylines with the high schoolers and the construction guys (which I skipped through majority of the time and the story was still intact), they just felt really irrelevant and they tried so hard to include them.

My issues:
- At one point I thought her mother was an abuser and I didn't second guess it because of how hostile she's been written. So when they revealed that she didn't actually hit her husband (and her friends even thought she hit him) it was brushed over. I would've liked a bit more unpacking as to why we as an audience and why her friends thought she was capable of that.
- Her powers made no sense. She protected her friend from something that was going to hurt her. How was she suppose to know that there was an innocent man on the elevator. It just seemed unfair that she lost her powers for something that was out of her hands. And adding on, how come her children's powers weren't taken away when they punched innocent people?
- I think we could've done with less of the side characters.
- The tonal shifts were weird and off. We went from girls being kidnapped to the leads being all cute to the comic relief. They needed to sit and build on one aspect before moving on to the next.

My favourite:
+ The leads and their chemistry. They felt playful and comfortable with each other which made me believe the very fast progression of their relationship.
+ That one song about love.
+ Mr Ahn's assistant and his facial expressions.
+ The crime/thriller part. The actor who played the bad guy was actually quite good and scary at times (except at the end). He felt like he could've been a suspect from Criminal Minds.

I finally watched this drama and let me just say something I have never seen such a cute and perfect couple in my entire life and I couldn't stop oohing and awwing at them the entire time. Definitely one of my favourite dramas and definitely my favourite K-drama couple. I love the fact that the female lead is the strong one and is the one that protects others it made me so happy to see that. Such good acting in this drama. Oh and I also nearly died a million times looking at Park Hyung Sik like could he get any better. He is so good looking. Anyways back to the subject it was the first time I'd saw Park Bo Young in a drama and she was really cute and strong and so great at her craft. Poor Jisoo always getting second male lead roles. Please watch this drama. I'm not very good at writing reviews but believe me when I say it is a great drama.

This drama is good if you're looking for something fun and with light-hearted romance. What I love the most is the chemistry between Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Sik. If I were to rewatch the drama, it's because of this. The cute and loving moments between the two were endearing to watch. I'd say the casts all did well and the music are not bad either. However, there are quite a lot of parts that I would say unnecessary and random but I guess it's just to add the comedic value to the drama. Overall, I consider it an average or above average drama but I can't deny that it is entertaining.

So this was basically ""the"" drama for me as after watching this I knew I'm sucked into the drama world!!
The story was quite intriguing from the get go, romance was ADORABLE and that dash of mystery really kept things interesting throughout its course. Also, the fact that there was little to no 'second lead syndrome' was very well appreciated.
Now for each category:

STORY:-
As I've already said, the story was quite interesting and it's unlikely for you to get bored at any point of this drama. There were a lot of characters (like A LOT) and multiple sub plots, which could have ruined the watching experience but luckily the execution was amazing. All the supporting characters had their own thing going and you would end up Loving them just as much as our cute main leads. This drama also had one of the most smoking hot baddie ever (you will end up stalking that guy on Google, for sure) but yeah he was pretty trashy yet interesting character.

ACTING/CAST:-
The acting of almost all the cast members exceeded my expectations.
Park Hyun sik as the super cocky chaebol, Ahn Min hyuk, with the heart of gold had me smittened. He was also so genuinely unabashed about his feelings for bong soon I mean it's just awwwwwww!!!!

Park Bo young was probably the perfect person to play our cutie pie, Bong soon, with hulk-like strength! She was the perfect mix of innocent and badass and you can't help but root for her.

Ji soo as and I quote bong soon ""handsome Guk doo"" gave an impressive performance and his face offs with minhyuk contributed to some of the major LOLs of the show

Special mention to Won-hae Kim, Jeon Seok-ho and Im Won-hee who played some of the most pivotal roles, without them the show would not have been the same.

MUSIC:-
This is my absolute favourite part of this drama!! All the songs are so well-suited to the premise and I don't think I'll ever get tired of them. The entire ost is currently my most played playlist on Spotify and that ain't changing anytime soon?

REWATCH VALUE:-
You can watch it a million times without getting bored. I find myself going back to the same comic or romantic scenes again and again.

Overall it is one of the best light hearted/mystery dramas out there and trust me you won't regret spending your precious 16 hrs on this particular gem.

HAPPY WATCHING!!

I must admit, I laughed a LOT while watching this.

The actors were pretty good. I loved the unusual dynamic between Ahn Min Hyuk and Do Bong Soon, it's refreshing, not to mention adorable, he looks at her the way I look at coffee on a sleep-deprived morning.

What I didn't love is the drastic changes in tone this show seemed to have. You can't have a starry-eyed boy trying to hide the fact he's turned on in the most PG-13 way possible in one scene, and a really terrifying serial kidnapper in a dungeon filled with his victims hatching his plan in the next. I never knew how important it is for a story to choose a Genre and stick with it until now.

That god-awful song that came on every time they had a sentimental moment drove me nuts, it ruined any scene it played on. I can't say I remember any other song on the soundtrack.

I skipped most of it, except for the parts with Bong Soon because she's awesome, and Min Hyuk because how could I resist his charming fangirling over her, and his over the top gestures that cracked me up. The other parts seemed like a` waste of my life.

Don't watch it unless you wanna laugh a lot and don't mind skipping every other scene.

Watched this after missing AoL from DF. This is way too sweet and void of anything serious to warrant deep discussion.
Storyline: strong girl protects - crazy female hating villain - crush /CEO love triangle. Two NON-related stories in one and never could figure out WHY and purpose of crazy hating villain - NO connection at ALL to story.
Cast: Leads were convincing and entertaining - nothing noteworthy
Music: never paid any attention
Overall: The lead female was far too silly and naive for ANY adulting nonetheless a HS relationship. This character showed no signs of development for 16 eps. The male leads displayed more development which is really rare in dramaworld. Watch knowing this is just mindless and rather blerg. Setting the bar fairly low.

Story
The entire plot and motive of the people who wrote it is just laughable. Strong Woman was a Rom-Com show that was supposed to be all lovey dovey cute between the two leads but then they added the theme of having a serial killer to be the driving force of the show. Nevermind the show being about a woman who has super strength; it's a fucking rom-com! Why the fuck do you have to mix it with a thriller theme? They could've just made the show about the everyday struggles of a woman with super strength has; could be about those who are starting to like her, suddenly despising her because of her powers. Or some people before use her for good, thus why she shuns out people. I can think of a lot more ways the plot could've gone simpler, and 10x better than this fucked up Rom-Com x Thriller theme. And since we're at it, the thriller theme of the show also failed miserably. The main villain of the entire show was just a washed-up lunatic who somehow has a lot of resources from unexplained reasons and starts kidnapping women all because he is addicted to a play. I mean seriously, my 4 year-old nephew would've done a better job of telling a story he thought of. I think the director and the writers really just wanted to mix 2 genres to become unique and successful like While You Were Sleeping, a Legal/Crime + Fantasy and it was awesome. Another example is Descendants of the Sun which was a Melodrama + Medical, and although I personally think that it wasn't that great, I still loved it. The end product of mixing Romance(Comedy) and Thriller is destined to suck already even at first glance. It just doesnt make sense.

Acting
The acting really made up for a really shitty story. Strong Woman was rated so high and received so well by people mainly because of the electric chemistry between Park Bo Young, Park Hyung Sik, and Ji Soo. Park Bo Young was cute and adorable in almost every scene; Park Hyung Sik was funny and appealing in most of the scenes; Ji Soo was straightforward and tense like a true cop is. When added together, they made a show with a really shitty story become a respectable one. Props to the supporting cast as well! Kim Won Hae was funny as hell in the two roles he played.

OST
A nice, respectable OST. Fitted the scenes well and made my heart follow the beat

Overall
If you're someone who wants to watch a chill Rom-Com, then this show isn't for you. Trust me, while it seems that you're up for a generally chill ride, you'll suddenly find tense characters who are determined to catch a psychopath who somehow is rich and smart. If you can withstand that, then you can probably enjoy the cast

Its a light and fun drama that mixes crime, romance and comedy pretty well.  I was far more invested in Guk Doo's duel with the kidnapper in comparison to Bong Soon's relationship. The cronies provided some comedic relief but it got pretty drawn out and annoying after a while. The same can be said about Min Hyuks and Bong Soons relationship, as it's just not very interesting but bearable(i love Park Bo young, but her crying in this drama is super annoying) .

Overall its an entertaining watch and pretty fun to watch, i ended up watching just to see the kidnapper get caught because the character is so evil and smart at the same time. Definitely not the most compelling drama i've ever seen though.

An incoherent drama with an odd entertaining factor
Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is one of those dramas that are overhyped and I do not really know why.

I did not find it amazing or out of this world ,in fact ,I found Strong Woman ahem, STRONGLY incoherent , inconsistent , not well focused and not well-intentioned . However, it did have an entertainment factor going for it and for that I pulled through and watched all 16 episodes. Other than that, it‚Äôs not that special besides the fact that the female lead is very strong. So ?

What is the point of Strong Woman actually ? It has a lot elemental things inserted such as criminality , super powers , family and the police but still found it very hard to convey a message or running commentary on any of the elements . It was just pure fluff and highly silly throughout.

I won't comment on acting because the actors were brought down by the elemental stupidity of the drama they were acting in so I can not assess at all.

I believe that if you are going to base your story in a setting prevalent in society like a police station or a corporation ,commentary of those settings needs to be seen and heard . Unfortunately , this drama lacked everything.

In conclusion - This show is not that bad . BAD being the operative . But you keep watching because of that inexplicable charm that K dramas have !

While I liked the entire show in general, the way the show handles Do Bong Soon's superhuman strength is a huge problem.

If hurting someone innocent would cause Do Bong Soon to lose her powers, I'm sure she would have lost it in the earlier episodes for breaking Mr Gong's tail bone. The way her abilities work are nothing more than a convenient plot device without much thought put behind it.

It is stated early on in the show that once the superhuman strength is lost, she will never ever get it back. Unfortunately, this drama played into the cliche of only giving the main character back her ability.

Another issue with the story is the mixture of genres that makes it a little hard to watch. One moment you are watching a thriller and the next you are watching a couple flirting. The transition between scenes could see improvement.

I was smitten with this drama during the first 6 episodes. Park Bo Young is definitely cute and adorable. Her acting is on point - she is good with both funny and crying scenes. Park Hyung Sik is definitely making a name in the Kdrama world. His stares are to die for.

I love the chemistry the chemistry of the lead couple - on cam and off cam (based on BTS).

However, I find the story messy with a lot of fillers. I was disappointed with the writer of the drama. The cast, the chemistry and the soundtrack are very commendable.

I just wish that the writer tried harder in providing better content for the actors to work on. I know a lot of the fillers are meant to be fun but they became tiring because of their redundancy.

Nonetheless, I will finish watching the drama instead of dropping it. The cast and their chemistry are too good to give them up.

Long & Really Dragged Out
Honestly, I really thought there could be some potential to this show with the relatively high ratings. However, what truly transpired was probably the most frustrating push to complete this show out of all the shows I've watched in so far.

I could be quite biased as my very first kdrama ever was It's Okay to Not Be Okay and that set the bar for all subsequent dramas to hit what I still consider to be a balance of romance, fiction, thriller and real life illnesses. This show is clearly not a great representation of any of these and the flow of the show is too forced in my opinion. I would surmise it as the romance is quite abrupt with no real lead up or progression but rather just happens. The storyline is all over the place in that you will have love/romance scenes juxtapositioned with thriller scenes and no real transition between the two aside from their connection to the main character.

In this show's entirety, I would have loved for the thrilling part of the show to not be as forced and drawn out. It truly seemed like the more idiotic the characters were the more aneurysms I would get watching and it wasn't the funny kind either. You'd get a mix of odd gang member violence, superpower main character, love triangle and psychopath thriller all jumbled into one episode and you come to wonder what is going on.

I can't in good conscious ever recommend this show to anybody. The story is just all over the place and even with good acting the storyline cannot be saved. It felt like watching an episode of the Bachelor where there's unnecessary drama in places that make no sense.

TL;DR storyline is all over the place with no clear goal in sight with the acting over dramaticized.

Misogyny, homophobia, domestic violence in a comedy, as comedy? Oh, no.
The creative team behind Strong Woman Do Bong Soon assembled all the ingredients necessary for a delightful screwball comedy. Fun wacky premise? Yes‚Äîa diminutive woman is born with the strength of your typical superhero. Of course, she wants to go through life without being noticed, so she must hide this gift. Charming and beautiful lead actors with good chemistry? Yes‚Äîbut then we expect that from every K-drama at this point. A powerful man in need of protection? Yes‚Äîa CEO accustomed to being in charge must hire the Strong Woman to be his body guard. Naturally, their agendas clash to create comedic plot points. Villains appropriate to a screwball comedy? Yes‚Äînot one but two dysfunctional families and a group of inept mobsters are the comic foils to our two heroes. Action sequences in keeping with the screwball premise? Yes‚Äîat one point, the titular Strong Woman singlehandedly brawls with 30 mobsters and vanquishes them all in true cartoon-violence style. That is to say, it‚Äôs both funny and satisfying. Having assembled these ingredients, the creative team delivers a finished product that delivers on the promise of its premise. For much of the time, Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is a textbook example of what a viewer would want from a screwball comedy.

But this creative team was not content with the strong comedic elements they compiled. They must have concluded the story needed some drama too. So, to their wacky tale featuring cartoonish-feats of strength, leads squabbling with parents whose goals for their kids differ from the kids' own goals for funny, if typical, family conflict, and a half-hearted but light love triangle, this creative team threw into the mix the following additional and super-amusing ingredients: brutal, violent misogyny; kidnapping and torture; multiple ways to ridicule and demean gay men; and turning domestic violence into a joke. To say these elements do not mesh with the elements discussed in the fist paragraph would be to grossly understate the degree to which Strong Woman Do Bong Soon went off the rails as a series.

Once the viewer decides no longer to overlook the brutality of scenes that involve the stalking of women, the beating of women, the mental and physical intimidation of women after their kidnapping; once the viewer can no longer stomach the tired, cliched portrayals of gay men whose only purpose in the story is to make the point that being gay is disgusting and gross and to serve as the butt of jokes for others; once the viewer decides that domestic violence is never funny even if the perpetrator is the wife rather than the husband‚Äîwell, once the viewer really reflects on those things Strong Woman Do Bong Soon ceases to function as an innocuous screwball comedy. At that point, it‚Äôs just an unwatchable mess.

And that‚Äôs a shame, because when the series wasn‚Äôt being actively misogynistic, insultingly homophobic, or miscasting a social problem for comedy, the rest of it was quite entertaining. This show was popular in its day‚Äîand plenty of fans continue to choose to overlook the issues I mentioned above, precisely because the screwball comedy ingredients actually deliver effective screwball comedy. But I cannot imagine people will watch this mess in the future and think it aged well.

Overrated
I found this show after seeing the many high ratings across many platforms - and was shocked at how quickly I got confused halfway through the 3rd episode. Too many overlapping storylines and it‚Äôs quite confusing actually. In many instances it actually is rather loud as there is a lot of screaming.
Very good cast however I found the second male lead rather too angry throughout. I fast forwarded throughout most as I wanted to see it through to the end however I honestly am surprised by these ratings. Too overrated in my opinion!

i'm genuinely not averse to tonal shifts or meshing seeming unalike genres together, i'm really not, but this show and the ppl behind it i'm convinced had no idea wtf they were doing or where they were going with this show. so much doesn't work from the comedy to the pacing to the relationship building. (why is there a love triangle when it effectively forgets about it and the secondary love interest isn't really a convincing threat by episode like four? why is this show involving a serial abductor and wannabe killer when it could just singularly focus on the inept mafia members, which fit better tonally with what it's kinda going for? what IS this going for? i don't know! do you?) there are glimmers of potential and occasionally the cast, particularly the leads, push through to sell a scene but nothing can rely on a single, inconsistent element for long.

the core problem, the more i examine it, is and was the decision to make this a romcom and serial killer thriller when...this does not have the range, i'm sorry. it does not compliment nor work with any of the themes it does establish, which are paper thin, no the comic-y feel it exudes almost constantly. it should have, frankly, been something more akin to a slice-of-life with a heroine who is clark kenting it to the best of her abilities and branch from the hijinx that can entail from that.

instead we get a drama that's only thing it chiefly knows about itself is to be homophobic. it's such a shame because there is potential and a number of things to work with here.

Oooooh Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. The promise you held, the promise you made, the promise you did not keep.

This drama is crazy popular, and I admit it. I understand why. It's filled with fun and interesting characters, an infinitely fascinating premise, superb acting, and some Very attractive male leads. I fully accept that I am in the minority with my opinion, and that's ok. I'm glad everyone else was able to enjoy this drama. But as interesting and fun and superbly acted as it is...

A terrible script it was. Great acting and interesting characters and story premises often lift many a terrible script, and I unashamedly admit to loving stories that are terrible simply because everything else was so well done. I think that has a lot to do with why so many people love this drama so much.

But those things just didn't do enough to compensate for this dramas writing for me.

First things first:

The rules of her superpowers were never clear. The first episode portrays her mother losing her powers because she was abusing them to make money off of people. I expected that to serve as a clear indicator of what was acceptable and what was not. That was apparently not so. I spent the rest of the drama (as far as I watched) trying to figure out just what the rules were. What exactly counted as using her abilities for ill and using them for good? Surely beating up bad guys and defending the weak would be considered using your powers for good, right? Wrong. Or maybe not wrong? Bong Soon frequently held herself back in situations where she Clearly would have been in the right to act and intervene, but then at other times, she just let herself go, wailed on bad guys left and right...and still didn't end up losing her powers. So what was the barometer? Helping this defenseless person is ok but helping that defenseless person is not?

As for the romance, Park Hyung Shik is endlessly charming and witty and charismatic and has looks that go on for daaaaaays. He's almost immediately smitten with Park Bo Young's character, and you're always gonna get a happy viewer out of me when a male lead falls first. But damn it if he wasn't super manipulative and uncomfortably controlling! It didn't help that Bong Soon gave him into his demands Far more often than I liked. I wasn't against her having maybe a more mild, and maybe even shy, personality in comparison to her abilities, but she gave in in situations where there was no reasonable justification for her doing so, and it INFURIATED MEEEEEEE. She didn't have to fight back with her powers. I was fully on board with that being considered using them for ill. But she sure as heck could have used her words sometimes and said NO.

I dropped this before the last two eps, so I cannot comment on them, but I heard a few things went a little off the rails at that point, and I'm glad I bowed out when I did. This drama did not follow through on the things it promised me in the beginning, and I just want my trust back.

THE SHOW DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT WANTS TO BE
THE PLOT was good. It's definitely original cause I've seen nothing like it. I feel like the show kept going back and forth on what genre it wanted to be. The crime aspect seemed like a second thought, which is disappointing because it was the most interesting thing about this. Sometimes dramas go out of the way to portray a strong independent woman and this was one of those dramas. I don't know if this will make sense but I think Bong Soon was too ""strong."" I kinda got tired of seeing her beat up people. What kept me watching was the serial kidnapper and Park Hyung Shik(that man is stupid gorgeous). The love triangle between Bong Soon and the two leads was funny to watch but I think the romance aspect could have been a bit stronger. I did feel second lead syndrome and thought In Gook Doo should‚Äôve ended up with the female lead. Min Hyuk was very cute, but I felt like the SML was more sincere. On another note, Bong Soon's nosy ass mother managed to get some laughs out of me.

THE ACTING was ok. The best actor imo was Ji Soo. At times things got too cheesy for me, and I couldn't stand that group of guys that got beat up by Bong Soon. They got WAY too much screentime and they only existed for some cheap laughs, and not ONCE did I ever find them funny. I just ended up skipping any scenes with them. Park Hyung Shik is literally so handsome I found it hard to pay attention judge his acting in any scene he was in, but he gave a pretty solid performance. He was such eye candy that I had to finish this.

REWATCH VALUE is non existent for me. I won't ever come back to this drama. This was cute and light-hearted but you can never take this too seriously when watching. Wish they had focused on the serial kidnapper more. 7/10

the first half of the drama had some of the best episodes in kdrama but after a while the drama got boring and repetetive especially during episodes 8-14

still the last 2 episodes made the show justice which is the reason why i was able to give this a high score
the acting was fine but during some scene Ji Soo was quite akward and not believeble as a detective.
i don't think i'll ever rewatch this

Pros:
- Interesting characters with a diverse set of personalities.
- Unique animation that communicates ideas, and sentiments well.
- Nice blend of dark and light drama in the first two-thirds of the series. I found that the way the two major plot points of the story were transitioned between suggested a sort of ""life as it is"". At the same time that, say, a major romantic relationship milestone was met, a dark, immoral act was committed concurrently, and these scenes would follow one another. It was really good at keeping the darker elements from becoming uncomfortable and created a more realistic and not-to-scary lens to witness the darker sides of the drama from.
Cons/ Overall:
- The drama had a great start, the characters were interesting, to say the least. Even when some characters became unrelatable, and unrealistic, the personalities of the others would redeem the overall impression of the show. I feel that this series suffered from the usual trend that I find with Kdramas: It starts off with an engrossing cast of characters, a compelling storyline, and great progression, but by episode 12/13 the characters behave in a way that seems inconsistent with how they were initially portrayed. There is an argument with no directed intention,  which felt contrived, relationship problems that could have been avoided by simply communicating the problem, and responding in earnest, the female lead becomes incredibly passive in the relationship. The characters begin to react very emotionally to their circumstances and the drama no longer feels true to itself. The sense of immersion is lost because the initial draw of believable and even relatable characters is lost, and now you, if you're like me, just have to finish because you started. Personally, I thought the outfits were nice, so that also motivated me to stick around.  ^_^

This drama is going to go down as one of my all-time favorites. The chemistry between the two leads are undeniable, and the male lead is the softest cinnamon roll ever. I love the way he looks at the FL. With that being said, my heart still BROKE for the second lead, despite how much I shipped the first lead.

The kidnapping sub-plot was also super intriguing, and I was really invested in how the characters would deal with it. It scared me but also ended up creating a really good balance between light, fluffy scenes and darker moments.

Amazing drama, so entertaining and beautful with a lot of empowerment, it demostrates women can be just as good as men, the leads are just amazing, the bromance is lovely and the main female is just too cute... not to mention but this series is so so funny you won't ever be bored. I would re watch this but in a few years only.:) the main lead is just too cute and you will love it if you're a romantic like me :)

Do you want a super adorable hilarious show with a dark creepy psychopath subplot? Then this one's for you. This drama is thoroughly enjoyable, filled with fall off my chair laughing moments to regretting that I'm watching at night.

From the get go you know the story is going to be lots of fun. It involves Do Bong Soon, a small girl with superhuman strength. There are two sides to this story, which you get to watch build up into the climax of the drama. One side deals with her learning to deal with the strength she has, and of course, her love life involving two very tall, very beautiful dudes. The other side deals with a psychotic kidnapper who takes young girls and locks them into a dungeon. Doesn't make sense right? These two storylines eventually merge into one coherent one. The comedic timing of this show though is amazing. From the dialogue, to the effects, and even the sound effects, every aspect was perfectly done and made me die of laughter. It's definitely a fun show all around, despite the darker side theme.

The acting was absolutely done very well. I've known Park Bo Young from two of her other works, and once again she's proven her strong acting abilities here. Park Hyung Sik has definitely improved very much and despite his status as an idol, he's become a very competent actor as well. Their chemistry was off the charts and made me feel so many things. Aside from the main characters, every actor in this show was phenomenal. You can tell they put 101% of their effort into their acting and it definitely shows. Their commitment to making this the funniest drama is very evident once you watch it.

The music was very memorable. I especially loved Jung Eun Ji and Mamamoo's OSTs, but many others were great as well.

I would definitely rewatch this drama, as I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a super fun and adorable romance that is definitely binge-worthy. It's not too action packed, but interactions between characters were very much enjoyable. Props to the sound director as well for the perfectly placed sound effects. I loved this drama so so much and it's become a top 10. All in all, definitely worth a watch!

Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.

Oh man, this was a great show. I can see why it's breaking records for JTBC. It stars Park Bo Young as the titular character, Do Bong Soon, a young woman with superhuman strength, and Park Hyung Shik as Ahn Min Hyeok, the CEO of a gaming company. Ji Soo plays In Gook Doo, the second lead, who is a cop and Bong Soon's childhood friend (and her crush). Much of the story is the pursuit of the killer and serial kidnapper terrorizing the neighborhood in which Do Bong Soon lives, and that plot line does admirably well at being creepy and challenging for the protagonists, but is largely just back drop for the truly delightful interactions between Bong Soon and Min Hyeok. There's a love triangle, but really only sort of (I'm ready for Ji Soo to actually play a character who gets the girl, though I'm not at all unhappy with his character /not/ getting to be with Bong Soon) because one of the three spent most of his life with his head in the sand. I love that Min Hyeok is intrigued by Bong Soon from the beginning and doesn't spend really any time at all trying to change her. I love that he embraces her strength and treasures it, and that he wants to protect her and keep her from harm, but also doesn't stop her from being an active participant in her life and in facing the various challenges that cross her path. The chemistry in this cast is just amazing.

Minus .5 on story only because some of the story lines get dropped so fast that there's not much satisfaction (and at least one semi-major one doesn't even have a resolution). The music in this show is catchy and delightful.

It seems like 2017 will be the year of strong female leads, not that i'm complaining. I think it's nice to finally see more strong female leads that aren't just the main characters pretty little doll that needs to be protected or the whiny girls that are even worse. Anyway, let's get to the review.

Story:
When i first saw the plot of this drama and heard the title, i immediately thought of ""Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok joo"", and wasn't to excited about watching it. Now don't get me wrong, i looooved ""Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok joo"". I just thought it was unnecessary to make a new drama with the same plot, all over again. Especially since ""Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok joo"" just fininshed airing not too long ago.
But once ""Strong Woman Do Bong soon"" started airing, people started talking about it a lot and therefore, i had to watch it.

When i started watching it, i loved it right from the start.
Although it, in some ways, are similar to ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo"", it wasn't as similar as i had feared. It's mostly just the fact that both of the female leads are strong and doesn't live up to the stereotypical ""pretty-like-a-doll"" girls that we are used to seeing in dramas, and the fact that both dramas are romantic comedies. In a way you could say that ""Strong Woman Do Bong soon"" is the ""adult"" version of ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok joo"". ""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" is more ""dark"" i guess you could say.
You have the creepy kidnapper, and the adult jokes, that made it more ""mature"", while ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok joo"" was more sweet and not as ""dark"".
(The reason for why i'm using ("""") when i say ""dark"", is because ""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" wasn't really that dark either. It's mostly just an absolutely hilarious and sweet drama, but it's ""darker"" than ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo"", if you get what i mean...why are both of those titles so long?"").
Overall the story was great and entertaining all the way 'till the very end.

Acting:
I have officially added another actor and actress to my favourite-actors/actresses list. I have seen dramas with both before, and they both did well in those too,
it's just that i like to see actors act different types of roles before i make my mind up on wether i think they're good actors or not, and i can honestly say that Park Hyungshik and Park Bo young are great actors.

Their chemistry was great, they were such a cute couple and their bickering is the best thing i've seen this year, or the next best thing i've seen this year after the bromance.

Can we just take a minute to talk about how much i ship Hyungshik and Jisoo, like for real. I kinda hoped that this drama would take a turn and that Hyungshik's character actually was gay but...you can't always get what you want now can you?

Music:
The music was good, very fitting with the superhero theme that this drama has. I don't have much more to say.
It was good.

Rewatch value:
9/10, because i don't really rewatch dramas, but it's a drama i could've rewatched, if that makes any sense.

Overall:
All i have to say, is that i think ""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" is the best drama that has aired so far (of the once i've seen at least) this year! Loved it.

I loved watching this, it had humor, emotional at times when women were kidnapped and caged. I'm glad how being kidnapped is horrific and thank you for bringing the awareness of violent crimes that happen to women. The storyline had it's ups and downs from comedy to seriousness. I wished that all women were strong too. The three main actors and one actress did especially well and of course, so did the supporting actors. I loved the visual and the martial art of Park Hyung Sik when he jumped on dudes' neck and flip to the ground. His vocals are off the top! I hope he doesn't stop singing! He is still young and very handsome. This the 2nd KDrama that I have seen him in.

I'll preface that when people ask me for recommendations, this is usually my first choice. I loved almost every single detail about this series. It's not everyday you come across a show that perfectly balances and blends three different genres. Enter Strong-Woman Do Bong Soon. This weaves a comedic story of romance, fantasy/sci-fi, and crime as we follow our protagonist, Bong-Soon. Born with super-human strength, a trait that is passed from mother to daughter, Bong-Soon is almost like an other mid-twenties modern girl, y'know except for the fact that she can toss a car as easily as other people would toss away a used kleenex. While she doesn't broadcast her skills, in some cases she hides them, they are accidentally witnessed by Ahn Min-hyuk, a young Game Developer and CEO who ends up hiring Bong-soon to be his bodyguard. Against the background of this budding romance (and eventual love triangle) is a serial kidnapping and murder case.

Sounds a bit far stretched? I don't disagree, but that is part of the charm of this series. To this day, I cannot think of a drama that made me literally cry from laughter or squeek from delight. Bonus is a cute soundtrack, nearly perfect special effects you don't even notice, and some really great side characters. I was hooked on episode one, and the adorable romance between Park Bo-young and Park Hyung-sik has made me come back to this series multiple times. I hope you love it just as much as I do!

Man what a mess lol. Romance, comedy, crime thriller (not forgetting the slapstick comedy) altogether was just an odd combination of genres. I could not get used to the atmosphere changing abruptly. At one moment it felt like a rom-com and the abruptly the mood shifts and gets all creepy when the kidnapper guy appears and then again abruptly shifts to slapstick comedy when it comes to any scene with the thug guys...like jeez stick to some genres that actually go together!

And honestly too many episodes! Most episodes had a whole lot of nothing going on and they just kept dragging the story showing a lot of unnecessary scenes with the thug guys..and most of those comedic scenes weren't even funny tbh.

I only liked the romance and the OST. The romantic storyline itself was a mess and honestly quite unrealistic lol but the 2 leads had good chemistry and they looked cute together. I think that's the only reason why I watched this drama till the very end and why I'm atleast giving it a 3/10 instead of 1/10. And Park Hyung Shik looks cute lol..
But it's definitely an overrated drama imo..

Do not recommend to newcomers to kdrama
I normally don't like writing bad reviews of shows I don't enjoy. But I felt compelled with this drama.

First, the good: Park Bo Young is enjoyable to watch as the petite and unassuming Bong Soon as she navigates social circles while hiding her superhuman strength, yearning for a normal life, and a love that remains unrequited for the longest time. She's jaded of her superpower and feels like an outcast even in her own family.

That said, this drama has to be one of the worst shows I've ever watched and I feel so sorry for everyone involved especially the actors who I think did their best to elevate this drama from the heaping pile of shit it wants to stay in.

This drama asks A LOT from its viewers. it wants you to forgive its poor visual effects, it wants you to laugh at its forced slapstick humor, it wants you to forgive it for beating around the bush too much. But the weakest part of this drama is the terrible pacing- it's all over the place. One minute you're following the crime mystery, and once you're invested, it pulls you out back to a 15 minute scene at the hospital where the injured gang stooges gather to try to make you laugh with poop jokes, or a long protracted homophobic scene where the 2 MLs caress each other in Bong Soon's head. Also, practically any time the gang boss or his thin henchman or his doppelganger is on screen, it's complete filler / padding and they're not even funny (well, the metal chopstick bracelet scene was actually funny). Several times I've felt like this drama was just wasting my time while I'm waiting for the story to progress. Certain scenes feel way too stretched and I felt they could've just cut more in the editing room to improve the pacing.

Overall, this is the quintessential Kdrama stereotype most non viewers think when someone mentions ""kdrama"" to them which is a shame since kdrama has so much more to offer. If someone you know wants to get into kdrama but is hesitant, avoid recommending this at all costs.

If u like to watch strong female with romcom
I don't know why there are so many bad reviews here on this aap. This drama is already famous and beautiful altogether.

(If you're not fan of romantic comedy with female action or mixed genres, pls do not watch it to later criticizing it badly)

(Try to enjoy the romance and humor they has to offer with going all protective)

I've watched it many times just to re-watch the cuteness of the couples.

She tiny, powerful, cute, beats all the bad guys (she's not a bully for teaching a good lesson to bad peoples), falls out of love from her long term crush after ignored for long, both of the couples are really cute, do not criticize for her being not able to control her power in the starting and getting overboard, she's smug which suits her, handling all those powers are not easy.


I only didn't like the character of her mother who's abusive towards her husband. Otherwise everything is fine.

The male lead, first rumoured as gay, but he later clarified his reason, he's cute and head over heals in love with her, smart, handle everything perfectly, a charismatic CEO, supports do bong soon, trains her, wants to protect her even though she's powerful.

The police force is showed useless but the plot needed this to let our three heroes catch the kidnappers.

IN A DILEMMA BUT YOU STILL LOVE IT
You know when you're in a relationship with somebody that's stupid but you still love the person anyway plus all the stupidity and all? Well this drama is like that, the plot is so ridiculous and unnecessary but you still love it and that was my dilemma. I just watched it because I started it and needed to see the ending, so many unnecessary and ridiculous scenes which doesn't go well with the drama at all, I gave it a 10 overall because I love both PARKs and the laughter the gangsters gave to me, they did well especially PHS. Every other thing is just so ridiculous and unnecessary,now I'm not saying the drama is bad just that it's so ridiculous but you still have to watch it because of how light it is. The drama also articulated how useless the police are both in fiction and nonfiction. Second male lead and the love triangle was unnecessary (another reason why I say somethings in the drama are unnecessary.
FYI PARK HYUNG-SHIK IS A GREAT KISSER

Why just why?
I completely get different dramas appeal to different people, but I can‚Äôt quite wrap my head around why this one is so popular. Story dragged out and was chock full of obnoxious characters and over the top humor that didn‚Äôt quite deliver. I get this was a comedy not to be taken too seriously but the humor fell flat and was jarring with the rest of the genres they tried to smash together to create this train wreck.
I suffered through the entire series with my finger heavy on fast forward just so I could watch the main couple. Not because I enjoyed Bong Soon as a character or an actress. She was flat, tried way to hard to be cute, never grew on me, and completely undeserving of our male lead. But because watching Min Min totally head over heals besotted like an adorable puppy with hearts in his eyes was the best part of this whole drama.

Watch it for Park Hyungsik :-)
I loved this drama. I started watching it, because Park Hyungsik is in it, after having watched and loved the actor in High Society. He is adorable, and it is worth watching SWDBS just for him. Actually, when I rewatched the drama, I skipped everything but the romance plot. This is the kind of drama that, despite being cheesy, is also extremely charming, and that's because the main leads ""sell"" the romance so well. I'm an ahjumma, but while watching it, I felt like a young girl again, loved and falling in love. If you are looking for a realistic drama - skip it. But if you want to feel romantic - this drama is just right (unless yu don'r fall for Park Hyungsik, but is that even possible?)

First, I was kind of skeptical about this drama. It seemed from the description and the poster as a childish typical drama. But now that I've completed it, I can finally give my own opinion.
I ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS DRAMA !
From the cast to the storyline to the soundtrack, I loved everything about "" Strong Woman Do Bong Soon "". The performance of Park Bo Young was fantastic and she just fitted the character. I liked the fact that she kept looking cute and shy while hiding her power. Usually, when I hear a strong woman I picture some bulky girl with a scary intimidating face.
Moreover, the chemistry was attracting. In some episodes, you can mistake them for a real couple. You can see the love that Park Hung Sik bears for his co-star. He nailed the romantic scenes.
Overall, I loved this drama and I recommend it strongly for people who are looking for a different storyline than the typical romantic comedies.

Rewatching it for the 3rd time
Needless to say this is my favorite korean drama. It's the drama I've watched the most and honestly it's my happy pill. The chemistry between the main couple is extraordinary, loved how the relationship evolves as the episodes go by. Really love the mix of thriller, romance and comedy that this drama has. I watched it in a blink of an eye cuase it's really addicting. Will keep rewatching it in the future cause it's the drama I always come back to, and honestly I'll hardly get tired of watching it.

I have been watching dramas for a long time. And Strong Woman Do Bong Soon really comes top on my list. Personally I really loved the plotline. It was unique and refreshing. In most dramas, the female lead tend be a passive role, and it's really hard nowadays to find a drama as refreshing without many cliches. SWDBS with a really ""strong"" yet cute, female lead played by Park Bo Young, a woman who has strong opinions that stands out and really talented. Though SWDBS has it fair share of flaws, it's good aspects really outshine them. SWDBS is a drama encouraging female empowerment (which is really rare to see)and tackles social issues. It has a considerably good balance between funny/cute/romantic side as well as a dark/mysterious/criminal aspect. The music is really great too, enhancing the mood of the scene and really attracts the viewers. I'd totally recommend this drama and 100% re-watch it.

Funny
I thought this show was very funny at times, and lovely at others. I wouldn't say it was as romantic as some other shows I have watched but was still good. I kind of felt it was too short. I finished it all in one day, but that's just me. I love binge watching shows and to be honest sometimes it's better if it's short rather than dragging on. Kiss scenes where good and I could feel the chemistry between the main characters to the point where I had to have a second look at my husband and wonder why I chose him ?

This series started off well, I actually really enjoyed the super-human strength, family heritage story. I think the comedic/slapstick spin that the show put on it really helped to make the story flow, since we know it's nonsense, it was nice to see that the show knew itself that it was nonsense too and didn't take itself too seriously.
The two lead men in this show are SO HANDSOME. I can't even, honestly. I am more biased towards Ji Soo because he's more my cup of tea (or shot of soju if you will) than Min, but I seriously think both of them are terrific actors and super super good looking. They really did their jobs well.
Bong Soon is a cute girl, and she's a good actress, I just think her character got old really quickly trying to play out all the crazy subplots and twists that this show tried to stuff into the series. Maybe there were too many episodes, that's it. Probably could've taken away 5-8 episodes and closed it strong, but instead it sort of just dragged on with some more unbelievable antics.

All in all, good show, good looking, talented and believable cast (especially the overly-effeminate co-worker), I would recommend watching it if you're not looking for something too story driven, and if you like male eye candy.

Park Bo-young and Park Hyung-Sik could not be a more perfect leading couple! Bo-young captured my heart just as much as Hyung-sik. The storyline had some real heartbreaking scenes and some hilarious ones and I think thats what made this drama a strong 10 for me!!
The drama as a whole couldn't have been more perfect and as I watched it I could feel the emotions protracted from each scene, the plot came across as a new and stylish idea and I don't think any drama could top this one with a plot any similar.

If you want a very funny and cute drama with a little mystery, this is it!
This is the first kdrama that comes to my mind when i want to recommend one to an absolute beginner in kdramas. The love story is very cute! I loved the male lead for his funny and loving character! Female lead was so adorable and strong! I loved their relationship from the beginning to the end, the process from friendship to romance . The only thing that I didn't like was the shady parts with the criminal, but I guess that they were necessary for the plot. I liked so much the supporting characters too! They were hilarious at times. If I were to watch it again, I would do this, although I don't watch dramas or movies twice, but I would skip all the criminal parts. If you want a cute love story with a lot of comedy, you should totally watch this!

my favorite drama
i don't understand why a lot of people don't like this.. it has to be the best thing i've watched. it can be too much for some people who like simple story lines, but this drama has it all. like it has romance, thrills, horror, and is even funny. when i first watched it i fell in love. the actors are so perfect for the characters that i legit could not imagine do bong soon or ahn min hyuk as anyone else. the chemistry between them is just so eeeeek. theyre so cute!! i felt extreme second lead syndrome for like a few of the episodes. the ost is also so good. all of the songs have been in my playlist for a few years now and i never skip them, expecially heartbeat by suran! i've watched this drama 9-10 times, and i always feel the emotions everytime! my favorite part in the whole drama is when do bong soon saved gyeong shim the first time from the bad guy. it was so emotional and i couldnt stop crying. i have to admit, the bad guy was smart when he took gyeong shim instead of hee ji, the first time i watched it i was so shocked. the one thing bad thing i would say about this is i don't really like that they never showed in gook doo having a happy ending, he is a main character so i would like something about him. maybe it ends in my first first love haha!
anyway, this is one of THE best dramas i have ever watched. i'm legit watching it right now too lol. it has such a good story, and i would recommend this to people who love a good romance and thriller!!!

Tacky story but sweet and in the end, a feel good drama.
What more can i say about this drama....
I dont wanna add spoilers...........
I loved the cast, there was synergy between them.
Though the story line tried to hard to make us laugh but to me, it wasnt successful at all.
Whats with trying to create a doppleganger for one of the thugs?........... absolutely unnecesary too.
Kudos as well, not alot of product placement ads in the drama........
Asides the above, i was fixeted for most part of the drama. Just a few skips here and there.
Weldone cast and crew.... you did really well

6th Rewatch - Still Amazing
I am writing this review after watching this drama for the 6th time. Yes, this drama is that good. Each time I watch it, it‚Äôs like a serotonin shot. It‚Äôs so funny, and so sugar sweet. The writing is original, the characters are one of a kind and you are rooting for them all, except for the villain obvs.

When I say the characters are well developed, I mean it. From the main leads to all the side characters, they all have unique personalities and the relationships among the characters are so well written that each interaction comes off so genuine. My favorite is of course Do Bong Soon followed by Min Min <3 just heart eyes all around for these two. She does the cute stuff sooooooo well like its so natural. I think we‚Äôre all Min Hyuk in awe of her like everytime he goes in to squeeze her that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all feeling lol I loved their interactions, I loved how open and honest Min Hyuk‚Äôs adoration was for Bong Soon. I am not religious at all but his love for Bong Soon reminded me of this verse:
‚ÄúLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.‚Äù
It was so pure, and wholesome and actually really unique to this drama because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anything similar with the leads before. Tsundere leads are nice and all but THIS, MIN‚ÄôS LOVE it was everythinggggggg.

i also really loved her parents, especially her father that was just such a sweet father/daughter relationship and the relationship they built with Min Hyun. Last but not least was the second lead, this is the first time I have enjoyed the second lead arc. Here‚Äôs the thing, with second leads you know who they are and you know how it‚Äôll end. But a lot of the time, I feel like writers don‚Äôt give that character their closure. Especially when that second lead is supposed to be a life long friend, they make their relationship end on a really pathetic note but that definitely did not happen here. It was mature and respectful of their friendship, I loved that. I never once cringed for them and I usually hate having to do that.

Music, SUPER POWER GIRLLLLLL omg so addicting. I love the songs in this drama, they were just perfect. They did an awesome job queuing them up in just the right places

Rewatch Value - like a million. I legit rewatch this drama like every 6 months when I get bored and hit a slump and can‚Äôt find anything good to watch. It just lifts me up. Also this is one of the only dramas that I rewatch to the last episode. I have a few favorites but I honestly don‚Äôt ever rewatch them to the very end.

The only complaint I had was that I had one last ship in this show that did not set sail but had potential. Can you watch and guess who I am shipping?

I watched this drama because the premise of the show seemed interesting and I really ended up having mixed feelings.

The plot felt all over the place to me. There was a lot going on all the time, one plot point resolved another comes in, but I think it could have been better handled. Many of the sub-plots existed just for the sake of existing and didn't really contribute to the main plot, so at the same time the main plot, the criminal one, felt sometimes out of place.

The two main characters were lovable and together with the actors' acting made the show worth watching, There were though some characters that felt two-dimensional and made me groan when they had to appear on the screen just to make the plot move.

Even though I think the plot was unnecessairly all over the place, this was definitely one of the funniest dramas I've ever watched, it had a lot of hilarious situational humor and the comedy was the part I enjoyed the most while watching the drama.

I think the premise of the show was gripping but the drama tried to be too many genres at once and the plot was messy because of the many subplots and writers' intentions; maybe one day i will rewatch it for the main couple and the comedy.

Fun to watch
I wasn't expecting much when I saw this because I have found myself steering away from Korean cliche rom-coms.

It was fun to watch and a bit cheesy for my taste. I stuck it out to the end just to see if the ending would be good and it was OK.

My favorite was the guy who played the police officer but both he and the main male lead had me in stitches. Even though they were enemies their chemistry was what kept me watching.

Again I hate the way they profile Korean women: poor, pretty, and stupid and that's how they portrayed Do Soon.

The villain was pretty weak but again, I just kept watching it because it was filling my void of Korean action dramas.

I know this show isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. I definitely wasn't expecting it to be mine even though I went it loving Park Bo-Young after seeing her in Hot Young Bloods and Oh My Ghost. I'd never heard of Park Hyung Shik so didn't have any expectations for him going in which just made it so much more delightful. First and foremost, this isn't a perfect show. But it's highly enjoyable if you're into the kind of humor the show dishes out and if you fall for the lead couple as hard as I did.

I love:
-- strong, quirky, sassy female lead
-- a hero who is quirky in his own way while managing to still exude that confidences that makes you think he's worth your heroine's time. oh. also, totally respects her and always trying to lift her up.
-- their relationship. the witty back and forth between these two is GOLD for me. I just love it.
-- the growth of the female lead. I will admit. At first, I wasn't digging that she wasn't utilizing her powers. And I loved her.

I liked:
-- the friendship between bong soon + her best friend. at first I didn't care for it but they slowly grew on me. I don't know if it was the chemistry between the two actresses or what, but they managed to morph a friendship that I was at first thinking ""why are we seeing so much of herrrr"" into ""aww they're like sisters! I want what they have"" kind of relationship.
--bong soon's relationship with her dad -- normally I might not have commented on this but her mother was such a b**** that every tender smile or endearment that dad sent his daughter had my heart feeling warm
-- the gangster story line. look, I know not a lot of people care for that kind of humor. I never really cared for it but I love
-- the serial kidnapping storyline. Yea. I said it. I liked it. I think it worked. I was on the edge of my seat. Hell, Jang Mi Kwan did such an awesome job at his role he had me googling his ass within the first couple of episodes because i'm like ""this dude is A PSYCHO BUT WHY IS HE SO GOOD LOOKING THO? AM I INSANE? WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE IN REAL LIFE?"" i'm even more impressed that it was his first acting role. I hope keeps acting because it's SO RARE to find a villian that actually does a legit good job at being crazy.

HatedDidn't care for:
-- bong soon's mother. I honestly don't understand why the mom was written the way she was and maybe it's a cultural think, a tough love korean mom style thing that I don't get but I hated her. I skipped over most scenes with her once I realized that no, they were not messing with me, no, there was no redemption arch with her character, no place for growth -- that she was just a horrible woman. Quiet frankly I respected Bong Soon so much for being as sane and normal as she is for having a mother like this.
-- the monk storyline. what? why?
-- the love line between Bong Ki (bong soon's brother) and Hee Ji (gook doo's gf/ex). Look. As soon as Show put these two in the same room and I Hee Ji started eyeing up Bong Ki I was like girl GTFO. Just don't. I have zero tolerance for women that play that shit and couldn't care less for her or her storyline.
-- aside from gook doo these cops were NOT the smartest bunch. but they were endearing...to a certain degree. and redeemed themselves a little bit towards the latter end.


Overall---I thoroughly enjoyed this show. Then I got my sister to rewatch it with me while we had two kids running around and she enjoyed it just as much as me. It's not perfect--but I'd say watch the first 3-4 episodes before you decide to drop it. For all the things that I didn't like or care for, I've rewatched this show countless times (grateful that it's on netflix) when I needed a pick me up.

Cute !!
This drama was such a cute drama!! It was just fun to watch and to laugh through it. The couple was so cute that I could stop watching it.

This drama is a romance drama with a bit of a thriller aspect in it. the thriller is not for anyone and can make some people uncomfortable by it, but it is also a very interesting aspect of the story.

Park Bo Young was such an amazing actress and play Bong Soon very well. Park Bo Young played the aegyo amazing. Bong Soon is a character that I really enjoyed she was such an amazing character.
Park Hyung Shik was such the perfect actor for Min Hyuk. Min Hyuk is such the perfect boyfriend, in my opinion, he was so head over heel for Bong Soon it was cute. I also love that he loves that he doesn't mind that Bong Soon strength and still loves her for her.
Park Hyung Shik and Park Bo Young chemistry made this show twice as better. the chemistry the hade was so cute and you could feel it through the screen and you couldn't help but feel giddy when they were together. Min Hyuk and Bong Soon was such a cute relationship, I really loved their banter with each other. they are one of my favorites relationships.

The OST was one of my favorite. My favorite is ""Because of you"" by Park Hyung-Sik

Hot and Spicey Cotton Candy...
This drama is like just like I view Park Bo Young so sweet, spicy, cute, sweet, cute, fun,...

Bong Soon is the ultimate Hot and Spicy Cotton Candy. and this is one of my all time favorite dramas. who happens to have the scene that inspired my username. to be honest some of the humor is a bit low, there are some scenes that on their own may be questionable but if you try to look at this dram as a whole you may just find it quite progressive and that the humor you may have found slightly questionable at times when put in to the context of the whole drama is actually not that bad and does get addressed in one way or another depending on what you look at, and how you understand it...

Sorry If I sound vague and complicate things but once you watch it,you may understand what I am trying to say..

What I love about this drama is the chemistry between the leads and the way this couple interacts and shows respect towards each other giving us some of Dramalands sweetest scenes. I also love the many, many contrasts shown in this drama, soft hard, sweet strong, funny-serious issue... The fighting scenes here are just so cute and bad ass at the same time. And I love how they show how society's norm restrict women from showing strength but also how the many, many men in this drama are portrayed differently making way for both macho, evil, vulnerable, understanding and kind..

I love this drama so much that few articles feel complete without it... It may not actually be that great if looked upon with an objective eye To be honest there are some scenes that are ok to skip and should probably lesson the score but those two leads make up for every one of those scenes making this a dram I would gladly rate higher if I could, yest the main couple is just that adorable...And it just makes me feel all fuzzy inside (even though it has some pretty dark scenes)... Making it one of the most memorable dramas in Dreamland and the second most popular k-drama for a reason, if you ask me it is a lot more entertaining them the number one drama...

So if you by chance have not watched it yet then just go for it... And if you have already seen it why not watch it again?

Tonally uneven, poorly structured, with an insanely sweet lead couple
I wish this drama was better. There's a lot of potential in the premise, which is fresh and fun, and you've got two great looking and quick good actors as your leads, but the execution just isn't there.

Tonally, this drama either doesn't know what it wants to be (ultra sweet romance or dark thriller or farcical comedy?) or wants to be all of the things mentioned and doesn't know how to meld them together into a cohesive whole (there is only one drama that I've ever seen that can blend super sugary romance, serious and dark themes and pure comedy together and that's Joy of Life, but that drama is such a masterclass in writing, acting and directing that it's unfair to judge anything else against it).

What you end up with is a drama that has some great romance, some good action, a hell of a lot of baggy and unnecessary scenes and some comedy that is either deeply disrespectful and homophobic, or gives you whiplash. The ongoing gag of the gangsters that were beaten up by the female lead is funny at first, but when you've got it paired next to a scene where her best friend is in the hospital after being kidnapped and possibly tortured and raped by a serial killer, the gangster stuff starts to feel cheap and ugly.

This drama is a mess. It's all over the place, it has uneven acting and is very draggy in some areas and very rushed in others. I like rewatching it for the lead couple, but I find myself fast forwarding like crazy. That's really the only way I can watch this show -- treat it like a highlight reel. Keep about 30% (the romance! The fighting!) and throw out the rest.

Greatest Weakness: The homophobic 'comedy'
Greatest Strength: The romance between the leads

Saw this on Netflix and though, ""Na. Seems cheesy."" Well, I'm an idiot and clearly know nothing about picking shows. This drama is FUN! A great watch to get you out of a drama rut. I fell in love with Bong Soon in the first episode and would have binged the whole show if not for my real life getting in the way.

I liked that there was a romance part that wasn't particularly complicated or up and down but was sweet and organic. I liked that the love triangle didn't crush my soul at the end. I thought the OST was really well done and well timed (mostly). The story is a bit all over the place and several loose ends are never really tidied up which is unfortunate. The ""thriller"" part of the show feels a little too scary for such a lighthearted story but it is necessary to drive the plot and give it weight. It could be triggering to someone who has suffered trauma so be aware of that.

The best part of the show though is the comedy. Laughing out loud happens rarely to a jaded old timer like me but I definitely laughed out loud. There's a lot of silly slapstick and fun in this show which was refreshing. Who couldn't love a pint sized super hero who is oblivious to her charms. Bong Soon is my hero, too!

I am watching Strong Girl Do Bong Soon for the second time; I was not watching carefully the first time and I was not too impressed. That makes complete sense as the joy in this drama is not in following the average and inconsistent story but in reveling in the sweet moments that the drama has, and it has so many!
The Good: The acting in the drama is top notch and it is easy to relate the romantic situations to real life. Both male leads are really good looking but I was quite taken aback by how incredibly cute Min Hyuk was. He is probably the most playful male lead I have seen. I could really relate to how he felt when he called Bong Soon a cutie pie or his reaction when she sent him the Min Min emoji, even the caress of the hair he liked to give Bong Soon, these details on him falling for her made it so enjoyable! The height difference with Bo Young is very obvious but she overcomes it with cuteness. The first time, I was not too impressed by Bo Young but this time I realized that her poker face or deer in the headlights reactions in certain situations is exactly how some girls act and she is quite sensational when she acts happy, confused or sad; her expressions are often worth replaying.
The OST is excellent and apt for a romcom. I particularly liked Double trouble Couple and Heartbeat but the whole OST is a good listen with a peppy and fun, youthfhul vibe. I even liked the action music they brought on in the thriller scenes.
The thriller element in this show was actually good. The villain felt dangerous but was not so horrific as to make this unsuitable for adolescents. He was smart and a worthy adversary talking less and doing more. I have had enough of dramas where the villain makes baseless and empty threats. Here, the villain was genuinely ahead all the time and would have probably won if not for the supernatural element.
Overall the humour in this show was very good and I mostly liked the slapstick nature of the comedy. The supporting characters were quite involved in the storyline and came together quite well. Kyung Shim as the girl who preemptively understood certain things or the secretary and even the Development Team doppelganger of the gangster were enjoyable characters.
The Bad: The main story of Bong Soon and her powers is hopelessly underdeveloped. That was why the first time I felt the drama was a drag. The writers call for an absolute suspension of disbelief. Ok, just roll with it. However, it is hard to take messages about weak girls and the strong preying on the weak seriously on such flimsy premises of unearned strength. Frankly, I found those lines irritating and preachy. The journal on the family's use of strength and Bong Soon's plans on what to with her superpowers, there was almost no detailing. The drama gets all the subtle elements of the lovable romance right: the smile, the teary eyes, the cute laugh, the rising tone of the voice showing ecstacy and completely messes up the detailing in the story. It is so frustrating.
Bong Soon's aim of joining Ainsoft is not to create games but create a game centered on herself, the height of narcissism. There is little in terms of further details on this game and it is kinda important since she has nothing else on her resume worth joining a corporate firm.
The villain's reasons for kidnapping are not really well specified. He wants to marry them and then what? The police's handling of security protocol was really awful. i couldn't understand how lockdown of facilities was not initiated even once even when the guy made repeated similar attempts at the same hospital.
The funny baddie of Tak Baek development was played too long without adequate character development; the amount of screentime given to that segue was too much. The segue needed better writing to funnier or could be edited to a fraction.
One last thing, I feel a bit worried for Bong Soon's fiance. She can be a bit of a bully at times and her mother is a particularly bad example. I wonder how he would stand ground in an argument against her when all she has to say is that I don't like it and you might get hurt but well..let's assume a happily forever after.

This drama became by far my absolute love !
The story line mixes rom-com and action/thriller elements in a very sucessfull way.
I honestly felt like the thriller plot was lead in a very smart way giving depth and helping the story line development without being overwatched nor rushed in the end like other romcoms. Also loved how the comical elements were smartly incorporated in the story without being too much nor out of place. The drama gave me some of my biggest laughts !
Both leads grew on my heart and almost fell for the second male lead ! Loved Bong Soon kirky yet super cute character that you never got enough of but most of all the fact the the charater unlike other strong FL never totally fell fot the ML knight syndrome and remained the show stealer <3

Above my expectations
Okay so to begin with I myself don't know how many times I skipped this title because
1) I thought it was just hyped
2) didn't get attracted to synopsis
3) didn't like poster as well
4) thought it would be typical push and pull love triangle

Now coming to the main point

I am so happy was wrong. I was out of drama so I thought of watching just 1 episode atleast to judge it (since it was always popping in my feed)

And OohMmyyGoddd

This was such a great watch. I binged watched it. The story has different concept which i loved.

Their actings are so natural everyone not just main leads everyone

The male lead
I blushed everytime I saw him.. He was so cute and adorable in his role.

The female lead
She is so sweet and cute as well.

Their chemistry was *swoon worthy *


Okay so the review may be never ending

But in conclusion
It is cute, fluffy, soft, emotional ( yeah the emotions arr potrayed so well) and all those good adjectives.

It is a must watch for me
And definitely gonna re-watch it when I want something heart warming light story.

I‚Äôve said it before, life is WAY too serious to waste my time watching the serious shows (although I‚Äôm trying). Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is a show my nieces recommended I watch. Truthfully, they love Park Hyung Shik and they hoped I‚Äôd add him to my ‚Äúoppa‚Äù list. While I didn‚Äôt add him to my list, I did enjoy the show and yes, it made me smile more than once‚Ä¶..well it made me groan more than once as well. So if you want a lighthearted show that is cute, comical, and happy, then this is a good choice.

STORY: The story is of Do Bong Soon who doesn‚Äôt have much to recommend herself except for exceptional strength that is passed through the female line of her family. Now if you are looking for Bong Soon to be a superwoman who fights for the downtrodden, she does get there‚Ä¶.just not very quickly. Admittedly she whines her way through many episodes but comes into her own around episode twelve.

She is helped along the way by Ahn Min Hyuk (played by Park Hyung Shik) and In Gook Doo (another cutie..Ji Soo). There is a serial kidnapper and some very interesting Korean mafia type people that provide much of the groans and comedic situations. Her parents are more of a hindrance than help but they also provide more groans and laughs.

CHARACTERS: I did love the characters, mainly because each and everyone of them made me cringe at least once during the sixteen episodes. I prefer to notice someone is on the screen rather than have them disappear into the background like a piece of furniture. Park Bo Young did a great job of making Bong Soon likeable, even when she whined. She had the character really changing in the last three episodes and we really saw what a TRULY strong woman Bong Soon was (I adore the scene with the walnuts and the kidnapper).

I can see why my nieces love Park Hyung Shik. He was completely lovable as Min Hyuk and I‚Äôve said it before, those smiles are deadly. I would have watched it until the bitter end with just him smiling in every episode. He is a difficult man to despise.

The rest of the characters were well done and mostly obnoxious which adds to the fun of the show. I did like the story arc of the mafia people. At the end with that rag tag group, it was very funny and touching all at once.

MUSIC: The music was so so but not totally annoying. I didn‚Äôt rush out to download any songs and didn‚Äôt endlessly search for YouTube videos of the music so I could relive the experience.

Overall, this wasn‚Äôt a bad show. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite, but it definitely is a good watch to detox from binging on intense c-dramas. Don‚Äôt be discouraged if Do Bong Soon isn‚Äôt the super hero you are looking for in the beginning. By the end, she definitely comes into her own and shows us what a strong woman can really achieve.

A fantastic drama, fully of joy and laughter!

I really loved this drama. When I first started this drama, I had no idea I would fall in love with the characters and the storyline. I had one started this drama before and then quit, but I am so happy that I started this drama again. The chemistry between the main characters is the best. Park Hyun Shik and Ji soo are both very handsome and lovely (I really love Park Hyun Shik with all my heart). I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch the funniest and cutest drama ever. And the last thing that caught my attention is that usually the dramas show the happiness of the female lead when the two main characters fall in love, but in this drama, Park Hyun Shik is the God of Cuteness to me and the drama shows how he gets excited when the female lead pays attention to him.
Last words: just watch it!

There aren't a lot of dramas that are so comfortable to watch where you can put it on before you go to sleep. And that's what I did. Every night, I'd watch a few episodes of Strong Woman Do Bong So, watch whatever antics Bong So and Ahn Min were up to and sleep. Which is odd considering there is a violent serial kidnapper (and presumably rapist) in the show. But this was a very lightly toned show while keeping the mystery intriguing. Do Bong So was a great character to watch regardless of the circumstances. She was totally badass, quirky and clever. She was a good influence on those around her and made great use of her powers to help people.

This drama is really lovely, short and sweet. You have Ahn Min Hyuk, CEO of a gaming company who acts very uncaring, and Do Bong Soon, who has power of strength but who is very sweet and caring to towards people she cares about. Both actors were great in this show, and I really enjoyed watching how they both developed both in their personality and in their relationship. It is not a fast moving drama, at least not in the romance department so if that is what you are wanting you have to wait for it since it develops slowly. Highly recommend you watch this drama and decide if it is right for you. I truly enjoyed it.

This was the cutest show ever and is now one of my favorite shows.
It takes a different approach which is refreshing and they do it very well. The show did start to slow down around the 8th episode but nothing to bad.
It was definitely interesting to see how such a cute and funny show could also be very intense. Overall you will be smiling but get ready some serious moments as well.
The actors have great chemistry and did a great job showing all the different emotions experienced throughout the series.
I very highly recommend this show to everyone!

I Just... Don't Know.
So... I don't know what to say about Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. Was it a good drama? Sure I enjoyed. Was it my favorite? Not by a long shot. So much happened in this drama that I found myself looking to see how much longer I had for each episode. It felt like they were trying to jam 3 dramas into 1 and it was a chore to watch them. The acting was great and I enjoyed the characters, but just didn't like how the exacuted the drama as a whole. Could have been better and could have been worse. Do I plan on rewatching it??? Yeah, but only if I'm really, really desperate for something to watch.

A CUTE ROMCOM WITH A DARK SIDE!
The story-line of this drama was well written as they never showed too many gruesome scenes in one sequence instead balanced it out with the romance. The cast was amazing, all of them were great but the male lead stood out for his funny expressions, it was fun to watch. The scenes with the villain were done properly without looking awkward especially the fight scenes. The fight scenes were sometimes comical bu they made it funny without overdoing it. The chemistry between the couple was also great. The ending wrapped up the entire story for all the characters and left nothing for us to guess. Overall, a drama definitely worth watching...

My second ever kdrama!
SWDBS is definitely up there as one of my fave kdramas. Many have said that the story tried to do too much but honestly I didn't see it like that. I saw a brilliant drama that just managed to intertwine the genre of romance, comedy and crime well. I feel that people put too many categories down as what a kind of kdrama it is. People believe that an office romance or having powers and the fact there is a serial killer in the drama is doing 'too much' to the story but I think it was done well enough so that it didn't affect the chemistry of the main leads.

Both PHS and PBY were perfect in this drama and their chemistry is defo one of the best I have seen. And my poor little Jisoo once again just falling short of being the guy for the female lead. But honestly this one was made for the Park couple.

The only flaw I saw in this drama really was the whole relationship with Guk Doo's ex and DBS' brother. Just thought it was unnecessary and also a plot hole as what even happened there??

Other than that, it was one of my rated 10 drama.

If you love comedy and happy endings, please watch this show!
I loved this show. Though I had to watch it more than once to better understand the story, I loved the comedic tone. It completely balanced with the scenes that were emotional and quite serious. This was especially necessary because the serial killer in the show was written in such a sadistic way.
I especially loved the romantic chemistry between Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Shik. Their chemistry made the story seem more real and fluid; it also helped to differentiate the reasons why Park Bo Young's character made the romantic choices she did throughout the series. It took me two viewings of the show to understand the love triangle, so if you have trouble I would suggest re-watching the show to better understand.
FYI: I loved the grandmother the best. Her role in the show was a small one but she was very memorable.

I absolutely adored Park Hyung Sik in Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. He was hilarious, sweet, and heartwarming. Also, super stylish - I loved all his outfits. Park Bo Young was also great as the title character. I loved their interactions and would 100% rewatch their scenes. The rest of it... eh, I accepted it as the price to pay for all of Park Hyung Sik's cute moments. This drama is a strange mix of romantic comedy with a disturbing crime mystery storyline, but I actually didn't mind the crime part as it tied in with Do Bong Soon's power. It was the bizarre side plot with the gangsters that I really didn't care for.   Towards the end I skipped past those parts entirely.

I have no memory of the music so I just gave that a generic 5.0.

A very interesting approach to a drama and I think it was pulled off very well indeed! The story really did start to get very good after the first few episodes and it left me hooked with the show! An all-star cast followed with a great production and editing crew made 'Strong Girl' a 'Strong Success'!
I feel like this show does deserve a second season, although I'm not really sure it will ever be made. It's a shame, as I think I've found a great plot for it. Anyways, talking about plot, this show managed to pull off the thriller plot, romance plot and comedy plot amazingly well! This show is a MUST TRY!

Had Potential
This drama was definitely addictive and fun to watch. The creepy serial kidnapper/murderer storyline was particularly interesting . The villain did a great job with his role. Park Bo-Young was so loveable and adorable. The juxtaposition of her tiny frame with her immense strength was amusing and entertaining, and very well done.
The romance was also very sweet and I actually cried for Guk-doo. The dynamic between the leading triad was done very well. Park Hyung-sik also did a phenomenal job and I couldn't help but fall for his exaggerated expressions and antics.

What let this drama down were the comedic sub-plots. I resorted to skipping many of the scenes with Baek Tak Party and its members, which in my opinion got way too much screen time in the last few episodes. They served their purpose well in terms of providing people for Bong Soon to beat up, but otherwise added nothing to the story. Similarly with the doppelganger Mr Oh at Ainsoft - I skipped many of his scenes too because they were distasteful and unnecessary. Because of these side characters, the storyline felt like a restaurant menu with too many options. The drama could have benefitted from a strong editing hand and less characters.

I don't know why I haven't drop this
I saw so many problems in this show I don't even know where do I begin to explain them.

Well, first thing: THE SIDE CHARACTERS. It bothered me how the portrayal of bong soon's power gets tiring at some point. In the beginning of the show it was interesting to see her beating up those criminals. But then it kinda got really repetitive to see them never getting out of the hospital because of her. And other than being beaten up by her they didn't really have any other function in the show. And what was that monk plot?! (if that can be called a plot even). It was boring, annoying, nonsensical and a bit racist. About bong soon's parents, I can't say I was bothered by her mother abusing her father. But that's a really serious thing that was being shown as a comic situation. So that's a huge red flag in the series.

Second: THE SECOND LEAD. Why did bong soon like him in the first place? He never let her end a sentence when she is talking to him or show him any kind of affection. He never shows her any affection. It's like he doesn't like her. But the thing is: he does like her, he just doesn't know how to express that I think? He couldn't even express his feelings for his girlfriend! It's ridiculous! I think the reason why he doesn't demonstrates he likes bong soon is because of her brother. But he's not even that close of a friend with him and her brother is not the type that interferes with bong soon's love life. So it doesn't make any sense. And there's also the fact that bong soon felt the need to hide her powers from him because she thought he would think less of her due to that. While min min liked her because of that and thinks that she's more interesting because of this. I think I don't need to explain further right?

Third: THE ROMANCE. Bong soon and min min's relationship was really cute. Actually I remember when this drama was still airing and I used to watch short videos and gifs of them. I had never watched a kdrama before so I didn't know how and where to watch these things, but I really wanted to. So I think I didn't drop this drama because of this memory I have. But while watching I got annoyed by how bong soon takes too long to realize her love for min min, and she only gives in to min min's love after that other guy (I can't remember his name) leaves her waiting in the cafe. I didn't understand her hesitance to choose min min since it was obvious the other guy didn't like her (actually he liked her but he's just a total idiot when it comes to love apparently). But the thing that really disturbed me was how, close to the end, I couldn't care less for their romance when all those girls were suffering hell with that kidnapper. Those girls were going through real trauma, they were going through all women's nightmare. And we were supposed to laugh of all the rest. I just wanted that plot to end.

Fourth: THE VILLAIN. The whole plot of kidnapping was the worst thing in the series for me. It was really a trigger. And it wasn't even well treated during the show. But that's smth I'm gonna talk about later. The thing is I don't even think he was a good villain, in relation to plot. The problem is how he doesn't have any connection or relationship with bong soon, so they only have their first meeting in the second half of the series. Bong soon spends a lot of time fighting those gang criminals instead of concentrating in the real villain. I was a lot times hoping that bong soon would finally pay attention to the kidnappings in her area. To sum up, the show didn't create a strong dynamic of antagonism between her and the villain.

Fifth: THE PLOT. When I began watching the show I caught all the heroic references, the opening, the story of her power and how she can lose it, the crimes happening in her area, and I thought I was going to see the story of how bong soon would become a true superhero. However, she took like a loooong time to begin thinking about those crimes and trying to find the psycho who was doing that. Actually, she only worried about that when her friend was in danger, because she was only a hero for her friend, she only used her power to help her friend and those highschool students who looked like a bunch of grownups. Or to hurt people for comedic purposes (min min, secretary gong, that doppelganger). All those kidnapped girls were being tortured and bong soon could only think about that guy who didn't give a shit about her. And when we were supposed to see her big fight against the villain it was all just so... lame. It was dull and annoying. She's Do Bong Soon. Why she can't end up that guy?! And it looked like her two love interests were the ones who really did smth. So bong soon, the great protagonist with superhuman power, was outshined by two men. It completely contradicts the bigger message of the show. The real problem of the plot was the difference of moods in the series. In one scene we're suppose to feel horror and pain for the girls in captivity and in the others we're supposed to laugh and swoon for the other characters. For a comedy series the dark part was too dark.

Wow, I really said some harsh things about this series. But it really disappointed me since I've always wanted to watch it. But the truth is that I should've dropped when I had the time.

If you can look past the messy story with multiple unnecessary plot lines, but enjoy slapstick humour and cheesy fluffy romance, you would likely enjoy this show. I certainly did! Just remember that the drama is supposed to be fantasy-based like a comic book.

The writer tried to pack too much into the show - romance, comedy, family drama and a triller with a serial killer. I think the writer is really good in the romance department - there were plenty of swoon-worthy scenes involving the male and female leads. The humour can be a bit low brow - I dislike that the writer used homosexuality for jokes but at least, they were not too crass or mean. In general, I found myself laughing out loud throughout the show. Where the story failed to impress was the whole dark triller bit. That sub-plot by itself was not bad but to counter the dark scenes with the romantic comedy bits was just too jarring for me.

There were a few fillers or scenes like the whole set up between Bong Gi and Hee Ji. As I mentioned, the show tried to do too much. I'm not surprised by some of the lower ratings since the story-line was all over the place and the scene changes did not flow nicely at times.

Acting-wise, I think the cast did a phenomenal job. The three leads (Bong Soon, Min Hyuk and Gook Doo) really played their parts well, and the supporting actors delivered great performances too. I have to say that the cast was filled with good-looking actors. Even the villain kidnapper played by Jang Mi Kwan was nice to look at during his crazy moments.

Park Hyung Shik as Min Hyuk is my most favourite male lead character to date. That boy is so lovely to look at, and he acted the different aspects of a besotted CEO so well. As Min Hyuk, he was arrogant, super confident about his looks, intelligence and ability. At the same time, he was dreamy, so sweet and puppy-like when he was with Bong Soon, for whom he fell hard and quickly after seeing her in her super-strength mode. I love how smooth he was in dropping hints of his love for Bong Soon, how he was so earnest and yet not overly aggressive in his pursuit of Bong Soon. He always gave her room to breath, and instead of demanding, he requested - like when he asked her to ""Please love me"", or when he asked her ""Will you come to me?"" before their first real kiss. His confessions and lead up to the proposal - just perfect! Well done, screenwriter! There were just so many scenes of how he looked at her, and spoke to her that made me squeal and my heart flutter :D. The final episode was packed with his charm and lovableness! I truly enjoyed watching his micro-expressions especially during his constant gazes directed at Bong Soon.

Park Bo Young was perfect as Bong Soon, our heroine with super strength. She is just so adorable and it seems like the role was written for her petite cuteness. To be honest, I was kind of annoyed that like many k-dramas, the female lead was portrayed as somewhat clueless, with an inability to think rationally during times of peril. Perhaps it is because I usually prefer the female leads to be smarter and more sophisticated, plus I expected more from a show that was supposed to be about a strong female character. Still, I got over my irritation and was won over by the great chemistry between Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Shik. Also, Bong Song did grow into a wiser, more thoughtful heroine towards the end.

Speaking of chemistry, I also enjoyed the bromance between Min Hyuk and Gook Doo. Those two had some great moments together. Ji Soo as Gook Doo was another perfect eye candy, and he can also act. He looked so dejected after being friend-zoned by Boon Soon that I had really hoped that the ending had him together with another female character. I truly felt for him because he realized ultimately that it was all about timing, and he missed his chance despite having had many years to express his feelings to Bong Soon who crushed on him throughout that time.

The OST was good - the music chosen fit the scenes and I did add a couple to my playlist. I like Heartbeat, the song that played initially when Bong Soon saw her crush Gook Doo, and then Min Hyuk.

I will probably rewatch the scenes between Min Hyuk and Bong Soon when I am in the mood for some fluffy romance and cheese. Episode 16 would be one that I will watch again and again.

I hated this drama. I forced myself to watch this because of all the rave reviews. I‚Äôve attempted and dropped it a couple times previously so wanted to give it one more shot... and it was so painful. Excruciating. Way too much violence against women, the irritating aegyo acting of the main character (especially the airy breathless whining and crying she does whenever she‚Äôs distressed... which is a lot) who was not likable to me at all (more on this in next paragraph), the whole tired ‚Äúinept and incompetent police getting outwitted by the villain‚Äù trope, and the overall attempt to layer cutesy romance, slapstick humor of side characters, and the dark and sexual nature of the villain preying specifically on small dainty skinny defenseless young women ... terrible.

The biggest reason I was disappointed by this drama was because there was so much potential here to say something meaningful about the perception of strong vs weak women. Instead strong here is personified by whoever can physically beat the crap out of someone else (see also her mom and how she treats her husband!!). Lately I‚Äôve been watching dramas with strong female leads that are empowered, independent, quick-witted, true to themselves, and these traits are the thing that attracts the leads to them. While strong is the premise of this series, I felt that
the protagonist, despite her superhuman strength, was very much never really in control of anything. It felt like she only used her strength impulsively based on her emotions (which made her come off more like a passive-aggressive bully teaching people lessons than a hero).

Another thing that really bothered me was that the lead was almost like being passed back and forth between the two male leads, never really standing on her own and relying on them throughout the series. They both empathized the desire to want to have someone to protect (eye roll) and they were both constantly chasing after her as if she were a child running with a pair of scissors who couldn‚Äôt do anything properly on her own ‚Äî and she goes with it quietly!!! Obliges, even when they yell at her. Come on!!

So many other dramas that are more riveting and do what this tried to do so much better.

The main guy is cute. That is the only redeeming thing here. +1 star for as he got me all the way to episode 12.

Haha.. I am one of the MINORITY didn't appreciated this drama..I tried to watch this because I want to know if it's really good liked what others said but my gosh there's nothing new about this drama just a typical ROMCOM drama.Maybe romcom is not my cup of tea ever but I still watch some romcom that suited to my taste. Hehe... I realized that fans really loved romcom and didn't appreciate the essence of the other dramas. Haha..

The story is unique but I felt it's empty somehow
The characters were fine but not impressive and no characters development
No comment about the chemistry of the leads because I am not investing too much on romantic part of any kdramas.

What can I say, it's gaddamn Park Bo fucking Young!

She's hella cute, hella quirky and such a good actress! I loved her in Oh My Ghostess so I thought I'd give this one a try

Story: FIRE. Shit was boomin from 1st episode. A strong (literally) female lead that gives no f*cks when it comes to people trying to harm her. She's definitely one of the best female leads I've seen. It definitely is a good thriller. Not the best but it's definitely up there.

The chemistry was dope, top notch! (although I did like her chemistry with Jo Jung Suk in Oh My Ghostess better, it was still close to that level with Park Hyung Shik)

Acting/Cast: Obviously dope. as. f*ck. Everyone did a great job, a phenomenal job really. Even the comedic relief characters did great

Music was so good! I'm a MAMAMOO fan so the OST is up there with one of the best for me.

Overall: if you're looking to watch a fun, yet intense thriller with a STRONG, seriously STROOOONG female lead, you're gonna love this one! Give it a try!

I haven't had as much fun watching a drama in a long time. It was a perfect mix of comedy, drama and action. Do Bong Soon is one of the best female lead characters I've seen so far in k-dramas. Park Bo Young did a fantastic job as did the rest of the cast. This show also has one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen. Truly heart-warming and a definite must watch as far as I'm concerned!

This show has so many things wrong with it, yet I loved it to pieces.

Its plot doesn't know what it wants to be. Should it be a thriller with a crazy kidnapper and a small woman going against all odds to defeat him? Should it be a fluffy romance between a poor girl and a rich guy? Should it be a goofy, slapstick comedy? This writer couldn't pick, and so they blended them all together in a sort of odd way, but I was okay with it. I know in my heart that there were so many things wrong with the structure of the show, and even with its writing in some spots, but I was so in love with Bong Soon and the rest of the cast, I didn't mind. The show was ridiculous, but it was okay. It wasn't ridiculous because it was written poorly. It was ridiculous because that's the kind of drama it is.

I loved the whole cast. There are a lot of really talented people in this show. Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Sik have especially great comedic timing, and tons of chemistry. The supporting characters were well done, too.

The music sort of annoyed me at first, but it grew on me after a while. I think it really suits the silly nature of this show.

I would definitely consider rewatching this show, just not right away. I want to analyze it further to see if how I feel about it now will change at all.

This show is insane, almost too insane. This show's constant mood swings between thriller, romance, and comedy were jarring at first, but I learned to accept that that's just how this show is. It's silly, it's all over the place, and there's some things wrong with it that should have ruined it, but it's unbelievable charm kept it afloat and helped the ridiculousness just be another part of the fun. It's chaotic, but in a good way.

I definitely recommend this drama.

First of all, the drama is good but not very good. The director had a good concept but he Fcd it up with unnecessary things.

I like Park Bo young's acting in this and her previous dramas as well. The others also acted well. The comedy is good. The villian is also good and clever.

This drama shud have been edited to 10 episodes and remove the unnecessary shit out of it. Then it wud have been a very good drama if not amazing. It doesn't deserve a 8.8 rating in MDL in my view. The comedy track with the thugs was useful and funny at first but it deviates from plot towards 2nd half and forms its own drama which the director placed the scenes when the original drama got intense . It's just there not helping the plot or anything.

The Mc has been acting like a teenager with love track. I mean its given he had dated several women but act like a high schooler like his first woman crush. I get it with Fmc becoz she had one crush and didn't date. But with Mc its not acceptable as he wasn't a high schooler or this is a high school drama. The Mc looks too happy for everything.

Finally what i want to say is although it has flaws which are easily noticible it's a good drama worth of 8 / 10.

This was actually a pretty cool show. I watched it coz of park bo young. She is one if my favorite actresses and park hyung shik isnt bad either. Hes cute too.though its full of dark thrilling scenes the gang and kim won hae the gay employee made it fun with their wit. Its laugh out loud and scary at the same time. The other fun parts was the mum. Shes just a hot mess but she was cool.. Must see show.

From the very first episode I was into this! I wanted to know what would happen next and it had to do with the great acting.... The story was pretty good with great plot twists. Of course this was very predictable but at the end of the day it was very entertaining.

Story 9/10
I enjoyed the fun plot of this whole drama. Most people would say that the story for this was all over the place, i didnt think so. I think it had the right amount of humor, romance, and suspense. I can understand why one might not like this. But I think the suspense and comedy balanced each other out perfectly in this.

Acting/Cast 10/10
The best part of this drama was the cast. Everyone was just so much fun. I loved that I didnt get bored with anyone's character. Everyone had a role. Lets start with Strong Woman Do Bong Soon herself, Park Bo Young. The role Bong Soon was made with her in mind. Her crying scenes might be annoying at parts but overall she was perfect! Park Hyung Shin as MinMin was the best. He was so adorable. His reactions were just wonderful. I loved how he accepted Bong Soon for who she was. Ji Soo, I dont even need to say much. He was a great second lead. Unfortunately I just didnt feel his chemistry with Park Bo Young, which was good. I wasnt a victim of the second lead syndrome in this one lol. Finally Jang Mi Kwan as the best villain ever. He gave me the chills every time he was on screen. I will be looking out for more of his work in the future.

Music 9/10
THe music was on point and really enhanced the watching experience. Great OST overall. My favorite is Super Power Girl just because it describes Bong Soon so well haha...

Rewatch Value 9/10
Why not? It is a lighthearted drama. If I am feeling down it is perfect...

I looooved the chemistry between Bong Bong & Min Min but the random filler characters were just so out of place and awkward, getting rid of the suspense from the main plot with the psycho killer. Like literally I loved the gangsters and Bong Soon's mom at first but then they would just pop up in the most random places like what...?

This was one of the dramas of 2017 that I started watching as soon as it first aired and I just finished it today. Man, it was soooooo good! It's a perfect combination of the rom-com and thriller genres. Never have I ever watched a drama where I was squealing almost every episode from the cutesy and romantic scenes but also where there was suspense and horror lurking in the corner. And it never got boring or super cheesy, especially I was very fond of the unique humor. It was very well incorporated to make this series fresh and easy to watch. Some people might criticize the violence or the unnecessary abuse scenes in the drama, but half of this story is unrealistic and shouldn't be taken very seriously.



It's a wonderful story about 2 people falling in love, how they develop feelings and trust among each other. I couldn't help but smile every time the leads were shown together, their chemistry is out of this world. The other actors did a spectacular job as well, none of the side characters were left out, since they got enough screen time to display their own unique roles.



If you're into very sweet and cute romance stories, you'll definitely enjoy this one like a delicious dessert. It's worth all of the hype so go watch it ASAP!

Omo, omo, this couple is going to be a fan favorite. Min min and Bong Bong are just too precious. Their love is what drives this drama forward, keeping everyone watching ...
This drama is by no means perfect. There are a few plot holes, and the drama has the tendency to focus too much on secondary characters. Even with these shortcoming, the romance in this drama makes up for it.
This drama is truly fresh and new. Featuring a peanut size King Kong as the lead protagonist. Park Bo Young will steal into your heart. Park Hyung Shik's performance as a snarky chaebol keeps delivering the SASS. His love and obsession with the surprisingly strong protagonist will keep you grinning from ear to ear. What are you waiting for?! Go Watch It!

- Kdramas have a problem of not balancing the interest level of both Female and male characters but this show proved to be one of the rare exception.
- story can be better, but the character relationship and actors amazing work and chemistry won me over 200%!
- made me happy!
- Satisfying ending!
- More girls should watch this and more guys should learn from Min Hyuk

I did wish they further explored the woman's equality issues but Min hyuk truly showed how you should treat a woman. True men are secure and appreciate a strong woman. Not pressuring but treat her and each other with respect.
BONG BONG x MIN MIM FOREVER!

This drama will make the audiences feel happy.

Love filled in the air, especially between the male and female lead.

The leads have natural cute chemistry. And I can say that Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Sik are one of the best on-screen and off screen chemistry couples in Korean drama. Their chemistry is the key factor that makes the huge contribution to the success of Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.

The story of this drama balance both romance and thriller but actually few last episodes ( except episode 15 and 16) are quite weak. It took too long to catch the criminals.

The ending is quite satisfied and this drama is warm- hearted, funny and loving drama.

If you like romance and comedy dramas, this drama is worth watching.

Boring...
BORING....
BOOOORING

Unfortunately I don't think this drama deserves much praise.
I think it's overrated, I didn't like the main character Boo, I don't know what.
To me she was more of a ""bully"" than a superhero.
The love triangle doesn't work for me.
I found the story very boring, wanting to mix several genres and it was not good until I watched it.
I really tried to love like most, but for me it's one of the worst in terms of story and character development.

Perfect romance/chemistry, but overall drama just doesn't work
I try to balance out my ratings with a combination of objectivity/subjectivity. Hence, the highest rating I can give this drama is a 6/10. And that's only because the lead pairings' buildup/chemistry was one of my favorites (my bias is heavily at work here, lol). Even then, the overall drama just doesn't work due to the other three plotlines: Company threat, gangsters, and serial killer. Our leads had to share their plotline with the other three and the result was disastrous. Lol, the gangster/serial killer plots were such a mismatch to the romance that it felt like three different dramas (slapstick, horror, and romance).

I couldn't finish this drama the first time around and on my second, I fast-forwarded everything that didn't involve the OTP's romance. The production team had a goldmine OTP and really should have written the overall plot around their romance: Maybe explore the lore behind Bo Soon's powers and focus more on Min Hyuk's relationship with his family or the leads' passion for developing games while building up their relationship during this process. You'll have a much more cohesive drama this way. The gangsters/serial killer plots don't connect well with the romance and should never have made it in the script.

Oh well, at least the creators knew enough to give us plenty of sweet scenes between our swoon-worthy leads. Aside from their story, this drama really is a trainwreck.

this drama include the themes of comedy, romance, supernatural, bloody thriller and action and adventure. this drama does a good job tying everything up together. the actors do a good job playing there role. this was my first time meeting all these new actors and actresses and believe me they did a pretty awesome job at portraying their people. there was a super rich, pretty faced, gaming company guy. then there was a cop who tries to do a good job at his work in the police force and takes on the toughest cases. then there is the main lead who has to take on the role of being a superhuman and having the strength that nobody can imagine. and keeping that secret from everybody else and using that power against bad people. the toughest part of her job is explain how she got hurt, how the others broke all their bones and why she fought. then the evil character has to play a psycho which he does a pretty good job at. i think that they should have made the villain a superhuman just like our actress but, they didn't but if they did that would have been much better cuz then she would have a better opponent to fight with. therefore making the battles more nail biting and edgy. cuz two people with the same strength will be a better fight. but, they do a really good job especially when the big plot twist comes in the end. this drama does a really good job when it comes to including the funny scens. because usually in a mystery and crime related there is no funny scenes because it is all serious. but, there were a lot of funny scenes especially from the lead actress. who knew superhuman strength came with the power of making people laugh? anyways this is totally the best drama to watch if you wanna see a girl who has superhuman strength that you wish you could have.

Watching this drama, I often found myself in a poker face.
There were just fragments of interesting scenes..
I think what went wrong here is that the production tried real hard to merge various genres equally. I mean, they tried putting in the comedy part which I think doesn't went accordingly to the story. Yes, it would be much better with the comedy but it shouldn't be overdone.
Nonetheless, the actors are really commendable. Park Bo Young gave a really awesome acting here. She could pass into melo. The scene in somewhere about episode 14, WOAH. Park Hyun Sik also did a good job. I'm just kind of distracted when he acts kind of gayish (maybe because he's friends with KwangHee, lol). Lastly, I think Ji Soo could also pass as An Min Hyuk! He's really good and got great bod, hotter than Clara LOL.

Oh, and I can't help but notice Bong Soon's mom's pretty face. OH OH OH, and Jang Mi Kwan!! I looked into him and it's said that this is really his first project. WOW, he could go real far with his acting. I wasn't scared much as the drama has a weak storyline but his acting is really commendable.

Finally, what's really good about this drama is their OST! SUPER POWER GIRL!!

A piece of advice (well, it goes differently to different people), don't expect much from this drama. It's good but not as much as it is getting attention.

Story: I really liked the story actually, because it kept me interested to watch it. Some of it was sometimes too much to handle, because there wasn't only ONE story line, but many that made a big one and for some people that might be a bit irritating, but in the end all the loose ends come together, so I really liked it.

Acting/Cast: The people chosen for their roles were really on point. Every character is likable and you get to know some backround of the protagonists as well which is crucial for the storyline. I think that some characters wouldn't have been necessary but that's just my own opinion.

Music: I really really loved the music! I fell in love with the love-song-theme from VROMANCE, omg my sister and I are singing or more humming (we don't speak korean) the melody all the time xD

Rewatch Value: I would definitly rewatch this show, but not too soon, because the storyline has so many strings that it's not an ""easy"" show to watch because sometimes it seems too much :D But I would rewatch it some day for sure ;)

Overall: Overall I'd say that this drama is very adorable and likeable.

I have to say, this is my number one drama! Ive watched so many dramas to date, I cant even remember how many, But this one, its a winner. Comedy, Romance, Mystery, you name it, this drama has it all. To date, Ive already rewatched it thrice and each time, I cant get over how funny and light-hearted this drama is! And of course, the main cast members dont make it any much easier to leave this drama, (total eye-candy!). I'd say give it a try , watch a few episodes and you will fall right in love with this drama !

One of my favorite drama, a perfect combination of suspense thriller, love story, humor and a lot more!
You will love it as well, the acting was great as well as the story line.... I fell in love with Park Hyung Sik watching this and a lot of viewer thought main characters in this drama were dating in real life, that was how real his acting was!!!!!! Of course, Park Bo Young is my fav female korean Actress as well. But I wanted to learn more about Park Hyung Sik. This is my 2nd favorite, My Mister is the 1st.
The author is full of imagination and sense of humor and she is the one who wrote ""My love Eun-dong"", ""The lady in dignity"". I loved both dramas but out of 3, Bong soon is my favorite!!!!!!
I am sure you will enjoy every single episode.

This drama is full of serious moments which turn into comedy while the overall drama turns from comedy into something (mostly) serious. I started watching it and I completely understand why some people really really hate it. It's different from other dramas, especially in the beginning. Don't worry, later on it takes more characteristics of a normal drama.

Story:
Prepare to get your typical drama clich√©es and moments...BUT there will always be a turn on it that takes the comical route. Seriously, this drama doesn't take itself very seriously (in the beginning).
What makes this drama different is: in other dramas there are many storylines working to problem and one resolution in the end, in SWDBS there is more than one main story and not all of them have the purpose to end at the finale but some of them are resolved right in the middle. I loved that. It seemed more real and kept the story fresh.
Also you will get A LOT of witty conversations and funny comebacks. It's just really funny, even if you can guess (some) of the outcomes. Also the characters are really interesting and enjoyable.
I do admit, that I didn't like Bong Soon all the time. Sometimes she was really annoying but that's not for the actress but the character. And the acting behind the character was really believable.

Acting/Cast:
I really really really have to compliment this cast. The cast was chosen perfectly, the characters were written amazingly. After this drama I really know what it means to act with your eyes. Seriously, I think like 70% of the acting was facial reactions. And not just the sad or touching parts but also the comedic acting was done perfectly. The lines were delivered perfectly and I really liked it. Compliments to HyungSik also, I didn't realise he was such a great actor.

Music:
Appropriate for the drama but I wasn't really into looking up the songs, I admit.

Rewatch:
I tend to only rewatch very few dramas...SWDBS...maybe one day. I'm not against it but I'll probably only rewatch specific scenes.

Overall:
A comedic drama with some genres which you'd never expect in a comedy. Get used to being totally confused over what's happening but enjoying it wholeheartedly. Also a plus point? I think SWDBS is a great and recommendable drama but you probably won't get into a drama slump afterwards. So nice not being depressed for once after watching a good drama ^.^

This is a classic example of an average drama redeemed by a great cast. SWDBS had serious plot issues: whole plotlines were improperly developed, stunted or abandoned sans resolution; many main characters were seriously two dimensional; the humor was (literally) crappy at times; and there were too many unnecessary storylines/characters unnecessarily taking up screen time that could have been better utilized fleshing out the main characters and their motivations. I'll confess I skipped whole sections even in my first run through and didn't feel like I'm missing anything.

BUT..... (and this is where the drama rocked) the charismatic cast, ESPECIALLY HYUNSIK (more on him later) took what they had and RAN with it, leaving me giggling, squealing and marathon-ing the episodes (along with multiple replays of probably every scene with Hyung Sik/ CEO Ahn)....

Min-Min and Bong-Bong made me feel like kawaii hearts were flying off my screen every time they came on despite one of my pet peeves in a romantic pairing: one partner being noticeably more invested in the relationship than the other. Though Bong Soon makes up for it somewhat in the penultimate episodes, I was left with the feeling that the romantic balance was off. Which was especially sad because the losing half was my main reason for sitting through this drama.

Which brings us to this drama's STRONG point as far as I'm concerned: A heart-melting, squeal-inducing, cuddle-worthy PARK HYUNG-SIK as the strongly individualistic and swooningly vulnerable Ahn Min Hyuk. I've had a soft spot for him since his Heirs days (he and Woo Bin redeemed that otherwise cringe-worthy drama for me) and his performance here has made me want to try Hwarang, which I'd dropped after the initial 10 minutes. If he continues like this Hyungsik could end second only to Ji Chang Wook in my heart's (giant) kdrama soft corner. He still has a long way to go before he even comes close to JCW's triple crown (Healer-K2-Suspicious Partner) splendor, but I'm cautiously looking forward to his next project.

I really liked the show. I think it deserves an 8 but I gave it an 8.5 because of the following:
-The romance was great. Who she ended up with, they were soooo cute together. The guy especially, I loved how he played his character. He is so cute when he's in love.
-I liked the dark, detective story. The criminal played his role well, he was so creepy.
-The comedy was great most of the time
-the bromance! Ah! So good!
-Music perfectly fit the show
-the acting was of course excellent

What I didn't like though that really brought down the score I gave:
-It tried to be too many things. If the show had stuck to one aspect like the comedy and bong soon trying to come to terms with her powers, I think it would've been better. I know why they had to have the criminal storyline but it was so contrastingly dark, it was jarring sometimes. I felt like the best parts about the show was the comedy and the bromance but They didn't touch on those as much. they should've come up with a different storyline to get her comfortable with her powers.
-I REALLY disliked two of the characters. That lead gangsters who was hospitalized forever in a body cast and the project team leader, omg, they were both sooo annoying. I didn't think they were funny at all. It really detracted from the show. They were both so useless and their characters were so over the top. No not good.

I still recommend people watch it. The beginnng was really strong. Towards the middle it got more involved in the crime genre. Each were good stories, i just thought it was too much together. It was overall, a really funny show and the romance was so cute! I just loved them. And seeing Bong Soon grow up and into her powers, seeing her believe in herself, it was a nice thing to watch.

What can I say? I was really looking forward for this drama. The main male actors are people that I've been following since they debuted and I've also followed Park Bo Young for a couple of years now;not because of the trends or recent popularity, but because I do believe they have great acting skills.

I really loved the story in the beggining. The antagonist role is one that I have not seen in any other romcom drama (or at least not one that I remember), so for the first episodes it intrigued me, it captivated me and I wanted to watch them all in one sitting if they were all available at the moment. But as the story got closer to the middle I believe it started to lose its focus and concentrated, instead, on the super cringy relationship between the leads (seriously guys, I sometimes skipped their parts because I couldn't bare to watch it lol but then again that may be only me)

So once that happened I also started to get bored. last episodes became harder to watch for me and sometimes I just forgot about the drama for days or even weeks and then came back to see it because I didn't like leaving things unfinished lol.

The ending was absolutely predictable, but thet was okay by me, nothing wrong in there, I like simple and happy endings. But the female lead became even more clingy at the end (which I didn't think it was possible), kinda ignorant for my taste, and it sort of destroyed her own image of a strong woman who needs no man to save the world and catch bad guys when she had to rely on her rich boyfriend to give her a job, which was a huuuuuuuge disappointment to me and then led me to rate the drama as I just did.

In conclusion, its a good drama for those who do not care about reaaaaaally cringey scenes involving an almost 30 year old woman who acts like a child, for those who are happy with the story losing its focus on the antagonists, and for those who also do not care about characters that are supposed (I believe) to empower woman and end up being a disappointment.

Perfect drama
The acting is superb, there were no actors that fell short in skills and the plot is very well thought out. The comedy is perfect for me, however, it is not just some funny drama, but also has suspense and tension between the villain and the fl. I love the couple so much, they are so cute together. Even the ost is good and the supporting characters bring great value to the drama. Their comedy isn't too over the top where it is cringey like most dramas are. Wish to see the leads do more future dramas together!

GIRL POWER, YO!
Full disclosure, I am a female gamer and I freaking love shows with powerful female leads and video games. This drama is one of my absolutely favorites, I've seen it twice and I incredibly rarely ever re-watch shows. The lead actress is ADORABLE. The lead actor is ADORABLE. I like them together so much, they play off each other really well. It's refreshing, to me, to have a male lead that's more about being cute and silly and less about being brooding and aloof and a total dick.

I think the best part of this show was combining the super emotional female with the super strong female. That is so relatable to me. Even on my stronger days when I'm feeling most triumphant and like a total badass I might burst into tears over the dumbest stuff. The lead character is like that too. You get to watch her beat the ever loving crap out of bad guys, but she's emotional and weak sometimes too. As a side note...have you literally EVER seen a chick cry that cutely? It was like watching a cartoon kitten cry crocodile tears.

The comedy in this show is top-notch. It's hilarious watching this tiny cute child-like woman punch a dude and then make little sympathetic noises and apologize and then hit him again. It's so entertaining. It's like watching a 2-week old kitten smack a bulldog. The male lead is hilarious too, his constant good natured trolling and pranks are super fun to watch. Together their chemistry is outstanding.

The side characters in this drama are so well done. Kim Won Hae is exceptional in literally every drama ever, but in this one he plays two comedic supporting characters masterfully. The entire group of gangsters is fun to watch. The group of school-aged street thugs is fun to watch. There are SO MANY supporting characters and they do such a good job developing each one individually. The lead antagonist is excessively creepy and I would love to have seen him get the living crap beat out of him about 20 more times during the show...but that probably means it's really well acted if I hate him that much right?

The only character I actually didn't like at all in the drama, AT ALL, and could have done without was Kwon Hyuk-Soo as the weird fake Indian monk guy. The acting was SO SO bad and nothing he did was remotely entertaining. He added no value to the show at all. The voice he used and the gestures he made were offensively flamboyant in a way that Kim Won Hae's gender fluid tech lead character was absolutely the opposite of. I literally hated everything about this monk dude and wouldn't have minded him getting a little smack in the face at some point.

The concept was pretty much amazing and unique, I really like how the petite Bong Soon was so strong both mentally and physically and Min Hyuk was amazing as well in his role of cute and succesfull CEO Min Hyuk. The second male lead was also nice and I loved their bromance together. xD My least favourite character would be probably Gristle, most of his scenes seemed more cringe and embarrasing to me rather than actual funny. The OST was good but nothing memorable expect the theme song which I really liked. This korean drama is certainly living to its hype!

this drama is hilarious and the couple is super adorable and cute...
Strong Woman Bo Dong Soon is about a woman with super strength (Park Bo Young) who becomes the bodyguard to an eccentric chaebol heir (Park Hyung Shik).  A love triangle develops between them and the woman‚Äôs longtime friend (Ji Soo) who is now a police detective on the hunt for a serial kidnapper.
Strong Woman Do Bong Soon was a fun drama that mixed in romantic comedy along with darker crime elements. It has some issues, but with a main couple that will leave you with a cheesy grin on your face episode after episode, they are the reason to watch this drama.
Park Bo Young plays our strong woman Do Bong Soon. She‚Äôs so tiny and is about as cute as can be! Park Bo Young really brings this character to life with her comedic abilities as well as being so completely endearing. Bong Soon is an easy character to root for and connect with.
Park Hyung Shik is our eccentric chaebol heir who runs a software company. When he discovers Bong Soon‚Äôs ability, he immediately hires her as his bodyguard. Little did he know that he would fall head over heels for her. And if you like a leading man that dotes upon his lady and displays all kinds of cuteness, look no further than Park Hyung Shik!
Ji Soo plays In Gook Doo. He‚Äôs a long-time friend of Bong Soon‚Äôs who she has harbored a crush on since middle school. Now a police detective, he‚Äôs on the hunt for a criminal who is abducting young women. And it‚Äôs his concern for Bong Soon‚Äôs safety that finally brings his feelings for her to the surface.
We then have the crime side of the drama which gives us a little excitement and some thrills. There are definitely some pretty dark elements involving the abducted women. The kidnapper is pretty creepy, and the women go through some quite difficult and scary things.
Despite some shortcomings, Strong Woman Do Bong Soon did end up being a very fun drama overall. Park Hyung Shik and Park Bo Young are both adorable individually as well as together. As I mentioned earlier, they are the reason to watch this drama.
The main story is good, though it suffered from a lack of development and uneven pacing. There is plenty of humor as well as a few thrills to keep things exciting. So overall, Strong Woman Do Bong Soon was more than enjoyable and left me with mostly good feelings.

ultimate ""girl crush"" to the max
This drama is the ultimate ""girl crush"" to the max. Slap Stick display of strength and a cute love story. Abit of thriller elements thrown in. Don't forget the love triangles too. One of the better Park Bo Young comedic roles. Supported well by the surrounding characters

A common kdrama storyline. But stay for the chemistry and the funny moments. Not your usual Kdrama

A reverse prince charming story

Lovable, adorable and strong Park Bo Young. And with 2 handsome male leads for the girls to drool over.

A must watch for romance fans
Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is definitely one of my favorite love stories and the romance is definetely the reason to watch it. The story is interesting enough but nothing amazing, I think they made a good job balancing romance, comedy and thriller for the most part. Although funny, the slapstick humor is bit too much sometimes. Also, some sensitive themes like domestic abuse and homossexuality could've been handled better, but overall the plot is decent and with a good pacing.

The entire cast does a pretty good job with their acting, however the protagonists are the highlight of this show. Bong Soon sets herself apart from most female leads for being not just emotionally, but physycally strong. Not gonna lie, though, she was a bit too childish and had very unrealistic expectations when demanding a job she wasn't qualified for, but I managed to look past that.

Park Hyung Sik really shines in his role here. Min Hyuk is funny, smart and captivating, there's no way you won't fall in love with him. His chemistry with the fl is out of this world, I was actually surprised the actors didn't date in real life. Their relationship is certainly the best part about the drama and they have very cute moments with great kiss scenes.

Also, a shoutout to the scene where the trio (Min Hyuk, Bong Soon and Gok Doo) team up against the villain in the end, they all looked super badass!

This drama is really gripping and entertaining with a fantastic love story, however it's not for overyone. If you are a hardcore fan of rom-coms, though, definitely go for it.

I fell in love with drama. This drama was really good. From the storyline to the acting of the actors, It was just perfect. I really enjoyed watching this drama. Park Bo Young's acting was really good and she is so cute throughout the drama. Park Hyung Sik's acting was really good as well and tbh, his acting was really cute and funny. He looked like a big child tbh. Ji soo's acting was good too and I really loved him throughout the drama. He portrayed the character given to him beautifully. This drama was really hilarious. Not only the main but the supporting cast also made super funny. But despite being super funny, It has all the drama and thriller that make it exciting and anticipating. The actor which played the character of the psycho kidnapper, He played it really well. His acting was phenomenal. In all, It was a really good and I would definitely recommend this as it is a real time killer. You would definitely enjoy it.

Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover...
Imagine Superman was a tiny woman and cue the hilarity that is Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. Whilst navigating her way in a patriarchal world where appearance is king; what gives her self-assurance & confidence stems from her strength, in not needing a man to physically protect her. Park Bo-young makes for a refreshing FL in not being a conventional weak beauty. We can actually see ourselves in her. I have to admit that this started out with a 10 rating which gradually fell short. At the beginning it is fast-paced and strikes the perfect balance between physical comedy & thriller. The graphics are on-point and the dialogue is snappy. I do get the overall impression that this series was made for a young audience hence the vulgarity in parts. You know her & Park Hyung-sik are made for each other when they start arguing like an old-married couple from the start, they really are one of the cutest couples I've ever seen. However, there is a turning point where the gay gags are just overdone and cease to be funny. Kim Won-hae who was tremendous in the beginning for some reason gets drafted into playing his own doppelganger which does him no favours at all. The Indian guru turning out to be a Korean con man is also a completely futile attempt to inject some juice into the flagging narrative. I am really quite miffed that such an amazing series left me with a bitter aftertaste due to being stretched out to the standard 16 weeks. I hope the KIndustry is learning from Netflix that it's ok to leave it at 12 or less episodes!

This is an extremely entertaining show. And that's just it, entertaining. If you are looking for something deep and emotional, this is not it. This is however one of the best comedy dramas there is.

I love how the story is not made to be believable at all. Everything is exaggerated but to the right amount that the show doesn't annoy you.

The romantic story of the lead couple is cute and it's refreshing watching a drama where the male is visibly and obviously in love with the woman.

The cast is impeccable! All of them!

Music is meh, not memorable at all

This is definitely a show you would want to watch again.

So I‚Äôve watched this show about like 10 times! There‚Äôs some people who say that the story line was messy but I really don‚Äôt think so I think everything went together. The mix of the comedy and romance between the president and do bong soon is incredible and just so cute! The comedy is also very funny. The show is 10x more interesting cause of those little moments where do bong soon fights or has those moments that showcases her abilities. Tbh those moments make me swoon and I‚Äôm like I WANT TO BE HER! The ending had me crying and I was just like their so cool!!!

This is only 1 of 2 Korean dramas I‚Äôve ever rewatched.
This drama was amazing. I absolutely loved everything about it. The chemistry between the leads, storyline, comedy, drama, everything was amazing! This drama made me laugh so much! Definitely in my top 3 recommendations for Korean dramas.

The only thing I thought was a little abrupt with this drama was it seemed like after pursuing the female lead for a while, the female lead all of a sudden likes the male lead and stops liking the 2nd male lead even though she‚Äôs had a crush on the 2nd male lead for a very long time.

My new favourite
I didn't think I could like any series more than ""What's wrong with Secretary Kim?"", but this story has taken its place in my heart. I watched the entire series over 36 or so hours and skipped less than 5 minutes of the story. This story revolves around romance, action, redemption and family and is uplifting and fun. I can't speak for my male counterparts, but as a woman who enjoys superhero stories this was a win win for me.

A few things to note:
1. If you dislike fantasy or are looking for realism this is obviously not the story for you. It's based on a woman with supernatural strength so don't expect it to be realistic.
2. You can see from the cover that there will be a love triangle. I despise love triangles, but here it was written in a way that I personally didn't mind. The female lead is sweet and caring and doesn't play with anybody's feelings and I wasn't left broken-hearted with her choice. It is a very satisfying happily ever after.
3. I don't know what the age restriction on this is, but because of the violence/gore I think it's definitely not meant for children.

With above three caveats in mind, get ready for your new favourite series!

Good story with fleshed out main characters and thoughtful comedy
I have watched this twice. Once by myself and once to show my husband. What I loved about this show: Park Bo-young and Park Hyun Sik's chemistry is stellar!! They light up the screen. Gut-busting comedy without the tired traps of putting down women or talking bad about the disabled or otherwise marginalized. The romance is cute (although it kind of materializes out of thin air). What I liked: Again, I love the chemistry the whole cast carries on. So the romance, including the second male lead romance, is worth it, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to have a starting point. I won't say more than that. What I hated: how eerily perfect the depiction of terror, abduction, and sexual abuse was (the actual sexual abuse isn‚Äôt shown). It made me uneasy, but it wasn't gratuitous. I could have done without the ashram bit because it felt like filler and took up a good bit of the end half. I would re-watch a 3rd time as well and probably will. It is one of my favorites.

Why was this drama my favourite of all time?
Personslly this drama really made me happy ! it seemed strange at first but by the end of episode 1 i was in love.

it's been 4 years since this show was released a nd it is still one of the best dramas. all my family enjoyed watching it too.

the cast picked were amazing and all had such great chemistry. the two leads looked amazing together and are, by far, one of the most amazing couples in any drama i have ever watched.

i enjoyed the crime element of this series but with the touch of comedy, it really hit the spot


(THIS IS WHERE SPOLIERS START)


personally the first episode was strange. but as it progressed it got more and more amazing. do bong-soon (park bo-young) is such an icon. like what is she? she strong, she's sassy and she's kind. the men who own the building site can go away, literally and physically (lol).


an min-hyuk (park hyung-sik) was an amazing cast to this show. a young ceo, who is incredibly smart and makes games? yes please.



the overall drama was on point. and was the best drama to have ever been made.

A Perfect Drama
Wow. Just wow. This is a perfect show. You have action, romance, fluffy cuteness, comedy, strong characters, friendship, unrequited love, a serial killer, and gangsters. I had no idea what to expect when I watched this, but I regret not watching it sooner! It was a pure joy to watch 99% of the time. I laughed. I cried. I smiled like a dork. The entire show was just perfect. And I really loved how it really I played Bong Soon‚Äôs strength as a person and her warm personality. I would totally want to be friends with her.

First of all, I‚Äôve heard a lot about this drama, mostly ‚ÄúAww!! How cute this drama is!!‚Äù or ‚ÄúAww!! look at the couple! How cute they are!!‚Äù. So naturally, I have had high expectation for this drama. Apparently, I found the drama and the lead couple as cute as most other romcom K-Dramas out there.

Secondly, I didn‚Äôt like much how the lead female character is portrayed. I have watched the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Click‚Äù movie and found Park Bo-Young‚Äôs acting pretty okay. So I guess it‚Äôs not her acting but the way she has been asked to portray the character is what I found a bit annoying. This is, of course, a personal judgment and I guess this exact fact has made many fall in love with Do bong soon.

Last but not the least, personally I am not a big fan of ‚ÄúSuperhero‚Äù genre.

But I am crazy for Psychopath based stuff. That‚Äôs why I got hooked to this movie from the very beginning. Yes, not the cuteness of the drama or the fun part of superhero stuff but the psychopath based storyline makes me complete watching this drama in two sitting.

The opening is pretty awesome. Twist in almost every episodes and the build-up of the plot are simply amazing. I started having this feeling that it would be one of my most favorites. But No! When it comes to thriller, a perfect closure is a must which doesn‚Äôt occur in this drama apparently. The last two episodes literally disappointed me. I would like to explain why I felt so but then I would end up giving spoiler. Anyway, the story should have been ended in a much more sensible way. There are some other, though few, inconsistencies in the story.

Nonetheless, the overall storytelling is smooth. The comic stuff is okay. I loved how Park Hyung-sik portrayed both the ‚Äòcarefree‚Äô CEO & the ‚Äòone awestruck by the charm of the female lead‚Äô in an equally amazing way. I have seen him in ‚ÄòHigh Society‚Äô and I wonder if he is so natural in term of playing a chaebol role because he is actually a one. Apart from the leads, I did love Jang Mi-Kwan in the role of the psycho; he does justice to the character, specially his creepy smile.

As for the OSTs, usually, a new song, that can be an OST or a score, gets included in my playlist right after I am done with a K-drama which didn‚Äôt happen this time. I liked the ‚ÄòHeartbeat‚Äò OST though.

Overall, a pretty enjoyable drama if you can overlook those inconsistencies.

A classic to watch without worrying~
‚ú®classic, very good, just watch this without worrying and the cast is so impressive! ‚ù§Ô∏è? (the villain psycho character is really horrific omg and do bong soon is an unforgettable character?) love the couple minmin&bongbong ?? tbh i watched this for the couple more than the story (i don't really like the dark story that gives bad tones to the rom-com type of that drama) they have a great chemistry between them!

I see them more than a relation ""actors only"". That their roles aren't just roles to play and that's what I like about the cast in general. Its seen that they had fun and that they are close even irl‚ú®(i know they aren't a real couple, but if it was, they would be so cute together ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è)

btw the story is mixed ... From thriller to rom-com like in a shojo ... I didn't like it too much but the character was worth it tbh ?‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Wholesome and swoon-worthy
Honestly, this was one of the most wholesome and swoon-worthy dramas I have ever seen. The relationship between the lead couple was so precious, it's hard not to fall in love with them and die with every cute moment!! I just felt like the ending was a bit rushed, they could have given it a little more time, but other than that, it was amazing!! BongBong and MinMin are goals <3 the acting and the chemistry of Park Bo Young and Park Hyungsik was so on point, I honestly don't know how she didn't fall in love with him as he fell for her...

I was surprised to find a lot of the top reviews highlighting so much negatives. Yes, this drama has comedy, action, romance, and crime - a lot to different dynamics to it, but I personally find that these actually elevated the drama considering its main premise and made it much more entertaining to watch.

20 min into the first episode, it's already very clear that the show doesn't take itself very seriously. There are scenes later on that explores a more serious tone but I won't call it ""dark"" which a lot of the other reviewers complained. In fact, I find that it adds more depth and complexity to Bong Song's character and abilities. The male lead also did very well in this drama - his character really draws you in and paired very well in contrast to the female lead. Music is done really well and it lets the audience know when the story wants to show a funny or a serious moment.

The only complaint I have is that it does slow down a bit in certain parts and the crime component in the end feels a bit forced, but nothing ground-breaking here that would make me stop the series. I suppose for some people, the main premise could be a bit too ridiculous for them to handle, but honestly, just watch this with an open mind and you'll be quick to get sucked into it! I think it's that good! VERY ENTERTAINING!

This was a fun show to watch. It made me mad, happy, sad and feel basically all the emotions in a good way of course. I loved the main girl she was good. She was very strong every time a person got on her bad side she head sure that she kicked them really badly and made sure they got hurt. All the actors and actresses were really good at this show. This show is also empowering to women to let them know that they can be strong and the hero if they want to be. I loved this show a lot it is very good to show. I loved the scene where her brother who a doctor told her to stop beating people up becuse there was no more room for people she had beaten up to be there. I would recommend this is anyone no matter if they're new to Asian drama or been watching them for years.

This is one of the best dramas (if not the best) I have ever seen. To begin with, I thought the story was fun and refreshing. We have the typical love triangle, but it doesn't feel too long as it sometimes does in other dramas. The characters solve their issues pretty fast and in a somehow realistic way (taking into account that the circumstances of the show are not supposed to be realistic at all).  The actors did a great job too. I immediately fell in love with most of the characters, especially the two leads. Their chemistry was amazing, and their screen time together was glorious!

This was my 3rd Korean drama and I was glad it was so good.
Loved:
* Actors - good acting, cute
* OST - the songs have been on my playlist for many months now
* Romantic tension was just right

Didn't love:
* Several plot lines. They had a purpose but sometimes it dragged and when I was vested in one story it switched to another story
* Poor 2nd lead. I don't know why I still feel some type of way about this.
* The mom - she was abusive, it wasn't funny and didn't add to the story.

I got my daughter's friend hooked on the show and got an earful from the parents because she was watching so much tv. We thought it was worth it.

Fun superhero story with both action and romance
I loved this drama so much! Ended up binge watching it over a few days and am so glad I finally caved in, after years of having people recommend it to me.

The entire story is very light humoured, and the absurdity of some scenes just add to it. The ""role reversal"" of the lead characters (incredibly strong and small woman protecting the man, who's more fragile than her) didn't feel over done, and both lead men were so respectful towards her. There wasn't a moment in which I felt that they saw her as anything other a great girl, never really looking at her like a ""superhero"", which helped humanize that superpower storyline.

The editing and the songs were fun, too, and so many of the characters were hilarious. That actor that plays two characters is phenomenal, and I'm pretty sure I laughed until my belly hurt in every single one of his scenes.

I definitely feel that this drama is a hit or miss depending on the style of humor that the viewer has, but it worked perfectly for me, so I'd definitely recommend it. And I'll be keeping an eye on this cast when I choose my next dramas, too. :-)

Everything about it is beautiful
‚ÄºÔ∏è WARNING: THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS BUT NOT IN A OBVIOUS WAY ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Story: Although there are still some things in the drama that aren‚Äôt explained very well, like how did the power the woman in Bong-Soon family, or how did she gained her powers again after losing them. Obviously i do have some theories it would be good if they could give us more explanations about it. The story itself is good, some things about the culprit also wasn‚Äôt explained very well but that‚Äôs okay since he was a psychopath he could have done it without having a real meaning behind his actions. The story for me is 9.5/10, everything is very sweet and cute love it.
Acting/Cast: 10/10. Everyone performed their characters very well, including the villain. The actors absolutely made us fall in love with every character and it was very well done.
OST: 10/10, loved the background songs it made every scene more beautiful and real.
More general information: This was my second korean drama, and i deeply love it. The ending for me was cute but I was expecting to see some interaction between Bong-Soon and her babies, also i understood that what she wanted was to protect people with her power but it kinda of made me sad that she probably no long produces games like she originally wanted to do, but i guess that‚Äôs just character development and the maturity she gains during the drama. Another thing that i absolutely loved was the love development between the main couple, it‚Äôs really sweet to see them falling in love specially Bong-Soon. Another thing that‚Äôs absolutely cute it‚Äôs the way Guk-Do realizes he‚Äôs in love with his best friend, and also realizes he no longer can have her and instead of acting like a dickass, he understands it and only wishes for her happiness and also wants them to stay friends forever. One of my favorite scenes is when MinHyuk says he won‚Äôt leave BongSoon side even if it means he‚Äôs also going to die, it‚Äôs beautiful and it‚Äôs also when they both understand the deep love that exists between themselves. It‚Äôs also beautiful and absolutely cute how they ‚Äúconsume‚Äù their relationship lmao i loved that episode.
Overall it‚Äôs a really good drama, would recommend it, it has an happy ending, it‚Äôs really funny, absolutely laughed a lot during the episodes, it also has some triggered scenes so be aware of that.

slapstick humor, easy watching
I laughed so much while watching this and enjoyed it thoroughly. Park Bo Young is such a versatile actress and even though I am not a fan of love triangles somehow I will still watch and enjoy them if she‚Äôs apart of the show. This is an easy must watch for anyone who enjoys a little bit of slapstick and a little bit of mystery. Although it may be a little plain if watched right after a great series or movie, I found it to be a welcome relief in between the melodrama or action suspense series. It was digestible, most of the humor landed for me and it was just a touch romantic. I would recommend this to someone who likes to laugh and who needs a break from the intense shows but not to someone who wants depth and intrigue.

This was the first drama I ever watched and have fallen in love with these stories since then. I love how such a heartwarming story can have a lot to give to its audience. From cute and cheesy moments to darker ones when you don't want to see the characters suffer. I think it's important to point out that this show has its fair share of creepy moments because it took me by surprise, nobody warned me about this.
The storyline was messy at some points and I'm not sure I liked the end, didn't make much sense for me. But overall, I enjoyed the main leads acting, they were so cute together and they are to blame for my unrealistic expectations regarding relationships.

I absolutely adored this show. It‚Äôs filled with cute romance and hilarity which I very much enjoyed. The characters were just so perfect and I loved them all, especially the leads. The chemistry of the couple were on point. The comedy in the show was cleverly executed. The crime side plot gave the drama more depth. Although the drama would‚Äôve survived without it, I think in the end it was necessary to provide a resonating message to audience. I will rewatch the drama occasionally because of how much I enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it.

I did not think that I would love the drama as much as I did...This drama's plot was very unique and was fun to watch though the gene included thriller...(but it made it interesting i promise). The female main main lead Do Bong Soon (played by Park Bo-Young) is one of those iconic characters that won't be forgotten. Bong Soon was fearless, EXTREMELY STRONG and had an adorable bubbly personality. The male main lead was very charming and sweet. Their chemistry together was out of this world as if they were a real couple!!! I loved how their acting became natural over time went on....definitely worth watching and would recommend.

I was waiting for the leading lady's comeback since oh my ghost. And though the beginning of this drama was a killer, the ending lost most of its charm and ended up a cheesy rom com. Thankfully, there was the serial killer case that at least kept it refreshing and interesting. Honestly, the main idea of a girl having the super power of strength kind of scared me off this drama, especially after having watched weight lifting fairy straight before it (felt like a rip off). However, I gave in and watched the first episode and I was immediately hooked. The girl was very cute, the guy funny, the second lead interesting and the serial killer case thrilling. That was until they became a couple. The drama shifted its attention from the girl's powers and quest of justice to the development of the romance. Okay, the couple was cute together, but some more twists on the criminal case would have been nice. One other thing that bothered me about this drama was the constant advertisements. Most of the dramas do it smoothly and some of them even hide them so good that you can't tell if they are promoting a product or not. But this one just had some unnecessary scenes simply for the purpose of advertising. If that had happened once or twice, it would have been tolerated, but there were scenes in most of the episodes. So, 6 out of 10.

REWATCHED FOR 3 TIMES IN A ROW?!
Hello!
This drama is one of the most famous drama from South Korea. I watched this drama back in 2017. I found out ''Park Hyung Sik'' from 'Hwarang' and eventually fell for him. Later discovered this drama, which was on air that time! Let me tell you straight if you haven't tried this yet! This is a MUST WATCH DRAMA if you're into the genres like 'rom-com, super power, fantasy, female power, suspense' etc. The drama gives you whole vibe and make you groove from the starting to the ending. We won't fall for the 2nd lead thankfully here. Don't even think, this is the continuation of 'weightlifting fairy', cause both the storylines are different and not even similar!!Yes, as you read from the title, I watched this on 2017, again on 2018, 2019 and now 2021! Still I would love to watch again. You won't regret! Just go for this drama. ALL THE BEST!

It has been quite a while when I first watched this drama. I recently finished rewatching this drama and I fell in love with it again.

I do not know where to begin this review. The plot line was easy going, simple but very touching. It was not really complicated or so, but what was very interesting was that it was about a strong woman. This time it is not the man who needs to protect his girl, but the girl who protect the man. There were some plotlines which were a bit boring but that was not really a problem. Nevertheless, to get to the main point of this review is their chemistry, Park Bo-Young and Park Hyung-Sik were so cute on screen. I just couldn't stop looking at them and videos about them because they are so cute.

I would definitely recommend this drama to everyone, you will definitely enjoy this drama.

I'm actually mad at how many people only watched one then two episodes and dropped. I was on my way to do that as well but I wanted to see how cute our leads were but their cuteness isn't the only thing that keep me in with time.

There's nothing dark about this drama. More meaningful. How could people have missed that completely? This drama is about women, not just Do Bong Soon born with a physical super strength. But women with their own strength and how society treats women in general.

-Her mom is that woman who'd only plan on marrying her daughter because she's a girl and she needs to bare children, to her that's her only role. That she gets hurt mentally or emotionally, that's not her problem.

- Her first crush is that guy who'd only like to be a macho to women so women will need him to be protected.

- The psycho and all these other gangsters are all these men who thinks women are their toys so they can do as they wish with them because they are the ""weaker sxx"".

- Her boyfriend is the guy who knows her woman is strong and loves her however she is. (Min Hyuk is the real one here.)

Are women not treated like that? Yes, her powers are super natural but it's to showcase that women are strong. And I think this is empowering, that's why i love this so much. And i can't believe people didn't see this, wow.

Watch it, right away!

LOVE IT. I love a strong female lead, and I love this.

I'm not a big fan of love triangles, so I was worried, but there was no need to worry AT ALL. The way the main character changes her affection from one guy to the next is so natural, and it makes so much sense. She's not all that hesitant about it either, just mostly confused at first, which I think is totally accurate.

Plus, I love the main actor! I had never heard of him before, but the two have great chemistry~ I spent a good bit of this giggling and squealing. There were parts where I cried too, but they were all worth it to get that amazing ending~

10/10 Strong Woman Do Bong Soon!
This was hands down my favorite kdrama thus far. It had funny parts, great editing, fun characters, thriller elements, crime fighting and great character growth for FL.

I loved the main leads and they did so well in their parts. Everything worked at a really good pace in the story.

I didn't want to watch this drama at first because the synopsis did not sound all that interesting but I did on a whim. I binged it in one night, staying up till 10am the next day to see the ending.

This drama definitely gave me a crush on Park Hyung-sik and Park Bo-Young. They were people that I would be friends with. I also loved the friend of the FL. They had a very sweet relationship where they supported each other. *start of rant* I cannot any longer watch dramas where the FL has no friends or support. Why. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT. *end of rant*

If you need something that will make you laugh and cry then this is it. It was awesome to see Do Bong grow into who she wanted to become. She was strong and kicked ass. I was so happy with the ending.

This is the first time I've actually rewatched a drama in its entirety, I usually don't do that and seek new dramas instead. I feel like it's rather because of the fact that I find this drama easily enjoyable and time-killing rather than it's a masterpiece.
Let me start with the fact that I'm probably one of the few who didn't think the story was a mess. The crime element, as in the kidnapping seemed solid to me as without this the main story would go nowhere since the three main characters wouldn't interact, at all. I feel like if this was totally a rom-com, it wouldn't be half as good as it was and Bong-soon's superpowers would be useless to the plot. I'll admit I don't know how to judge acting unless it's ridiculously bad, and this wasn't the case. Both Min-hyuk and Guk-du annoyed me at times but none of the actors are to blame. They did quite well with the material they had. Park Bo-young totally stole the show though (I wish they had given her some better clothes though, she looked lovely but her wardrobe was questionable). I couldn't imagine anyone else pulling the character of Bong-soon off the way she did. I must say I loved how the story went by really quick, at least to me it felt like the 16 episodes passed by in a blink of an eye. Now that we're done with the praises, let's move on to the negative aspects of the drama - there weren't that many as there could have been but no drama is perfect. Let me start with the fact that I tend to ignore the OST unless it's something I really enjoy (like the Goblin OST which I listen to this day) but with this drama, you couldn't because of how often they played it. I'm not saying the songs included were bad, but it would have been much better if they didn't play it every 5 seconds or so. Another negative aspect is the homophobic remarks. I'm not going to elaborate on that because everyone knows which moments I'm talking about but as I'm not straight I must say I was slightly disappointed that the writers did not realise that there is no need to be offensive to be funny. Another one is Bong-soon's mom and her unhealthy relationship with Bong-soon's father. I found it tiring to watch at times. There is also the completely unneccessary plot with the monk. I completely don't understand it, what was the point? Same goes for the relationship between Guk-du's ex and Bong-soon's brother. However this one made a lot more sense than the plotline with the monk did.
To sum it all up, it feels like I wrote more negative things that positive ones but nevertheless it was a good watch which I enjoyed so I'm leaving it with a solid rank. Would I recommend it? Not on the top of my recommendation list but it's worth your time if you're just starting to get into K-Dramas or if you have a lot of free time or if you're looking for something easily enjoyable.

I‚Äôm glad I actually decided to watch this drama after putting it off for so long. I‚Äôve seen scenes from this all over the internet when it came out and it looked like a romance drama so I never really got into watching it, but man was I surprised that this drama actually had some dark content with kidnappings. Not what I was expecting at all from what I‚Äôve seen around the internet. I definitely would watch it again if I had to. It has everything from comedy to horror. Honestly I wish this show was a lot longer and I‚Äôm sad that I finished it so soon.

Hilarious and touching ‚ô•Ô∏è
After a heavy drama, this one will certainly enlighten the mood for you.
I mean, the story isn't original but it it works very well. Little King Kong and the heroine, excuse me, little King Kong and the hero, were touching, charming, funny. Unlike most of the viewers, I've watched Happiness and come to know Park Hyung Shik and watched Doom at your service before this one, so the visuals of course for Park Hyung Shik it was like it was another actor he was serious loving caring in Happiness and here üòÇ he was naturally hilarious, I loved both of his roles, for Park Bo young I preferred this one, superpower girl suits her better ‚ô•Ô∏è It was that binge watchable drama that will remain in your comfort dramas type, It was a warm watch, Gamsamnida...

It‚Äôs funny
Humour is nice and drama is light hearted . I loved watching it as cast was quite nice and running is relatively less . Story was also nice and exciting. There was suspense that hold you up to complete whole drama . Casting and acting is quite applause able. . But still out of all points I gave above it was definitely humour that entertained the best. As it was the factor that makes it different from rest all Korean dramas .
That all I would like to say . It is must watch because watching female leads dominating the screen means a lot to female audience . Watching women taking all the things in their hands is definitely worth watching .

Funny, romantic, sweet, and with the right amount of action and danger
I think this series is one of my all time favorite K-Drama series, at least in top 3 or 5.
First time I watched it earlier in the year, and just recently re-watched it. It was fun to watch it again.

Park Bo Young's performance in this series is amazing, it is one of my favorite character in all the series I've watched, just about 80 series. It is also my favorite character from all the character that she performs. She's just so cute, sweet and funny, totally adorable. Yet when push comes to shove she can easily go into kick-ass mode.

The chemistry between her and Park Hyung Shik, the other main lead, is amazing. He acts the right character for this series, a guy that is just flabbergasted of her, just like anyone would be.

But I've rarely laughed so much and so deeply, the humor is over the top. The romance is strong and everything just seems to click perfectly together in this series.

Perfect series.

Worth noting, the soundtrack for this series is also my favorite soundtrack from all the series. There are many great tracks and I can easily listen to the whole album over and over.

A complete Package....
Actually, I'm not a RomCom lover unless I love the Lead Actors or it blends with crime story just like Strong woman. Parkk Bo-Young was one of my favorite Korean Actress coming from Oh my Ghost and Abyss, she is one of the best but I was surprise with Park Hyun-sik , I started to love him in this drama. His acting and visuals in this drama were level up. I love how the Writer pull of the series. Their love story blends well with the crime part in this series. Although, in the crime part, the Culprit doesn't really justify why he is committing the crime, I don't mind at all, Bong Bong and Minmin's love story was enough for me already plus the OST here was 10/10. I made it as my ringtone actually. This is why I love Kdrama over other series, aside from the lead actors, distinct stories, expensive productions and amazing cinematography, you can also look forward for the OST's.

Cute but overhyped
This has been on my watchlist for an really long time and I finally got around to watching this, and I‚Äôm sorry to say that it was quite disappointing. The only good thing throughout the show is the adorable romance between the leads and the ML gushing over the FL. Apart from the romance, there‚Äôs quite a dark subplot which I felt that started off well, but as the story progressed it gets all over the place and the last five episodes are such a drag. The drama consistently jumps between light and dark and it feels a little discerning.

There were also plenty of problematic things which I felt were passed off as humour ‚Äî to start with: the entire focus on the lead being gay, or the stereotypical way in which the LGBTQ community was represented, almost always being the end of slapstick humour. I also didn‚Äôt appreciate how the FL‚Äôs mom‚Äôs abuse towards her family was passed off as humour, it wasn‚Äôt funny at all.

To sum it up, without the extremely wholesome fluffy chemistry between the leads, there isn‚Äôt much to love about Strong Girl Bong Soon. Majority of it feels like a filler after a point, especially towards the end.

Most hilarious Korean Series ever made!
This still tops my most hilarious korean series ever made. It is light, uberly hilarious and sweet too. I like how the lead male let do bong soon be herself and support her all the way. I specifically like the mob boss and his right hand's characters they really made the show intensively hilarious! I like the development of the love story. It was gradual and progressive. The lead actress was so perfect for the role. Sweet, innocent-looking and too fragile-looking. You will really have a hard time believing that she is super strong indeed! All the minor characters really popped out, they all contributed to the rolling-on-the-floor-laughter this show evokes. There was never a dull character in this show. Until now, i highly recommends this to my friends. Watch it and you will never regret it!

Strong Girl Bong Soon is a fun and alright drama. The decent cast carried this drama through its simple plot line. If it wasn't for the cast, I probably would've given this drama a miss. Nevertheless, I'm glad I gave it a go as it definitely had its good moments.

Characters/Acting:
I am all for the female heroine vibe, no damsel in distress drama. Bong-Soon's character and her powers only being used for good does send an overall good message. Park Bo-Young as Bong-Soon did an incredible job portraying a cute, tiny lady who no one would suspect to be so strong. Her emotional scenes were very good and her 'cute' acting was just that...very cute.

As for the lead guy, Park Hyung-sik, he did a good job portraying that young, cool, gamer CEO character vibe. Min-Hyuk as a character is never too serious and is actually funny at times and Hyung-sik did great acting out that comedic side of the character but still kept him very cool and CEO-like. Although he didn't have much emotional/serious scenes, when he did have them, he did them very well that it almost brought me to tears.
His 'cute'/'flustered' scenes however, were exaggerated far too much that if it wasn't for the genre of this drama, it would've been cringe-y. But since a lot of the side characters were also exaggerated, this part of his acting blended in and somehow actually worked well.

For the 2nd lead guy, Kim Ji Soo, there wasn't really a lot of variety to his acting and that's because of the character he had to play. His character, Gook-Doo, was meant to be serious and is the total opposite of Min-Hyuk. There wasn't really much to him besides being serious and a couple of emotional scenes. The way Gook-Doo's relationship pans out with Bong-Soon was also a bit silly in my opinion. He seemed to have this big brother vibe with Bong-Soon as he always yelled at her. Later on he realises his real feelings and it just seemed silly when he says he never realised Bong-soon's feelings for him because he was too into his own feelings. It just sounded stupid to me, if I'm being frank.

Aside from the 3 main leads, all the supporting cast were all pretty decent too. I have to especially mention Kim Won Hae who played both Kim Kwang Bok and Oh Dol Pyu. I actually started to get annoyed with his character portrayal of Kwang Bok as it was waaaaayyyy to exaggerated but then when he came on as Oh Dol Pyu, I was just impressed. The way he acted that character was spot on. Though, it was still exaggerated, it just seemed to suit Oh Dol Pyu more.

Story/Plotline:
There really wasn't much of a story to this drama. It's very very easy to follow. There's the main 'thriller' story and the love triangle going on beside it and that's pretty much it. Some of the scenes didn't even make sense in the drama and were literally there to just be the 'in-between' scenes. It wasn't necessary as it didn't really add anything to the story and most of them tried to be funny but instead got a bit annoying.
I did however enjoy the romance side of the plot and the way it progressed between the main leads. It didn't feel rushed and it seemed pretty realistic/relatable in terms of how one's feelings towards someone else can eventually expire.
The best thing about the story/drama for me was the ending. I'm a 'happy ending' / 'and they lived happily ever after' kinda person so I was very satisfied with the ending of this drama.

Music/OST:
The OST was alright. There were a couple of good tracks but they are quite forgettable. If I heard them again, I probably won't remember it came from this drama.

Would I recommend:
Yes, but only if you don't mind exaggerated characters/acting and a few cringe-y moments. This drama is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a slapstick comedy with a side of thriller, that says it all. If you just want to watch a fun, cute romance drama then I would definitely recommend this one. P.S. It's worth watching for Bo-Young and Hyung-Sik's on-screen chemistry and visuals to be honest :D If you're a fan of either of them, then I would give this one a go.

This drama made me start to think about all the dramas I have watched in the past, especially the ones I have rated 5/5. And yesterday was the day that Xiao Nai had been overthrown by Ahn Min Hyuk as my drama boyfriend. It was a hard decision and Nai will always hold a place in my heart, but Ahn Min Hyuk was everything. He was funny and silly and when he needed to be serious, he was one of the most professional CEO I have ever seen. But most importantly, from the moment he saw Do Bong Soon, he knew that she was his soulmate. And I am not going to lie, In Guk Doo deserved sooooo much better than what he got, and I did tear up during most of his scenes towards the end when finally realized that he's always liked Do Bong Soon, but at that point, she was already in love with another man. It was heartbreaking, and I want him to find his happily ever after, but he can't have Do Bong Soon because her and Anh Min Hyuk were soulmates. After I finished binge watching this drama, I went into this little depression knowing that I had to say goodbye to perfect Anh Min Hyuk. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE deserves to find someone like him in their lives. Yes, he was a little childish at some points, but it added to his charm. He was who is was because of a broken family, and once he found out what real love was, he didn't want to let go. He was super extra and honestly an amazing hype-man and I mean all of this in a good way. I've watched dramas where there has been a dramatic and extra character that I found annoying, but I don't know if it was because of the writing or the actor, but I didn't find this character annoying whatsoever and thought it added to his charm. Also, you knew how in love he was with Bong Soon. It wasn't a fall hard fast and get bored with you in a few months or years. Anh Min Hyuk, solely based off of the looks he would give her...it was EVERYTHING. You could read him like a book. He was so in love with Bong Soon. Plus, the things he would say to her when they were alone were super romantic and he opened up his entire soul to her. I still remember, and cried, the words he spoke when he asked for her father's permission to marry her. When he asked Min Hyuk what he liked about his daughter, he said something so simple, yet so moving. That he loved her because she was simply Do Bong Soon. ""The feeling that I only exist when she does, and I don't if she doesn't."" Yes...I am super deep in this korean drama hole, but honestly, I don't care. And yes, it sounds super extra and cheesy, but after watching this drama, I fully believe him with my entire soul. Throughout this whole drama, he gave her his entire soul and even knowing that she had this super strength, he still told her that he would protect with with his entire being, either be emotionally or physically. And let me tell you, homeboy kicks some serious ass. He shines in multiple, different ways in this drama. And don't be fooled - he is not all talk.

I also believe that this drama has some of the most emotional scenes in any drama I have ever watched, including a lot of american dramas. There is one scene in particular (ep 14), it was super heartbreaking, where he did everything in his power to try to save her and when he failed, he didn't run away to try and save himself. He still tried to emotionally comfort her and told her that she was not alone and he wouldn't leave her side. And I wish I could tell you more about this scary af scene that broke my heart but also showed me what being completely in love with someone looks like, but it would spoil how raw this scene was.

Honestly, I am super jealous of everyone who hasn't seen this drama yet because the moment you do, you will experience everything in this show for the first time. You will fall in love with Min Hyuk for the first time. You will experience hating Buk Doo and then learning to love him. You will experience Bong Soon's struggle with learning how to love herself and learning that she wasn't born with a curse, but a gift. And you will experience how fucked up the villain of this drama was. Such a solid villain - one thing that can make or break a story is a villain.

I loved how the romance in this drama did take up a chunk of the story line, but it wasn't the main plot of the drama. I loved how this was a coming to age story for Bong Soon about learning how to love herself and loving her gift. There was this emotional and powerful scene with Bong Soon and her mother and grandmother and they talked about how the women were gifted with this strength because they are the leaders of their households and the communities and they, as woman, were born to protect the people they love from harm, and then pass this strength onto their daughters and teach them to be strong. It was such a girl power type of drama, but it was also great because it didn't belittle men at all. This drama showed that men and women were both strong in many different as well as in the same ways. But I must say, poor Buk Doo, somehow was the smartest, yet dumbest cop I have ever seen. His character annoyed me, but this drama was so good that even though I didn't like him because of the way he treated Bong Soon and how he never stopped to think about how his actions affected other people, I stilled cried for him at the end when you learn more about his character and how much love he also had to Bong Soon. He he def on the top of my ""they deserved better"" team.

One last thing, over the course of a few months, I have watched a few dramas, and for the first time in a long while, I didn't hate the main character. Going back thinking about Weightlifting Fairy, Hot Girl, Love @ Seventeen, and even Sweet Combat, this is the first time that I was completely on homegirl's side. Yes, I thought she was being annoying when she was in love with Buk Doo and not Min Hyuk, but I think that is the beauty of this show. When Min Hyuk saw her one-sided love that wasn't one-sided, he didn't shove himself in the middle and make her fall in love with him. He just continued to act like himself and knew that eventually she would fall for him. Or maybe she wouldn't, but he didn't try to pretend to be anyone he wasn't. He knew that he was this broken person, but he wanted to be a better person for himself as well as a better person for the woman who stole his heart. And I loved the slow burning romance of Bong Soon realizing that the guy that has always been on her side, helping her, accepting her fully, was the guy she loved. And you got to experience that shift with her which is why I loved her so much. There was this one half episode where I was like...homegirl...wtf...why are you pushing him away, but Min Hyuk stayed by her side and kept his promise that he would always protect her, even if she was too stubborn and didn't think she needed to be protected. He took the time to understand her and her situation but also treat her like a normal girl.

MY FIRST K-DRAMA
During quarantine I decided to venture out of the western-hollywood scene and explore more international titles. This drama was the very first k-drama I came across and I absolutely LOVED it! The cast & characters were amazing and fully entertaining the entire time. I expected the show to be more romance than anything else, but to me it was definitely more of a Drama-Comedy. I love the family dynamic, it felt very classic; I love the female lead actress/character; and I love love the ""thug boss"" character (I could not stop laughing every time I saw him). The villain was questionable at times, but very interesting and I did not expect the end outcome. Overall, it is now a staple in my list and something I would recommend to any/everybody!

Idk how to describe it without just... soft. I loved how Bong Soon wasn't made into a man in a woman's body because of how strong she is physically. I'm all for strong female leads, but people tend to make it only about strength in a masculine way. She was completely feminine and wonderful!
Now for the Fluff Factor-- this was a slow burn (in my opinion, though I've seen slower) with cute moments sprinkled throughout, which is just how I like it! It wasn't too long, and it didn't add unnecessary stuff after getting together just to make it longer, and I was never really bored. Sweet and satisfying ending with a great aesthetic and great characters! Overall, pretty much the best one I've seen so far. Definitely recommend!

Agh.... my heart.....
Honestly, this show was able to pull on my heartstrings harder than most of the previous shows I watched. It was cute and had some light comedy, but what made it give me a lasting impression was the romance. In fact, the romance was so adorable that I won't be surprised if I find myself on YouTube rewatching certain scenes so that I can fall in love again. But hey...... there is more to this show than just romance. A few other disappointing elements...

Story „ÄÜ(„Éª‚àÄ„ÉªÔº†): This is where the majority of my problems lay: the story. In short, the story was extremely messy at first. So much was happening to so many different characters, and you just had to follow along. Not that it was necessarily confusing since each plot point was straightforward, but it instead started to hurt the show in the long run. Because of all the side stories, the writers had to try and wrap them up to make way for the main plot. But that instead just left us with unsatisfying closures and a plethora of characters that have nothing to do. It's these very unwanted characters that stopped the show from being much higher on my list. When a side-characters story is over, they just hover around and do stupid things to try and keep the comedy alive. In the beginning, the humor was so strong. I haven't burst out laughing as many times as I had during the first few episodes (a major feat since I don't consider myself someone who laughs a lot). But as the show went on, some parts got heavier to match the darker plot. Yet to the writers, that just seemed like a call to add as much humor as they possibly can. So now we get needed characters doing stupid things that neither farther the plot or keep you interested. It was a huge downer and bored me so many times. I would have brought the story score down much more if it wasn't for the main couple. They were the most well-written and sweetest little things! Everything they did was so meaningful without the writers forwarding their relationship via troupe checklist. The main rich guy, Ahn Min-Hyuk, is a prime example of the show creating something new and enjoyable. Yes, he was the rich and lonely character, but at the same time, if we were to strip him from his wealth, not much would change. He did have his shopping sprees and cool gadgets, but his character was so much more than having a company and a bank account. His personality was so likable and flowed so nicely with the story. There were other characters that were written well like this, but he is just the first person that comes to my mind.

Acting ÔΩ°„Çú(ÔΩÄ–î')„ÇúÔΩ°: I honestly love/hate the casting done on this show. I have no problem with any of the main characters. Park Bo-Young played the little King Kong, Bong-Soon, so well. Bo-Young just naturally can make any character so cute you just wanna hold your heart and never let go. But despite her everlasting cuteness, she was able to pull off serious and heavy moments as well. I think she was the perfect fit both physically and personality-wise, which made you want to root for right-of-the-bat. I already talked about how much I loved Min-Hyuk as a character, but without Park Hyung-Shik, I don't think it would ever be the same. Similar to Bo-Young, Hyung-Shik fits his character perfectly to the point where I can never see anyone else in that role. Just his smile alone was enough to melt me twenty times over. That smile partnered with Bong-Soon's cuteness just killed me over and over again. Those two did so well in the romance aspect, making them probably my favorite couple to date. Ji-Soo also did an outstanding job with the gold-hearted police role. He was humorous at the start and heart-wrenching at the end. Which only ended up making the love triangle harder to watch. With my praise out of the way... I need to make light of a few casting issues. Like seriously...... in the world of Korean actors they couldn't find someone who didn't look over 30 to play a high school character!? That was one of the funniest things for me. And on top of that, all the gangers were also a little odd. Not that they didn't fit the appearance, but none of them really caught my attention and just seemed like actors trying to get through the script without showing much. And the ones that did try their hardest were just a little too much for me....

Music „Éæ(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)„Éé‚ô™: I usually hate talking about the music since I am no expert and struggle to evaluate it properly. Yet I can confidently say that I loved the music from this show. Well.... love is a strong word. I wouldn't go and look for the soundtrack, but when I was watching the show, I enjoyed listening to it so much. It was so unique to this show that if I were to be asked which show does this song belongs to, I would be able to identify it in a heartbeat. Not just the main opening theme was recognizable. Many of the background songs helped the scene carry more meaning and were just as catchy to listen too. It's in no way near the most spectacular music, but it is incredibly delightful to listen while watching.

Other (‡∏á¬∞ŸÑÕú¬∞)‡∏á: *sigh* ...... that's really all I can start with. I loved the idea of a tiny girl having super strength, so It was delightful to watch play out. But - I'm sorry to bring it up - the rules just didn't make itself apparent to me. As I always say, I am a stickler for supernatural laws and love knowing what can and cannot happen. But it's just super strength, what else needs to be clear? If it were just strength, then I wouldn't have an issue. It's just that this show made the idea of losing one's powers a terrible thing. And I get it. They have to stop people like Bong-Soon's mother from using it in the wrong way. But how exactly is the meaning behind an action judged? I initially thought one would lose their powers if they did something with a dark intention behind it, but apparently, that isn't the case. That brings to question about all of the stuff did with previous strength holders. Did the ones who kept their strength really not accidentally harm a person? It's just the show tried to make some kind of line to keep the supernatural women in check, but it just left me a bit more confused. Nothing to pull your hair over, but something I would have definitely loved answered.

Time to wrap things up! This review is a bit long, so sorry about that, but I just needed to get some things off my chest. All in all, the story was enjoyable. I wouldn't say this is my favorite show, but I will say that this had my favorite couple. The love story was the main saving grace and kept me with the show when I was starting to falter. Without such a well-written duo, I would have never enjoyed it as much and would have most likely considered dropping it. So if your a romance fan (more specifically a fan of cute and fluffy love stories) than this show is for you!!!
Will there be some tedious and frustrating things? Yep. But it's all worth it to see Bong-Soon and Min-Hyuk smile at each other with the most sweetest puppy dog eyes.
Happy Watching <3

""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" has just about everything one could ask for in a drama: Romance, Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Cop/Detective, Supernatural, Martial Arts, a small helping of Medical, & even a few scenes with a Historical element. Normally, such a hodgepodge of genres would result in a muddled, muddy mess; however, each aspect is done very well; more than capable of eliciting tears, smiles, feelings of happiness, anticipation & anxiety, & more laughter than some straight up comedies! The actors are incredible, but that's pretty much a given in regards to K-drama, imo. Still, I appreciate how dedicated they are to their craft.
Bottom line, I don't think one could go wrong watching this series! I bet you'll be hooked after a couple of episodes, at most!

This is the second drama that I'd recommend for anyone to watch.
I don't remember the songs that I've heard from this drama.
I have an outstanding memory of this drama, in and out. It was filled with cuteness, love, comedy and it was absolutely perfect.
I love this drama because it shows how strong women can really be. It shows that you should never be fooled by a pretty face. Innocence doesn't mean weakness.
The two main actors: Ji Soo and Park Hyung Sik are perfect for one another.

At first Ji Soo annoyed me, but the serious role fits him. It makes him super duper sexy.
Park Hyung Sik is hilarious when he gets jealous. He is definitely funny when he gets drunk. I love his character.
Overall this drama gets a 10 stars. It was well performed, well casted, and it didn't make me cry. Which is a rare matter when it comes toward dramas.

There's nothing sadder than a show that has so much potential never reach their full on potential, sadly that is what happens with Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. If it wasn't for the main leads chemistry and performances I would've probably dropped the show. The main proble with the show is that it gets stuck in a storyline and it drags it out until the end. Also the show is quite lighthearted so the serious stuff doesn't fit in, it just feel strange to move on from a serious scene that involves a serial killer to lighthearted moments between the two leads. If that whole story arc was left out of the show or at least wouldn't have been dragged out for so long I probably would've enjoyed it more. Still I find the show worth checking out, especially since Park Bo Young & Park Hyung Shik do a marvelous job as the leads.

The cutest OTP
Fair warning. This show can go from cute (make you feel every tiny heart flutter) to crass (Get you annoyed at the Bad taste in jokes and even worse imagery) to creepy (scoot back in your seat in fear) in T-minus ten seconds. The swift change can give you whiplash, and more so turn you off from continuing the show, but stay. Press on. You‚Äôll see one of the most rewarding love stories ever.

Min min and Bong Bong are anything but a stereotypical couple. In fact everything this couple does is a role reversal and that in itself is pleasantly surprising. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to see a pint sized firecracker carry a sassy six footer?

Some people did suffer from SLS, but fortunately for me Guk Du‚Äôs brash personality didn‚Äôt tamper with Min Hyuk‚Äôs quirk. Park Hyung Sik owns Ahn Min Hyuk in a way that seems like his character is second skin. Do Bong Soon is everything you want to see in a woman, with her superhuman strength, her cutesy personality and sharp wit.

All in all a wonderful show, if only for the lead couple. You might use the FF button like me for the not so pleasant parts.

Great comedy & Romance
I don‚Äôt like silly dramas that are full of slapstick style over the top physical comedy. That being said, the comedy in this drama is pure gold. It‚Äôs very funny. I was laughing all the time watching this. I like that the drama doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously and stays light hearted throughout the drama. There‚Äôs just enough angst and plot depth to keep you interested but not so much that it loses it‚Äôs light hearted feel and hilarity. It‚Äôs popularity and high ratings are well deserved.

As far as romance goes, the main leads have some of the best chemistry I‚Äôve ever seen onscreen. (In fact the male lead admitted to having a crush on the female lead in real life. She wasn‚Äôt available at the time but now that she‚Äôs available he‚Äôs in the military.) There‚Äôs lots of steamy kisses, hugs, flirting, and cuddling here for those that are into skinship. The way the female lead flirts with and teases the male lead until he‚Äôs all tied up in knots is just too adorable. And if you‚Äôre into height difference couples you‚Äôll be pleased because she‚Äôs so tiny compared to him he calls her his peanut.

Her ‚Äúpowers‚Äù are a bit far fetched and not very believable. But that‚Äôs part of the charm of this show, it‚Äôs not supposed to be believable or realistic. It‚Äôs just super funny and cute. This tiny little girl is such a feisty little fireball, you can‚Äôt help but love her and her courage and strong sense of justice.

It starts out funny but gets a little serious when a man starts kidnapping women and the female lead thinks she may be able to identify him. Then there‚Äôs the whole mystery of who is threatening the male lead and why. And of course a love triangle forms. So there‚Äôs more to the story than just comedy and romance.

Overall I really loved this drama and have already rewatched it mainly for the comedy and romance. I wish there more dramas like this that does such a good job with both comedy and romance. Don‚Äôt skip this one, it‚Äôs a really good drama.

This was one of the very first K-drama's I started to watch and how I got started watching K-dramas, was literally just flicking through Netflix after work and just happened to click it and start the show! Who knew that it would be one of my favourites after!

I love how Park Bo-Young portrayed this really strong women, who just wanted to help everyone around her, and then Park Hyung-Sik, was this like rich person who needed like protection! - Such a interesting twist in roles!

Definitely really enjoyed it and would - and loved how like light-hearted it was and Kim Won-hae, I loved his character, I feel like I see this actor in a lot of dramas but thought he was just hilarious in this role, both him and the secretary Jeon Seok-ho were both so funny!

I miss this drama! Right after I finished it I didn't rate it as high but I miss it and there is a chance I will rewatch this drama. Do Bong Soon is one of my favorite drama characters in awhile. I love her for her strength and her relationships, and being relatable for being average (other than her hidden strength). I also think she has the cutest cry ever. The male leads are both great too. They are such opposites but I enjoyed them both. I love In Gook Doo's passion for his job and his desire to help people. I love that Ahn Min Hyuk is very strong and capable but at the same time is very sensitive and needy. The writers amazed me at how they made this drama jump seamlessly from comedy to thriller to a fluffy romance. I truly enjoyed this drama even though a lot of it was comedic nonsense and very predictable. I would not want it any other way! I am not sure if this is true but I watched it on Netflix and I was informed that Netflix changed some of the music. I hope that is a lie because Netflix should just leave dramas alone especially since one of the reasons I love Asian dramas is the music!

without Park Hyungsik this would have been a total flop
the concept was nice, there were some good jokes in there, and the chemistry between Park Hyungsik and Park Bo young was out of this world.

HOWEVER some jokes were way too disrespectful and I think without these I would have enjoyed the show so much more. also the plot was all over the place, I kind of decided to act like some characters weren't there and completely dismissed their storylines on purpose for selfcare (the whole gang, monk, and gay stereotypes plotlines to name a few) only to find out they weren't useful for the main plot anyway.

tbh Park Hyungsik's acting made it bearable let's be real, and if it weren't for the good mood he sets everytime he's on screen I would have probably not even given episode 2 a chance.

Usually I'm not a huge fan of kdramas that have such an obvious love triangle, but this one was really cute. The plot was kinda all over the place, and there were subplots left open. Despite all of its this, one thing this drama had going was its cast. I love the different characters. From Min Hyuk to secretary Gong to all the guys at Baek Tak Party. Everyone really played their role well. The one character I really didn't like was Bong Soon's mom. The definition of TOXIC. I really hated the way she treated Bong Soon and her husband.

Now onto the plot..
Where do I even begin? Although it was very entertaining, I feel like they tried to add too much in the plot. They should've left certain subplots out, if they weren't going to finish them. For example, Bong Gi and Hee Ji both clearly having feelings for each other, but not ending up together. Another one that I didn't get was Bong Soon going back to being an ""intern"" after she worked so hard to get into the development team. I get that she was trying to save the world or whatever, but she only became a bodyguard so she could work towards being on the development planning team. It was weird how Min Hyuk's family was never brought up again after they found out who was threatening him. Towards the end, the plot became too predictable. The comedy was good, but I didn't like how they kept switching back and forth from comedy to crime. It was a bit too messy, and the plot could've been much better than it was.

Bong Soon and Min Hyuk's relationship was really cute, a bit cringey at times, but their chemistry was good. The same goes for Bong Soon and Gook Do. One more thing I would like point out is that the brand deals/advertisements were soooo obvious. Like when Bong Soon gets Gyeong Shim the shampoo as a gift and she wants to talk about how nice it smells after she was almost abducted like??? I feel like this drama had so much potential, but they tried to do too much.

I just finished the last episode of Strong Girl Bong Soon and was entertained all the way through. Kudos to the screenwriter for making this zany comedy funny, without being corny, romantic without being syrupy sweet, and scary enough without being overtly horrifying. On top of it all, it doesn't take itself too seriously with several laugh-out-loud moments to to reflect that.

What I love about Bong Soon is that she is a down to earth super hero who, rather than flaunt her strength, tries her very best to hide it, preferring to be more of a guardian angel than donning a ridiculously tight spandex suit with the letter ""B"" affixed to her chest. She cares deeply for her friends and family and isn't afraid to take risks to save them. She is cute with a quirky sense of style, and can easily pass for the girl next door. No drop dead, gorgeous vixen here. Even so, she manages to catch the eye of two very handsome young men, who try their best to be her number one.

The supporting cast was equally strong, making her look even better. All cast members felt fleshed out and human, and you cared about them all. It was a well put together cast of very talented people. I was very pleased with this production. I like a comedy that can be funny without being ridiculous.

A Must Watch
I loved this show!! It was full of laughs and action with thrilling suspense and sweet moments. Definitely the perfect show to binge! I loved the characters, our leads were so great! I loved Min Min, He was the perfect amount of soft and confident without all the annoying arrogance. He is one of my Top Male leads yet. I Love how he supported our FML without trying to control her. He seriously sets the standards hight. I really couldn't love him more! Park Bo Young is my absolute favorite female actress. She is wonderful in every show I've seen and she was great here. She was the perfect blend of cute and quirky with that vulnerability that makes you connect with her. The love triangle was fun and keeps you interested without being angsty. Ji Soo was just the right amount of serious, you really crush on him. He gave great competition to Min Min. I really enjoyed this show and all of the laughs, I laughed so hard I know my stomach muscles are going to be hurting tomorrow.. I highly recommend it. And will be rewatching.

Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is my favorite drama and I wasn't sure how it got such low ratings when I first signed into MyDramalist. I realized that many people thought the funny scenes were too stupid or cringey, but honestly I think I may have a super weird sense of humor cuz I found them absolutely hilarious. ALSO FOR THOSE WHO HATED ON BONG SOON'S MUM FOR HER ABUSE SHOULD KNOW THAT SUCH ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY NORMALIZED IN MANY ASIAN COUNTRIES (THOUGH I AM AGAINST IT). THEY WRITERS PROBABLY DECIDED TO REVERSE GENDER ROLES FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE. Some people actually found it funny but I considered it a serious problem. In the end when they showed her concern for her husband though they fought, I was happy they made up. Like the typical Asian parent or spouse, she started behaving sweetly towards him as a sign of an apology instead of directly apologizing. So if anybody didn't like these happenings, then know that it is cultural difference and nothing else. I thought that the way they combined so many genres was super refreshing and the transition from one genre to another was pretty smooth and refreshing. I loved Min hyuk's and Bong soon's characters and acting was also up to the mark. I didn't find any serious flaws with the story except a few unrealistic scenes. The story is cliche but the comedy made up for it in my opinion.

Somehow I feel that thriller has been a trend in Korean drama lately. I'm not sure. Maybe just because I watched Healer, Tunnel and also reminded of Pinocchio and I Hear Your Voice. Despite some thrill has been added, this drama is a romantic comedy. The drama is very funny.  Since the first episode, I can't stop laughing. The animation and sound effect just nail it. (I love the puppy sound ^^)

Since the idea of the story is not new (I think I can find a lot of story about a strong woman), the story can be predictable. Somehow the main lead always bickering with each other. It's already a k drama pattern that you can find everywhere. (Secret Garden, Delightful Girl Chun Hyang, Fight For My Way, etc)

Another bad point about the drama is the case with the kidnapper feel like too long to be solved. Sometimes you feel that the progress is really slow and the show can have too many filler comedy.

Overall this is a cute drama. Even though the story is predictable, I still enjoy the whole show. Especially when Bong So starts to beat up people!

I watched it last year and the only thing that stands out in my mind now is that it was a really funny show overall! Yeah, it really had some really cringey humour at times but if you just skip past those few mins in every few episodes, then you can enjoy a really funny show. Especially the side villains were so funny whenever they encountered our badass FL! Lol

The FL and ML have cute chemistry and even though the FL was slightly emotionally weak in the beginning especially when it came to Second ML, she becomes fully badass towards the end! It was a really satisfying to watch that because in most dramas FL are either physically strong or mentally strong but here thankfully she is both and that is refreshing!

The sismance here was totally awesome! And also bittersweet bickering bromance between the 2 MLs was also very funny and enjoyable! The goons and those bully kids turned lackeys were really funny. All the characters and plots were entertaining to watch except the FL's brother love story plot which made feel very angry for obvious reasons, especially on his new 'girlfriend' ...

There is a little Thriller plot that runs throughout the drama but that certainly is not the main focus of this drama. This is essentially a romcom with good doses of romance and comedy with the added advantage of an intelligent ML and a strong (really really strong :D) FL!

I really Think this is worth your time
The show itself has many interesting factors and has a unique plot, not only does this show have those but it is also really well done. The storyline is easy enough to follow but manages to keep you on edge most episodes. Besides all the parts that may be scarier to younger children this show is really cute and the relationships between the characters are really fun to watch as they change. The music in the show is always fitting for the mood but the songs are repeated a decent bit so depending on how many times you watch this the songs may get annoying but besides that the songs fit really well with the scenes to engage the audience and create the appropriate mood. I do believe this is worth your time and even rewatching it is worth your time as well, in fact i have rewatched this show about three times. This is my personal opinion but I believe you should give this show a chance.

This is a good story not the best.
I like the story because it shows that no one in this world is there who cannot adjust to their surroundings. Do Bong Soon (Park Bo Young) comes from a long line of women possessing Herculean strength. But Bong Soon can only use her strength for good; if she uses it for her own personal gain or to mistreat others, she can lose her strength forever like her mother, Hwang Jin Yi (Shim Hye Jin). Bong Soon‚Äôs twin brother, Do Bong Ki (An Woo Yeon) did not inherit the unusual family strength and is a doctor, but Bong Soon has trouble finding gainful employment as an aspiring game developer.



When Ahn Min Hyuk (Park Hyung Sik), the young CEO of AIN Software, a gaming company, witnesses Bong Soon‚Äôs amazing strength against a group of gangsters one day, he hires her to be his personal bodyguard to help him catch a man who has been making death threats against him. Bong Soon has a secret crush on her childhood friend, In Guk Doo (Ji Soo), a police detective who is trying to capture a dangerous kidnapper in Bong Soon‚Äôs neighborhood.

First of all, the story is a bit silly but it made me so happy while I was watching, I smiled a lot just seeing those characters with funny and cheerful personalities. It develops smoothly, I really enjoyed watching this. The special effects aren't good though.
I loved the cast. I had never seen Park Bo Young and Park Hyung Shik before and I fell in love with them. They were perfect for these main roles, the rest of the cast were good but not as good as them.
The music really fits this show. You hear it and you immediately associates with this drama.
Since I had so much fun watching this, I'd really love to rewatch it.
SPOILER
Lastly, there's just 1 thing I would change about the story. It broke my heart the fact that Gook Do ended up alone, so this is the only thing I would change.

Another Drama to add to my Top 5
I literally just finished watching this and am about to rewatch. I can't remember when I've watched something and laughed as hard as I did watching SWDBS! I know for sure I haven't laughed this hard during the past year of Covid quarantine/lockdown.

I'm really kicking myself for not watching this earlier. To be honest, the description made it sound a bit too fluffy and immature...and, truth is, it IS fluffy and a bit immature, but that happens to be part of its charm. The scenes are zany and ridiculous but this drama manages to combine the zany and ridiculous in the funniest way.

It certainly helps that both the ML and FL are so gosh darn cute too. Their chemistry is off the charts. Typically as an older kdrama watcher, I don't enjoy younger romance stories, but this one is the exception.

My only criticism is that at times the secondary characters were given too much attention. We watched the same scene of some injured characters in the hospital over and over again...and for so many episodes. I'm still not sure what that was for. It was funny the first two times we saw them...the other 20? Not so much.

Anyway, I'm surprised at how good this was and how much I enjoyed it. Few dramas make me want to rewatch right after they end. This one does it (and I even re-watched certain scenes while I was watching the first time!)

Just So Much Fun!
I've watched a number of Korean shows over the past five years or so, but I'm not sure I had so much fun watching ""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.""

Bo-Young Park first appealed to me as an actress after watching ""Oh My Ghost!"" I was so impressed by her range as well as being able to easily handle the two different personality types. When I searched for something else of hers to watch, this series came up.

I've been into superhero shows and movies since I was a kid. I wasn't sure if I was going to be watching something cheesy or something fun and exciting. ""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" actually transcends all of these things. One of the things I've loved so much about Korean shows is how the writers are able to weave such a complex range of emotions: humorous, romantic, mysterious, and even heartfelt. Overall, this series was just a ton of fun. Watching Bo-Young Park's face when she's about to stomp on someone, or even toss them up into the air, usually got me laughing. But the story runs much deeper than just a girl with super-strength thump away on the bad guys.

In many ways, this series has something for everyone. And perhaps that is why it's done so well!

Very simple storyline but a lot of cute moments
I thought the story about the kidnapper was too simple, not written intelligently at all. When they were both in danger I couldn't help laughing because it was too overdramatic. The music was too cheesy and the over exaggerated humour didn't fit well with me. It might fit well for some people like my mum.

But other than that, it was filled with cute moments between the leads. Like the ones where you can't help but smile. One of the best chemistry.

Only rewatch it for some of the funny moments.

From the onset (episode 1), the drama was really interesting, it was really funny and I was always motivated to keep watching but I'm not gonna lie, I found Bong-soon kind of annoying in the beginning. I didn't understand how a twenty-something year old spoke like she was 5, don't even get me started on how she always said ""guk-doo ya"", oh my. But as the show progressed, I began to like her more and more and eventually loved her.

Even though I have given a very high rating, there were still some faults;
- Why did Guk-doo always seem to be in a bad mood? And come on, how can he say that he didn't realise Bong-soon was head over heels for him, now that's just ridiculous. Also, why were we never shown an interaction of he and his mother? Why did a mother and son who were recurring exist as completely separate entities? I always looked forward to their interaction (for some reason) but it never came. I know that Guk-doo was not written to be a character that we would obsess over anyway, so I would forgive his 24/7 straight/angry/confused face.
- Bong soon's superpower was over-exploited, she did some things that they weren't even able to explain e.g. we were never shown how she saved those women even though the place had been set on fire. Just a tad bit toooo unrealistic at times.
- I wasn't a hundred percent convinced with Ahn Woo-yeon's (Bong-ki) acting. A lot of the times he just had a confused expression, as did his to-be girlfriend Hee-ji, I guess they fit perfectly, two confused characters. I also have questions regarding how she so easily fell for him after one interaction but I don't want to be too fussy.
- Why was Bong-soon's mother's treatment toward the father tolerated? It was funny in the first few episodes but it got worse and worse and just became... abusive. I did not enjoy watching those scenes at all. Also her (Bong-soon's mum) and her posse were overdone, they became boring and were just a filler (I skipped a lot of their scenes)
- The comedy around the gang members (the ones she beat up in episode 1) was also overdid to the point that it became annoying and had me skipping scenes.
- The comedy around the police was also a bit overplayed, however, I liked how Guk-doo's personality contrasted his work colleagues, it helped him shine more as a main because a lot of the time, I forgot that he was a main; to me, he merely existed in Bong-soon and Min-hyuk's shadow.

Notwithstanding all the points aforementioned, I would still rate this drama a 9.5/10, I wish I could give it a 9.75/10 as that would be more true to my feelings but MyDramList does not provide/allow that option so what can we do. Again, the things I didn't like about it were merely small issues, they do not heavily influence my decision.

One thing that was portrayed EXCELLENTLY though was Bong-soon and Min-hyuk's relationship and both their individual character developments. Although I have one little complaint; how is it possible that he fell so deeply and easily for her? But you know, never try to see the logic in dramas or else you will have a million questions. Anyway, I found myself always anticipating their scenes together, they MADE the show and they also fit so well together.

Lastly, a lot of people did not like the mix of genres but I think that brought the show to life and was executed quite impressively.

The only thing that kept me distant and disappointed from this drama is the story and the writing. I'm a sole believer that the writing is pretty much the most important aspect of a film (next to acting).

STORY:
It's just all over the place. Sometimes I felt like the writers tried to make the story unpredictable but it's super predictable. They try to build up suspense and made me anticipate some sort of extraordinary plot twist only to be let down, failing the turn of events. There are some parts that just don't mix together, and there are a lot of holes in the plot. It's like the writers forgot half of the story an began to drift somewhere else. I started this drama because I love strong, badass female leads. Not that I was disappointed by Bong Soon, but more like I wish I could get more out of her. There is just so much potential in her character, but if you take away the strength of her, she would've been any other female lead in a romantic comedy. But other than that, the romance and the comedy aspects can be quite enjoyable.

ACTING:
I LOVE JI SOO. He is what kept me going throughout this drama, and he is why I started the drama also. I'm also a fan of Park Bo Young. The acting is fairly decent. I think they all did a great job. Definitely lots of eye candy in the drama.

Music: I really liked it, I listen to them on my free time too XD.
Cinematography: Very pretty and high quality scenery.

OVERALL THOUGHTS:
I think this drama would be great if they pre-produced it. There is a lot of potential because of the female lead. She can bend all the Kdrama cliches due to her strength (like wrist grabbing), but even when she did, why did it still feel like it's a cliche?? A lot of ideas were introduced later in the story which is why it made the plot messy. The whole drama itself is quite enjoyable, if you overlook the plot and stay for the romantic comedy. (Though, you'd either find it cringy or cute)

Overall Review by a Rom-Com Fan
Before I break the review down into sections, I will give a general feedback on this drama. I had already given a 10/10 rating while I was watching the 7th episode and now that I have finished watching this drama, I don't regret the rating. In fact, I wish to give it a 100/10. I have 2 words. LOVED IT! This drama was beyond my expectations and not for once was any scene obvious. I never enjoy romcoms that accompany other serious genres like a thriller or action because I am never pleased with the character development or the way rom-com is integrated with other genres. I never get to see the development in relations that I expect from a normal rom-com drama because once a rom-com drama is accompanied by other genres, I always find the romcom not being justified, and it never has a satisfying ending. BUT THIS! THIS ONE, HAS IT ALL! I am very much pleased with the way different genres were put together and after I watched the drama I was genuinely content.

Now, breaking it down, I'll give my opinion on characterisation, script/plot/story, casting, genre and conclusion.
CHARACTERISATION
Out of the diverse set of characters a society includes a few roles of extreme characters were given a role in this drama. For example, a psycho, a well-off CEO, a righteous police officer, etc. The characterisation in this drama was done so well because it chose to have different characters and make room in the drama for roles that show diverse personalities.

SCRIPT/PLOT/STORY
As mentioned before, for a rom-com fan like me, non of the scenes from this drama was obvious and that made the drama so interesting to watch. I love the execution of the script and the production team deserves to be praised for this. They did a very good job of bringing things together. The plot includes different genres and I was hesitant in the beginning because it involved romcom and action and thriller, but it was put together so well that I cannot stop praising it. The plot was very unique and different and the diverse set of characters made the story unique and stand out.

CASTING
I am in love with the cast that was able to pull this drama off so flawlessly. I can't think of any other cast that could've done a better job than the already casted ones. I simply do not want to stop praising the cast for their acting skills. It was just so natural and I fell in love with the characters it be antagonists or protagonists. They all did such amazing work.

GENRE
My usual complaint on romcom expectations not being met when added with other genres doesn't apply to this drama. Each genre was executed to the fullest and adequately justified. Personally, I don't prefer violent dramas rather light-hearted dramas. This one amazed me. If you love romcoms, do watch this. Every episode will make you laugh out loud and make your heart flutter.

CONCLUSION
If you've managed to read this far, I recommend checking out my drama list on my profile to see if our interests match. That way, you'll be reassured to watch this drama.
If you are a rom-com fan, this drama will not disappoint you.

Strong leads, enjoyable, but the plot and focus are a bit of a mess
I thought the cast for this was very strong, especially the three leads. Bong Soon and Min Hyuk have near fatal chemistry and that's the clear highlight of this drama. Bong Soon is adorable and Min Hyuk's mannerisms and romantic approach are overpowering. The rival character is also one of the strongest I've seen in this role, even if I had such a strong distaste for him early on. I don't care at all for love triangles but this one was relatively reasonable and well-acted.

The show has way, way too much comic relief and non-central character focus, to the point that I felt like every episode had nearly 10 minutes of filler. The comedy itself is often very lowest common denominator (don't get me started on the wine gag and loud is funny humor), though the main character centered comedy is pretty good. I'm also an opponent of overarching psycho pervert thriller-style conflict, though here it sort of makes sense given the comic-book/action movie premise. This conflict trope is extremely overused and very often distracts from what actually works for the central relationships. In my mind, Strong Woman Bong Soon should've been a more focused romcom with episodic villains; for instance, they should've made housing development and local thugs the central source of conflict - the show teases this possibility before diving into the thriller stuff. I think defeating villains and converting them to acquaintances/friends would work way better for the tone this show sets early than using the genius evil sicko. One example of why this fails - the main antagonist, despite the job he has, carries around basically tens if not hundreds of rolls of cash; honestly, if the plot needed it, I'm sure he would've had more money on hand than the ML. He's meant to be taken seriously but the overall presentation of his character doesn't make a lot of sense. The slice of life side of this show is undoubtedly the best part so the conflict should be on that level; as it is, there's a sharp divide between what works tonally and the conflict the show forces.

Also, I didn't like the use of wealth in this show (though I'm not a fan of this dynamic in general). Min Hyuk is a very young CEO entrepreneur-type who's absurdly wealthy and who uses it and its influence to basically coerce the main character to him. I don't like rich guy/poor girl dynamics because it leads to a lot of plot expedients and holes in logic. For instance, ""if he is so rich, why didn't he do X, Y, and Z"" that anyone with that money would do in the circumstance? Beyond such plotting problems, Bong Soon is also extremely economically dependent on her relationship's success to maintain her job. I think having a character be filthy rich actually robs us of layers that their personality could've taken on otherwise and, in this case, moves the relationship further towards the concerning side of the spectrum. I had to bracket off dimensions of their relationship to fully enjoy it, but Bong Soon as a character is so compelling that eventually the wealth problems fade a bit into the background.

Still, a lot of this could be ignored because the show doesn't take itself too seriously and aims mostly for fun over logic. Even so, I think the lack of a clear focus and the weak overarching conflict are major detriments. I would recommend this because it has so many features that one might connect to when watching. Even if I'm pretty critical above, it has a lot going for it at the character level.

An interesting watch for sure
""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" is one of my first `newer` Korean dramas I`ve seen since starting to watch them half a year ago. I have to say that, though my rating is not as high as the rating average for a reason I`ll elaborate on further, it is still the type of drama that will never keep you bored. And for that, writers and producers have to thank the set designers and actors, because had this drama had actors that were just a little bit less likeable, this rating would plunge into 6s. The main reason for that being, like others have mentioned, a strong dissonance between genres they were trying to include. Romance, comedy, thriller, action... The tone of this drama is all over the place, and it almost feels like they were writing the drama episode by episode, depending on the audience`s reception. Funnily enough, this is that type of drama which you`ll search up on Youtube, and end up watching strictly funny interactions between Bong Soon and Min-Hyuk. Park Hyung-sik did a phenomenal job with his character, even down to the level of charisma he exudes. He also feels the most natural in his role, while I`m not as sold on Park Bo-young yet. Her acting in this was serviceable, but I did feel a bit of a disconnect in her facial expressions.

Since I have a feeling that Bong Soon was supposed to be even more fiery than she ended up being in her potrayal, Bo-young sometimes felt a touch too cutesy and innocent, so when she was supposed to be badass, it still only conveyed a quarter of what she wanted to, I`m sure. But I`ll keep my eye out for her future projects, because I think she does have a talent. The comedy can at times be spot on or a total miss, but I`ll chalk that up to my love of dry and weird humor rather than the slapstick type this drama goes for.

My closing sentence would be that, though it`s not at all bad or bland, this is that drama that you`ll forget about after, say, a week of watching it. So, while I do think you`ll get some nice scenes and feelings out of watching it, the rewatch value for me on this one is quite low.

This was the first kdrama I watched and really liked, so I may be a bit biased (also because Park Hyung Sik is really cute). Some may think that the lovey-dovey parts of the show did not mix well with the dark & gory parts, but I personally loved the contrast and felt like the 'darker' part of the drama made it more balanced. I particularly loved the casting, and I feel that Park Hyung Sik and Park Bo Young (Puppy Couple) had amazing chemistry. I often rewatch clips of them because I find their interactions adorable. (On a sidenote, this drama also holds value to me because it introduced me to kpop, since I found out that Park Hyung Sik is friends with V from BTS).

While this drama definitely isn't for everyone, if you want a mystery, action, romance, comedy with an overly extra male lead and a badass female lead, then this is your drama!

The leads are hilarious sometimes and super badass at other times, Bong-Soon has a cheeky, warmhearted yet tough personality. Min-Hyuk is brilliantly cast and is a strange yet entertaining combination of child-like energy with lethal intelligence.
It's a long drama, with 16 hour-long episodes so there are plenty of sub-plots and relieving moments from the darker tones.
None of the leads throughout the drama do anything unreasonable or spontaneously out of character, the sweet Bong Soon is always a brilliant character to watch.

I love this drama only because it was my second drama to watch when becoming familiar with kdrama's. When I first watched this drama it left me feeling content because I could say I really enjoyed it. I have gone back and watched it again after becoming more aware of how kdrama's work and what to expect and now that I have, I have to say this drama lost it's luster for me.
This drama has way too much going on and I could say that some kdrama's tend to do this a lot. It had a thriller story mixed with rom-com and you just can't mix these two without being jarred out of one or the other. You would go from watching this cutesy scene of Bong Soon's hilariously done ""strength"" scenes and her love life, which is entertaining to watch, only to be thrown into a horrific scene with a kidnapping psychopathic killer. While I love thriller's, this just wasn't done right. This drama should have just stuck to one idea and went with it. There are also so many side stories thrown into the drama that eventually loose their charm or I just don't care enough to want to stick with them and end up fast forwarding to the main plot. And the main plot is a mess because there are just too many elements going on at once.
While I will say this isn't a bad watch because of the romance and humor, it's not a good one. I do come back to watch it because of how silly it can be and I always do enjoy it since it holds a special place in my heart regarding the drama, but let's be honest: this drama was just a mess and a bad one at that. I would say watch at your own risk and be prepared for some gruesome moments if you are weak of heart.

Just watch it- it‚Äôs a good watch
Not what i expected at all. I originally ignored this drama because of its cringe comedy style and editing, but i came back to it purely because of a youtube video of Hyung-shik kissing bong soon and then this drama became quite literally addictive. I watched all 16 episodes in maybe 3 days? It is really good, the acting is top notch, the soundtrack is kinda cringe but lovable and the characters are just works of art. My only complaint would be too many comedic side stories to handle, but the highschool gangsters subplot was too funny and lovable to reject (It also brung out a different side to bong soon in my opinion). But these side stories are easily skipped, so don‚Äôt worry and watch this drama.

This part kind of includes a character description but it‚Äôs not really a spoiler

I wanted to devote a paragraph to kim jang hyun and the actor who played him (Jang mi kwan). Jang hyuns character was beautiful. An obsessive kidnapper who idolises an abusive play? His character is crafted so well, and the acting!! Jang mi kwan plays this role so well (And he is very good looking i have to say but still keeps his role hateable and villainous which is really impressive to me) the acting is top notch. I was really disappointed to find he‚Äôs only been in 4 dramas, and had barely noticeable roles in the other 3, i hope he gets a main or supporting role soon!! Anyway his role was really good and i seriously think he is such a good actor. So that‚Äôs the end of my paragraph about him.

I also wanted to note the brother and his now love interest are so bloody annoying and seriously need to start ceasing to exist. That‚Äôs all.

Also- Mr gong? My man needs to get himself a partner- i feel bad for him third wheeling all the time.

The feces wine thing had me rolling on the floor for hours, i was actually dying.
And the grandma- she‚Äôs a baddie icl.

All in all- great drama- you should watch. Ik people on here can be quite critical, but ignore them and just watch it. It‚Äôs super good !

Okay I really liked this drama. It was hilarious, over the top & just cute.

The series allowed the female lead to be amazing. She grew & developed through the series.

The series had a very respectful, kind & considerate male lead. Finally! He was cute & funny too.

The series was funny. The jokes were very over the top but that was the tone of the series. Yes there was a baddy in it who was psychopathic but the tone never veered too faraway from the silly.

I didn‚Äôt take any of too seriously & thoroughly enjoyed this series.

A wonderful feel-good romp
I had no idea what to expect going into this one and I was delightfully surprised. This is feel-good romantic comedy‚Äîwith a little mystery, suspense, and action thrown in--and I absolutely loved it. Petite, doe-eyed Park Bo Young was perfect for the role of Do Bong Soon. Her diminutive stature and schoolgirl innocence fit the part perfectly and she was a delight to watch. Her chemistry with Park Hyung Shik as Min Hyuk was terrific, and they looked wonderful together. Kim Ji Soo was also good as the brooding cop who discovers too late that he let the love of his life slip away.

The rest of the cast is also good. I can only imagine how wild it must have been filming some of this stuff. How anyone kept a straight face is beyond me. Kim Won Tae goes completely over the top in the dual roles of gangster Kim Kwang Bok and the swishy Oh Dol Pyu. It is hilarious in places and cringeworthy in others, but he held absolutely nothing back. Jang Mi Kwan was super creepy as the villain Kim Jang Hyuk. All in all, it was a wonderful ensemble they assembled for this production.

A couple of special shout outs: First, to the team that created the subtitles. I watched this show on Viki and the translation to English was wonderful, often explaining the double meanings, alliteration, word play, and cultural references in the Korean dialog. Outstanding! Second, I don‚Äôt normally pay much attention to the OST, but I immediately recognized the voice of Jeong Eun Ji singing the ‚ÄúSecret Garden‚Äù love theme. What an amazing talent.

So what kept me from rating this one a ‚Äú10‚Äù? Some of the other reviews have complained a bit about the jarring contrast between the mostly happy, cartoonish theme, the bumbling gangsters, and the violence and gore related to the dark, sinister bad guy. I have to agree with that. If there were a machine to create the perfect drama, I would use it to tweak the settings on this one. I would dial back the violence and darkness a bit, dial back the cutesy on romantic lead Min Hyuk just a little and the shreeking campiness of the queen Dol Pyu a little more. I would also dial back the Keystone cops effect on the bumbling mobsters just a little bit, add a dash more of grandma, and a little less of Bong Soon‚Äôs mom beating up on her dad. However, these are all mostly quibbles. Don‚Äôt let any of it stop you from watching this wonderful show.

The best part of this show is definitely the humor. It's really crazy and mabye not for everyone but I lost my sh*t, haha. The acting was also very well done but I have to say the characters were extremely annoying. That is why I couldn't like the drama as much as I maybe could have.

1. Bong Soon continuesly beats people up in the show resulting in hospitalizing them for a very long time. I get that it's supposed to be a show and 'funny' but no. The show tries to ridicule violence and to justify it. Not okay.

2. Her mother has the upper hand in the family and beats up her dad all the time when he doesn't agree. Does that seem like a healthy relationship? No, but sorry. I couldn't even smile at these scenes. It's supposed to be funny because the 'weak' mother -- a woman -- beats up her husband, ohohoho... Not hilarious.

Apart from that it is a good show, I guess but nothing TOO special even if they were somehow trying to make it into something big I feel.

Fabulous!
This drama is so awesome I finished rewatching it and that is something I hardly do.
I think there not so many dramas that are great so I have to rewatch some jewels like this show.

PLOT - very nice and funny. I think the thriller part is not a necessity, not the minor nonsense scenes like a bomb turned into fireworks, the gangs, the way her mother is, etc. The romance is nice despite the ML turned too much into a silly in love guy.
I hate love triangles but I think that must be a women's thing since I can't recall immediately a love triangle with 2 women and a man... I think that a good drama doesn't need all the same clich√©s. But this love triangle is soft...

ACTING - awesome acting by most of the actors!

OST - I liked the music of the fighting scenes but I would not listen to none of them by choice

REWATCH - I did it! 100% YES

ROMANCE - I like it but it has many silly parts, specially the ML. I think that he is awesome, a successful business man, and that part is not shown, only in first episode...

ENDING - the bad guy is not bad but I didn't care for that story. I like it, lots of funny moments and a good way of wrapping most of the stories. Even the twins could be interesting in other s√©rie...

OVERALL - love it. Even with some flaws. The romance is nice, despite the annoyance of the love triangles... I know the formula seems to work to most of the viewers but never for me.
If you like romance, comedy, a female with strong and independence thoughts I think you should watch this!!!

Loved this one!
Loved the (literally) strong female lead and her character growth throughout the show and how the men had to adapt to fit into her life. In the end, she is doing what she wants to do, having achieved her goal with the launch of the video game.

I loved the mom and grandmother characters as well. Also strong women, even though her mother lost her powers, she was still a strong personality and leader in her community. I enjoyed a series where the ""strong men"" - the bullies and gangsters, were put in their place by tiny Do Bong Soon. And the traditional male roles of police officer, also benefited from Do Bong Soon's strength.

I didn't like that she had to be the unsung hero in the end after she helped catch the kidnapping criminal. It wouldn't have been possible without her assistance. However, it was at her request in order to keep her anonymity so she could do her good deeds.

I did enjoy the romance between Bong Soon and her Min Min. Although I didn't like the way he had her work in his office at what was like a little girl's dollhouse desk. I know that her character thought it was cute and liked it. So I suppose that was what mattered.

The ending was sweet and adorable when Min-Hyuk was left to care for his twin daughters while Bong Soon was ""working"". I loved the reversal of traditional husband/wife roles.

Joyful leads and great chemistry keep this from falling apart...this show will likely not age well (discussed in a footnote below).

Do Bong Soon and Ahn Min-hyuk are the key. Coming from opposite backgrounds, they share a childlike exuberance towards life, a love of video games, and underneath it all a strong sense of vengeful justice. Both know what it's like to feel like 'an outsider looking in,' and they hate the strong bullying the weak.

Ahn Min-hyuk immediately, and endearingly thinks Do Bong Soon's super-strength is an amazing quality. Better still, his admiration for her strength doesn't lessen his concerns for her well-being. It is this rare quality in the male lead that really stuck with me.

The music and sound-effects all have a comic book/video game feel that suits the show, and some of the scenes are so iconic or so startlingly unique that they will live in my head forever.

Themes: 8.0
Inner strength and a life worth living comes from being sure of your strengths and values. Pick a romantic partner who respects and values your strengths and does not try to supress or diminish them.

Complex Characters/Character Growth: 7.5
Do Bong Soon is on a journey to becoming comfortable with who she is. She doesn't so much change but settle into her skin. Ahn Min-hyuk develops different facets (childishness, ruthlessness, admiration) but not sure if he has much growth per se

Relationships Between Women: 5.0
Strong Girl Bong Soon does have friends etc. but all the other main characters are men.

Cinematography/Production values: 8.0
Thought was put into the comic book/video game feel to the show with the pops of color, noises and special effects.

NOTE: There was one gender nonconforming/LGBTQ character that was played very campily for laughs. I couldn't tell whether it was cultural differences or a disrespectful portrayal. Overall, the jokes are based on dated patriarchal ideas, and I could see the 'flip' of gender dynamics jokes not aging particularly well.

In addition, the creepy male serial killer attacking women who fit the patriarchal ideal and then being brought down by a strong woman - is a nice theme but it belonged in a different show. Worse of all, all the emphasis and fascination with this storyline overwhelmingly and unnecessarily centered male violence and took away from the point of the show.

This show was one of top recommended show to me , people were going ham around me to watch it, and i have no regrets whatsoever for watching this.
STORY: The first episodes build a great plot and introduce the story well , the flow is great. Somewhere in the middle we realize that there might be plot-holes here and there but that is so perfectly covered with the hilarious comedy scenes for which we should thank the casting gods for casting an amazing set of actors , who fit perfectly into their roles.
and all those people saying that its an unrealistic story- well that's why it comes under ""supernatural"".
personally i think, You'll be missing out on a great romantic-comedy if you don't watch this show.
And in some later scenes you'll notice the connections to her and the way the lead pictured herself at the start, the call backs and stuff.

ACTING/CAST: I'm telling you for these characters i don't think there can be a better casting, these people ACED their roles and their chemistry is off the charts. Each and every actor did so well and their acting is so so good.

MUSIC: I'd say all the songs are pretty catchy and feel-good and they all fit the drama really really well

REWATCH: YES i will definitely watch a couple more times for its best comedy timing and cute leads

at the end i can say , watching this drama made me fell more in love with park hyung sik and park bo young , I've already been their fan but this drama man just made me fan girl , their chemistry , timing , was just so good. I LOVED WATCHING THIS DRAMA and please do give it a go. i promise you won't regret it one bit.
happy watching.

well i came into watching this drama because of the crazy good reviews i was reading about it and how likable the characters were
not going to lie here, overall i did enjoy the drama because of its action and comedy packed scenes but there was a lot missing
first off all, the plot was interesting and so was the characters ngl.
but the fact that they overplayed the main character as gay was a turnoff, it was not offensive but i felt like they brought it up loads of times that it made it tiring while they made him dress up as a girl and flirt with the guys. it was funny the first few times then it kinda got boring but hey that is really okay because they didn't seem like it was a bad thing. at least i don't remember (if they do please inform me :) )
the characters were hella annoying, the girl was starstruck by a man but didnt see anyone else and kept thinking about. while she has some super powers that no one knows about
thats just some of the bad things please remember that there is alot of good things about the drama and i havent explained everything!

The best thing about this show is the great cast, acting and music.

The lead actress is really sweet and talks really softly and nice.

The entire show is a bit imbalanced though. I don't know why the super serious crime thriller is included in this show. It creates an imbalance of super sweet scenes to bloody/violent scenes.

Overall though, it's a very fun watch for the rom-com parts.

Give this drama a try!
STORY: A lot of people's views seem to differ on this drama which I found quite surprising because it is as of now my favorite Korean drama. My 10/10 review for everything might seem a bit over the top but I can't express more so on how much I LOVE this drama. I went into the drama blindly, however with knowing that the main character would be strong as the title states. I see that the reviews usually talk about a messy storyline. I honestly thought that it flowed quite well between romance and crime. Every episode was exciting with me wanting more and the ending was satisfying.

ACTING/CAST: Park Bo-young and Park Hyung-sik are amazing in this drama. I've never seen them in anything else before watching this so I was blown away with seeing them act for my first time. Their chemistry was lovely as hell and I was basically a giddy school girl during sweeter scenes. I can't express how strong my emotions were while watching them act. I laughed (loudly), (ugly) cried, and felt literally every other emotion watching them together. The other actors were of course amazing as well since it all felt real the way it was presented.

MUSIC: OH how I love the music! I would, after watching, search up the whole OST after trying to poorly sing along when my favorite songs played during a scene. The songs fit perfectly and introduced me to new Korean artists that I hadn't known about before. It makes you more immersed with the scenes.

REWATCH VALUE: I'm known to rewatch everything that I love too many times after watching it. This is exactly what I did with this drama. Not only did I rewatch my favorite scenes but everything from the start as well and surprisingly felt the same emotions over again like I hadn't watched it before. I highly recommend this drama and recommend that when you do watch it, make sure you have spare time to watch it through in one go since it'll be even more fun that way~! <3

More than just a super hero movie
9/10 is my rating. This is a 2017 jSouth Korean television series series spanning 16 (67 minute) episodes. Park Bo-Young plays Do Bong-soon a woman born into a family that has a line of women with super human strength. Use the strength for good, and you can keep it. Use it for personal gain or evil and you are right back to being normal (dang pickle jars are hard to open). Do Bong-soon is madly in love with Guk-doo (Ji So) a local police officer. Due to her acts of heroism she finds herself the body guard of the CEO of a gaming company (Park Hung-sik) and the two do not like each other much at the outset. He just sees her as a useful ‚Äútool‚Äù and she sees him as a meal ticket.

Spoiler ? The beginning of the series I wasn't a huge fan of the two main leads as a couple I was actually rooting for her to get with the side character. I also was afraid it was going to be some silly super hero-ish movie with no real plot. But, by the end, I loved her and the main lead so much. They are still one of my favorite Asian Drama couples ‚Äì so cute together. The only thing I didn't like about this was they went almost too far into the after story. She also became too much of a super hero at the end ‚Äì it was really different than what she had been about through the whole series.

ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS. Just clear opinions.

Overall review:
If you had to describe this drama in two words, it's 'cotton candy'. Seriously. This is my all time favourite guilty pleasure k-drama. It could be yours too, if you give it a try. It's sweet. It's light. There's HEA. Aand the lead actors are super cute. I mean...what more can a girl ask for, right?

Cast and Acting:
Just fabulous. Like their casting director needs a hefty paycheck kinda fabulous. Watching cute LOVEY-DOVEY kdrama couples is totally my thing, and PARK HYUNG-SIK and PARK BOYOUNG serve us some major heart-throbbing bloody cute moments and just....ugggh. Feel me? You can NEVER go wrong with PARk HyuNGsik aagh...

Things you may not like:
Well the story is kinda cliche for one. Two, I personally believe that the lead cast and cuteness is the only thing that saves this drama. Three, very fairytale-ish gives-you-a-tooth-ache-kinda-sweet. But that is the definiton and the whole point of a guilty pleasure. So four, if cliche cute ass cheesy dramas are not your cup of tea, this is not for you.

General Biases:
I've had friends who kept starting this drama on hold because they felt they can't take a cute faced female lead with bangs and short hair as seriously as they would a little more mature looking female lead in a romcom. You get what I mean? But honestly, Park Boyoung can completely rid you of this opinion and change your mind. So if this is your concern and it's the only thing that's holding you back, puh-lease put that prejudice aside and give this a try. I gaurantee you will enjoy it overall.

This is a legend in the kdrama world and a must-have in your list of watched kdramas if you want to call yourself a true kdrama fan. Hope this was helpful!

LOVE,
A

Lovely, funny and fulfills all your superhero needs
I tried to write this review without any spoilers in case new watchers stumble upon it, but I have so many things to say that it just wasn't possible. So if anyone's by chance reading this - be aware.

""Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"" came out in 2017 - right about the time K-Dramas had a new surge of popularity within the younger Western audience. You would be hard-pressed to find a person who didn't love this drama (or hasn't seen it), and after watching it, I can confidently say it deserves all the hype and love it has!

SWDBS at its heart is a superhero origin story. It has all the right elements - humour, romance, a dash of complicated family dynamics, a training montage, acceptance of one's powers, a huge cast of characters, small and medium level villains, and of course, the Big Bad. Unlike many others, I wasn't taken aback by the funny/serious tone switch. In fact, I loved it! The cast was very versatile - Park Bo Young and Park Bo Mi (the actress who played Bong Soon's best friend) were amazing during emotional scenes (they are both *spectacular* criers).

Bong Soon's character was another favourite of mine - she was small and adorable, but also loyal, smart, and a bit petty (aren't we all?). While it hurt to watch her deal with daily misogyny and harsh comments from her own mother, in the end, she always stood up for herself - Bong Soon's speech about her upbringing compared to her brother's got me teary-eyed. She fit perfectly together with Min Hyuk (a true imaginary boyfriend <3) and wasn't afraid to kick a**.

The soundtrack was amazing!!! It worked perfectly for the kind of drama SWDBS is - kind of crazy, very romantic and undoubtedly hilarious. Though if I had to mention anything negative, I would say that between the two ""official"" songs for romantic moments, I liked Suran's ""Heartbeat"" a LOT more than the other. It was quiet and soft, and the second seemed too loud for me.

I am generally not a negative person, so I'll mention the rest of my complaints briefly: 1) what was the deal with Bong Soon's brother and Guk Doo's ex? Just felt icky and too close to cheating; 2) I did not like Guk Doo - he was a bland character and a terrible police officer; 3) Bong Soon should have beaten the a**hole kidnapper to the pulp in the final fight; 4) the last 10 minutes of ep16 should've been a part of the special episode.

Otherwise, SWDBS is truly a superior drama for actually showing how long patients stay in hospitals, and how much time it takes for wounds to heal :D

Well what to say. This drama is driven by characters and amazing chemistry between FL and ML. I really loved comedy in this and all secondary characters were nice to watch.
Things I liked:
- FL and ML and fluffy moments between them
- Relationship between FL¬¥s father and her
- Comedy scenes with her power

What I didn¬¥t like:
- Overly dramatic and draggy last 1/3 of story
- Her mother
- How stupid they were acting, for example FL¬¥s friend, so u was attacked and almost kiddnaped a u go again alone in the night? And that scene with sniper rifle? What if he was aiming for her head? And I am not talking about other illogical things. I know it¬¥s normal in korean dramas but in this it was too much.

So overall this is good example that even best actors can¬¥t save hopeless drama.

This is a story about a girl who is super strong. Cool. Them adding a serial killer aspect to it, makes it ten times better. The fact that she's a badass who ends up turning into a bodyguard for the hottie CEO is hilarious. This show is definitely a roller coaster for emotions. It had me laugh, cry, scream at the t.v., and pissed off many different times.

It was fun. I've rewatched it a few times. I would definitely recommend it to someone just getting into k-dramas. More experienced K-Drama watchers would probably find this decent but not great. I personally have loved K-dramas since like 2006 and this was a nice step away from the lack of plot lines other than ""rich guy, poor girl"" trope that's been done to death.

So this is love
WHEN I TELL YOU THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE DRAMA. Just watch it honestly. I came in thinking I wouldn't like it cause magical superhero powers trope can sometimes turn out cringey. But man oh man, afterwards I fell in love with Park Boyoung and Park Hyungsik. Their romance, their chemistry, just amazing. It had a great mix of thriller and rom-com in it. The thriller part of the show always kept me on my toes but then the romance and comedy part of it always made me so happy. It's been almost 4 years since I watched this drama but I still think about it and go back to watch little clips here and there.

I really enjoy this drama
I watched it because it quickly attracted my attention on an upcoming drama article. The story seem's interesting and funny : a small cute and innocent looking woman as strong as a super hero‚Ä¶I looked forward to see. Plus I recently saw Hwarang with Park Hyung Shik and I wanted to see more of his acting.
This drama is really funny and cute but it also has a somber part with the kidnaping investigation which is well balanced.
I love the 3 main actor they are really good and have a good chemistry.
The couple is so sweet together it's really nice to watch them.
I will probably re-watch it after some time when I want a drama that make me smile and laugh a lot.

...because for some reason I could not binge it 100%...

If you're not sure about watching this drama, let me help you decide. WATCH IT. It will be worth your time.

Although there are not many plot twists, the writers did a good job in preventing it from getting too predictable or boring. It had just the right amount of comic relief to level out all the seriousness and if you're a hopeless romantic, you're going to love the fact that this drama is packed with couple cuteness.

If you're not a hopeless romantic, don't worry, neither am I and I was not that bothered by it since it gave more depth to the characters, which I feel, was a big plus, since non-stereotypical characters have been rare lately. I feel like the writers got creative and made some memorable favorites. Not to mention the amazing cast who did an incredible job in all the settings and scenes.

Yes, there is a triangle (I feel like there always is) but it does not cover much screen time and it wasn't the kind of triangle that makes the drama frustrating to watch. The girl doesn't pace back and forth between the boys. It's a very comfortable change from one love to the other.

I also want to warn you about the comedy. It's very loud and over the top so when you enter the world of Do Bong Soon, brace yourself. It is so worth it though because some scenes were adlibs that the producers decided to keep. Those are hilarious.

With all that said, I don't think I left any important details out....

.....ENJOY!!

I have just finished the last episode and I might say, 10/10 for laughter, chemistry and overall acting. Plot was not spectacular, but it kept me going.
Why did I rate all so high? Well, for once today tv shows too many serious, violent shows on tv. Here, each episode was so funny it made m laugh like there is no tomorrow!
I would love to see the main leads again in another comedy series. Very natural performance and for this kudos to the cast!
I want to see more laughter on Tv and a chemistry such as this 16 episode series has! Bravo to all the cast and producers - for me this drama is definitely underrated!

*screams into a pillow*

Okay, now that I‚Äôve released a bit of my frustration with this show, I can talk about it a bit more rationally.

This show has a maaaaaaajor tone problem that becomes more and more apparent as the show progresses. The first half of the show is pretty good kdrama fun times, plenty of laughs to be had. The main trio are great at comedy. The love triangle is actually pretty good, as I think it‚Äôs a bit different from usual. Min Hyuk knows who Bong Soon ‚Äútruly‚Äù is, and admires her for her strength, while Gook Du perceives her as weak and wants to protect her. They aren‚Äôt just two people vying for her love; they are two people who have very different perspectives on who she is, that makes the love triangle more interesting than usual.

And then the show progressively derails as the episodes progress. The serial killer plot ramps up and is so extreme and scary, and there‚Äôs some serious whiplash going back and forth between cute scenes of our couple and scenes of this terrifying guy. Oh, and the goshdarn gangster scenes. Does that stuff even count as a subplot? It serves as ‚Äúfunny‚Äù filler, but I find pretty much none of it funny and it borders on gross for me. Those were the scenes I hated the most. The only way to watch the second half of the show is to skip through all the crap to get to the cute scenes with our couple, and at that point you might as well just watch the clips on YouTube.

I actually would give this show a 7, but it has such a high rating here and I feel the need to turn the dial down a bit so people understand that there‚Äôs some serious problems with this show. The cast is good, the humor is pretty good in the first half of the show, and the OST is fitting. However, many of the characters are superfluous and are meant to be humorous but are so over the top that it is too much to handle. The serial killer plot is so extreme that it throws the show off kilter, and it truly feels like it belongs in a different show like Voice. The saving grace of this show is the couple, which is one of the darn cutest couples I‚Äôve seen in kdramaland. The main trio are great (though Ji Soo‚Äôs talents are somewhat wasted here). I wish that the latter half of the show wasn‚Äôt a hot mess, because otherwise this show would be really great.

Giving this a 9 because there were so many different genres in this show that I was slowly losing my mind but the cast was /perfect/.

***THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD PLEASE BE WARNED***

I mean I could see how writer-nim wanted to connect Bong Soon to the mystery and crime angle in the story but I think it just took so much time and dragged the show a bit because of the seven brides thingy (I was so pissed at the police for always missing the suspect lol). The side characters were ok for me but then some of the screen times were unnecessarily long. Poop jokes were a bit too much but the interactions between Min Hyuk and Secretary Gong will always have a place in my heart!

The cast was just A+. PBY and PHS were just off the roof with their chemistry. PLEASE DATE IRL lol JEBAL MOM AND DAD PLS DATE IRL!!!! The last episode almost killed be because of its cuteness AND YES BECAUSE I AM A SUCKER FOR ROMCOMS. Secretary Gong was one of my favorites tbh! That character was such a living meme lol. Bong Soon's mother was definitely me whenever I see the BongMin couple!

Loved the OST too, I think PD-nim chose the right songs for the right moments. The SFX were great too, the cat/puppy noises, etc. It added flair and cuteness to the show.

I would watch this again though but maybe I'll skip the filler parts and just proceed to my favorite episodes/scenes.

Ok I'll start in overall:
Ep1-9 felt like there's magic into it
10-13 plot starts to struggle
13-16: good with a closure that gives what you wish/dream of.
a kind of drama that is not so perfect but end up to my fav list/love it.

If you're into romcom, love cute/adorable couple like you enjoy dramas that are light hearted then this drama is for you...~ Chemistry is just too real a kind of relationship that you can't see any other guy for her, just him. It's seriously funny/hilarious....XD but there are times you'll be like... Is this even impt?


Story: genre of crime/romcom/thriller didn't work all together in the middle of the story it felt so random it would be better if they focus in just one genre, The flaws and hole into it, there is so many ways to improve it, make it better, that they failed to do so. DESPITE all that you won't think about it, it could make you forget /forgive those shortcoming, for the main couple. Their love story overcomes all those problem, you know their chemistry is just too undeniably strong and so much lovable.

Recommendation
highly recommended to those who have bubbly personality, hopelessly loves romance, loves to fall out of love, wants to meet a sassy male lead, cutie female lead, a good laugh then go watch it. If you wanna watch this drama because of investigation genre, just don't and go somewhere else. This isn't for you if you're too much of a technical person when it comes to watching dramas but if you're someone who based it more in the feels then you'll enjoy and appreciate it~

Character/acting
Minhyuk and Bong Soon is loife!
Characters: there's your fav, someone you'll dislike/like, you'll love/hate, find annoying/funny. Shoutout to Secretary, Bong ki and high-schoolers!~

Park Hyungsik and Park Bo Young shines in this and I hope they'll continue to shine, to see them together in another drama or just date for real. Oooops!!! Kekkeke. I love all the cast and I thank the PD-nim for the supply of bts every week.

The ost is good. Rewatched value is perfect ofc I'm talking about the moments/story of the main couple, I'm gonna miss all of them and I want a version 2 juseyo!!!! Bong Soon and Minhyuk will always have a special place in my heart. My 100th drama! Whooooops! Thankyouuu for the feels.~

ps: the main couple is way too cute to handle, warning; they're addicting. Uggggggh!!!! Anyways hope my review helps!~

What a batshit crazy useless show!!!!!
I am seriously questioning the sanity of people who found this show even remotely likeable.
The story was a hot mess. There was no particular plot. The plot was the basically 3 good lead actors trying to be cute along with useless unfunny fillers and bunch of people overacting. That's it. That's the plot.

What were those bunch of goons getting beaten up all the time? Why is a very loving father getting beaten up funny?? What was that priest kind of dude trying to do all the time?

Where was the story? Just looking cute can not be whole plotline of the show.

Also what was the really dark weird creepy thriller doing in between??

Basically.. What was this show?? WHY WAS THIS SHOW EVER MADE?

Plus oh my god the amount of homophobia. Yeah i understand most romcoms are not progressive or even give much thought to it but OH MY GOD. The ""gay is funny"" thing was so on the face. I get it. You think homosexuality is some kind of disease. But can you please have a limit.

The re watch value is actually 0 but that is not allowed.

EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT...

Girl power rocks...B:

Story is well-thought.The plot has a few problems, the crime part really got dragged but it's not that important to me.
Park Hyung Shik shined in this drama.He is like a princess,really.(Yes, not a prince but princess because he is too beautiful.) If this drama was any longer, I don't think I would be able to handle watching him.
Cuteness is overflowing...^^
And it is way tooo funny till the end.

Personally I loved this drama, usually it's hard to get me to laugh but during this I was laughing every time. It has some very interesting takes showing you things you've probably never seen in a show before which is great especially if you get the kind of gags they are trying to tell. All the characters were v cute and likable especially the love triangle will make you want to tear you hair out on who to ship. Honestly I was debating on actually dating Do Bong Soon myself. The soundtrack is definitely not one to miss and it's the same with just little sound effects they used during the scenes that you probably won't forget. In a whole, it's the best thing I have had the pleasure of viewing this year and I highly recommend it. I hope you'd like it as much I did, peace.

Puppy face with lots of comedy
Its my first ever drama starring Park Bo Young, I am flabbergasted with her acting. My god the the role Do Bong Soon perfectly suits her. This drama is all about her only. The storyline is smooth without any unncessary crossovers.
The makeover of her character is epic. A cute, puppy face girl with msyterious power and her struggle to hide it. I loved this drama. It was very refreshing for me to watch it.

The drama itself is filled with comedy, I mean a lot comedy. You will not regret watching any episode. The support character are hillarious. Espescially the gang members, they will make you laugh all the time. I don't know what to add more this drama is worth watching. Romance is overflowing here with losts of cute moments. Also this drama has dark thriller arc of the kidnapper which makes this more hillarious to watch.

Park Hyung Sik, an amzing role. As a CEO and also as a man who decides to help a women with strange power and ends up falling for her.
Shim Hye Jin(a mother who everyone wants), what a comedic character with open heart.
Kim Won Hae (double role), gives a pure comedy experience.
And lots of lovable character.

You can enjoy this drama as a happy reward. 2-3 episodes during day break. Totally worth it. OST are also good.
A perfect for rewatch in future.

Fun, crazy, over-the-top, cutesy romance, crime, superhero action, girl power story. The show is a mashing together of many different types of stories.The main reason to watch it is that it is the cutest, swoony-est romance that I have seen in a long time -maybe even ever. The couple is so adorable. The 3 main leads are all really good. Ahn Min Hyeok especially is so cute when he is acting all goo goo over Bong Soon and their PDA scenes are really amusing. It's hilarious to watch. The romance is really cutesy but it grows and deepens into something really touching as the story progresses.

Then there is the dark serial killer storyline that is not that different in tone than an episode of SVU. It adds some drama and danger to the main romantic storyline. There is the fun superhero action story aspect where you get to see a girl getting the best of everyone and being the main hero instead of the guys. There is the slapstick gangster storyline which was funny sometimes, but sometimes not so much.

It can be a jarring mashup, but overall it is a fun show if you don't take it too seriously. If you have a low tolerance for a slightly overactive plot, slapstick humor or dark crime you might not like it. But I loved it and looked forward to each episode. It's the funnest most romantic show I've seen in awhile.

Oh gosh this drama was such a delight to watch, especially during the point of the school year where I feel absolutely no motivation to do any work, ahaha. This drama gave me SO MANY FREAKING FEELS, MADE ME CRY MORE THAN I SHOULD'VE, MADE ME SQUEAL AND SCREAM and it just had everything a great drama should! Our main OTP had great chemistry and all the characters were so unique and made the story so different, whether they were bringing suspense, humour or their handsome looks lol.

I will admit that sometimes it felt like it took way to long for the plot to get somewhere, but I didn't mind to be honest. Unless you're really picky, I don't think you would notice this flaw.

The acting was top-notch and spot on. I don't think Park Bo Young could've done a better job as the protagonist than she already did. I was so satisfied with everyone's performance and their acting capabilities. Sometimes it went so bizarre and crazy but they played it off with their characters really well. I do wish, however, that certain characters would have more development or back story to them, particularly the brother and Gook Du's girlfriend.

The music I CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW CATCHY ALL THE SONGS ARE and the enhanced the scenes so well. I've been listening to the OST on repeat for days and haven't gotten sick of the songs yet, surprisingly.

I'm not one for rematching dramas, but I'll definitely be binge-watching FMVs on YouTube for the next few months or until my withdrawal goes away!

Ok, so perfect 10? Probably wondering why. I'm a sap for sweet romance, and this drama has it.

It's hilarious, the heroine is adorable and loveable.

I enjoyed every element of this drama. The cast had great chemistry and some of the moments had me laughing so hard I cried. The scenes were written beautifully. The crime element of the story was intriguing, and I felt like it left something for everyone who wasn't just interesting in the love story to enjoy about the drama.

The music in this drama is amazing as well, and whenever I hear it, it puts a smile on my face.

Strong Women Do Bong Soon is a pretty fantastic drama, there's not much I would change about it.

Initially I was worried based off the cover that the 'love triangle' aspect would be overwhelming (as it tends to be), but I was happily surprised that it was well done, and I didn't feel annoyed by it as I usually do when they spend 14 episodes dragging the main girl back and forth between two guys.

There are tons of memorable scenes in this drama, and all of her action scenes showing off her powers were hilarious and empowering.

Overall, I gave this a 10 because after finishing this drama I felt like a 10. I will definitely be watching more stuff from these actors, they are absolutely amazing.

I'm sure you've already read other reviews, but I do 100% recommend this drama to everyone, not just people looking for romance, It truly has it all.

one of the best dramas I have seen! great story with a good amount of comedy, romance, cuteness, action. I like that this drama had not evil mom/dad/ friends and that everyone around the main characters were overall nice people. I also like how the mystery+action+thriller was in the drama but they didn't focus on it 100% of the time.  It was nice how some 'bad guys' weren't really bad but they were kinda making the show a bit funny, the actors did a great job and the main couple had GREAT chemistry. 100% suggest to watch this show, one of the top shows of 2017

OMG!!!
AN AMAZING DRAMA!!!
A very cute drama with Park Hyung Shik, one of my favorite kdrama actors....
A very cute drama you will laugh, cry get angry and even dance with joy while watching it.
It is the story of a girl small in size but with great strength and a boy deprived of love..and how they start loving each other while saving their town from a serial kidnapper
The most funny part is when Ahn Min Hyeok says that he loved Gook Do's ass??? and the loveliest part is when Ahn Min Hyeok see Do Bong Sook in her wedding gown ohhh its just so cute.
A recommend it to all kdrama watchers who like romantic comedies‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

First of all, I really loved the chemistry between the main two leads. They were just extremely cute and it's also probably the reason why I enjoyed the show that much. To see Ahn Min Hyuk's reactions to DBS's cuteness was just... I was just in love of his acting in the show!
Then about Ji Soo, I just wish he will get the girl in a drama someday and be the main lead, he's a good actor and deserves it !
It's the first time I saw Park Bo Young in a drama and while I usually don't like the main female lead, I liked her a lot.
It was good to see a show with a strong woman ^^ I mean, usually in shows women are weak and are being rescued by men but here she was the one rescuing others and it was refreshing.
I loved Bong Soon's family too. Especially her dad. But yeah, to see that they took the wife beating the husband part quite lightly and joking about it was wrong. Even if they tried to explain it at the end... So, that was the part I didn't like about the DBS's mom.
I liked Baek Tak and the gang's part, that was quite funny. And I enjoyed even more the high schoolers part. I wish we saw them more.
Then the plot with the serial killer was also interesting but I'm disappointed that we don't really know his motives, his background.. Why is he really doing that? What made him become like that? How come did he have that much money?

So, I would say this drama is mixing a lot of different genre especially a thriller plot and a romance comedy part. I feel like they did it good but only in a shallow way. They didn't go deep at all and that for every aspect of the show expect for the romance part. Which is why I wouldn't rate it higher.
However, since it was a more of a funny drama, I wasn't expecting them to go deep I think, I just wanted the drama to be entertaining and it was.
Usually, dramas are funny in the beginning and then it is more and more sad with a lot of obstacle towards the end but here it was different. It was funny from the beginning until the end and that's what I liked in that show.

Of course, there is an exception : episode 13. It was the worst and most cliche episode of the show. I seriously was afraid the remaining episodes would be like that but thankfully they weren't. Seriously this episode doesn't make any sense for me. And, if ever I rewatch the show, I would probably skip it.

I wish we knew more about Min Hyuk's family, and that they went deeper about some characters and part of the show but well they just focused on the funny and romance part. They maybe could have add more episodes (2?) for that but well I still like it that way. I also think a second season could be great too. Maybe not with 16 episodes but well, I would watch it for sure.

The music in Strong Woman DBS is good, not great, but good. In the first episodes, I couldn't remember any songs from the show but eventually I did. The music was cute, refreshing like the drama. It suited it well.

So, I would say that you should watch it if you want to watch a funny drama that you are ready to not take seriously and just enjoy without thinking too much.

Totally recommended!
If you want light but thrilling drama, you guys should check this out. The only downside of this drama is that it gets really unrealistic at times but really enjoyable overall. The chemistry between the leads is SO LIT and I couldnt get over it for weeks. I really love the acting and there are no awkward moments of acting between the leads. All seems natural and legit!

For me, this drama lands in my top 5 favorite South Korean Dramas, and probably my top 5 favorite dramas in general.  This was a rollercoaster of a ride, that had complex story, yet three dimensional characters.  The acting, the consistent plot, and the different emotions it portrays made this a hit drama in my eyes, one I would gladly watch over and over again.  

Story: 9.5
The story was something I have never really seen before in a way that portrays a woman as the superhero in my days of watching Asian dramas.  I particularly liked the way that it was set up to follow a clear formated path.  It took you down twists and turns of what was going to happen next, but it never, in my eyes, lost what it clearly was.  A comedic story yet with a dramatic overtone.
The only issue I had with the story plot, was the sub-plot that seemed irrelevant in the long run, such as the one with the gang boss and the school gang.  It just seemed like it was meant to fill up time in some areas.  Though I enjoyed some of it, it just didn‚Äôt seem to be there except to help with comic relief.  Which is a good thing for a story that is meant to be a comedy but going down a dark path.

I enjoyed mostly the romance between the two leads.  It‚Äôs been awhile since I saw the man chasing after the girl portrayed in such a healthy way. Though whether or not a drama can ever portray a healthy relationship is another entire conversation for another day, that I‚Äôm not even sure of my own answer.  
But this drama comes close it.  The romance is what brought me in, but the action and comedy is what kept me.  

Acting/Casting: 10.0
There wasn‚Äôt a moment where I thought that the cast was wrong.  I thought every single person who was chosen for their character played it perfectly.  This was in my opinion one of, if not the best casted Dramas I have seen in awhile.  Though some of the sub-plots were boring to me, no one was out of character even in those tiny roles.  

The Two main leads had chemistry with each other that skyrocketed through the roof since the first moment you see him lay his eyes on her.  The chemistry between the secondary characters and the leads was perfect and didn‚Äôt feel disconnected.

But what I was pleased about with the acting was the subtle little hints that something was going in their head.  The realization to go from a comedic moment to one of the most dramatic was what made this drama click for me.  One of the scenes where you see the male lead in the hospital acting happy, but then that immediately goes away when his family comes into the picture.  The backstory the character built up, showing plan view for others to read.  The second lead who sees the world in black and white in the eyes of the law, struggles with his own feelings of denial, and the grey zone in between relationships.  

The sudden switch of emotions of some of the acting, going from comedic to dramatic in a matter of seconds might be off putting to some, but for me, it truly showed the acting skills of the moment.  The scene where she's drunk and brazen, yet vulnerable and sad hits me every time, because it's one of those moments you realize humans are more complex in their emotions than you believe.  This characters were not two dimensional, and I can see that even in the ridiculous characters such as the gang boss, they two were also three dimensional.

Music:  9.0
I‚Äôm not really a music reviewer.  So I tend to make this brief with a simple explanation.  The music in this drama set what the moment was going to be.  The comedic superhero entrance or the dramatic, tale of a serial kidnapper who ruins people's lives.  The worst crime you could think of, against the funny, sometimes three stooges comedy that we're going to witness.  Without the background music pushing the feelings, you honestly wouldn‚Äôt quite know who to feel.  So overall, the music was good and well placed throughout.    

Rewatch Value: 9.5
Re-watch value I believe is all up to the viewer.  If you entirely enjoyed this drama as much as I have, you wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to make this re-watch value high.  But if you have issues with it, you wouldn‚Äôt necessary add it to you must re-watch list.  For me, it's a highly rated drama that is in my top 5 of Korean dramas I love.  So I highly recommend re-watching it.

it tried to be too much
In the beginning, the show was really good. It was fun and interesting and the male and female lead have such an amazing chemistry. But when it came to the main plot and villian, it took it too far. A creepy man who terrorizes and torments females by looking them up in cages has no place in a lighthearted and fun rom com. I understand that there has to be a main villian, but they could have had anything but this. The scenes with the women were so dark and scary and I honestly felt like i was watching two different shows with two contrasting themes.

This series has a really good structure and plot,  and it's an original story.  Also, the same way as the story progresses you fell in love with the characters and the actors too. All the actors do it very well in their roles, I believe that they are irreplaceable and very talented. It is a slightly frequent romantic history that breaks with the rules of the typical plot where the boy saves the girl who is in danger. In this series, the two characters saved each other from different events. Highly Recommended.

First of all my expectations according to the opinions was very high
Which later was the main point for disappointing me
I can't deny I love every second in front of
Park Hyung Shik he is an amazing actor I adore him since I watched ""High society""
The drama has many fluffy scences

But I was frustrated by the weak shallow plot
And many unnecessary side storie scenes which I passed many times and doesn't affect the story at all if they cut it
Such as
*The gangsters
*Her brother's unfinished love story hee ji
*The priest
*The g** guy at the co. Who was loving hung shik

But the most sad part for me was
Ji soo
The writer made him realize his feelings too Late which was too unrealistic and so frustrating and sad
And didn't try to bring him another love like he did wz do bong soon
I saw that unjustice and not fair
As if he just wanted someone to suffer without any good reason for such a light romcom

For me it's light drama u can watch just once
And they should reduce it to avoid the shallow part in it

Firstly, due to the abundance of dramas that are similar to this one, I had very low expectations, especially since each episode was 1 hour long. but I was gobsmacked when I watched the first episode and then I just couldn't stop. It was romantics, funny and dark.

The only problem was the story-line. i understand that they wanted to make the show dark, but with the added humor and romance it was just too much. It just didn't blend well and it kind of made me less interested in the show.

The music was great I loved the music they played during episode 4, and the romantic music they played in episode 16. This is probably one of the little dramas that I've seen which have goo music. The cast was great! I totally ship Park Bo  Young and Park Hyung Shik. The acting was amazing and the emotional scenes made me teary.

I would definitely re-watch this drama, and would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of watching it.

Overall I would give this a 9/10 mainly because I have difficulty finding good dramas mainly because of my preferences when it comes to story-lines.

Hope this helped :)

Strong Woman tells the story about a girl who got a supernatural strength from her antecedents, more than that, the drama shows her life and how she deals with it
The drama was funny and the romance was well done but some parts were kinda boring. Besides that, the cast of the drama was amazing and the actors are very talented and the ost was good as well, so I recommend it for people who like to watch dramas who mix between funny moments, creepy things and romance all in the same episodes

A positive review!
I agree this drama tried to touch every genre romance thriller crime fantasy comedy and I must say it did well

I didn't feel it was all over the place
It was perfect
Every character was well acted

Now I will state it it's a good watch

Extremely light nothing so intense... though there is violence but not too much

Love triangle is touching..I mean there were not too many scenes with SML but you'll still have a heavy heart

The thriller is of perfect intensity for a rom com

FL is extremely cute and the way she fights is the coolest thing ever

ML is very good looking and is obsessed with her..it's very cute watching them

The gangster group and the highschooler group is so refreshing and funny..I loved them!!

If you are an Indian... there's a lot of Indian reference

The ending is of course satisfactory

Do give it a watch!!

Okay, so first things first - this drama is a wonderful drama that I would recommend in a heartbeat, especially to those who love a cute, good romance but are not looking for a heap load of angst in the relationship. Personally, this is my favorite type of drama. I prefer it when the plot does not revolve around what new misunderstanding happens between the main couple, and who tries to separate them next and *gasp* he has an arranged marriage, and she has cancer!

This drama forgoes all this and instead focuses on making Bong Soon Min Hyeok an otp to remember and top lists. I love those two (together and separately) to death! The process of them falling in love was such a lovely journey to be part of, and the way they looked at each other made my heart flutter. Especially Min Hyeok, who was so gone it wasn't even funny, just extremely enviable.

These two were simply adorable, and their personalities are really the strongest part of this drama. Bong Soon is a little ball of fire, and Min Hyeok becomes a teddy bear whenever he's around the peanut-sized king kong, even when he tries really hard to be mean (in a playful way). They were the whole package!

Now, I have absolutely no complaint about the entirety of their relationship, and again, I WOULD RECOMMEND this drama in a heartbeat, I really would. But at the end of the day, I couldn't give this drama full stars even though a part of me want to just for my otp. I think this is partly because I already watched Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo which is kind of the perfect drama in my opinion and does what Strong Woman tries to do perfectly.

What do I mean? Whereas the romance is the definite strong suit of this drama, the side plots is where it falls. Because honestly, there was only one truly interesting side plot to this drama and about a dozen unnecessary ones.

And Strong Woman drags *all* of them.

(1)We have the serial killer, who was interesting and made me bite my nails but fell flat at the end. (2) The whole unrequited-maybe-required love situation. (3) I admit I liked the gang members...at first. Then I kind of wished someone would kill them just so I wouldn't need to hear another peep from them. (4)There was also Min Hyeok's family, wasn't there? or did I imagine it? (5) Can't forget Bong Soon's mom and her entire family (will I get stoned if I say I really liked her mom? Even those she's brash and abusive?) (6) Oh, and her game! (7) And there is that annoying sunbae Dong Byung and his whole part of the story, which was murder on my ears and just gah.

And those weren't all. Each one of them *could* have been interesting and had potential (okay, perhaps all but Dong Byung. AND the gang members should've quit while they were ahead). but at the end of the day, almost every one of the many stories this drama tried to tell beside the one of our lovely main couple ended up falling short. They were either too long, or too short, or just broke the flow of the entire drama or made me scratch my head wondering why they were needed in the first place.

I enjoyed the heck out of this drama, don't get me wrong, and I smiled nearly throughout the entirety of it, and I LIVE for portrayals of romance such as this one, with the full on heart-eyes and inability to contain the love. But I also feel like this *could* have been the perfect drama if you made it 12 episodes and cut off giant chunks of gang-member nonsense and idiocy and focused instead on just a few of the plotline and saw them through...

Wowww wowwww wowwww... What a Daebak drama...! Gudossss üëèüëèüëè..Really it was very superb...and im giving full stars after a long üòä.. Wonderfully scripted and my mouth fall out laughing a lot lot & lottt üòÜüòÜüòÜ....100% guaranteed fun, don't miss such an awesome serial üòé... This drama has covered almost every zones like fun, romance, sentiment, thrill, scientific, emotion etc..... üëç No one can dislike this drama.... Daebakkkkk ü§óü§óü§ó

Coming to the cast:
Min Min: Awesome male lead ‚ù§ i can see Lee jong suk in him üåπ His act was hilarious and made me laugh out loud whenever he hops in the scene üòÜ.. His love act was so pure and he had no fear to anyone....üòé The most thing was he never cared about his company or any whenever he was with his girlfriend, thus playing a superb boyfriend role üòâ... Also the gay part was laughable and he did act those scenes accordingly to make all believe that he is a gay ha ha ha üòÇ.... So pretty male lead, Loved him lot üòç

Bong Bong: Waaaahhhhhh she is really very tiny to call a strong woman as the title üòÑ... Anyways, Never judge by its cover right üòé.. She tremendously did her role very well and she is soooo cute and pretty as all said in the drama throughout.. üòç Really a peanut size girl üòÄ... She looked dashing as a woman in Juliet role and kid like nature in Bong Bong role ü§ó I loved her a lot, very adorable ‚ò∫

Gook doo: He said he liked flower-like girls pointing Bong Soon in his high school then he had HeeJi as girlfriend, after she said she is wavering, he suddenly jumped to say that he loved BongSoon only for this long to BongBong itself, this is so uncomfortable üòõ i really got confused just in that 1minute scene, if he loved Bong from long then why did he liked HeeJi in middle, eventhough he didnt get a clear picture he must have sort it and then made a choice üòØ...But friend like part was good between them üëç

Other characters: All did a fantastic job by supporting the flow of the script... Every role did so well... Applause üëèüëèüëè

Can't consider anything else in negative from a fantasy drama even if it's unbelievable journal... Just take only the fun ones, other than the rough and struggling parts üëç

Special mention: I must thank the music creators for such a lovely bgm for every scene... Even when they rolled the eyes they made a funny bgm and made me LOL üòÇüòÇüòÇ And HEARTBEAT & SUPER POWER GIRL songs are extraodinary, such a marvelous music, great and lovable songs üåπ

Last but not least, i must Thank the subtitlers for such a detailed subtitles where they explained very well... Even korean syllable words were explained clearly. Thanks a lot to all who made this üëèüëçüëè

Overall STRONG WOMAN DO BONG SOON is DAEBAK from start to end ‚ù§.. Accurate ending and well handled üòä... Directors did a lovely job üëè... Happy that i didnt miss such a drama.. Thanks again üòé

Woman Empowerment in a Different Way
What happens when a ‚Äúpeanut size‚Äù (his words, not mine) woman with super strength tries to save the world? You get a historic drama that challenges the conventional roles.Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is one such drama. Now, there are many woman empowering series or dramas with strong woman characters. However, Strong Woman Do Bong Soon is a little different and here‚Äôs why.

In a country like South Korea that has developed so much in no time, gender roles are still much traditional. Strong Woman Do Bong Soon features a woman character physically stronger than her male counterparts. Where most woman are projected as a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued, this one comes as a change of air where the male leads standby and watch things unfold (not always but that‚Äôs a start).

Characters

Do Bong Soon has literally become one of my all time favourite characters. She know her priorities straight. Maybe it‚Äôs because of her strength that she takes on things and beats up guys without batting an eye. But it‚Äôs because she is Bong Soon she never gives up, even when the world calls out her worth and intelligence. Bong Soon stands up against the wrong, stand by her friends, protects her loved ones but also exposes her vulnerable side from time to time. Such a strong character placed inside a tiny woman makes it all the more charming.

An Minhyuk- this guy is a dream. Everything about him is lovable, his righteousness, his fun suave office behaviour, his passionate love, and even his anger and concern for Bong Soon. This drama was definitely the most cutest one, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling whenever I would witness Min Hyuk swooning over Bong Soon. It made me feel all the butterflies in my stomach. Park Hyung Sik admitted to having a crush on Park Bo Young and it so evident in the drama. He wants her to take the main frame and be the main character. What I loved the most is that there are instances where he wants to ‚Äòbe the man‚Äô and protect Bong Soon but there are also instances where he ‚Äòman‚Äôs up‚Äô and realises her strength.

He respects her family, her decisions, her space, and the fact that she is special. Infact, it is her abilities and her good heart that makes him fall deeper for her.
(What a guy! Do they manufacture them anymore?)

Gook Doo‚Äôs character tries to keep a balance between progressive actions and regressive thoughts. A macho man with a lot of pride. Initially, cold with his love interest and later somewhat a Tsundere. He tries to protect Bong Soon like a fragile leaf who possibly can‚Äôt take care of herself. His views on her being a ‚Äòtiny little woman‚Äô don‚Äôt falter much even after finding out about her strength. His character provides all the conventional elements in the drama. I love the fact that he did not get hung up on his girlfriend seeing someone else considering he had feelings for someone too. And is actually cool about crossing paths with his ex and even protecting her. We find his true strength in setting aside his feelings for Bong Soon and maintaining his friendship with her.

The whole Bong Soon family, Secretary Gong, Head of planning department Oh Dol-ppyeo and Baek Tak gang were great additions to the drama. They complemented the drama well. In fact, the whole cast did great acting.

Plot / Story developments

Now, I also want to talk about something interesting here. This series is one of the few where the guy or his pride isn‚Äôt hurt in acknowledging that his woman is stronger than him and can protect him better than himself. Not only does he acknowledge it, he embraces it! Korea still isn‚Äôt entirely open on the idea of LGBT but the show has given full blown screen time to bromance between ‚ÄòGook Doo‚Äô and ‚ÄòMin Hyuk‚Äô. Not only this, they also featured a gay character and his interaction with the rest of characters is both fun and interesting.

The series doesn‚Äôt pit woman against each other. Well, not really! I love how Bong Soon‚Äôs parents take care of Kyung Shim like she is their own kid, and the lengths Do Bong Soon goes to just to save her friend. She even backs of and subdues her feelings for Gook Doo, because he has a woman. This line of plot had a great message, that it isn‚Äôt impossible to get over someone you thought you never could. If you actually shift your eyes around a better door will open.

Moralities

Another important message is via Bong Soon‚Äôs will to help out the weak and abused with her power. She makes a faithful following out of the drop out kids who leave their ganster like antics. They actually start cleaning up the neighborhood and try to protect Bong Soon even from Min Hyuk. (How cute!)

My Verdict - Loved nevertheless , hilarious

There‚Äôs hardly anything that I don‚Äôt like. Maybe (just maybe!) the Bak Tae story development could have reduced screen time especially around the whole turning into a monk thing. But I loved that nevertheless, it was funny. The soundtrack is amazing and so in-sync with the story. Be it the cute song Heartbeat, the beautifully mellow You are my Garden or the fun and upbeat Double Trouble Couple and Pit-a-Pat I love them all. Most of the main tracks are sung from a woman‚Äôs perspective which is understandable. Super Power Girl should be declared a girl‚Äôs anthem!

Ending

The wedding scene was so good and deserves a special mention. You can easily see how Park Hyung Sik is actually swooning over Park Bo Young. I loved the fact that they end up with two girls, who have Bong Soon‚Äôs super strength. (Ah! Poor Min Hyuk!) Not only would I say, get a guy like Ahn Hye Min who looks at you and treats you the way he treats Do Bong Song. I would also say get a girl like Do Bong Song who would love you with all her heart and protect you from any danger. (Don‚Äôt mind the tiny injuries) All in all, it was an amazing one-of-a-kind drama that I have actively watched more than once or twice. (And that doesn‚Äôt happen often!)

Why watch it?

- If you are a Park Bo Young, Park Hyung Sik or Kim Jisoo fan
- If you like woman centric Kdramas
- If you are into rom-coms
- If you are into action and thriller
- Amazing storyline and ensemble cast
- Great OST
- If you like ageyo, cute couple type dramas

One of the drama that I give the highest rating and my favourite drama too !

All good things must come to an end. It's the only way we can appreciate them more.

I'll confess, there's a lot going on with the plot. They dragged my emotions left and right. One minute I would be happy and the next, I would find myself wide-eyed and in utter shock. However, it wasn't overwhelming. Sure, I felt dizzy at times but I have no regrets whatsoever. And frankly, if I'm being honest, I think the romance helped with a lot.

I am so grateful that the cast has graced us with loads of hilarious moments to look back on. There wasn't a single moment where I wasn't giddy watching my favorite characters interact with one another. One thing that I was really disappointed about, though, was the fact that we never got the chance to delve into our antagonist's past. Jang Mi Kwan did such an incredible job portraying this character (especially for his first acting role), it's a shame the character itself lacked in depth.

The original soundtracks were very befitting of this drama. It did well with capturing the feel of it all. At times, I even found myself singing along to some of the lyrics.

Overall, I had a blast watching this drama. It was nice to see our main characters grow both as individuals and as a couple. There's not a single person I wouldn't recommend this to. As far as rewatching it goes, I think I'd be insane if I didn't. The memories are just too good for me not to relive.

With that said,
Llama out.

omg....finally its over...STRONG WOMEN DO BONG SOON... im totally out of words. i really liked this drama...this is been included in my fav k -series list. totally osam exactly one day .it took me one day to complete all the 16 episodes.the chemistry between min min and bong bong is just superb and sizzling... the director has made a remarkable hitlist. each and every episode were so in flow that i never felt to quit the show at all...yah, but sometime i felt its a bit dragging. but at the top of all. it was a bang on show....there were many scene which are still lingering in my thoughts.... like our bong bong fighting with villain...that scene was just wow.wow.and wow...the way min-min was sitting on the ground and the together, effort of hero heroin and the guardian. that scene was just remarkable. each and every episodes were just superb... the love triangle....was bit hectic but its OK.
min-min charismatic cutypie gestures....omg.i lives it they were just tooo cute ...
and then then the most liked thing was she was in the lime light the director has scored perfectly for the series name ,actually when i started the series i felt they might show her weak or somewhat very un-fightable or something like that but that was never the case. it was superb . one more thing is, always in a k-series the guardian end up at a bad shape (in most of the series) like the guardian( her our police li) he does everything for the heroin and end up very bad, but in this series it was different- i liked it. his respect was restored and he is still not left at a pathetic situation at the end of the series.thats good... and min-min aiegos and cute gestures stole the show .really really cute to watch....tillt he last scene of the last episode he was just damn cute....min-min is just....so cute totally.(he had done justice to his character.)and our bong bong is really a ""strong women do bong soon"".
to say it totally its a superb drama ,all time watchable drama...
its a mixture of romance, crime, thriller , investigation , women power and ala and all....
the main lead was just osam duo....

It tried to be too much.
Okay, boy do I have a lot to say about this drama.

The first thing that comes to my mind is how jarring it is to have such a fluffy storyline with Bong-soon and Min-hyuk, then have a super terrifying psycho as a villain. He's a solid villain, loved the acting, but it just ruined the show's tone for me. Why did he have to be there? The show tried to combine too many elements and it just didn't work in the end.

Speaking of ""why did he have to be there"", the entire plotline with the shit-eating mafia boss was just. Not it. It became annoying, and it was the first time I had to skip scenes from a drama. Totally unnecessary and weird.

I wasn't sold on Bong-soon and Min-hyuk at the beginning, but I grew to like them as the show went on. Gook-do had zero chemistry with Bong-soon and I just found him misogynistic and annoying. Park Bo-young and Park Hyung-sik did excellent jobs though, especially PBY. She was the cutest little bean.

I also loved Kim Won-hae in this, he was hilarious.

I didn't like the ending they had for Min-hyuk. They basically made him like Bong-soon's father, which is not good at all. It was such a good relationship, why'd they have to ruin it in the end?

The OST grew on me but I didn't find myself listening to it after the drama (which I tend to do to ease my post-drama sadness). So unfortunately it does not slap. I haven't tried rewatching it yet, I didn't find myself wanting to. It dragged on for a while when I was watching, though. Very slow.

Overall, it's good but not great. I can see why people like it so much, but maybe some of it just wasn't for me.

(This is just my opinion, no one's obligated to care about it. I just needed to talk about dramas somewhere :')

Ji Soo
One of the best second lead. If it is not for the love of romantic comedy, you should watch this for Ji Soo, he is fine. While he is stern as you would expect of a police officer, you can feel the warmth behind the feelings he didn't recognize long enough to lose the girl. I can't complain about the other leading actors, they were all good indeed, but I was biased to Ji Soo character from the get go. The one thing that was off for me, was the psycho kidnapper and his scenes with the women he abducted, these were parts in the drama I found mostly disturbing, along with some of the fighting scenes. Again, watch for Ji Soo, you won't regret it, and probably, you would follow his other dramas. I certainly will.

I watched this drama to get over my weightlifting fairy kim bok joo hangover and thankfully it didn't disappoint . It was a fun watch and i don't think it had a single dull episode. I loved the acting of the female lead and some of the moments in the drama had me laughing out too loud.

without giving out any spoilers, some of the things i loved about this drama were
- the plot! - like i said never a dull episode !!
- the fact that do bong soon is played by such a petite cute actress
- the whole team leader han doppleganger sub plot
- the acting of the supporting actors ( specially the main villain and bong soon's first crush - must say i liked him even better than the male lead)

Ok how can I start with this drama? At first I didn¬¥t want to see it cause it seemed very similiar to ""Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo"" ...but let me tell you IT'S NOT.
I love Park Bo Young since many years ago, and in this drama she is so cute and natural. The story is very funny and it has this ""funny sounds"" that play when a character makes something fun.
And I have to admit that I became a huge fan of Park Hyung Shik, he is so funny, so handsome and cute. His role is so cheese, kinda gay but just in the way he behaves.
It has a lot of cute/cheese romance, but at the same time it keeps you in suspense (you have to see it to know what I¬¥m talking about). There¬¥ll be plenty of people you will love beisde the main roles. And last but not least the soundtrack is so catchy and perfect.
I wish there will be another season, they have enough material to do it , so....

You won¬¥t regret it :) watch it

I absolutely loved this show. If you're someone who enjoys a cute rom-com and some fluff, then I would definitely recommend this show to you. Although there's more to it than just fluff, trust me.

I think the actors were amazing in this show. Park Bo Young was just the cutest and her acting was just spot on. The actors had great chemistry and I love them. The soundtrack was also great. There were a few songs that got stuck in my head but luckily, Spotify already had them. There were more than a few times where I found myself laughing at loud. I love comedy and this show was hilarious.

There are some flaws in the plot and I wanted to see a bit more, but then again, we all have flaws.

Strong Woman Do Bong Soon introduces a character trope rarely seen in the Korean dramasphere, one of a strong woman (as it says in the title) who isn't necessarily harsh and cold-hearted, but rather quirky, compassionate, and courageous. I was immediately reeled in by this aspect of the drama. The show includes the genres of supernatural, action, thriller, and from time to time comedy (the cheesy and slap-stick kind). But the investigation ('frontal' episodes) and romance (latter episodes of the drama) elements are the most prominent. The pacing of Strong Woman had me hooked when I initially watched the show, but I kind of drifted away towards the end of the series; the main plots had finished much earlier than I expected, so I felt that the resolution dragged on more than it needed to (the drama could've been condensed to 13 or 14 episodes). Nevertheless, the well-rounded cast, especially the chemistry seen between Do Bong Soon and Ahn Min Hyuk (and the actors who play them). I was also a fan of the soundtrack and score of Strong Woman; they mostly reflected the romantic components of the show. My favorite song was the main theme song, Super Power Girl; rather than a romantic ballad, it's an upbeat alternative/rock song that definitely matched the quirky personality of protagonist, Do Bong Soon. Overall, I would recommend Strong Woman Do Bong Soon to those who typically like romantic/investigative K-dramas but would like to spice up their tastes with a unconventionally supernatural twist.

This by far is the best drama I've seen!! I can't believe it has come to an end. Like what would I do with my life now when the only thing that kept me looking forward to the weekend has ended. It was so freaking cute and fun and just overall perfect! I had a problem with the whole homophobia thing that was going on but I think it's just because of their society is actually like this so putting this aside and the useless side characters/plot, everything else was great. Hyung Sik as a lead was like a dream coming true and he proved again that he is an amazing actor and he truly deserved it. Bo Young is just one of the cutest actresses ever ""peanut"" and her acting skills were just perfect. I felt really bad for Jisoo though especially with the last few episodes and he also proved once again that he truly deserves his own first lead role. The whole concept of the drama was just great showing that guys can be cute when they fall in love and girls can be cute yet strong and not dependent on any one. And an eternity of appreciation to the OSTs that are gonna be on repeat for upcoming month till I can find something remotely close to this even though I know there won't be. I'm just gonna miss them so much!!

ok so this drama...what can i say lol
I JUST FREAKING LOVED IT!

Im a big fan of jisoo and Park bo young and now an even bigger fan of Park hyung SIk, even tho it is my first drama watching with him in it. i just thought the way they all portrait their characters was off the charts. the chemistry between the main lead was something just truly amazing. i hadn't watched something so sweet which made my heart flutter in a while! I usually suffer then second male lead syndrome especially when it is jisoo lol coz i feel like he deserves better and actually deserves to get the girl but in this drama, i was strangely okay with him not getting her coz honestly i think they were perfect and no one could have done it any better.

the drama is absolutely hilarious although i do think that some scene were just over exaggerated and could have been cut out. some heartfelt moments, thrilling moments and some action. this is a must watch and i can't wait to see what they actors have more to offer. i hope to watch them all in other dramas as main leads and hopefully jisoo's next drama has him getting the girl lol

The story line was messy. But if you are new to kramas like me its a great start , and itll also get you more intrigued in different genres.   The romantic side is amazing due to the chemistry between the 2 actors (bong soon & min hyuks ) it shows how two opposites can attract. This was my first kdrama aswell as the drama that got me into all of these dramas. If you enjoy this I recommend ‚Äòmy secret romance , noble my love and oh my ghost‚Äô    If you havent watched this watch it noww because you wont be disappointed. Its GREATT????????

To the couple who made me believe that they are ""real"", I give you both a 10!!!

The way they acted (or not) got me watching from start to finish! The whole idea of this drama is quite unique to me! Not to mention that the cast and crew did everything for it to be light hearted even with all the fight scenes and seriously effed up criminal!

I just.. Ah! I'm at a loss of other things to say aside from it's just way perfect to me.
Thank you, Bong Bong and Min Min. You guys were my great source of happiness these past months. :)

The minute I started watching, I already loved the characters. The acting and story was well done, however to me it was a little slow. I bet it was because they wanted to fill in all the 16 episodes, but otherwise this was an AMAZING show to watch!!!
I have to warn that I noticed lots of product placements that did not necessarily sneak their way into the story well enough because it was like every time the characters had a breather from the suspense they did a product placement.
The side characters also stood out in their own way. However, there was a lot of gay humor which was funny (but if you don't like that kind of stuff then this is not a show you should watch). This show reminded me slightly of 'W' (if you haven't seen that drama - it's a MUST watch!!) because there was a lot of cartoon elements that made it seem like it was written from a webtoon.
The main heroine has super strength (not a spoiler), but she shows a lot more character as a woman than just being strong. Even though she looks weak, she fights off many difficulties pushed at her as well as showing signs of weakness (because a person cannot be strong all the time).
Of course, this is a romance so which guy does she fall in love with in the end? WATCH TO FIND OUT!!! ^_^

I didn't dislike this drama, really, I didn't. I actually found the sweet romance to be adorable to watch, but switching from sweet cute romantic comedy to dark murdering killer scenes was just too much for me to comfortably enjoy on my couch in the evening...And honestly, the bad guy was just frickin creepy...
When the scenes switched to the bad guy, I got such Criminal Minds vibes (that spooky thriller bad omen vibes) that I'd be too spooked to sleep comfortably. I'm a pretty big wimp though, so maybe my interpretation of how spooky and scary the bad guy was is just me...
BUT, something else I found jarring was how the romantic comedy was very slap-stick in nature, and then it would switch to the bad guy and it was very dark and scary....the abrupt switching between both extremes of those genre's just didn't smoothly blend and transition to be in one drama. I think if the bad guy scenes were less creepy and dark, I'd find the drama less unbalanced.
Overall, I did like the romantic comedy aspects, but inevitably, I dropped this drama because the scary scenes were just too outside my comfort zones for me to enjoy this drama in its entirety. You might find this drama fitting to your own preferences though, so I don't think it'd hurt to try starting and see if it's something you enjoy.

Should I finish it?
I'm confused about the direction of this series. It went from a possible love triangle to an extreme suspense theme that involves murder, bloody physical altercations, and random attacks. I don't think I can see this as a cute love story anymore. It's a real toss-up between loving the actors and hating the storyline. It's like the writer became overly excited about the cast and budget and decided to write all he or she could into this ONE series. Is it a love story, a comedy, suspense drama, supernatural, or what? I just don't know what's going on, which is leaving it undesirable to watch. HOWEVER, I love the actors.

Editing was a shit
Director was a shit
Actress was a shitty shit not cute at all
Not comedy
Not romance
They had no chemistry
Story was okay but it would be better if they make it in high quality,editing and find a really cute actress not this old woman who looks stupid when tried to be cute.
Two actors were so good, and i liked the cop more.
Give it a try and you'll drop it after the first episode
The webtoons stories are better at least you know that's a webtoon!
