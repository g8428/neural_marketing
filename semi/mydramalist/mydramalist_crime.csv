The Daesang for the 57th Baeksang goes to…
Shin Ha Kyun, of course! I can’t think of any other more worthy recipient of this prestigious accolade. He truly is the driving force behind Beyond Evil because without him, this drama would have ended up being Not Quite Evil. In fact this drama isn’t as much about evil as it is about filial piety (or lack thereof) and shady business ethics, with a dose of mental health issues included. In any case, I hope he gets a nomination at the very least because he is definitely deserving of the recognition for all the good work he has done here, and I have thoroughly enjoyed myself watching his performance in this extremely well made production.

This drama is set in the small town of Manyang, which has a sinister history of mysterious killings and gruesome mutilation of young women that remain unsolved until the present day. Part of this local community is a close-knit group of childhood friends, most of whom grew up to become members of the police force, while the others comprise the local butcher and convenience store operator, respectively. One day, a young hotshot police detective gets transferred to the Manyang police substation and all hell breaks loose in this sleepy town.

The plot is exquisitely written, despite not being groundbreaking, and we’ve seen this premise in many psychological crime thrillers. A small town with a hideous past and its suspicious inhabitants harbouring many unknown secrets, the perfect recipe for a can of worms that would’ve been better off left unopened. Except, in this case, it gets much more convoluted than that - a decades’ long conspiracy that culminates in a scandal of the highest order. This is very much a character driven drama and represents an in-depth case study of the complicated dynamics among the central characters. This is a complex and slowburn psychological whodunnit with dark humour and suspense along with themes of friendship, familial bond, betrayal, forgiveness and redemption.

Helmed by the young director Shim Na Yeon, a relative newcomer to the industry whose recent works cover mostly youth-themed melodramas and romance, and written by the experienced Kim Soo Jin whose previous crime dramas include Mad Dog and Life Special Investigation Team. Being part of the spring drama lineup of JTBC Studios, this drama features commendable production values. The cinematography showcases excellent shots of the Manyang town landscape, including the beautifully tall grass fields where multiple crime scenes have purportedly occurred, and the scenic port city of Busan for a story arc that lasts a couple of episodes. Other than that, the majority of the drama is set in the bright interrogation rooms and gloomy holding cells of the Manyang police substation, Munju police station and the Seoul police HQ. There are countless scenes of barbequing meat and drinking at the Manyang diner-cum-butcher shop as well.

The drama’s true strength lies in its cast and their superb acting, as well as the overall quality of the dialogue. Ever the consummate pro, Shin Ha Kyun does what Shin Ha Kyun does best. For the uninitiated (and for the purpose of managing excessive shock or awe), expect visceral intensity and raw emotions conveyed via truly immersive wholehearted portrayals. For regular viewers and admirers, his execution here is even more elevated from his usual performances in Less Than Evil and Pied Piper. His characterization of Lee Dong Shik is a delicate balancing act between nuanced and downright insane, and will probably represent the standard of acting for this genre in years to come (a close comparison would be Lee Hee Joon’s characterization in Mouse, so there’s potential in this area). Depicting a flawed anti-hero complex and emotionally traumatized character shouldering the burden of a profoundly tragic past is certainly no mean feat and Shin Ha Kyun does it magnificently indeed.

Of the 2 MLs featured in this drama, the other lead is the character of Han Joo Won who is decently portrayed by Yeo Jin Goo. Those familiar with his works would no doubt witness the same signature aspects of his acting. Since Hotel Del Luna (and even earlier, The Royal Gambler) he has perfected the art of the “intense gaze”. Not many actors can pull off this trademark look. An added bonus in this show, he does a near-complete character change that lasts a few episodes at the midway point. Despite not being a fan of the character - he comes across as aloof, sanctimonious, petulant, selfish and entitled, who possesses an unhealthy and somewhat irrational obsession for solving crimes while incessantly defying his own father at every turn - I do appreciate the characterization. The chemistry between the two men, Lee Dong Shik and Han Joo Won, is on point and works very well.

They are ably supported by the rest of the cast comprising the experienced veterans Chun Ho Jin, Choi Jin Ho, Kil Hae Yeon, Heo Sung Tae, Kim Shin Rok and Lee Kyu Hoe. Their versatility truly shows in playing a mix of understated, layered, OTT and mentally unstable characters. I’m also quite impressed with Choi Sung Eun in particular, whose portrayal of Yoo Jae Yi is very powerful and convincing and she stands out as the strongest female character in the show.

Aside from the acting, one aspect that probably doesn't get enough appreciation and recognition is the music for the drama. Kudos to the music director, the hugely experienced and prolific Ha Geun Young, who has done a fantastic job of arranging the original score with an infusion of contemplative jazz performed by a big band ensemble. There's more than a hint of cabaret and the vibe of classic film noir that somehow perfectly captures the essence of the drama. In addition to the music score, the accompanying original songs are terrific as well:

1. Choi Baek Ho - The Night
2. BIBI - Timeless
3. Car The Garden - Empty
4. SunWoo JungA - The Road

All things considered, Beyond Evil has been a hugely satisfying watch and certainly went beyond my initial expectations. I sincerely hope this drama and Shin Ha Kyun will be part of the nominations to be announced next week for the 57th Baeksang Awards this year. They absolutely deserve it!

The Most Formidable Bromance of 2021 that will bring you to your knees
Where do I even begin? This is the best detective thriller drama I have ever watched. There, I said it.

How many of you have grown tired of watching crime shows that just don't feel exciting anymore?

So many times, crime dramas get lost in the 'next big moment' and finding the thrill factor that they stop connecting with the watcher.

Beyond Evil is a beautiful mix of emotion and supense. It's a blend of heartbreakingly slow, full of feeling moments and bone chilling darkness. It's not a super fast show. It takes its time as it unravels, develops and comes to fruition gorgeously- like a well simmered pot of stew.

The drama's biggest strength is its unforgettable characters and the mindblowing acting by the cast.

In the beginning it induces your trust issues in a gut punching manner by introducing its two seemingly morally grey and unreliable protagonists and then slowly but surely brings to light one of the best friendships the Korean cinema has ever seen.

Both the main leads are phenomenal, each holding their own and being a massive force to be reckoned with.

Shin Ha Kyun put out acting worthy of a Daesang. His reckless, passionate, wildly fearless and courageous detective with the biggest smile and eyes full of pain doesn't take long to cement his place in your heart.

Yeo Jin Goo, on the other hand, while young, owned his role phenomenally. His character Han Joo Won, a prickly, seemingly cold catlike man with heart of platinum and a strong sense of justice is extremely easy to fawn over.

Together, these two are a storm- infinitely badass with balls of steel; a dynamic team that you can't help but fall in love in with.

Aside from the two, all the supporting characters bring their own flavour to the screen. While their little self-proclaimed 'Avengers' police team brings instant warmth to your heart, the antagonists are blood boiling-ly good in equal measure.

The music is fantastic- sombre and dark at times; sometimes cheeky and playful and other times enough to wreck you. There are a lot of stunning shots and the drama is both extremely well written and directed.

The character development is amazing and the bonds these characters form among each other is a powerful thing to witness. There's so much nuance in these relationships and it's hard not to catch feelings and let go of your heart when it comes to a show like this.

Honestly, for me a good psychological thriller is hard to come by and this was by far one of the best. I was so invested in it that some of the scenes made me bawl my eyes out, while others made me laugh, giggle, swoon and shout HOLY FUCK at the top of my lungs.

They nailed both the emotion and the 'whodunnit' aspect in a way that's very unique to the genre.

It was a wild, crazy, full of thrill and heart ride that I almost don't want to get off of.

Surely, a must-watch. Highly reccomended for fans of psychological thrillers who like their dramas with a little extra oomph!

This review may contain spoilers
Dong Sik and Ju Won make this drama what it is.
I'm going to keep this review relatively spoiler-free, but in order to make character references and because a big draw of the plot is whether or not the leads are involved in the murder, I'm going to use a spoiler tag as talking about their characters in-depth will reveal whether or not they're involved, so keep that in mind while reading.

It's really hard to write a detective thriller that works. We've all seen them, dozens of them. A fair amount of the most popular dramas over the years have fallen into this category. With so many to choose from and another 1-3 cropping up each season, it's hard for any individual title to leave its mark on you. You've seen it all before, all the twists and turns. And buddy cop dramas? They're a dime a dozen. Every dynamic has been tested, all the tropes are set, so the moment that you see a new title following the same formula, unless it has a gimmick, you don't bat an eye.

Beyond Evil is just like all of those other thriller detective stories. Except where it isn't. There's something different about this drama that really struck a chord with me. The setting of a small town with a history of murder where everyone knows each other and they all have secrets? That's nothing new. A 20-year-old-murder that's never been resolved is suddenly brought back into the spotlight when the killer kills again? It's been done to death. What about two very different police officers who are forced to partner up to solve the crime? That's one of the most popular dynamics in the genre!

Except, it's not. What really fascinated me about this drama wasn't the mystery, the setting, nor the plot. There was something different about the relationship between LDS and HJW, something that I couldn't quite place in the early episodes. When I started watching episodes 1 and 2 I had predicted the turns their relationship would take right off the bat. On one side we had an unconventional older cop who's been around the block and whose past is always hanging over him. He's bitter with the world, angry at himself, and is known to fly off the handle when provoked. Only... that's not really accurate. We can make assumptions about LDS before we really get to know him that can lead to those conclusions because that's typically how these characters go. And, honestly, he looks pretty unhinged early on, enough to make you wonder if HJW is right, if LDS has been the killer all along. The further the story goes and the more you see of him, you come to understand that what's on the surface isn't all there is to his character. Despite going off when he's angry, he can also be extremely rational. In those fits of brash action that he takes, he knows what he's doing, where it will go and what will happen because of it. He laughs like a madman not because he's unhinged but because of what he's been through. When fingers are being pointed at him, when he notices other cops making the same mistakes now that were made 20 years ago when he was named a suspect, he laughs at the absurdity of it, of knowing it was exactly those leaps in logic that ruined his life all those years ago and that, even after no evidence could be found and he was released, he's the first suspected when something goes wrong. LDS is a very thoroughly thought-out character, and I was honestly shocked by that as detectives don't tend to be that fleshed out in these types of stories - often their main character trait is 'the family/friend of victim A who wants to avenge their death'. LDS is no exception to this rule; he's a cop with a murdered sister who wants to find her body and catch the murderer, but there was more to him than that. Take that fleshed-out character and add the phenomenal actor Shin Ha Kyun and you have an amazing performance.

HJW is a little different. At first, I was sure that he was a badly written character. No matter what happened or how his logic was challenged, he was dead-set on LDS being named the murderer. In the first few episodes, he only vaguely considered other possibilities. Even when other characters tried to rationalize with him or let him into their lives, he just pushed them away. He didn't want anything to do with them. All that mattered was that LDS was the killer and that HJW was going to arrest him. But just like LDS, he's a character with a lot of layers. We get to see glimpses of his past, the grudge he holds against his father and how completely alone he's been throughout his life. The closeness of the Manyang police officers is foreign to him. He's not good with that sort of environment because he had never experienced it before. When someone shows him compassion, he pushes it back. He doesn't need it. He can't grasp the feelings behind it. Everyone has always wanted something from him, everyone always had expectations of him, and if they show one bit of kindness then they must be the same. To a man who doesn't believe in sincerity, it's easier to be alone. And honestly, before you know really know him, seeing him acting like this is frustrating. You just want to take him by the collar and shake him. Yeo Jin Goo plays this role perfectly as well. I honestly couldn't imagine another actor in his place, and even when you want to punch him, you can't quite hate him.

What really stands out about Beyond Evil is the relationship between these two characters. Now, I like detective thrillers. Even despite how much flack I give them, I still try out almost every one that comes around, I give them all a chance. I'm only so critical of the genre because of just how many I've seen and how a lot of them blur together. A drama doesn't necessarily need to have a good plot or production for me to like it. Usually, the first thing I look at is characters. If the characters are good then I've even enjoyed dramas that have very low ratings or little popularity. If a plot is really good but I hate seeing the characters, it's hard to get through. What surprised me about LDS and HJW's relationship is that it's not a typical enemies-to-friends dynamic. It isn't just two different people learning to depend on one another. For most of the series, these two clash. They butt heads every episode, they bait each other every chance they get. Compliments are backhanded insults and there is no trust between them. Half the time you'd think they hate each other. Half the time, they do. There's no bonding session 4 or 5 episodes in that makes them get along or work together better. It just doesn't happen. Every time LDS reaches out, HJW slaps him in the face. Again and again. But despite how terribly they get along, they start to worry about each other. They look out for one enough even while pointing figurative (and literal) guns at each other's heads. The way LDS talks and reacts to HJW reveals just how little he actually blames HJW for his actions. He sees him as a young, naive boy who doesn't have much experience with the world and lets him get away with a lot. You realize how tolerant he is. At the same time, HJW begins the long, slow journey of learning more about the world and himself. He opens up. Even if he has a sharp tongue right up until the end, he starts to ease up and let people into his life.

Beyond Evil is great. And these characters are just two of the rich cast we're given. Each character has their own secrets, their own stories and trials and everyone has their place. And the plot, while a little too messy at times, does a great job of bringing those characters together in a unique and interesting way. For me, this was the only drama this season that was consistently good from the beginning right until the end. It was the one that left me the most satisfied, and looking at where we started to where we are at the end has made me appreciate it even more. This is a classic in the making and I really hope more people give it a shot because it's worth your time.

The Perfect Definition of 'Thriller'
A drama that never fails to surprise you, giving you unexpected twists and turns, to the extent that the unpredictableness of the plot becomes predictable. This would be a perfect explanation for this masterpiece. Suspense, thriller, and mystery keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more and never be satisfied with one episode. I loved it for sure! For me, it's the perfect definition of the thriller genre. The twists and surprises we get at the end of every episode were really brilliant, the ending of every episode to be a cliffhanger leaving many unanswered questions behind I guess it is its specialty.

Story: It's very well written and well-executed, nothing here is draggy or unnecessary. I was hooked from the very 1st episode. Kudos to the writer for doing really great job as we don't get big loopholes in the plot and also its execution. The leads aren't perfect have their flaws but that's the strong point here. Both have a shady character which makes us suspicious about them. 'Never Trust Anyone' its motto. Having every character be suspicious, you wonder every time who might be the killer and what could be the reason. At one point you thought you are going in the right direction... but you never know what can happen next. So I guess keeping us in the dark till the moment of truth is really big astonishment as we can never predict what really happened.

Acting/Cast: Okay let the remaining cast aside coz I was just focused on our leads Lee Dong Shik (Shin Ha Kyun) and Han Joo Won (Yeo Jin Goo) they were phenomenal, I didn't even bother to look elsewhere whenever this pair was on screen. Specially Shin Ha Kyun's acting impressed me I never noticed him before but this time he truly nailed it. The acting, the emotions portrayed by both of them made this show more perfect. The chemistry and tension between them is the key point of the show. Haha, both remind me of Tom and Jerry. ;D

Cinematography: It was indeed great and beautiful, every shot was kind of perfection also the camera angle's light effect made it look shadier and perfect thriller vibes from the looks. So for me, there was nothing wrong with cinematography I also got some beautiful screenshots through some episodes.

Soundtrack: Well it does have some beautiful OSTs which makes it more perfect. I loved The Night especially, it's my favorite among these. Not just the OSTs but the background sound effects are great. Though sometimes you feel like wait... what? This is an intense/emotional scene and the background music is totally different?! But that's one of the special things about this drama!

So it nailed it in Story, Acting, Cinematography, Soundtrack there's nothing here that wasn't perfect for this show, one of the best thrillers so far. Definitely, a must-watch, give it try sure you won't regret it.

It'll make Eager to know the mystery - What happened? And why?

ABSOLUTELY MIND-BLOWING & MUST-WATCH!
so i’ve never written a review on here before, in-fact i just got into kdramas within the last month and have only watched a handful so forgive me if this isn’t the most “together” or intellectual review but all i have to say is WOW.

STORY — i can’t speak highly enough about the story. the fact that this was written and directed by women!! heck yes!! i typically get bored with things extremely quickly and tend to go on my phone and this didn’t happen once with this drama. every single scene meant something. there was nothing added just to fill up time. everything was important. everyone was important. every single character was vital to what went down throughout the sixteen episodes each in their own unique and intriguing way. the way the writing, directing, and acting showcased everything perfectly is absolutely mesmerizing. there wasn’t a single weak point in the show. i also liked how even though there were subplots with side/supporting characters, as i said, they weren’t there to just fill up time, but ending up playing a huge part into the overall story in the end. the parallels that ended up coming together in the episodes (especially the first few episodes versus the ending) were MIND-BLOWING.

ACTING — i could go on and on and on about the acting in this show everyone did phenomenal but there were four people who specifically stood out to to me:

shin ha kyun: as i said im new to kdramas but did this man blow my mind??? oh my goodness. the emotions he portrayed as such a tortured man dealing with so much. he delivered every line perfectly. AND THE SMILE. you know the smile. insane. i heard he got nominated for a big award. so deserved.

yeo jin goo: another mesmerizing performance by the other lead character. absolutely phenomenal i loved to see how much his character evolved as the story went on and how different circumstances changed the way he ultimately ended up. his acting in the last 3/4ish episodes some of my favorite in the entire drama. he killed it.

choi dae hoon: i’ve watched this actor in CLOY and FOE and if i’m being honest he didn’t stand out in those to me - i barely noticed him if im being honest. however, in BE he blew my mind. genuinely one of the best performances of the show. he had so much he had to do and the role was such a heavy one and the way he portrayed a character dealing with all of the emotions he was and making you sympathize with him was so crazy and he deserves all the praise!!

choi sung eun: she was phenomenal. another actress i’ve never seen before but her whole demeanor was amazing. i loved her character a ton and i want to say its all thanks to the actress. each emotion came across perfectly and i felt like i could somehow relate and understand every single one of her actions. i hope to see her in more projects!

special mention to lee do hyun he was great in his few scenes and as a fan of his, it was nice seeing a familiar face!

OST — im quite new to this but i loved the soundtrack. i loved the whole vibe and it fit extremely well. left me unsettled and intrigued as if i was one of the characters.

REWATCH VALUE — i can guarantee once this has sat for a little bit i will be rewatching. the plot-twists were great and i can’t imagine how cool it will be knowing everything ahead of time. i might have to make someone watch this with me and then i watch their reactions for the first time because i was a mess on multiple occasions.

OVERALL: i’ll put it simply. if you are on the fence about watching this - WATCH IT YOU WONT REGRET IT!

An intricate plot of 21 years worth of some dark secrets...
Hands down one of the best criminal dramas I've had the pleasure of following ever since it's release.

The premise for this drama was high as my expectations the minute I've heard about it, and glad to know it did not disappoint.

I've got to say, am sad that it's not having the hype it truly deserves, because this is a masterpiece to be appreciated.
The way the plot was made and how every single characters kept getting more interesting as the drama unfolded and the constant lies and deceit dwelled and made the viewer grew suspicious of the most unlikely character is astonishing...

Personally my favorite thing about this drama, is definitely the partnership of the two main characters, Dongsik and Juwon.
An uncommon duo that through their bickering and stubbornness, led the viewers into an adventure of traps and suspicions.
Two different characters and yet also similar, struggling with their own issues, both trying to find their right path and justice.

It's a full journey from the minute they met, until the very end. And I must say, their development of caracter, their own growth truly shines in the very last episode. In that one heartbreaking scene inside the house that depicts their overall progress, and how much they've changed and committed to their very beliefs, finding right and wrong. It's raw, and emotional and brilliant.

This is a gruesome drama, albeit there might be worse than this one, description is advised.
Still if you watch for the criminal and judicial terms and themes, then this drama is right for you.

One thing is certain it won't leave you bored. It's realistic, and shows how greedy and deceitful people are, even those one can least expect too. It has it's moments that might mess around with your assumptions, and definitely has some Psycho definitions, and yet if you're one to assume or create theories maybe you might get right on some, and others will make you doubtful, because nothing is for granted here until the end.

The OST is okay, I liked it. It matches well the drama. But what engaged me more was the plot.
Maybe I am being biased because I really enjoy these kind of dramas, and because the acting of Yeo JinGoo here is remarkable just as Shin HaKyun, but then again every single one the cast did their roles well. I've got no complains on that regard.

So, I highly recommend for criminal/thriller enthusiasts. It's definitely a must on your list ;)

Not Perfect, But Still Above the Average of Most Kdrama
I find the episode 1 quite good, nice story background, character background, Shin Ha-Kyun acting, etc, rate it 8/10
Then in episode 3 and 4, quite draggy, it could be compressed into one single episode.
The best episodes are episode 7 and 12, I would give those episodes a solid 9/10

The rest episodes quite weak and draggy. Sometimes they just confronting each other while the evidence still not enough which becomes repetitive. And then the kept secret for later episodes, makes the earlier episode quite draggy because they can't talk about it yet. So the story building things not quite good.

And the last episode is quite nice closure, not great, but still good, I give it 7.5/10
Shin Ha-Kyun's acting the most shining one. On those episode 7 and 12, there are also some great scene throughout the series.

If only they can maintain the interesting things on each episode, I would have rate it higher.
For overall series, I would give this 7/10

Beyond Evil -- Beyond Well Done and Deserving of its Awards
I knew from the intense start of this drama that it would be a memorable one. And if anyone watching it has any doubts about the kind of drama Beyond Evil is, the opening scenes clear it up pretty quick. I was quite thrilled to have Shin Han Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo in a drama together. The last drama I watched Jin Goo in was The Crowned Clown, and he was excellent. Shin Ha Kyun, well, he's a beast of an actor and more than deserving of his best actor award in how he portrayed the tormented Dong Shik, but I think the best part of this drama was how Yeo Jin Goo and Shin Ha Kyun played off each other in their respective roles. Their chemistry on-screen is absorbing, and the fact that the drama is shrouded with mystery and hidden secrets added to its enjoyment. And as they say, a good actor is only as good as a well-written screenplay and direction, and without a doubt, Beyond Evil had that in droves. It's what made the drama as captivating as everything worked perfectly, from the dialogue to the storytelling and directing.

But as much as I loved both Shin Han Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo, I would be remiss not to mention Choi Dae Hoon in the role of Park Jung Je; his character that touched me the most, and it's probably in the way Dae Hoon portrays him and in the sadness that seems to always be in him, with him, and around him. The credit definitely goes to Choi Dae Hoon (I love the way he talks) for portraying Park so effortlessly, for making me care for him as much as I did. I felt his hopelessness every time.

All the important characters within this drama go through so much, and the best part is that they each had great development throughout the show, especially Dong Shik and Joo Won (Shin Han Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo). They go from practically hating each other to having complete trust in one another as they each lay their lives for the other, and in the process, learn the toughest lessons from each other. That punishment is not for revenge but to lessen crime and reform the criminal and that children are not responsible for their parent's actions. I love a drama with a message, and this one's major in it that out of adversity comes opportunity and sometimes the best of relationships and that one must stand up to the truth no matter who steps on it. Beyond Evil is beyond well done and is one drama worthy of the watch over and over again -- a perfect ten. I am not surprised this drama won best drama and screenplay of the year nor that Shin Ha Kyun won the best actor -- it was in the writing and the acting already. A standing ovation and thousand congratulations.

It's been a while
SPOILER FREE
Everyone can appreciate some aspects of this drama, like the acting or the OST, but plot-wise this is not a drama for everyone. Beyond Evil is a character-driven drama, that some may find slow paced. Anyone who likes multilayered and morally gray characters will appreciate it. The acting (especially from the two main leads) is probably one of the best I have seen.

SPOILERS
It's been a while since I saw such an intriguing series. Was it perfect without even a single flaw? No. However the flaws were minor, so I didn't really care about them.

Beyond Evil is a gripping drama from the beginning. There are not enough words to express how much I loved watching this series. The plot is very well written and the characters are so interesting and complex. The acting is outstanding. Shin Ha Kyun delivered one of the best performances I have ever seen. He is an amazing actor, and Yeo Jin Goo was such a great choice to play Han Joo Won. I don't know who thought of putting Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo together in a series, but whoever did, thank you very much! This series would definitely not be the same without this great cast and the phenomenal chemistry of the two main leads.

Generally, I don't pay too much attention to the directing, since most of the times it is good or at least decent. Nonetheless, it was impossible not to notice the great directing of this series. I loved how it was like seeing the POV of another character and it led the viewers to certain assumptions to distract them from the truth. The color tones were all so dark yet not too dark, which made the series even more appealing and disturbing (especially in the first episodes). The OST fits the series in an unimaginably good way.

Did this get draggy, tiring or just not as good comparing to the first half? Kind of, but it was inevitable. This isn't a series that reveals everything on the last episode, so of course every single clue added a piece to the puzzle and when things started getting clearer it was natural for the series to not be as mysterious as it was in the first episodes.

What I really loved, is the fact that everything was revealed slowly but surely and we didn't wait till the last episode to find out who the killer is.

I loved how Beyond Evil tackled many issues like the stigma that follows a falsely accused person or the pain that people who are left behind are going through.

Am I being objective giving this series a prefect 10? Probably not, but reviews are not objective anyways and this is a series that I will remember for quite a long time, so why not?

100% Worth Watching, Truly Recommended
My review is gonna be so long.

Don't get me wrong, I rate the story for you who don't believe in a 10 rate. It's good to start the series without expectation and it's up to you if this show deserves a higher rating :3

If you expect this as much of action-thriller scenes and intriguing cases drama, it's not, BUT it's more than that.

(Honestly, I would rate this drama as a perfect 10/10, but sadly I have to be realistic though)

This is mindblowing, for real. Every aspect of this drama is well made!

- {1. The Story} -
First, the drama feels like a super well-executed big movie because the storytelling is magnificent. Every dialogue has its purpose, comically or theoretically. The story is getting better. Each episode's ending always has a great cliffhanger, so it will make us want to watch it more and more. (I feel envy for those who can binge-watch this after the drama ends. Because the end is satisfying!)

Second, every character is necessary. It's not just like a random person passed by as a killer, get caught, and one case is done (so we won't see the character often). But not here. Every character has its nature, and we empathize with most of them, especially the main leads. The support characters appearance has meaning too to the story.

Third, it is unpredictable! Everyone can be a suspect of the crime. When you suspect someone, your reaction will be: ""It's him. Eh, actually not. No, it's him definitely. Or is he?"" It really plays with your mind!
And when the drama reveals some of the truths, you will be shouting out loud, ""OMG! IT'S HIM ALL THE TIME!"" or ""YES! I KNEW IT!""

It's well-paced and so fun to watch :D

Last, it's fun but also VERY DARK. Some of the episodes are rated as 19. As we know, the story is about serial killing, but not a brutal random slaughter. A dead person is a crucial issue because the victims have their own roles. And the killing method in this drama always makes me shivers. It's beyond creepy, and dark means no one's innocent. Even I feel irritated about the main leads! So much dirt but so cool.

THE MINUS:
Like I said earlier, the story is not about action scenes. It's more about manipulating emotionally and psychologically with dialogues and expression. So if you want to watch this, you can feel bored with the lack of action (but you should give it a try, please)

I think there's a difference between watching it when ongoing and binge-watch. The mystery is a slow-burn, so it is pretty slow. One of the reason is to build up some trusts and tensions. And sometimes I skip some scenes in the drama (especially when the higher-ups, people with power and money, speaks)

There's a tiny bit about political talks in the middle of the series. It's understandable because it's for the sake of the story. Though, it still bore me :'D


- {2. The Acting} -
It should've been Unlimited/10.

More than perfect. Even I didn't know that Choi Seung Eun as Yoo Jae Yi is a rookie actress! This is her first drama, yet she's so good!

Yeo Jin Goo is one of the greatest young actors. I really appreciate him. His way of conveying his character is very fluid. When he looks angry and desperate, we empathize with him as if we all feel the despair he feels.

And for more, he can tell us what he thinks without a word. The character cannot be matched with other actors but him. And honestly, at first, I originally watched this drama because of him. Thank you, Yeo Jin Goo, for introducing me to this spectacular drama!

Then there's Shin Ha Kyun. If he doesn't get any reward from Baeksang or Daesang in acting, I will be really devastated. The delivery of his emotions is very extreme, and every inch of his body speaks. I instantly felt scared when I saw him. And annoying too when the character is irritating at that time.

His intonation is unique, and even his sweet smile and laugh can look absolutely terrifying. But his sadness is his ace card for me. I suddenly felt concerned when I saw him crying. As it's so miserable that I want to embrace his character who has been soaked by suffering. I fell in love with Shin Ha Kyun's acting now.

Last but not least, the other support characters are so terrific (Choi Dae Hoon omg u have all my respects!). Even the cameo that only shows up in one scene can make me angry. Thus, the conclusion is, don't underestimate the supporting actors too! They deserve to be the main leads as time goes.


- {3. Music} -
Very beautiful, incredible, and spectacular. The Night is my favourite song in this series. A mixture of blues, jazz, and noir kind of music? Why not! It fits perfectly with the drama.

And the background music, *chef kiss* It's delicious and so unique!

In every scene in the drama, I feel goosebumps. The BGM emphasizes the intense atmosphere. Like, when something big will happen, it's so thrilling! It makes me want to rewatch the scene all over again.

I also believe one thing. Maybe if you heard the BGM after finished the drama, you would automatically reminisce saying, ""Ah, The Manyang Town."" like an old man.

So great, even one of the BGM song (10 Fingers Memory) has been my alarm sound to start the day.


- {4. Is it rewatchable?} -
Obviously! I'm sure most of us will rewatch it even though it's just for the scenes they like.

Not only from some impressive scenes with good acting and cinematography, but I might also even rewatch it from the beginning without skipping. (because at first I usually pass the boring part, but now I regretted it).

I wish I could watch it again with zero memories.


LAST WORDS
Again, this story is not for everyone.

Maybe some people prefer the drama to be a lot of action-thrillers between life and death. Or maybe not watching this drama because of the lack of romance (though there's bromance with such intimate interactions).

10/10 I recommend this to people who like dramas with heavy stories, lots of thoughts, and focus more on how good the actors' acting is than watching it because of how good-looking the actors are.

But for those of you who want to try it, I'm sure it's worth it as long as you don't watch it patchy!

Thank you for joining my TEDtalk :D

It exceed my expectation
I don’t have to habit of rating drama but I think this one needs to get the recognization. It has a great story, outstanding acting from every single actors, music are on point, the cinematic is just really pleasing and smart. Maybe it’s a bit slow at the first 4 eps but after ep 5 everything went quick and intense. The writer got me “wow” at the end of every single ep. Tbh, that’s awesome timing. Shin Hakyun and Yeo Jin Goo performance is ace. The chemistry is overflowing, expression on their faces are so on point. The supporting actors did well too. The ending is the most satisfied ending I have not seen from kdrama for a while. I got teary eyes and it’s not predictable as well as boring. The script is solid from the beginning till the end. Must watch!

I was a nice drama. But the plot wasn't really fresh and a bit predictable. This story is common in crime thriller dramas in SK (I cannot tell more because it's a major spoiler). And I was bored a biiiit. The second thing that was a bit unsettling is Ha Jun Won's character. I didn't understood his motives. Why he did alll these? Why he is so obssesed with this case? They never explained it. For the other part, Lee Dong Sik or Park Jung Je's characters was really well written with great depth.

The good thing, the really amazing acting from the whole cast. Everyone was really great, especially Shin Ha Kyun (he gave me the chills sometimes. )

WHAT THE HECK!!! THIS IS PERFECT!!!
Look, this drama was basically everything i like all in one package, in other words, it left me in a emotional mess when it ended. I started watching it on a whim and IT WAS PERFECT! I can't stress how good everyone's acting was, pls the two leads deserve awards for this or ima throw hands. The osts were SO beautiful, i downloaded many of them nd been listening on repeat, it really blended well with the scenes, making them super full of suspense nd excitement. Episode 7 felt like almost last episode material in how hyped it was nd from episode 7 onwards, i had no idea how but it kept getting better and better and the last episode was the pinnacle of perfection. This drama was confusing, exciting, thrilling, sad and heartwarming all at the same time. I kept on guessing coz everyone looked suspicious nd then each reveal, till the very last episode had me screaming 'omggg thats itttt holy shittt'. AND the relationship between the leads was just so adorable ;-; im weak to this kinda relationships, i love them so much. This drama showed how small, seemingly insignificant mistakes nd error in judgement can have devastating consequences and attempts at hiding it can pile up nd go on to ruin ur life nd also that of those around u. Throughout the 16 episodes i felt like i had also become one of the manyang residents nd im missing them like crazy now TT gotta rewatch.

Balancing Everything
Development has been long delayed in Munju located in the western part of the Gyeonggi Province due to blood-curdling incidents of the past; it is here the story of Beyond Evil has been set and the inhabitants have been close-knit community. Lee Dong Shik, once a victim to these incidents now works as sergeant at Manyang police substation of Munju police station. Despite his ""crazy"" work style, he is one of the well trusted persons of the community. Enters Han Joo Won, an elite officer, transferred as inspector who is diametrically opposite to LDS in character and work style. Upon his arrival, multiple events occur, people go missing, bodies are found, reminiscent of the past and reopening the scars of Munju.

HJW struggles with fitting in the community and workplace; some are hostile, some allege him to stop ""acting up"" and some make him accept their ways of doing things. This is a well-thought-out imagery as the viewer is also similarly taken through multitude of events and fitting into this drama feels a bit struggling. The reason for this being one might wonder what events to be taken seriously and what not; In retrospection, every minor event contributes to the big picture. It is truly mind-blowing to note how some random events tell something about the character and their way of thoughts, actions and reactions.

It is just fascinating that Beyond Evil has the perfect balance of smartly crafted characters and wittingly woven story which keeps the viewer on the edge of ""What Next?"" It is even more fascinating that ""theme of two"" contrasting and sometimes similar elements are constantly shown throughout the show, two contrasting characters -LDS and HJW- and their principles, their work styles, their past and present, their parental figures, their best friends, and much more; and how all these aspects contrive the story more complex and enticing to watch.

HJW X LDS: One is an elite who studied at the police academy and another is recruited by the local police station. One is stickler for following rules, principles and another gets work done by any means. One is calm externally but internally in chaos and one seems emotionally hyper but perfectly rational in mind. One makes elaborate plans and one makes plans on the go. One is affected by the scars inflicted by his parents and one has ill-fatedly affected and without intent, inflicted wounds on others.

At outset, these two bicker, banter, hector and coerce suspecting one another. This might induce either the viewer to laugh at the over-the-top actions of both or to pick a side. Honestly, both are sometimes right and wrong, they too realize their fallacies. Consequently, they finally come together for the common goal to know the real truth. This partnership takes a while to happen unlike mentioned in the summary but totally worth the wait. Their tongue-in-cheek work chemistry is hilarious to watch.

Not everything comes easy. At the cusp of rebooting of the development projects, the recent proceedings unleash the protective nature of the biggies. Do Hae Won, a congresswoman and aspiring mayor, and Lee Chang Jin, a hitman turned businessman, of the Munju who would go to any ends. Is it simply about money or genuine care for social development, one wonders? Along with them, is Han Ki Hwan, next police commissioner general of the country and father of HJW, who has ""perfected"" his life for this position of power and least afford to err. These characters stealthily direct the happenings to their advantage and hinder the police investigations. Aside from them, are many minor and well-defined characters, who pull and push the events of the Munju city.

Beyond Evil is well-paced story starts with a shower of events and slows down to give viewers half-time. This interval both serves as point to reorganize the thoughts and gives more team-bonding moments for the characters. Similar to how inhabitants warm up to HJW, metaphorically the viewers too warm up to the drama. Followed by, its pace quickens. In turn, BE gives a perfect and unpredictable closure to the story and characters provided that viewers too proactively catch up with its pace by observing and interpolating the events. At this juncture, the temptation to rewatch is high.

Shin Ha Kyun X Yeo Jin Goo: SHK's portrayal of LDS is on point and his countenance defines the idiosyncrasies of the character and deepens the character's appeal. Sometimes, it is hypnotizing to drown into fathomless depths of the character. Meanwhile, YJG's portrayal of HJW conceives the character's rigidity, and exudes cold-nature outlook. His expressions look like he is the naivest person but in reality, he is quite the opposite.

Other actors have made the characters stand out. Kang Min Ah's Kang Min Jung comes as the carefree hip person and parallelly manages to draw out our empathy. Chun Ho Jin's Nam Sang Bae treads the fine line making one wonder, if he is good or bad. Choi Dae Hoon's Park Jung Je makes us believe in his dreams, drawings and delusions. Every actor and their character have made fabulous job. Individually appreciating them would spoil the moment for future viewers.

The music is really good. It heightens the viewer's thrill, draws out empathy, and makes the experience more real and sometimes, surreal. Songs like Timeless, The Road, Empty makes the viewers feel virtually the inhabitants of Munju and invest ourselves in its predicaments. We too want the justice to serve in best possible way and closure to be given to the victims. The music makes final message resonate louder; the message being ""any clue or info regarding missing person should be reported to police how so ever infinitesimal."" The message creates awareness, feels affirmative and assuring.

Undeniably, Beyond Evil has best of everything.

Beyond Expectations
To start off this review with anything other than honesty would be a disservice to this drama - at first,I had no intentions of watching ""Beyond Evil"",despite being a huge fan of mysteries and true crime.But that all changed with the few shots of the first episode.

Again,I like to begin this review by listing the positives first,as I strongly believe it takes a lot to write,direct and film any drama,whether good or bad.That goes for movies,shows and almost every form of media.It`s hard.But,with that being said,I finished this drama feeling bittersweet,since I was saying goodbye to characters I really connected with and cared for.

What this drama does right,off the bat,is setting the atmosphere and mood reminiscent of old noir fiction,right down to our main characters and their characteristics.Paying homage almost,to one of my favorite faucets of crime fiction with morally ambiguous protagonists is a huge plus in my books.Even by the end of this drama,it was cemented in my mind that all characters meant to be on the good side,still DID one or more questionable things.Simultaneously all characters meant to be on the wrong side still DID one or more positive things.Because humans are like that.So what happens when we are faced with the consequences of our own actions?

True highlights of this show are Shin Ha-kyun as Dong Sik and Lee Gyu-Hoe as Kang Jin-Mook.They just are.As much as I was a big fan of excellent bromance between Dong Sik and Han Ju Won(played by seasoned actor Yeo Jin-Goo),there were a handful of times when the latter wasn`t as convincing as I wanted him to be,so that`s the only reason why I`m not naming BOTH principal actors as creams of the crop.That said,all actors across the board did an amazing job.Still,these two are my favorites.I was amazed at the fact that I could tell by his smile when Dong Sik was truly jubilant and when he was playing a part,despite it being the same smile in almost every way visually. It was a rush and a pleasure getting to watch such an outstanding performance.Even the way his character was written kept me on my toes and it`s so seldom I see character`s motivations displayed without any holes or contradictions in drama world. I can`t shower him with praises enough and can`t wait to see what else he does in the future.On the other hand,Kang Jin-Mook was slimy,underhanded,calculated and the complete opposite,yet he kept me invested.And that`s something,considering I knew about the twist before starting this drama.And that`s another fact:I absolutely LOVED how this case had layers to it and how it wasn`t just one person carrying the brunt of the whole act.Because in that sense,it`s so much more realistic.Not everything about this show works in terms of crime building,but this does to almost every extent. And I also liked all employees of Munju Police Station,especially Oh Ji-Hwa and Nam Sang-Bae.I actually shed a few tears during his death,but I was,in the same way,pleased with how everyone chose to honor his legacy.Through clever character placement and world building,it wasn`t hard seeing how and why all these characters cared about each other,despite their poor decision making.It was a complete,yet broken family whose members might all have something against each other,but when push comes to shove,they`re there to defend their own.And it was beautiful. Not to be forgotten,Heo Sung-Tae`s acting in this(as flamboyant and short fused Lee Chang-Jin)was exceptional and I was genuinely pleased they didn`t kill him off.Man`s clumsy,but he really won me over.

I liked the uncertainty of pinpointing character`s motivations.It was fun trying to put all these pieces together,along with our `heroes`.The OST was a masterpiece in its own right and,as I`m listening to it,not only is it different,but I note influences from shows like ""Jessica Jones"" and ""Daredevil"" weirdly enough.And I love every second of it.It`s understatedly powerful and poignant in more ways than one.

Set designs also range from good to amazing,with managing to evoke that silently dangerous charm of villages and counties.I hadn`t seen anyone commenting on it so I had to mention it regardless.

And now we have to get a bit nitpicky.And mention the shortcomings of this drama,which aren`t plenty,but are a bit more glaring when they`re placed against all these positives.And now,I fancy myself as John Wolfe of dramas(if you don`t know about him,check out his YT channel,he`s great)in that we both have to catch some inconsistencies and/or issues,even when no one else clocks them.And in this case,it`s the final few stages of case building,coupled with some smaller plot holes or deus ex machinas,if you will.I have to admit,I really wasn`t a fan of what ended up happening to Dong Sik`s sister in the end.And I was vocal about it whilst watching the show.It was just a very roundabout and clumsy way of including everyone(namely Han Ju Won`s father) in this crime scene.It was cluttered and considering the rest of this awesome drama, lackluster.It should`ve been sat on more in the writing room.Basically,the victim stumbled across a killing after a small fight with her boyfriend(Dong Sik`s best friend),had her fingers chopped off,in Jin-Mook`s signature style,managed to escape,only to be hit once and then again,after Chang-Jin couldn`t be bothered to be a real gangster and do his job.After this,she was snatched away by Jin-Mook and shoved in the wall of Dong Sik`s house.That last part was done great and the realization of your dead sister being near you all these years was also top-notch.Anything related to Jin-Mook`s part of the case I had no issue with.But they were really pushing it with involving everyone else in this one instance.Not only that,but they managed to create a big plot hole in the process.Yung-Je mentioned that he hit a deer and we are shown a shot of him hitting the victim while she was standing up.This is from his perspective,mind you.He later states that he hit her while she was laying down,which was the way they managed to crack the case.However,this understanding then negates all Yung-Je`s deer drawings as he was reminded of deers whilst looking into her eyes before hitting her.Another thing I wasn`t really a fan of is how Chang-Jin was called to the scene to clean it up TWICE,where he was just walking to and back from the road...it was a mess,that whole creative decision.Another character I wasn`t really sold on in terms of criminal acts tied to this case was Ju Won`s father.I didn`t really care about him outside the relationship with his son.And this is a small nitpick but,since the whole case swept up police stations basically,we see not one case outside of it.I can understand for Munju,as it`s a small substation and not much happens.But outside of it,I`m not so sure.

Overall,""Beyond Evil"" is a gem in its genre,and even outside of it.Despite some bumps in the road(no pun intended) it`s by far the best crime drama I`ve seen so far.And I`m so glad I was given the opportunity to experience it in full. I`d recommend it to anyone except hardcore romance watchers(if they have such expectations going in). It`s a drama that deserves more hype and deserves every bit of praise and mention coming its way.

ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I'VE SEEN TILL DATE IN MY LIFE
WOW where do I even start with this masterpiece of a show? It isn't even a show, it's an EXPERIENCE, it's goddamn cinematic poetry, it's an absolute DELIGHT in every way, and I'm going to try my best to describe exactly why. The acting, the story, the build-up, the chemistry, the MUSIC, the cinematography, everything was AMAZING.

But the main reason was the SIZZLING and intense and VISCERAL chemistry of the two main leads.
Lee Dong Shik and Han Ju Won, two names I'm likely to never forget as I desperately search for fanfiction and You Tube edits of this pair, because the reality is, I can't let this duo go just yet.

They were always colluding behind everyone's back while pretending that they hate each other, making FERVENT declarations to each other when they're alone, that NEVER ENDING eye contact, HJW willingly touching LDS whenever he gets the chance and even seeking out to be close to LDS physically and emotionally, being truthful only in front of each other, seeing each other at their weakest points, a ready-to-die-for-you attitude, two sides of the same coin, promising each other to be safe, ready to sacrifice their life to right a wrong in the other person's life, a strong sense of trust, pride, belonging and understanding...and where do I even BEGIN with that last 10 minutes T-T

SO MANY TIMES throughout the show, I replayed their 'moments' and observed each and every single expression, every single detail of their interactions, simply because I wanted to keep them in my memory because of how much satisfaction it gave me.

SATISFYING is the best way to put it, because after every revelation, after every reveal, every breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL and haunting soundtrack behind each new discovery, I was completely taken with this couple and their flow of the story, and even though it's supposed to be a slow burn classic thriller, it kept me on the edge of my seat, but I still saw and absorbed each and every single character's tale. The two leads have such an intense push-pull development and their characters compliment each other TOO well.

Despite of the lead couple's stellar chemistry and connection, it is truly remarkable how the other characters also manage to carve out their space in the audience's mind, each character displayed a uniqueness which makes them all memorable in my eyes, and the emotional and psychological trauma was portrayed BRILLIANTLY by each and every single one of them. The baddies were all a delight to watch as well, although the initial 'killer' gave me creeps like never before.

TLDR; WATCH THIS SHOW ASAP AND THEN THANK ME.

All he wants is to resolve his deep sorrow!
I was waiting for this drama since they announced it, and I wasn't disappointed! In FACT, It became one of my all time favorite drama ever. It's such a spectacular 'humane drama', narrated as a mind-blowing psychological thriller!

Psychological Thrillers are always a treat to those who love suspense and making things out in your mind before stuff happen on screen! To top that with a heart-wrenching emotional ride isn't the most common stuff coming out these days, so I urge you please, DON'T miss THIS ONE!!!Without further ado, let's get to the actual review,

STORY: It's sublime and well refined with a DARK STORY-LINE. The main character (Dong Shik) who is a demoted detective, is suspected of killing his own sister, and the others on his team aren't totally innocent. The drama unfolds when a frightening murder happens which resembles ones happening in the span of 20 years to the past! And the young detective from Seoul vows to catch ""Dong Shik"" for he thinks it must be his doing and he must be the culprit of the serial murder case!

Acting/Characters: Lee Do Hyun gave an outstanding [tho very short] performance as the young Dong Shik.

Shin Ha Kyun's acting is stellar! Once again beyond words! His voice is so fitting, calming and apologetic, as if he have done the world wrong! Yet his laugh is so creepy, it's quite a thrill to look at him smirking. Jin Goo's character is usually cold and unwavering... yet with is amazing acting, he manages to make way into anyone's heart early in the drama!
All the rest of the cast are doing immensely great job, with their acting naturally flowing in, very realistic and never feel forced!
Special thanks to the lovely rookie actress, Choi Sung Eun as ""Yoo Jae Yi"", I can't possibly think of a better acting for her character! Not even if done by one with far more experience!

Much respect for the amazing portrayal of ""Park Jeong Jae"" by Choi Dae Hoon he really brought out raw feelings with his marvelous portrayal of a mentally unstable officer who has been living with so much guilt ever!

Music: The score is DRAMATIC, SUSPENSEFUL and very pleasant to listen to. The main theme grabbed my attention from the opening scene, with the beautiful blend of the violin and the percussion. and as for the songs. The song ""THAT NIGHT"" is the PERFECT music to give anyone chills watching this PERFECT DRAMA! It feels like a sorrowful man's screams and says letting out his long held grudges to be heard by someone in a corner... An absolute classic masterpiece that deserves best music awards for the year! I love the background musics, 'Who is the monster' 'Dong Shik Knows' 'Beyond Evil Opening Title' were absolutely beautiful! And I was getting goosebumps anytime I heard the first few seconds of 'Empty' & 'The Night' in the episode's ending minute!
Rest of the songs are all amazing, The beautiful and sad composition called ""The Road"" by Sunwoo Jung A is my favorite to listen to again when I miss the drama, especially if I miss Dong Shik and Ju Won's moments together!

LAST WORDS:
This drama is GREATNESS beyond WORDS! and I'm quite bad with crafty expressions, so all I can do, to give this drama justice, is ask you to start watching the first episode RIGHT AWAY, and don't let anything get your attention till you're done with the first! The rest will be history, as a matter of fact, you won't be able to stop watching! Guaranteed!

**Unless you're the type who can't stand very dark and regretful stories!**

A MUST WATCH! If you're looking for a DEEP and FASCINATING HUMANE STORY.

Brilliant acting, but goes around in circles
I started watching this series due to all the hype and awards. It's a psychological thriller (not a mystery) so you do need patience and the willingness to understand the motives, behaviour patterns and relationship connections for all the characters. It's a very intricately woven story, with a lot of nuance and some phenomenal acting from all the cast members.

However, I found the pace inconsitent from episode to episode, and it was annoying to have a lot of the story told with flashbacks ranging from months to years to days to hours! It also had a gimmicky approach towards some of the characters, making you suspect this character and the other character quite randomly, and then the story heading in a completely different direction. They could have done without these gimmicks.

Overall, it's a good, though slow, watch and worth it purely for the performances of all the cast members.

beyond evil? it's more like beyond standards.
First of all, it blows my mind how good this drama is.
If you like thriller, mystery or suspense series you must know how difficult it is to find a good story that keeps you excited until the end: there's a lot of things that the screenwriter needs to be aware of and a lot of plot lines that needs to be added in the main plot so the watcher keeps on wanting and wanting the next episode.
Beyond Evil is one of the few dramas that this happens: I felt like I was losing brain cells every time I watched an episode because all the story kept my brain working so hard to find out what was happening. I swear it was such an incredible experience because the plot kept on twisting at the right place and at the right time. *sighs* The screenwriter did such an amazing job because the plot opens in a perfect rhythm and the development of the character is SOOOOO damn good -- I know it's also hard to find a suspense drama where the main character doesn't get lost in his own personality, but you won't get disappointed in Beyond Evil; all the characters development is 100% perfect. *chef's kiss*

And not only the great story, you also have the ACTING! I'm a huge fan of Yeo Jin Goo and seeing him as Han Joo Won was just another proof that he is an amazing actor. His acting! I can't stop thinking about it and his characters is also so great, his development towards the series was exactly what I was hoping for. And it hurt so much to watch the last episode knowing I wouldn't have anymore of this.
I usually don't feel this way if suspense dramas. I don't think I ever get attached to a suspense drama before, but Beyond Evil is just that good. You grow attached. You hope that the character you like won't be a killer because you wouldn't support the pain, you get hurt when they're hurt and you want to get revenge in them behalf.
I'm so grateful for the screenwriter and for whoever choose these actors. They did an incredible job. Their acting was always on point. 10/10.

Basically, yeah. Beyond Evil was *sobs* I don't even can't find the words to describe it. It really raise the standards I have for this kind of plots and I honestly hope we'll see more of the director and screenwriter duo in the future.

This is one of those series where every word & every action carries weight
Beyond Evil is a 2021 psychological thriller drama starring Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo as the leads. In summary, the story revolves around two fearless detectives in the police force working together (somewhat) to track down and identify a serial killer from 20 years ago. However, as they dig further, new evidence starts to emerge, suggesting that there might be more that one killer and that, the killer is amongst them. Hence, no one is to be trusted, not even themselves.

This show started off as rather slow and slightly boring (for me) only to become my absolute favourite after EP 5. I guess what truly made this show stand out when compared to other thriller and psychological dramas out there is that it is quite unique in the sense, it is neither cliché nor lacking in originality. Instead, it is quite captivating and addictive to the point where it makes viewers curious, as to what would happen next or who the ‘actual killer’ is. Throughout the series, I found myself quite immersed into finding the actual killer by looking for hidden clues and focusing on facial expressions and just when I was absolutely certain about the killer, the show introduced new suspects leading us in a completely different direction. So, I guess, ‘Beyond Evil’ really does surprise its viewers with unexpected twists and turns without recycling certain plot devices.

Aside from the storyline, another aspect this show does extremely well in is – Casting. Whoever decided on the cast deserves a bonus. Both Yeo Jin Goo and Shin Ha Kyun are brilliant actors who knew what they were doing; hence, there was not a single clunker throughout the drama. Lastly, the soundtrack for this series including the background music is one of the best I’ve heard in a long time. If the sound makers ever decide to release a CD featuring all the song, I’ll definitely buy it.

And finally, to those wondering whether to check this show out or not, do check it out. I’m absolutely certain you’ll love it and make sure, you stick around till EP 5 (if you find the start a little dry, like me).

Amazing
When I saw the poster and trailer, my expectation was very low but that all changed when I watched episode 1!!! I very liked it because the acting was amazing and also the story was beyond amazing. The actors did incredible job and the casting director did such a good job choosing them.

One of my favorite kdrama that I thought would never go in my favorite list which it did! I definitely recommend this if your looking for a mystery drama.

Ps. This is my second review so I am deeply sorry if this doesn't make sense!

A psychological crime thriller of many layers
Beyond Evil definitely deserves recognition as one of the best dramas depicting psychological crime detective thriller.

With a dark gripping and highly thrilling plot to keep you at the edge of your seat.
the story first starts as a whodunit mystery of a 20 year old case that haunts our protagonist and essentially destroyed his family and life. and the story is written in a way that makes you doubt each character, if not for being the criminal, but for harboring evil and hiding a dark side in one way or the other. The first couple of episodes were a bit slow paced but serve a very important role in setting the stage, introducing the characters and the background story. The pace then steams up into a rollercoaster, you will be amazed at how each episode brings a new bomb of a revelation that leaves you shocked and intrigued. Starting halfway through the drama, I found myself constantly wondering ""If all of this is revealed now so early on, how will the writer fill the rest of the drama?!"", and each episode just proved me wrong. I will not say that the plot never loses steam, but let's just say that this drama left me feeling like peeling an onion. You think you've uncovered the truth, only to discover that you've only just hit the surface and a lot more is yet to unravel.

The story itself had many aspects which were all well balanced and perfectly written, it portrayed deep sorrow and hope, psychological pain and strength of character, vengeance and trust, frienship and enemosity. And the smart script, marvelous cinematography and direction helped bring out such a story in a gripping and truthful way (the story takes place in an undeveloped rural area, and I appreciated how the lighting especially in dark scenes was kept to a minimun to convey both the natural and mental feeling of darkness)

Above all the acting was one of the strongest points to the drama, thanks to solid performances by the two male leads, and their friends from the police force. In particular Shin Ha Kyun delievered a stellar almost-flawless performance, his acting was perfect shifting seamlessly from sad to mysterious to crazy to scary to evil to cute. He at times showed how broken and unstable he was, other times he was strong with a unwaveringsebse of justice, he was vengeful and other times forgiving. He had the best smile to send shivers down someone's spine. His acting alone could have carried the whole drama, but our second lead Yeo Jin Goo also delivered a very strong and believable performance that helped the viewer care for the two male leads' dinamic and how their relationship will evolve.

The music was very good with a lot of great tracks both instrumental and vocal that all fitted the atmosphere of the plot.

This is a strong recommendation to all crime/detective drama fans out there. Do not be fooled or put off by the slow paced plot the first couple if episodes, for you will be soon thrown down a dark pit of mystery and evil.

I never rewatch but this drama made me rewatch EVERY episode while airing!
This drama is an art, a masterpiece! The writing and directing is genius, and the actors are monsters themselves in becoming one with their characters. Beyond Evil is just such a treat to watch!

This is definitely a slow burn, but the type where you can’t even notice how much time has already passed - a lot of the episodes left me feeling pleasantly surprised that an hour had already gone by. It is engaging and enchanting at the same time.

I will always love the buildup in this drama, most of similar style would somehow bore me but the direction here fits the narrative perfectly, I can feel the intensity of each scenes even without much visual stimulus! Just showcase the facial expressions of each characters, and you’ll know you’re in for a ride. It is evident that every detail is placed with very careful calculations, and I must say, the roller coaster ride becomes crazy once episode 5 starts, and it’s showing no signs of stopping so far with 10 episodes in. The writer and director are very effective in showing multidimensional characters and that adds so much more depth to the story. The way this drama portrays their “humanity” sets it apart from other series with similar premises.

This is indeed a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER. The state of the characters when faced with incredulous situations matched with amazing acting makes you marvel at the grays of human choices and its inevitable outcome. We are already at episode 10 but I still can’t grasp where this story is heading...and I would gladly follow it blindfolded!

Definitely a must watch!

Beyond Great
This drama is it! This is what you are looking for if you want a good story, acting, and keeping you on edge every episode to find out what really happened.

Justice was served to the viewers who invested time watching this masterpiece. There is nothing major I would say needs improving but sometimes the viewer can get a bit confused on what's happening but don't be overwhelmed by that and all the information provided to you because if there's something you don't understand, rewatch the scene and it also could be that the scene will be better explained in later scenes so maybe that was the intention. That's the fun part of the drama; to keep guessing.

Give this drama a go. All actors portrayed their character's beautifully and the storyline was great too. I liked the partnership of the main lead detectives and it was amazing to watch a drama that was not giving me an obvious suspect because the people of Manyang were all suspicious to me eventually.

The ending was portrayed beautifully. It had such a great closure. 11/10 ..yes 11 stars.

Amazing series! A must watch!
This series is truly breathtaking and keeps you in the edge throughout the whole run.

Every actor in this series have delivered in the most impeccable manner and no one falls short in delivering. Yet, a special shout-out to the two main actors (Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo) must be given for their baeksang worthy performance. The bromance are intricately developed and I like how their relationship develop throughout the series.

I truly love this series because there are no unnecessary romance or any unnecessary theme, and the darkness in the story is carried out without being cheap or silly.

It drags during the first episode but after that it has been nothing but a gift that keeps on giving. I will definitely rewatch this series, and as much as I'm wishing for another sequel, the series has given us a truly satisfying ending.

This review may contain spoilers
A raw and outstanding depiction of characters drenched in their pain
!! This review contains some spoilers (nothing too specific though) !!

Rating this drama with the highest mark and calling it a masterpiece would make me sound like I’m overreacting, wouldn’t it? I gave this drama the highest mark not because it’s perfect – other reviewers pointed out some of its flaws although what makes a drama perfect and worth the highest rating is something over which not everyone agrees – but because it was truly outstanding. I wish I could write a close reading on every character and the way each actor/actress portrayed them… That’s how strong and phenomenal the acting was. Each character shone in their own way which made them all relevant to the story, no matter how “minor” they were. Obviously, I was amazed by the two main actors’ acting but they weren’t the only ones who left a strong impression on me. Choi Dae Hoon’s acting was beautifully heart-breaking. I feel like the key element of his performance was his voice: the way it cracks, weakens, quivers… I’m glad he was nominated for best supporting actor at this year’s Baeksang Arts Award. Also, Choi Sung Eun, given how few acting experiences she has, was remarkable! I’m looking forward to seeing her in other dramas/movies.

Now allow me to praise Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo’s acting. I wasn’t familiar with any of them. I had heard of the latter but I had never watched any of their dramas (if anyone wants to recommend me their favourite dramas/movies featuring either of them, please feel free to do so ^^). As a consequence, I can’t compare their performances with any of their previous works’ but I don’t think it really matters… They were simply amazing.
Dong Shik and Joo Won’s dynamic, the way their relationship develops as the story progresses, it was so well-written! As I see it, what makes this drama worth watching is – among other things – the complexity of the characters and their developments. Kim Soo Jin, the screenwriter, did a tremendous job with the screenplay. The plot got me hooked as early as the first episode and not a single one that followed bored me. I couldn’t wait to see what would happen next although I did not binge watch this drama since I didn’t want to finish it too quickly. This is the kind of drama that should be savoured.

Anyway, back to Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo’s acting.
What moved me the most about Yeo Jin Goo’s character, Han Joo Won, is how his composure is gradually shaken up and how it eventually breaks – the result of which is the breath-taking scene which happened in episode 16. I loved how expressive his eyes – and frowns – were, how Yeo Jin Goo uses his hands to convey whatever his character feels, how his lips trembled as anger, sadness and/or frustration descended on him, the way he conveyed his frustration whenever Lee Dong Shik saw right through him and outsmart him etc...
Shin Ha Kyun is… something else really… It’s hard to put into words what I felt while watching his portrayal of Lee Dong Shik. His micro expressions are everything; I’ll develop this point a little further on alongside with my thoughts on the OST. The way Lee Dong Shik lets his arms dangle along his body, his hunched back, the way he folds in on himself as if the weight he has been carrying on his own for 21 years is physically crushing him, his controlled, watchful and careful gaze… His eyes but also his whole body speak VOLUMES! To be honest I could write on and on about Lee Dong Shik but I’ll just end this review with a specific point I’d like to address.

Although I didn’t fall in love with the OST right away, I was certainly in love with it by the end of the drama. Every song just fits so well each scene in which it is played… Aww it will move you to the verge of tears.
I was not a fan of the song “10 fingers memory” at first – because it seemed to me that whenever it was played it broke the dramatic tension and the seriousness of the scene – however I learnt to appreciate and acknowledge its importance as the story progressed. This song is just so well-thought. It succeeded at capturing Lee Dong Shik’s raw and complex emotions in only 1:14 minutes. As I see it, this song is the very embodiment of Lee Dong Shik’s smile and laugh and, more precisely, the emotions they hold in. It’s stunningly painful to listen to. It’s as if you could hear his laugh, as if every note mimicked and echoed his every peal of laughter. Truly outstanding.

I think I can safely say that Lee Dong Shik’s smile has left a strong impression not only on the characters – such as Han Joo Won – but on the viewers themselves. Lee Dong Shik is used to being referred to as the “nut case” of the town and so he knows very well that his smile is perceived as yet another mark of his so-called craziness. But his craziness isn’t sheer craziness if not the consequence of everything he had to bear alone for the past 21 years. The song “10 fingers memory” is usually played whenever a twist occurs. It really emphasises the hopelessness that Lee Dong Shik may have felt whenever the situation got even more ridiculous than it already was because of how never-ending and unsolvable it appeared to be.
I never saw him as someone crazy. His smile was heart-wrenching to watch because it never missed to reveal what he truly felt – that’s why the smile he gave Han Joo Won at the end was so beautiful and heart-warming because it was a smile that expressed a state of peacefulness. His smile displays his distress in such a genuine and raw way, showing us that he is a character shattered by pain, anger and helplessness… It’s one of the saddest smiles I’ve ever seen. Those emotions and the way they mingle together are what prevents him for being rational and careful at all times (hence people thinking he is crazy). This song highlights all of those emotions. “10 fingers memory” is the song of Lee Dong Shik’s pain and, paradoxically, the somewhat “comical” feels you may get from it makes you ache for Shin Ha Kyun’s character even more than you already were.
This song gives me mixed feelings and I think it’s in keeping with Lee Dong Shik’s complex personality.

I’ll end this review here. This review was more about me wanting to express the feelings I have for this beautiful drama than a proper review but I hope that, after reading it, you might consider watching it if you haven’t yet.

Thank you for taking the time to read this review till the end!

It was okay/-
The acting was really good and yeo Jin goo looks soooo gooood he was dressed in all black the entire time he was always cold and cool which I loved. His voice is soo sexy.
The other actor his acting was really good and they both made such a good pair.
This drama was not mind blowing and it was not bad either it was somewhere in btwn good and bad it’s an ‘okay’ drama bcuz the title, poster and trailer was soo cool so
I expected a lot.
The story was very easy to guess and nothing was like ‘woahhhhhhh’ everything was like ‘hmmm mehhh’.
They were keeping a lot of secrets and dragging the ep which was really boring and frustrating to watch.

It was mysterious but in a boring way and nothing gave me chills or butterflies and I was not eager to watch the next ep either I just wanted to watch it to see how they trap the bad ppl.
The first 5 ep was sooo boring and from the 6th ep onwards it started to be interesting and I was just watching it for yeo Jin goo.
at first he was making me feel soo frustrated bcuz his role was smart, arrogant, rich and passionate but he was not living up to it he was smart in the book way and he was not smart in a sly way and I was getting soo annoyed bcuz he was just standing there telling the book stuff and the other dude was making a fool out of him but later he picks up all the dirty tricks and does cool stuff.
The butcher shop girl looks soo pretty.
This drama was a nice watch.

A tale of twisted characters.
I am honestly in awe how refreshing and gripping Beyond Evil was - even taking into consideration how, at times, it follows rather well known scenarios and clichés. The key to its success lies in the versatile characters and dynamic relationships between them.

The plot gives us the same old story of a serial killer on the loose, detective with personal stakes and bits of political scheming surrounding it. Does not sound that groundbreaking, does it? Thanks to the complex, amazingly written and dynamic characters, we get to know, the story is as not simple as we might have initially thought.

Each character has their own story, secrets and goals. There are no noble good guys, but we do get a lot of amazingly gray characters and a variety of villains, each of them having a unique reasoning behind their actions and wrongdoings. Slowly we gather more puzzle pieces that form a complex picture that goes beyond the actions of just one person. I am truly incapable of describing how perfect was the set of characters in this show. They were all so unique and intriguing, I could literally watch them just talk to each other, and it would be entertaining.

That said, the explanation of the big mystery felt flat. With how amazingly the tension was building, how we could not predict which of the characters were involved - the answers just didn’t do it for me. For some aspect, I just didn’t get any explanation. To avoid spoiling the show, more about it in the comment under the review :)

As for the acting, Shin Ha Kyun went beyond what’s humanly possible in delivering us the compelling character - Lee Dong Shik. There are not enough positive adjectives in the dictionary to truly describe this performance - he was simply talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before… you know what’s up. The acting gave me the best type of goosebumps - some scenes were worth rewatching countless times.

What’s more, I genuinely believe this is the best performance we have seen from Yeo Jin Goo. Just the fact he was able to keep up with Shin Ha Kyun and his performance did not feel flat at all, but rather I saw it as gripping and convincing, means a lot.

From all the main and supporting actors, I did have a small beef with Son Sang Gyu in episode 11 and 12 - the acting was just not right. It was too much going on for my liking. Taking into consideration this was his first role, and he was surrounded by quite experienced actors, I am not mad about the end result and I am willing to let it slide.

The production value was a pure perfection. Not one frame felt off, not one detail has been out of place. From camera work, to editing, up to soundtrack - everything crafted in a way to elevate the story to an artistic level. With no hint of exaggeration, Beyond Evil has one of the best soundtracks in the history of kdramas. Choi Baek Ho’s “The Night” is simply a masterpiece.

Overall: It’s a characters and relationships driven drama, with the plot serving as the background for us to understand and enjoy the ever changing dynamics between them. Beyond Evil might not seem as a masterpiece for people preferring fast paced show, that said, with how gripping and fascinating the characters and performances are, I would highly recommend everyone to at least give it a chance.

WORK OF ART!!!!!!
Beyond Evil is an absolute masterpiece. The suspense, the plot, the characters, the setting, everything about this drama is nothing short of a PERFECT MYSTERY THRILLER. Every episode will keep you on the edge of your seat suspecting everyone and no one at the same time. Heck you CANT EVEN TRUST THE MAIN LEADS yet alone the suspicious group of people surrounding them

The underrated thing about this drama is the tension and TSUNDERE BROMANCE the 2 leads have. They are both geniuses and crackheads at the same time. I love how important the supporting characters are to the story and how uniquely different everyone are contrasting one another.

GIVE THIS DRAMA A SHOT AND YOU WILL BE ADDICTED!!!!

Game of suspects
I must say this show was nothing like I expected. I didn’t know what to expect, honestly, but definitely not what I got. ? One thing I will say, though, is that unlike most K-dramas I’ve seen, the show actually started out terrible but got better.

Beyond evil was a perfectly serviceable “whodunit” script. I thought the way they introduced the murder of Dong-sik’s sister was very effective and it immediately set up Dong-sik was the prime suspect. After the time jump, though, it started to suck. The problem is that the writer tried too hard to make everyone seem like a suspect early on. First 5-6 episodes were wasted setting everyone up as crazies but instead of creating suspense and mystery, it only made the characters extremely unlikable and cartoonish. Even after that, the show continued to play cheap tricks and introduced distracting story threads to make the story unnecessarily complicated and confusing. This actually mirrored what two main characters did throughout the show in which they kept playing tricks on other characters to get themselves deeper into the case and find the “whole” truth. By episode 8-9, I started to not believe what’s being said and done because I knew in a few scenes, they would show a completely different version of the story than what they led you to believe. Once you realize the trick, there’s no going back. What’s sigh inducing about it was that the story itself was such a simple one. Just another cliche cover up story involving powerful people. A simple murder case turned out to be much bigger kind of story. You’ve seen this many times. Bad guys might as well have name tags saying “I’m guilty”. Although, there were some twists along the way but by then, the show already burned through too many false twists that I wasn’t moved or shocked. There simply isn’t much going on in this world they created to warrant 16 episodes which seems like a common K-drama problem. Also, I must say that what took place in Han Ki-won’s house at the end was probably the most cringe worthy scene in TV history.

As for two main characters, they went way overboard to fulfill their respective nut job roles. Dong-sik has the crazy laughs and bulging eyes with red eye make-up to go along with it. I’m guessing he was channeling the Joker??? Joo-won, of course, has to be the opposite so, naturally, he has no emotion and social skills. He basically sees suspects everywhere and flat out asks people if they committed the crime!!! It’s hard to go along with any of this because their motivations and backstories were not disclosed early on. I was constantly wondering why they were acting that way and put off by their strange behaviors.

The secondary characters did fairly well. I liked Chang-Jin, Jae-i and Ji-hwa. Chang-jin was a stand out as the former gangster turned CEO/killer/Russian quipping all around entertaining guy. Ji-hwa was great as a childhood friend turned detective who’s basically only calm and settled character in the show. I’m liked Jae-i as the sad deli owner but felt like she disappeared towards he end.

Music in this show was atrocious. What’s the deal with the weird crying/wailing music? Once again, another cheap attempt at creating a creepy, uncertain atmosphere but off putting.

Like I said, it’s not a bad show but it could have benefited by cutting out 5-6 episodes to make the story tighter and not waste viewers’ time with cheap tricks. Viewers are not as dumb as some of these writers seem to think. Just give us good stories and we can figure things out by ourselves. Hopefully, they’ll learn.

The best thriller of the year.
One of the best dramas in the world.
Perfect.
The actors are great actors.
I loved since ep1 i couldnt wait for the next episodes
Love love love
I hate when I am between episodes 6 to 14 of any show. Because I can't wait for the two last episodes, because I know all the waiting, waiting, guessing.... It drives me over the rails!
But when it comes I hate because when is over I will miss, because I may not find anything as good.
I know your feelings.
It was perfect crime thriller, it had everything corruption, serial killers, love, abuse (Park's mother she abuses him, by castrating his maturity), devotion, betraying, spirituality, friendship, good looking people, and showed a lot of Korean culture. Brilliance

Worth Your While!
This drama is not light, funny, or fluffy, even though it had a few amusing scenes for comic relief.
However, if this is your type of genre, then you will love every single moment of this rollercoaster!
SHK did an exceptional job in this drama and really turned me into a fan. His best work yet, in my opinion.
I was a little confused with YJG's character in the beginning because he wasn't contributing to the plot at all, but I now understand why the writers did that. You have to let it marinate before you smoke it!
The acting was amazing, the plot was thick and full of twists, and the OSTs complimented the scenes perfectly.
Nicely done overall, I recommend this 100%!

One of the most stunning tour de forces of acting you will ever see
If you tune into Beyond Evil for no other reason, then do it for Shin Ha-kyun's Baeksang winning performance as small town cop, Lee Dong-sik. Beyond Evil is an excellent, finely-written crime thriller. But even if this isn't your genre, you won't regret watching this acting masterclass unfold.

Accused of the murder of his sister and her friend while still a teenager, Lee Dong-sik has carved out a life for himself as a beat cop in his regional town. As Beyond Evil begins, this backwater is disrupted by the arrival of elite golden boy, Lieutenant Han Joo-won, who's been sent to the small town to avoid a scandal that could impact on the promotion of his high-profile father. Joo-won is convinced that Dong-sik is guilty: not just of the murder of Yoo-yeon and Joo-seon 20 years ago but of other, more recent, killings of illegal immigrants.

Yeo Jin-goo perfectly embodies an entitled member of a ruling class who’s long been led to believe he’s always the smartest person in the room and struggles to know how to act once he makes his first big mistake. And in any other drama, his performance would be considered exceptional. Unfortunately he's acting next to Shin Ha-kyun whose portrayal of this damaged and sometimes unhinged man is one of the most extraordinary I've ever seen.

There’s an air of Twin Peaks small town gothic to Beyond Evil; a sense of a facade of small town life hiding a darkness the denizens either ignore or deliberately plaster over in the name of community solidarity. And with the body parts piling up, it’s time for all those secrets to be dredged up too.

Beyond Evil is the whole package: the writing, acting, themes, music, production values are all top notch. But while it doesn't quite rival the true masterpieces in this genre - Forest of Secrets/Stranger for example - it is still worth every award it won this year. And Shin Ha-kyun has proven himself to be one of the best actors of his generation. And not just in Korea but anywhere.

The plot of Beyond Evil is well twisted, and a new intrigue is revealed behind each denouement. But at the same time, already in the first episodes, I felt that Beyond Evil could be more than just a good detective. And I was not wrong.

From the very first episodes, we plunge into the drama, like into a fabulous whirlpool. We get to know the life of a provincial town. We watch Lee Dong Sik intently, trying to figure out what is behind his extravagant behavior. Shin Ha Kyun in this role masterfully balances on the border of light and shadow, sober calculation and madness. In the meantime, we are wondering who he is - a ""fallen angel"" or a bright angel who fell from a height and broke his wings. We look into the faces of all the heroes, trying to determine which of them is the monster. And gradually we are imbued with the mesmerizing beauty of this world and its inhabitants.

At first, Han Joo Won was perceived as an outsider. ""Young master"" in an expensive suit, completely alien among the ordinary people of Manyang. And it's not just about social status. Han Joo Won chose this role for himself - an independent observer who looks from above at the ugliness of this world and does not touch the dirt. However, the further he progresses in his research, the more personal it becomes, and the mask of equanimity slips from his face. This is how a classic detective story turns into a psychological journey - to feelings and memories walled up in the basements of the soul, into a journey to someone else and to oneself. Because these two processes always go together - to find yourself, you need to see the other and be seen. Find your own reflection in the other person's eyes.

The drama Beyond Evil is a real maze of reflections. Each significant event, the history of each hero has its own reflection. Some of them are false, some of them are true, but all these fragments, put together, allow you to see the truth. There is such a method of image restoration - from several dull and even distorted reflections, you can recreate a real image. We recognize heroes by the way they are reflected in each other. And each new meeting, each new dialogue is another step towards finding a real face. This approach makes the image of each character multidimensional and deep.

The drama really captures all aspects of the relationship. Family relationships – healthy or toxic. Relations with oneself, relationships with the world, social relationships - the law and its implementation. Morality as the ability to contact. Breaking up relationships like disappearing. The attitude towards the deceased loved ones and the ways of dealing with loss, with death. Relationships are alive, supportive and healing. Relationships are codependent, burdensome and suffocating. Personality always lives in a relationship. Fencing off from the world, a person cuts off a part of himself and, ultimately, can completely die as a person. This is how a person turns into a monster.
“Everyone in the city is like one family,” says Han Joo Won of the residents of Manyang. And he is absolutely right. All heroes are connected to each other by a whole network of threads. But somewhere these are the supporting threads of life, and somewhere they are suffocating fetters. The family image is central to the drama. Everything begins with it - everything ends with it. For each of the heroes, this word means something different - a project, a burden, a duty, a dream of absolute happiness. But for everyone, it carries a lot of weight. Thus, a small town turns out to be a global metaphor for a community, a social family, in which our humanity is born, but sometimes dies.
The density of connections and meanings in the drama is so great that not only each character, but the whole world of the drama is felt as something living, animated. The city of Manyang is not just a place of action, but an independent character. The whole city, as an integral living system, exists according to its own laws. The Beyond Evil story is the story of Manyang's illness and healing.

What's also great about the Beyond Evil is that there is no moralizing in it. Despite the great semantic load, the author does not reduce everything to one idea, does not teach, but shows reality in its complexity, even paradoxicality. Each character is a part of a big picture, an element of the inner life of an integral system. But also everyone is a separate unique person, with their own choice and responsibility for this choice. The story of the Beyond Evil is the story of Manyang, but it’s just as much the story of two people meeting. It is no coincidence that all the main scenes are ""doubled"". If you look at the titles of the episodes, you can see that the pairing is ""sewn"" into the very structure of the script. As if the whole story is a long dialogue between two, a series of questions and answers. Each character in the drama is interesting. Each has its own story, its own drama, its own unique personality. But the main axis of the whole story is the meeting and dialogue of the two main characters.

Lee Dong Sik and Han Joo Won, so different, but equally extraordinary, strong in spirit, but practically buried under the rubble of their own psychological trauma. Throughout the drama, they continually drift apart and collide, let go and catch each other, meeting again each time on a deeper level. They go a long way from mutual irritation, exploitation, projecting their fears and expectations onto each other, to true mutual understanding. Throughout the entire drama, the characters stare at each other - with suspicion, with rage, with interest, admiration, tenderness. But invariably - with intense attention, as if looking for something very important in each other's eyes. And in the end they find and return to each other the opportunity to be themselves - whole, feeling, alive.
In my opinion, Beyond Evil, like no other drama, showed us an example of perfect human contact. At that difficultly attainable level, when you see and accept another as he is, in his true essence. The bromance of the main characters of the Beyond Evil is so beautiful that it overshadowed all the drama love lines for me. In fact, this is a ""love story"" - like the love of one soul for another soul. Someone sees them as a mentor and student. Someone sees them as father and son or even as a couple in love. In my opinion, we were specially shown these relations at such a level of generalization that each viewer is free to interpret them in his own way. For me, they are the embodiment of the idea of an existential meeting, beyond any categories.

The Beyond Evil is a theatrical chamber drama. But this simplicity of the means has a deep meaning. The real challenge for an artist is to show everyday reality as something magical, wonderful, and sometimes monstrous. And the Beyond Evil succeeded to create a heroic epic in the scenery of a small provincial town, where a butcher's shop, the basement of an old house or a reed field feel like a mystical place. Where dramatic battles and wonderful metamorphoses take place in the dialogues between the characters. Magic is created in the Beyond Evil, not taking away from reality, but immersing it in it. This is the fantasy world that really exists - in the space of the human psyche, in relationships between people.

This is a huge burden on the actors. They don't just need to play their characters, the actors pretty much create the world and atmosphere of the drama. And they also need to show the development and even the rebirth of their characters. Many characters in the drama wear masks. But in the end all the masks will be removed, ripped off or washed away by the rain. And under someone's mask we will find a monstrous grin, and under someone's - a beautiful face. Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo play characters whose faces change throughout the drama. In each new episode, they experience new trials, different emotions, but their eyes express not only situational emotions, but also profound personality changes. In some scenes, they need to act so subtly that it is like walking on a tightrope. A slightly different expression - and the impression would be wrong. But the actors are perfect in every shot.

The talent of all the participants has created an amazing artistic world. It's like the famous Doctor Who machine - more inside than outside. And you can dive into this depth over and over again, finding new nuances and meanings.

one of the best of 2021
one of the best dramas of 2021!!! the plot may not be extravagant but the cast, i swear they are beyond excellent! special mention to lee dong shik, park jeong je and han ju won. i am a fan of character-driven dramas, and i love the fact that despite this being plot driven, the characters werent set aside. you could still feel every pain and sorrow that they are going through. and the actors were superb. dont even get me started with dong shik and jeong je. i just just loved loved everything about this drama.

honestly, what i expected is like super dark vibes, but it wasnt like that. the atmosphere was lighter that what i have thought but the things that are happening, esp in dong shik's life arent as bright as that.

i'd say that the plot is simpler than what i had expected, but this drama did well with the mind games and the tricks they're hiding in their sleeves. it managed to maintain the suspense even though the culprits were revealed pretty quickly.

and how the actors delivered that ending... beyond touching. the ending wasnt even a scene that will supposedly makes me cry, but i dont know why i did. i was literally teary eyed while watching that scene. i just want to hug everyone and keep them safe. dong shik and ju won's friendship was so beautiful i feel like towards the end it became more of a familial love. i'm glad that despite everything that happened in their past, they were able to form such an amazing bond and helped each other recover.

so if you're hesitating to watch this , dont. GO AND WATCH THIS BEYOND EXCELLENT SHOW. you won't regret it.

It has been a long while since crime drama has kept me at the edge of my seat, excited about how the story was unfolding. Not since Flower of Evil, almost a year ago. It has especially been a long while since not one but two crime dramas have managed to do so. As a crime genre lover, it has been a wild ride and I am living!! I will talk about Mouse in another post but since Beyond Evil is going to end this week I thought I should talk about it first.

Why you should watch it:
1. Fantastic OST
I usually talk about the cinematography and OSTs at the very end of the review but OST was the first thing that I noticed about Beyond Evil so I wanted to talk about it first. The drama starts with a piece of very upbeat music that looks out of place for a crime thriller. For at least two episodes I kept feeling weird about the OST choices because why are they playing such a happy sounding music

For at least two episodes I kept feeling weird about the music choices of this drama because why were they playing a very loud song after someone died? But as the story progressed – it just made sense. The OST of Beyond Evil is phenomenal and a masterpiece. It is very rare for a crime thriller to have an OST quite like Beyond Evil. I had a feeling that a lot of people might want to turn it off because of the song choices but I think you should watch this drama for the added craziness of the scene because of the OST.

2. Shin Ha Kyun and his smile
I don’t think I have to talk about how amazing Shin Ha Kyun is. Whenever he is on the screen, he sucks you in the world of the character and keeps you there. So let’s talk about the character he is playing in the drama – Lee Dong Sik. Lee Dong Sik is surrounded by mystery and suspense. When you look at his face you can actually see that he knows more than he is letting on. When he cries you want to believe him but when he smiles you want to run away.

The drama is going to finish this week and I still don’t know whether I am rooting for him or I am afraid of him. If I can describe Shin Ha Kyun’s acting in one word, it would be – outstanding. There is no other actor who would have been able to give life to the character of Lee Dong Sik other than Shin Ha Kyun.

3. Yeo Jin Goo
I have seen Yeo Jin Goo in many dramas playing many different characters but dare I say, this might be his best work to date. There is just something about the way he is standing out and shining in Beyond Evil, especially when you consider that he is sharing the screen with Shin Ha Kyun and other veteran actors. This role suits him so well and also looks amazing in the drama.

Yeo Jin Goo is playing the role of Han Joo Won who is an uptight, law-abiding detective. He is not friendly, he says what he means and does what he wants. From the outside he is the complete opposite of Lee Dong Sik but, like Dong Sik, there is something about Joo Won that doesn’t fit. I can’t explain how wonderful it is to watch Joo Won throughout this drama and actually see his character development.

4. Rest of the cast
Beyond Evil is the kind of drama where you will suspect every single character that is on screen – including the main leads. These may look a certain way, they may act in a certain way but there is always something that they are not saying. So needless to say, like our two main leads, the drama has great actors to play those characters. The team of Beyond Evil has done a wonderful job casting these characters.

5. Writing and Cinematography
The reason I absolutely love crime investigation kdramas is that this genre needs a very tight plot that does not leave a space for plot holes. When you have a strict 16-20 episode time to wrap every plot and make it make sense – it makes for a great viewing experience.

Like I have said earlier, this drama is made in such a way that every single character feels suspicious and it feels like there is something that is right around the corner but you can’t see. The drama is purposefully written and shot that way and it is mindblowing. The director and screenwriter made a choice to not show the audience everything. They are playing hide and seek with us. Trying to keep making us guess what will happen next. All this with an addition of an incredible OST this drama is an experience that you can only understand when you watch it.

6. A perfect drama to binge watch
Beyond Evil is about to end this week and if you have not seen it yet, lucky you! This is the perfect time to watch. Beyond Evil is made to binge-watch. Every single episode ends with a cliffhanger and you don’t have to spend your week pulling your hair out waiting for the new episodes. Get your snacks, turn off your lights for ambience, turn off your phone and start watching Beyond Evil.

CONCLUSION
I am planning on making a separate spoilery in-depth review of this drama because there is just so much that I need to talk about Beyond Evil that I can’t talk about here. So once you are done with this drama, make sure to come back and scream with me, please. In conclusion, if you are a crime genre lover like me, do yourself a favour and don’t miss out on Beyond Evil.

""Can you still hear the cry of that deer?""
Because of my love for Shin Ha Kyun I jumped into this drama right after the airing of the first episode. I just had to watch this so badly, even if it wouldn’t be a good production. But really, what else is there to say about Beyond Evil other than it’s the best drama of 2021 for now.

The direction is so cinematically poetic, dark, deep, metaphoric.

The story is very well written and kept me on the edge of my seat. Nothing was forced, every episode made sense.

Some people might complain about the music, because it doesn't get every person into a serious mood, but for me it was so powerful it haunts me to this day.

The acting! Oh, the acting is beyond good... Shin Ha Kyun had definitely shown us the creepiest smile with the saddest eyes, so much pain hidden inside. And what’s even more amazing, Yeo Jin Goo wasn’t overshadowed by this veteran actor who always steals all of the attention. He also showed us marvelous emotional performance (especially with his heartbreaking gaze in a few scenes). AND THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THOSE TWO. I really don’t know how to say this, but it’s just something we probably won’t see anytime soon in the upcoming dramas. They played so extremely well together that it’s a crime to miss it.
And let’s not forget about the rest of the actors… even they were so immensely great! (Choi Dae Hoon especially resonated with me) It’s scary how I don’t have anything to complain about…

It’s just beyond good. I loved every second of it. This show is epic.

Beyond your expectations.
Wow. Do you ever watch something so good that it puts you in a daze and takes over your mind entirely? Well, Beyond Evil is perfectly that. There are so many things about this drama that were a hit that I don’t think I will be able to cover it in this review. Most of the things are observations and emotions that you feel with each passing episode. How can every episode manage to be superior than the previous one? They seemed to have done it in this!

One of the best things about this drama is the acting — every actor/actress has given it their best. And Shin Ha Kyun? What an amazing actor. So worthy of the Baeksang he won! And Yeo Jin Goo, despite his young age manages to give back to back hits and bring characters alive like no one else done. Considering his offline personality, he has hit Han Joo Won’s portrayal out of the part. Apart from the leads, the supporting characters have done an incredible job as well. All this wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for the well written script — if the characters weren’t layered and realistic.

Plot wise, this is an absolute thriller. From the first episode we are drawn in, given details and made to suspect almost every single person in Manyang. One thing I absolutely love was how the plot was laid down so well and wasn’t dragged. When something is revealed, it is acted upon! It’s fun to watch this if you are analysing and theorising on the motives and wondering about the plot. Perhaps this experience has made it more memorable for me.

Music wise the drama manages to bring out all the right emotions. The way each scene has been filmed — such brilliant camerawork.

I’m in awe of everything about this show and looking forward to more projects from the people involved in the making and acting. Beyond Evil is an experience that will remain a beautiful heartbreaking part of you. One which you’ll want to go back to watching while knowing all you do. Please don’t disregard this drama for the hype, it is worthy of all the praise it has received.

Beyond Evil? Beyond Amazing.
A thick story with some logical yet sudden twist and turns, leaving you to guess what will happen after each episode, alongside some amazing performances from a stellar cast, that's right, this is what happens when watching Beyond Evil. I feel like Beyond Evil is best watched when you take it slow, episodes are ""heavy"" so you will need to take your time with it, but it's definitely worth it if you do. Shin Ha Kyun absolutely shone in his role, as did many other cast members, but I thought I had to mention Shin Ha Kyun himself here as I will remember his performance in Beyond Evil for a very long time, I definitely need to watch more dramas that have casted him.

The OST is, for me anyway, the strongest OST of 2021 by far currently, I have literally been listening to it when exercising at the gym. Re-watch value could be considered low here, however, there are two things to consider: like before, episodes are heavy; and also consider my re-watch value rating is normally considered lower compared to most people when writing reviews.

I highly suggest for everyone to watch Beyond Evil!

Goosebumps!
This slow-burning serial killer drama is literally a work of art!

All the cast fit in very well in their respective characters.
Complicated storyline evokes the curiosity, & keep on going.
Soundtracks are amazing & synchronizes very well at the right timings.

Shin Ha Kyun's acting skills are beyond excellent, & I recommend another Daesang award for him.

The director pointed out certain weak points or loopholes in the law of South Korea, &
his sincere intention & good faith can obviously be seen till the final minutes of the finale.
Was this review helpful to you? Yes No"

Beyond Excellence.
This is one of the best drama... The acting was super good .... Story was very interesting..... Ost was good ..... I love the Han joo won and Lee dong sik's characters..... I loved how they were enough strong to face everything..... Idk why many people found han jo won quite annoying... I think he did nothing annoying... He was just trying to find the real culprit ...
In this drama every characters were necessary... I think the casting director is smart he picked the right actors who fit in their role perfectly...
Only one thing I didn't like that kang jin mook died easily after killing so many people....
He deserve to rotten in the jail.....
Dong sik and Han ju won's life was quite cruel ... Especially for Dong sik ...... However I gald that they didn't kill anyone despite of everything.....
I wanted to happen something between ju won and jae yi .... But nothing happened ....
I felt a little bit bad for oh ji hun ... He didn't get any chance to confess his feelings for min jeong....
I usually don't rate ... But I felt this drama deserve more rating ..
People should watch this drama... I think none will regret after watching this...

Good but
The story line is okay, the mystery part is okayy, the setting is okayyy, the characters are okayyyy except that the LCY is truly a pretty girl to watch, but somehow it is still a drama worth to watch. In short what really makes me thrill about this drama wasn't the story line, mystery, the setting, nor the plot, but was the perfect teamwork and relationship between LDS and HJW, where you will wonder if you can achieve it with your partners or colleague in that way all the time. However, the story is still a little bit too draggy and to be honest sometimes will watch until fell asleep and couldnt bear to fast forward. Only if the drama is not that draggy it can be quite a perfect drama to me.

This review may contain spoilers
A rare masterpiece in psychological thriller genre.
When you watch a psychological thriller there are certain things you expect. There'll be one killer at least, it will be full of plot twists, focused on characters' psyche and the killer's grand reveal in the last ep. And that's what I expected from BE but boy did it prove me wrong.

When I think of BE the immediate things that come to my mind are trust and family. BE breaks and constructs many layers of this concept while keeping the plot moving.

What does Beyond Evil mean? I think Dong shik answers it for us when Ji hwa confronts him about his lies. He tells her what she already knows that there existed no law that could judge the sinners and bring justice to the victims. Law is written by man and conducted by the ones who studied it. Humans are inherently flawed because we are social beings, we rely on a community and so everything is subjective.

But evil wasn't created by man. It was born through life but birthed out of nothingness and co-existed with the good because there is no good without evil and no evil without good. So when our law proves useless it should be the ""creator"" who rules.

See the killer is revealed fairly early in the drama and the bad guys are pretty much known, the intricacy of BE lies in how the characters react when the killer is right in front of them.

Many times both Dong shik and Ju won are faced with a decision, to kill or not to. They are handed that power but the inherent good in him fights back the urge.

How can a person keep taking lives? How is it that immense guilt and fear don't drown them? Evil can't be controlled by humans, hence it is beyond human comprehension. It is simply beyond evil.

At least that's what BE told me, I wonder what it will tell you. You just have to watch it for yourself then. :')

(PS: One of the best OST ever. There is something truly special in pairing strong, intense scenes with an acoustic guitar. The music fills you with that anticipation and the acting brings in the dread. Spectacular.)

I have mixed feelings about this drama. I started it with zero expectations and the
story seemed very promising but then...
I just felt so confused almost all the time!

The two main characters had great bickering scenes but I really didn't grow fond of either of them. I was honestly glad when I remembered their names because for some reason I had so much troubles remembering the characters' names in this drama. ?

One thing I really really liked was the OST. It was so good, especially just the instrumental parts! They matched amazingly with the atmosphere and overall vibe of the drama.

Although I didn't like it, I still wanted to finish it to uncover the mysteries so I watched the last episodes on 1.5 speed and it was bearable. But it wasn't a memorable drama for me so I give the rating 6.5.

Started off as an anti-buddy cop drama.....but ended up being much more than that…..


Where do I begin....this was spectacular! If you're someone who enjoys a good slow burn mystery thriller THEN THIS IS FOR YOU! There are absolutely no reasons for not watching this.....so here is why this show deserves all the accolades, praises and is one of the best shows of 2021. I have not given any spoilers so feel free to read.

1. Simple done right: At its core, beyond evil is a very simple murder mystery but it is the execution that blows the mind of the audiences. Classic isn’t always bad. With the amount of dramas Korea is churning, the pressure to present new and unique stories rests heavily on the shoulders of the makers. But Beyond Evil is a great example of sticking to basics of a genre yet somehow reinventing story telling styles.

2. Three Cheers for the Screenplay: As I said the story is simple, then what made it a standout show? It was the screenplay. The carefully placed hints, the decision to reveal what aspects of story to the audience, when, how and systematically placing flashbacks in every episode is mesmerizing to watch. I cannot praise the writing team enough for the amount of intelligence and creativity they showed while building every episode.

3. Layers, Layers and Layers: This show can be very deceptive. On the face value it might seem like a straightforward murder mystery but at the end of the day it presents umpteen perspectives to the same plot. The show has successfully bypassed binaries of good and bad. It elevates the discussion on grey characters and grey scenarios. Every character has motives, secrets, complex emotions and varied outlook that clashes with each other. These layers add depth to the story without distracting the plot, rather it enriches the narration.

4. Remarkable Character Development: The testament of a great show is when the characters draw the audience into their world, make them invest and embark on a journey together. This show does exactly that. If you compare every character from ep1 to 16, you will be able to distinctly witness an evolution or devolution. Not a single character remains same by the time the show ends. Every character changes for good or worse.

5. Top Tier Acting Skills: I have always believed that Korea produces one of the best well rounded actors not only in Asia but also in the world. This show proves my point. If the screenplay/script is one pillar of the show then acting is the other. Our two lead titans Shin Ha Kyun (Lee Dong Shik) and Yeo Jin Goo (Han Joo Won) are outstanding. Everyone has been praising Shin Ha Kyun for his spectacular performance, even speculating possible Baeksang (totally deserving), so I thought to comment on Yeo Jin Goo. I never followed Yeo Jin Goo’s career in the past and I only saw Hotel Del Luna, which honestly centered on IU and therefore he did not leave any impression on me. But his nuanced and compelling performance in this show attests his years of experience in the industry. I cannot wait to see what kind of projects this young actor will choose in the future. Special shout out to every other cast member….they were equally great and deserve to get bigger roles after this show.

Beyond Evil has definitely raised the bar high for the industry. This is one of the finest of its genre, so featuring it on Netflix is a great decision. A show that will be remembered for a very long time…..

Masterpiece
It's like watching a puzzle slowly put together with each new piece/episode providing new inisight to the bigger picture. Everything is brilliantly connected and every character matters and is involved in some way.
The show is not just about finding out who the killer is but most importantly about the people involved and how deeply they were affected by it.
I don't see an issue with the pacing, it's what you would expect from a psychological thriller, no time was wasted. It slowly builds and forms the story with each episode and once you get to the end you see just how perfectly thought and planned out it was.

The cast I can't praise enough, all of them were phenomenal and had me so immersed that at times I forgot to read the subtitles, especially Shin Hakyun who blew me away every episode.
The ost seemed a little odd at first but I quickly fell in love with it and thought it perfectly fit the show.

No words are enough to describe how much I love this show and I'm not really good at reviews so if I could only use one word to describe it it would be masterpiece, it's by far the best k-drama I have seen.

Beyond Masterpiece
Plot is well-written. Nothing unpredictable. Every episode will make you crave for more. When you thought that you finally understand it, the show will throw another bomb. The acting is phenomenal. They choose the right people. All of the cast is amazing. They didn’t even drag the story even for a short time. They always gives you something new. Something to think about. Gives you chills, will shock the hell out of you, can make you laugh then cry. Beyond Evil deserves more recognition and love. A masterpiece indeed.

This review may contain spoilers
great characters horrible mystery
I was a huge fan of this but after ep12 I was severely disappointed. if this tried to be more like Nobody Knows (ie if they told us ""this is the villain(s), it's not a surprise"") then this would've been a 10/10 BUT, it's like the writer was desperate to ""outsmart"" the viewers, they had so many red herrings (which I didn't mind) and worse the never ending twists that were so predictable..



now to the spoiler part, there was this scene in The Neighborhood where the 3 guys find a mystery novel that didn't have an ending so they went to the writer and he told them ""it's the butler"" ie the most obvious not obvious answer, and those 3 didn't like it cuz each of them had their own ""villain"" and by the end they wrote that all 3 villains killed, so basically long story short that's what happened here
Jin Mook was ""the butler"", though I do admit till his revelation everything was perfect, he was such an obvious ""no way it can't be him"" that it was a good ""twist"" but then things started to get messy

now I never suspected our two mains, and I loved how both were the ""anti hero"" type, it created a beautiful and unique parring (usually it's good cop/bad cop), and those this drama felt perfect but


we go back to the three idiots and the 4th suspected that we end up with 5 people involved in the murder, and 4 atleast personally hurt her, that's TOO MUCH. and zero twist. from the start DongWon kept mentioning all villager names saying who is is it all, and it was all.....
one hurt her, one hit her with his car, another hit her with his car (how many drunk drivers do they need) and the 4th finished it off while the 5th made her son think he killed her while she knew the 1st person was the evil guy...


soo, where did it go wrong? making Joo Won's dad involved so he has a breakdown? making Dong Shik's closest friends involved? killing his sister, ""niece"" and boss?
I say all of the above. maybe not much of the last part, they had a serial killer, a corrupt cop, a business dude and a politician... and they always had to go out and eat together while nagging on and on and on...
in Nobody Knows there was the big rich evil guy and his minions and it was such a great show. sometimes the chase is better than the revelation


so basically, the writer gets a -10 and the actors saved this drama, I also loved the ost and I never rewatch stuff

One of the best drama deserving of its award
The moment I have finished the series felt like a weigh has been lifted off me but at the same time, I craved more. I thought I must write a review at all cost. So here we are!

The drama gave off a premise of what one would think of a typical crime drama where our protagonist gets wronged by the police so he seeks justice. Nope, it isn't all that.

In the drama, we have our protagonist, Lee Dong Sik, whose sister went missing 20 years ago, became the police officer he is today. He meets another officer whose views and perspective of things differ with him. Han Ju Won. From their clash of perspective to their suspicions, the two work it out to find the meaning of justice for the both of them.

There were a lot of GOOD things about the show that in fact just stating it in words alone isn't enough unless you experience its goodness yourself.

From the plot to character development, this drama nailed it all. I have to even say, everyone of the character feels like a main than a supporting and the casts? Everyone's superb. The drama will really leave you at the edge of your seat everytime you finish one, thinking what's going to happen next? Who's the real culprit? how will they catch him? Typical questions one would raise over a crime-mystery drama but Beyond Evil answers it all and will give you a satisfying end.

I must warn you of the stares between our actors Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo as their roles Lee Dong Sik and Han Ju Won, it gets to the point of addicting! The chemistry is too wonderful as partners, as brothers, or however way you want to see it.

Acting-wise, I think Shin Ka Hyun is truly the god of acting, the whirlpool of emotion he'll bring you and the eye-acting he offers is enough to pull you even more into the show. That doesn't mean Yeo Jin Goo falls behind, he manages to match against the other senior actor and offers his best, I think this is his best role just yet after Hotel Del Luna (for me). Choi Seung Eun whose known as a rookie, on the other hand, will catch your attention just as it caught mine.

The OST? Man, The Night will be on repeat once you finish the drama like a curse. I love it so much and it is so on point for the drama. Truly a masterpiece.

Anyway, I think it is a drama packed of human drama, thrill, emotions, and a whole lot more. But more importantly, I think it is important to find the message it was trying to convey.

I hope that this drama will be given a chance because it deserves the attention. I hope you enjoy it as much as we (the fans) do.

This is a first, but I think it has a rewatch value of 10/10. I would rewatch just to feel it all again.

Happy watching!

I was very worried upon starting this drama that it would be too dark and gruesome for me, so much so that I stopped watching after 2 episodes. But even after spending such a short time with the plot and the characters, I could not stop thinking about it, so after a few weeks I started again, and thank god I did because this was truly amazing! Also, not quite as gruesome as I was expecting, so my fear of seeing something I really didn't want to see at the end of episode 2 was unfounded, in case that helps anyone a little squeamish who reads this.
Part psychological thriller, part crime drama, and almost family drama, Beyond Evil manages an impressive balancing act between cold, disturbing darkness and raw emotion, both of the positive and negative kind. The plot unfolds perfectly over the course of the 16 episodes, leaving no lull in intensity or filler episodes but not rushing into anything either. You get enough time to savor all of the twists and turns of the story, all of the new developments and revelations, without getting bored. Contrarily to other intense crime dramas, Beyond Evil is truly moving and shocking at time, but never uses cheap tricks and haphazardly put together twists to achieve that, each turn of the story is impactful in its own right, and will leave you trying to solve the mystery by yourself.
What I was not expecting from this drama is for it to be so viscerally emotional at times. This comes mostly from the stellar acting from Shin Ha Kyun, who constantly walks the line between protagonist and antagonist, while staying utterly loveable and captivating throughout. The rest of the cast are all really impressive, most notably Yeo Jin Goo, who manages a really great, complex performance, despite his young age. The Korean title (Monster) is particularly fitting: the drama explores the monstrous in the different characters. If it sounds clichéd and a bit on the nose, don't worry, the drama never is. It uses this admittedly a bit overdone idea with impressive subtlety and efficiency, so that it always feels fresh and new.
On top of that, the drama simply looks fantastic, even though a lot of it takes place in dingy police station and old, somewhat decrepit houses, the filmography captures each place's essence and feel in a way that always elevates the story. The cold interrogation room is the perfect backdrop to enhance the ambivalence and mystery surrounding the suspects, while the old butcher shop reinforces the warmth of the long years of friendships between the main group of protagonists, and the old streets surrounded by vast expenses of countryside surrounding the town really drive home the sense of ""localness"" of a tragedy taking place in a small town.
The music is another great addition to the drama, with pieces that almost sound out of place at first, but work so well overall to build up the atmosphere, without being too distracting.
All in all, Beyond Evil is a remarkably well-rounded drama, that manages to feel amazingly intense while never resorting to cheap twists or being too fast. Each element of the production helps build up the intensity and emotions, leaving you with a really solid contender for best mystery/crime drama/psychological thriller of the year.

I have no words to say how this drama made me feel. I love thrillers and this year we had so many great dramas in this gender! The next one in my list of dramas that I translated but have not watched is ""Taxi Driver"" and I'm already pretty excited about it. But let's talk about this amazing production, without spoilers. You can see my first impressions here: https://mydramalist.com/profile/8270201/feeds/QkBBJS8

It's not for no reason that this drama won so many awards this year. We have an addicted story mixed with actors that deliver everything in their roles. I'll start talking about the main characters. Lee Dong Shik (Shin Ha Kyun) is the kind of character that you don't know what to expect. Until the last episode, I yet had afraid that he could do something terrible and I think that Ha Kyun pass the exact essence of the disturbed personality of Dong Shik. What is the smile of this man? It made me nervous and in love at the same time during the entire show. On the other side, but with the same instability, Han Joo Won (Yeo Jin Goo) made me crazy in the same way. Seeing Joo Won slowly losing his sanity and notion of justice and himself was the most incredible journey for me here. Yeo Jin Goo is a beast and I really hope that he can get a lot of complex characters in his career because I think we'll gonna see so much more of his ability from now on. I love the way how they put the people of the city so together. This left us confused for many episodes and maintain the thriller at the highest. I will make an honorable mention to Choi Dae Hoon, our Park Jung Jae, and Lee Kyu Hoe, the incredible Kang Jin Mook. These two, besides all the Munji crew, captivate me with extreme performance. I'm not totally recovery yet, for real.

About the story, I have to say that is not a even single missing point. Maybe you don't feel so excited if you don't like corruption plots, but if you are like me, you gonna love it. The corruption of the high society of Munji is the center of everything, and many times I felt disgusting seeing so much dirty, but at the same time is a totally possible story. It's very insane to think that something like that could happen for real, maybe not with such greatness but for sure with something similar, for the same reasons.

I'll definitely put this one as a chosen one (★ ★ ★ ★ ★★ ★ ★ ★ ★) and tied with ""Mouse"" in the scale of my heart (I really can't choose between these two). If you love ""Mouse"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Devil Judge"", you'll gonna love this for sure.

See you soon!
XOXO, Mari.

The best of it's genre.
A suspense thriller that deserves all the high ratings and awards it has received. Its scriptwriting is incredible; written for a thoughtful viewer who is able to read the eyes & emotions yet able to understand a plot which includes a bunch of different undertones. This show will not seem as tense or tedious only to viewers who can see beyond a facade.

It's certainly more inclinied towards the psychological part of a thriller e.g heroes unravel a tight tangle of secrets and intrigue through interrogations and reflections type of plot. This is exactly why, I would recommend it to an adult. Specifically a thoughtful viewer who is able to empathize with the heroes even when they do not openly show their suffering.

This drama was completely unpredictable from start to finish. And that's saying a lot from someone who watched dramas for years. Everyone suspects everyone and you never know what's coming next. I loved that all of the people from the town were close friends but kinda had their secrets. There were also some pretty gruesome scenes so you should keep that in mind before you start this drama. I loved the chemistry between Dong Shik and Joo Won. The two were supposed to be enemies where Joo Won would suspect him and Dong Sik just ignored that he was being interrogated and played it off. Joo Won learns a lot, unexpectedly, from Dong Sik and how he catches criminals. To be honest, they were kinda fruity (if you know what I mean) like Joo Won literally has mommy and daddy issues. That's a story for next time though. Also, I gave this drama a 7/10 for rewatch value because it wouldn't be the same to watch this when you know what's going to happen. Have fun bitches <3

PHENOMENAL! PHÉNOMÉNAL! FENOMENALE! PRIMA!
WAIT before watching something after ""Beyond Evil"": subsequent series/movies will feel bland or boring. ""Beyond Evil"" (I don't like the title, hence I left it to watch it when there was nothing else on Netflix) requires concentration and you'll get rewarded BIG time.
One thing that is amazing is how you can at times barely guess what is going to happen. As a rule of thumb, you can't. Let yourself immerge in the events shaking fictional Manyang village next to fictional Munju town.
Unsure whether the lack of romance adds or detracts from the series. There was the possibility to develop something, and my bet would have been Oh JiHwa (ladies first) and ML DongShik as well as Yoo JaeY and ML JooWoon. The author chose not to.
The music fits both in terms of when it appears and what it sounds like.
""Beyond Evil"" is another high light of 2021 kdramas, and bodes well for the future.

Outstanding performances all around !!
Incredible! Just truly incredible! I don't watch much crime thriller dramas. I prefer real life crime/thriller documentaries if I'm being honest. So this might actually be the first drama of this genre that I watched. And I must say, WOW!

However, I didn't really get into this drama until around episode 4. The first few episodes were good, especially the way Lee Dong-Shik's (Shin Ha-Kyun) character was introduced and the way the story was suggesting him to be the perpetrator. But it was definitely more like a cat and mouse act for those first episodes. At around episode 4 when more ""suspects""/""possible suspects"" gets introduced along with their individual stories, is when it starts to get interesting.

This is when the plot really starts to grab you as it starts to make you question and guess who is the real suspect among all the characters. Then more of the background stories of the supporting casts is also shared which thickens the plot even further. I really liked the way they end each episode on a cliffhanger as well, and that it makes you want to watch the next episode to find out what's happened.

In terms of the characters and acting, I really have to give it up to Shin Ha-Kyun and Yeo Jin-Goo because their chemistry and their acting in this drama was just another level. I have never seen Shin Ha-Kyun in any drama before this so I didn't know how good he is and my gosh is he SO GOOD! The way he acted a some-what psycho -ish character but then also had those gut-wrenching emotional scenes, it's unreal. I got scared by his psycho smile, but then also cried and felt heartbroken for him at the crucial stages of the drama.
Yeo Jin-Goo was just as incredible. He really held his own and it's dramas like this that makes you forget how young he really is because of how good and how mature he acts. I will say though that his character is very serious, I don't think Han Joo-Won ever smiled but that's not bad thing. This drama is a crime thriller after all and he's already proven he can act comedic and funny in Hotel De Luna already. This drama just showed that he can do both serious, emotional acting as well as comedic and funny.

Big ups to the supporting cast too. They were all impressive in their acting and their chemistry as a whole. At the episodes where a certain character is being suspected, I really did think that, that person could be the bad guy because of how well the/she acted. On the other hand, when it turned out not to be him/her and the real story of that person is revealed, that certain character's acting complimented that story change too. I felt suspicious of them then felt sad/sympathetic/angry...seriously lots of emotions.

A special mention to the OST/sound mixing too because I think it's a big part of what makes a good drama. And I must say, the soundtrack and sound mixing in this drama is just perfection. I didn't really know what type of soundtrack to expect from a crime thriller drama but golly its good. The sound mixing especially during tense scenes was also very very well done. It did hype up the tension a lot and added so much to the scenes.

Overall, this drama is truly amazing. The story, the cliff hangers, the never ending question of 'who did it'...it will grip you to the very end. It's worth all the accolades it received and certainly worth all the hype!

One of the best dramas EVER!
What to say about this drama that completely escapes the cliché? I have never seen such a complex story in my life, full of plot twists, minutely interconnected events. And the best thing is that even being a story full of details, they managed to show us all these details in just 16 episodes. Your head fills with theories. It fills with outbreaks because all the time you think one is the culprit, because all the time someone appears who took actions that impact the main story. The entire cast's performances were perfect, but the one that caught my attention the most was Yeo Jin-Goo. His performance was FLAWLESS! We could feel from here all the emotions that the character felt through his performance.
Each episode that ended was a different impact.

In short: a perfect drama, with a perfect story, with a perfect cast and a perfect acting!

Beyond Expectation
Where do I begin? The writing of this crime thriller is phenomenal, every episode subverts your expectation while keeping you throughly engaged due to it’s excellent pacing. Each side character is integral to the plot and aren’t in any way 2 dimensional. The morally grey nature of this show is captured perfectly by the cinematography and then further enhanced by it’s eerie OST. Yeo Jingoo and Shin Hakyun’s chemistry is seriously out of this world. In addition with the rest of the cast which makes the acting thorough out this drama outstanding. On the surface level, Beyond Evil might be perceived as a “who done it” mystery drama, however it’s much more then that, so please give it a watch!

The best drama that 2021 has released until now
This is the best drama that 2021 has release until now. Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo have the best chemistry ever. Their acting is spectacular and flawless. Especially, Jin Goo need to receive an award because they way he plays with emotions in this dramas is amazing. In one scene he goes from shock to deception, sadness, betrayal and anger in seconds was mind blowing. The plot is amazing and plays with your mind every minute of every episode. But, the strong point of this drama are the characters and the actors.

The Intricacy of Beyond Evil
I have been watching crime thriller dramas non-stop for quite a while now. But nothing prepared me for the intricacy that Beyond Evil brings. Unlike some dramas that the villain is a bit predictable from the get-go, I have a tough time deciphering the characters of our protagonists-male leads-villain in this drama.

If you are going to embark on this 16-episode journey, prepare to read through a lot of the subtitles and, listen to a lot of narration from our “subs” or suspects. But as the drama reached its conclusion, you will have this sense of fulfillment and accomplishment to finally see the drama come in a full circle.

Not a bad watch. Thanks, jTBC! And kudos to our actors as well.

Heavy and Dark : The end justifies the means..
Can I just say that after watching a lot of crime thriller dramas, this would be the most unique one because of how the narrative of the series was masterfully relayed from start to finish.. This drama is definitely a psychological thriller at its finest.. With its melodramatic and slow burn pacing that will surely enthrall the viewers / audience, you'll get to only understand the whole picture of the plot once you've finished watching it.. And truly, this is worth the watch..

The complexity of the characters, how they were introduced in the series as well as their major developments are outstanding..

In addition to that, can I just say that the soundtracks are daebak! (amazing). Each soundtrack fits the characters as well as the theme of the series so well, most especially when we're feeling the emotions being portrayed by the characters.

Although I have to admit that Beyond Evil took me a while to finish because of its slow burn pacing but at the end of the series, I now completely understand the relevance of its pacing... Some viewers may find this drama to be dull or monotonous.. Furthermore, I actually find the twists in the series to be predictable for it did not shook / surprise me that much..

However, Give it a Chance if you're not into the slow burn type of drama.. Each characters in the series had their own time to shine and I find that to be much appreciated.. Also, the interactions of the main characters most especially Lee Dong Shik and Han Joo Won are unforgettable... From start to finish, we get to see the intricacy of their relationship : Their Conflicts and Doubts turning to Trust and Respect for each other.. **applause**

In conclusion, Beyond Evil is one of those unforgettable psychological thriller dramas of 2021 which is definitely on par with Mouse : Both dramas have its unique take on the complexity of the characters and plot.. I highly recommended these shows if you're looking for a heavy and dark plot.. I actually finished watching Beyond Evil first before Mouse then I posted my review for Mouse first before Beyond Evil (lol) and no words can best describe these two series for both of them are really good in their own way...

Indeed, Beyond Evil is a brilliant show in which the end justifies the means...

A Slow-burn Masterpiece
Beyond Evil captivated me from start to finish. It was as close to perfection as a drama could get and deserves all the Baeksang awards it got and was nominated for.

If you are thinking of watching this, please note this is a psychological thriller. It's not a fast-paced, crazy chase to catch a killer or high stakes to save lives. It explores the minds of those left behind in missing cases and the motives that drive people to do evil or morally questionable things. It respects its viewers by not laying out every answer plainly for us to see, rather challenging us to make the connections ourselves. Beyond Evil places the spotlight on its characters, and you learn to appreciate the moments where they focus on each one - it is not a drop in pacing, it is a purposeful insight into the reasons behind their behaviour and how that contributes to the plot.

The directing, cinematography, writing and music all combine to foreshadow events, parallel scenes in previous episodes, and beautifully set the tone. The OST is a real winner here, it's a bit unusual at first (compared to most dramas) but it is really fitting and similar to a film OST where specific soundtracks are written for specific scenes. What are plot holes? You won't find them here, and if you didn't understand something, you weren't paying enough attention (me for real, had to rewind and piece things together a few times which is half of the fun tbh!). Even now after just finishing, I can't wait to rewatch and pick up on all the little hints that I missed on my first watch.

And the acting, oh the acting... The entire cast was amazing, there was no weakness. But Shin Ha Kyun won that Best Actor Baeksang for a reason. I've never seen someone use their face to convey emotions like he does, his eyes were truly a window to Dong Sik's inner turmoil and I was mesmerised by his performance. Even if this drama isn't for you, watch a few of his scenes and you'll understand why he beat out his heavy competition to win.

Now excuse me while I try to get over my post-Beyond Evil sadness. It was truly a masterpiece.

Brilliant Thrilling Story with Phenomenal Acting
Beyond Evil is a compelling incridible story that keeps you guessing. The plots are so unpredictable well-written. There is easter eggs in every episode and we can see them get revealed in a good pacing.

They casted a great actors & actress that played a phenomenal acting. Both the main and supporting characters have back stories to support their purpose in the mysterious plot. I must say every characters in Beyond Evil are important and significant for the story line. Shin Ha Kyun one of the main actor, won the Best Actor award from the 57th Baeksang Arts Awards for his role. At first I came watching this for Yeo Jin Goo, but Shin Ha Kyun surely catched viewer's attention especially mine.

The cinematography was dark, creepy, and perfect for the story. The OST add so much atmosphere and match the characters and story perfectly. I must mention the promotional poster, as a designer I really love the idea! It captures how the two main characters are like a set of twin that slowly merge together.

While I can understand some people find the show confusing and dragging, I had nothing to dislike from this series. Beyond Evil is surely an outstanding heavy thrilling story for psychological drama fans like me.

Why you should watch Beyond Evil
My reviews is going to be short and I'll try to keep it spoiler free because I want people to check it out. This drama has affected my viewer's experience in a big way. I didn't go in with a lot of expectation but that was before I knew who Shin Ha Kyun was. I was aware about Yeo Jin Goo. But all in all had never watched either of their works. AND I have literally discovered these amazing actors in this drama. Is the story complicated like other crime thriller ? No. It isn't. It's easy to follow. But the best part of this drama is exactly that. You'll know exactly why i said this once you start watching.
The acting. The leads are obviously phenomenal. But the supporting cast is soo good that they feel like main cast. Emphasis is on every character in this drama. Nobody is left out. Consistent drama. Tightly packed plot. Every action of a character has consequence. It's not shown for shits and giggles. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole drama. From start to finish. And as a fan of the drama, The direction, the OST, the production. You'll miss out on quality drama if you don't give this a shot.

Greed is beyond evil
I started late watching beyond evil because I joined the Vincenzo trend but because I can’t ignore the good reviews about this drama and so I started watching it..
At first the storyline was very complicated and it seemed very intense. I was afraid that it might take a wrong turn just like some dramas but as the story progresses the problem zoomed in.
It was just a simple struggle for survival. A mother protecting his son because of her greed for power and it may not seem but it was also out of love. A gangster and a police officer doing everything to feed their greed. A wrongly accused man trying to make out of what’s left. An abandoned son justifying the acts of her mother. A rookie police officer wanting to prove himself..
Beyond evil is a complex yet a very simple story and it’s nicely done.

At first glance, the drama appeared to be having a similar storyline that inspired the creation of Gapdong, Signal as well as Tunnel. Suppose such first impressions is unavoidable when it involves stories that contain an unsolved serial murder cases and cover up plotlines. And because of Shin Hakyun, I can't help getting a similar vibe I felt from Less than Evil for this drama. Which is probably intentional as the two characters from the two dramas had similar level of darkness, and the way Shin Hakyun carried both characters were almost similar.

That said, as much as I'm no stranger to these kind of genres I have to say that this drama can be pretty dark, heavy and intense. In which it might get a bit taxing to watch as almost every character in this drama seemed suspicious and make you wary about everyone. And the way Lee Dongsik kept acting very suspicious at times can be pretty exhausting to watch as one alternate from wanting to believe he was innocent or guilty, and it gets worse when almost every character in this drama behaved in similar ways. You can't help feeling like you're being gaslighted throughout the drama by almost every key characters.

On the bright side, it made the plot very unpredictable yet on another, it makes one question whether or not you should continue watching the drama as the main character tried too hard to act as the ultimate villain, just because they've become quite disillusioned with how the law works. It only really gets better or tolerable halfway towards the end, partially because the truth started to finally gets unravelled and the main characters started to become much more honest with each other.

Overall, it was a good story though you do need to have quite a bit of patience to get through the first half of the drama before being able to properly appreciate the mystery and storyline.

Watchable, but unremarkable
I don't really pay much attention to hype surrounding programs, I just watch them if they sounds interesting. I was just compelled to contribute my own review after changing status from ""In Progress"" to ""Completed"" and seeing all the 9/10-10/10 reviews.

I won't rehash the premise (the MDL synopsis is pretty good, but makes it sound a lot more interesting than it is, lol), but I will say as the backstory unfolds through to course of the program, it's pretty convoluted. The pace is quite slow, there's too much time spent focusing on Korean political machinations (which I don't find particularly compelling) and the show drags on a few too many episodes (which, as your know, is par for the course!).

Most of the cast were fantastic, with a particular mention to Ha Kyun Shin, I really think he anchored the whole show. It's no mean feat to be able to get you to hate a character and find them creepy, while winning them over through the course of the story (while still having them wonder the whole time if he could be a killer).
Jin Goo Yeo I thought was just OK, although admittedly I didn't really like him in ""Hotel Del Luna"" until toward the end of the show. I'm not sure if this is because his character here was written as stiff, blank and unlikable; or if he as an actor just takes a while to settle into a role.
Of the minor actors (who, as I said, are mostly fantastic) Sung Eun Choi as the feisty but sensitive Jae Yi was a standout for me - I hope I get to see her in more programs.

I usually hate when a show gets bogged down in romance, but I have to say it would have improved the show here if there was some..... it's a bit sad that all these people are single at the start of the series, and in the finale ""one year later"" flash forward they're still all single?
Oh, and don't be fooled by the other reviews stating this is a great bromance - there's hardly any bromance here either :P

All in all, I don't regret watching it, I just wish it had been more to the point, easier to follow, and had more character development (beyond just revealing the character' back stories).

I have no strong opinions. You won't hate it. You might not love it.
I didn't enjoy this as much as the community seemed to but they set a really high bar. Nothing bad to say about the acting. Everyone was top-notch and deserves the accolades. Should have been shorter, the storyline could've been tighter and there were a few 'mr screenwriter i see what you're trying to do but im not buying it.' subplots but overall i gave it a 9. You won't feel you wasted time seeing it through.

I feel bad. I felt like i had clocked this ending by episode 7-8 and spent the rest of it waiting for the twist that never came.

Accidental queerbait happy times for every one
Beyond Evil is a compelling thriller, aptly once described as a combination of Hannibal and Sherlock. Which feels like a very good description. In BE the two main characters creep you out - they both are suspicious as hell in the beginning and you're also getting gaslit into thinking they're murderers. Rather than Hannibal where the murderer gaslights the detective into believing he's innocent and then frames him in BE both detectives manipulate each other into believing the other one is a murderer - or rather, they let the other one think it in order to achieve their own goals.
Lee Dongsik whose sister had been killed 20 years ago is working in the police to catch the murderer and bring justice to victims of similar crimes. Of course his best idea of doing this is incredibly fucked up and an incredibly dangerous plan to incriminate the actual murderer and force him into revealing himself and enough evidence to get himself arrested. He knows the law well - if there's no body, there's no case. On the other hand young(er) Han Juwon, the son of the next police general comissioner, is convinced Lee Dongsik is guilty and killed his sister and all the other victims. And his primary drive here has also become guilt because by inducing a sting operation on his own, he had caused the death of one of the victims. They both find out each other's secrets and dig around for evidence and their relationship goes from Han Juwon suspecting Lee Dongsik to the horrible realization that Han Juwon's own father is the one guilty for the death and disappearance of Lee Dongsik's sister 20 years ago. Han Juwon then decides to abandon all his usual strategies and incriminate his father at any cost.
But that's enough about the plot. The obvious elephant in the room is the tension between the two leads. In not giving either of the male leads a female love interest (as k-dramas love to do) and making the whole series about their relationship, an accidental queerbait was created. And was it delicious to watch. Now don't get me wrong - I, like any other respectable gay, like to watch explicitly gay stuff. Queerbait is like... so 2012 and yet it's so rare to see between two main characters with no other romance obstructing it in Korean media that I'm actually happy. If this means that Korea is catching up to these trends in western shows, in a few years we might actually get high-production dramas with gay main characters. Maybe even a kiss. Let me dream. Also there's something so delicious about queerbaits where the ""will they won't they"" makes you wonder until the last moment.
There's an easy explanation as to how they accidentally made it gay. I'm sure that by making the two main characters be 12? 13? years apart in age they thought the vibe we get from them would be more of a ""son-father"" thing... I mean they really underestimated the hype for DILFs. Plus the age difference is really not that much considering Han Juwon is almost 30 years old.

Decent
The 1st half was decently interesting, with great production, acting, and atmosphere - and I do love a good serial killer case. However the 2nd half was boring as hell. Honestly the 1st half and 2nd half are almost different seasons of the same drama that just so happened to air all together.

However what WAS good throughout was the acting of the 2 leads - they were amazing, and even without a lot of insight into them as people their scenes always felt so intense/charged. The other actors did a good job, but were ultimately forgettable characters because, again, the drama gave us the barest of insights into their who they were as people and their emotions. I won't say that was an acting flaw, because honestly for things like that that's a writing flaw, and ultimately they did well with what they were working with. Even for the leads, there are some things that they did that just were never really explained - like why Joo Won latched onto this 20 year old case in the first place (I think it's so he can solve it and coast back to Seoul victoriously, but still even then... why this case? why the obsession? why is he SO convinced it was Dong Sik??). I think the drama would've delivered a more emotional punch if they just took a moment to look at their characters more closely.

Overall as a drama, this wasn't as mindblowing as I thought it'd be based on what I read here, and I never really experienced a shocking twist, but this was still a decent crime drama with great atmosphere (mostly in the 1st half), production, and acting that's worth a watch for the dynamic between Dong Sik and Joo Won alone. Han Joo Won especially was my favourite, and honestly was a major player in keeping me watching this drama.

Focusing on the drama as a whole, I think it deserves a 7.5 for being in the end somewhat average but not horrible with good production and acting. Besides the inexplicably electric dynamic between Joo Won and Dong Sik, I think this drama is somewhat forgettable, especially the 2nd half which honestly made my feelings towards this drama cool a lot. However like I've said before I did enjoy the acting from the leads and the 1st half was interesting so I'll give it an 8.

The Perfect Thriller
Do you like mystery and psychological thriller? Then welcome, sit down and enjoy the story of this mysterious village where a serial killer strikes.

Beyond Evil never disappointed me, every episode pushed me to the edge of my seat. In the beginning, we kinda suspect every character because all of them are so mysterious and suspicious. They all got secrets and step after step we start to unravel the goal of each one of them. The dynamics of the main leads is like a mouse and a cat, they hate each other but can't be separate.

They have such chemistry together that's so good we can't remove our eyes from them. Every time they talk, we notice the closeness of their body, their sharping eyes looking at each other, the teasing and both have the goals to have to upper hand at the end of the conversation. But at the same time, the flow of their conversation is always deep and meaningful.

I truly believe that they play better together as a duo than most of the mains of rom-com dramas. They are both in equation even though they'll never admit it. Every episode kinda leaves you dumbfounded, you’ll ask what did you miss? Who's the monster between them?
It's a very well written drama, the screenwriters made a great choice to not tell right away everything but to leave the viewers made up their theories.

They’ve written the character in a realistic way that no one would find grace or sympathy in your eyes. No more perfect mains lead with a hero complex! Nope!
Every dialogue and micro expression of the characters is very important, you have to pay attention otherwise you’ll end up lost.

I started the drama because of Shin Ha Kyun and what a wonderful performance he gave me! Both him and Yeo Jin Goo played their characters like a perfect symphony and they carry the drama to another dimension.

Stellar acting from the leads, brilliantly told story, a thrill to watch!
There’s a lot to love about this show, although there are not many surprising twists towards the second half. I will try to keep this review spoiler free.

This show’s strength is not the actual underlying plot itself, which we’ve seen before, but the raw and interesting characters and the morally grey natures of almost everyone in Manyang town.

The first few episodes are a roller coaster where you can’t seem to trust anybody - even the two main leads as they all seem to be hiding something darker within themselves.

What makes this show stand out is our two main leads. Many shows have tried this dynamic of old veteran cop and new, young cop teaming up - not getting along at first and slowly partnering up to fight crime, but it just feels a lot different here.

The constant push-pull between the leads is what kept me glued to the screen until the last second. Their chemistry was excellent; the way Lee Dong Shik and Han Joo Won went from slightly trusting each other one minute to suspecting each other the next was exciting to watch. The way the story unravels around them and culminates into a beautiful partnership towards the end makes this show a must-watch.

Shin Ha Kyun is brilliant as Lee Dong Shik. I have never watched any of his works before, but I will definitely check out some of his other projects. Lee Dong Shik is one of the most exciting and interesting cop characters I have seen. Though he is shown to be a wild, fearless, almost insane guy on the outside, it’s clear to see he is rational and calm on the inside.

On the other hand, Yeo Jin Goo’s Han Joo Won is a younger, colder, thorny, and more reserved person. He is shown to be calm and has a strong sense of justice, but we see he is a lot more emotional and soft on the inside. These two characters are so contradictory to what’s on the inside instead of what they show the world that the dynamic between them works brilliantly.

I have been very impressed with Yeo Jin Goo’s recent works like Circle and The Crowned Clown. I don’t think there’s any other 23-year-old actor who has the same acting chops as him. Shin Ha Kyun's extraordinary performance may have devoured a lesser actor, but Yeo Jin Goo held his own in every scene. I wish he continues picking such scripts now as I believe he shines brightly in these kinds of darker shows and away from the mainstream rom-com type of shows.

Around the 10th episode or so, you kind of know where the mystery plot is heading, but that still didn’t deter the enjoyment factor for me. The show culminated in an emotional and more than satisfactory ending and was well worth the watch.

Also, as a bonus, the OST and background score is very well done. The music draws you in and works very well with the storytelling.

It’s a must-watch for fans of crime thrillers, highly recommended!

So much going on but I'm loving it here
I wanted to give it some time before i wrote a review for this drama, at least after I've watched half of it. So here i am 8 eps in.

And given that I'm here halfway through the drama, I've only got good things to say.

From the get-go, the plot was already my style. It intrigued me so much I knew I had to give it try. It was also impossibly unique. From ep 1, I was so sure who the killer was and was so certain of it 'cause I had concreate evidence to back my theory, but then few episodes in, my mind changes... and then I'm thinking to myself, ""maybe they're accomplices?"" But then something happens that goes against my speculations. It plays around with my head so much It started to annoy me! Oof!

And it creeps me out 'cause the moment I began feeling so frustrated, the flow changed. Like it read me. Does it sound dramatic lmao but i kid you not. I was no longer confused and the real killer was shown. And knowing who the killer was for certain while watching this drama as an audience was another type of experience. You get to see how the other characters behave, how the killer killed and what the fukken hell was going through his head when he did what he did. You see the aftermath in a different perspective and that's pretty cool.

Another thing is they don't drag it for too long. Seeing as Ep. 8 is done, we've got 8 more eps and that's half of the drama left. Instead of focusing on the caught killer, the flow changed again, and i love it here. After watching the teaser for Ep. 9, it feels like the killer committed suicide? And even though he/she may have killed a lot of people, the killer Dong Sik has been looking for the past 20 years may actually be someone else? It just keeps getting better and better! I'm not bored for a minute when I watch this drama!

Last thing I've got to talk about is the chemistry between Dong Sik and Joo Won! OMG talk about tension! They were perfect, as rivals, friends, partners, whatever it was, they pulled it off together, and they did it so well! The first few eps, I was worried they'd stay as enemies slash colleagues-who-put-up-with-each-other-cause-they-are-cops-and-killing-one-another-is-illegal but Ep. 8 was a sigh of relief. They're going to team up and catch the killers that run havoc in Manyang and bring justice to the victims!

UPDATE:
Finished watching EPS 9 and 10 and omg so much happened! Someone else dies and it's heartbreaking... That ending scene of EP 10 was devastating yet the chemistry between Dong Shik and Joo Won is simply amazing. They would have made the best partners from the get-go but due to misunderstandings and pride and their stubbornness, we didn't get to see it, at least I hope until now. 'Cause finally Dong Shik acknowledged Joo Won as his partner (he said it in WORDS yasss!!!), and I didn't expect that hug at the end of EP 10 but it was beautiful and heart-wrenching at the same time. I want to say they're at last going to work together for real, but I thought the same thing last week for this week's eps... We've got 6 more eps until it ends, I hope we get a happy ending please!

All in all, I love this drama to bits! The genre, the plot, the castings, the bromance!! 100/100!!!

to me, this was a slow-paced mysterious crime drama. the first few eps were a bit too slow for me eventho i find the case interesting and makes me curious to know more. but at times it was just slow and draggy to the point that i once fell asleep already....and pelik sikitla ek cause cerita heavy en. i tried to think of the slow in like a slow-building curiousity to me but ah i cant :) i think only until the end of ep5 or 6 that i was getting thrilled and excited but not for long cause then after ep10 it was getting cliche, a bit boring and predictable too bcus of the problems with highers ups. anyways some culprits....ah i guessed it right so thats...not that fun anymore hahah. idky but there werent a lot of emotions that i felt while watching this so thats hmm i also dunno la. but i liked how the other characters have their own stories and secrets too and i enjoyed it moreee when i learned about them and that was when the twists for me happened. i also really enjoyed the casts in heree esp the two leads omg theur expressions were just amazingggg. loveee the relationship between them too! the cinematography was also outstanding and it played such a huge role in making the me felt thrilled. the ending was greatt satisfying. but yea to conclude, its still a very nice drama but its still just average for me

The best Korean drama in years
Beyond Evil is an intricate psychological mystery thriller redefining itself with every twist and turn before driving it home with its finale bombshell. The script is so well-woven and nuanced that almost every line contributes to the plot and character development and it is filled with Easter eggs that come out to punch you in the gut (or pelt you) when you least expected it. We are all monsters (the Korean name of the drama is literally “Monster”) regardless of the extent of our sins. While revealing the sins of others, we have to cover up our own sins too.

Many things are not black and white or fair in this world. Life is full of injustice, grievances, stereotypes and discrimination, sometimes through no fault of our own. Sometimes, we just become victims without reason. While many crime dramas usually focus on the spectacle and evil of serial murders, Beyond Evil looks far beyond this and lets us into the painful world of missing persons’ families who are left behind. Without a corpse, there is no crime and there can be no closure. Yet, within their pain, there is still hope. Hope in that one day their family member will return again alive and well. Hope in that one day justice will be served to the perpetrators of their pain. And it is probably this hope that has carried them till this day.

The plot, character development and character parallels in this Korean drama are near impeccable and it is not until the final scene where you really see everything and almost every character come full circle. I have never seen any other K-drama do all these without any major plot and character loopholes. This drama definitely deserves all the accolades it got from this year’s Baeksang Arts Awards, the biggest TV award show in Korea - “Best Drama”, “Best Screenplay” for the brilliant female scriptwriter Kim Su Jin and “Best Actor” for the phenomenal lead actor Shin Ha Kyun.

It is also with these reasons that Lee Dong Sik is my favourite TV male character till date. He is such a layered character that was acted so masterfully by Shin Ha Kyun. When I heard about this drama, almost everyone was raving about Shin’s acting online. I started watching this drama with humble expectations for his acting since great reviews are usually overrated to me and I have only seen him in small though notable special appearances on the Korean films I have watched previously (The Thieves, Extreme Job). But Shin really blew it out of the park for me. Never in my wildest imagination did I expect to become his fan from this drama and I just feel sad that I came to his party this late. Beyond Evil is Shin’s acting masterclass and is probably his best performance in his 23-year long career. It really is no surprise that he is known as “The God of Acting” in Korea. If you watch his interviews, his real personality is a far cry from Lee Dong Sik or any of his other characters. He is a quiet, shy and humble man of a few words known amongst reporters to be difficult to interview. But a whole load of acting talent (which he never admits to) lies beneath all of his shyness. I now sincerely struggle to thoroughly enjoy the acting of other Korean male lead actors in K-dramas after Beyond Evil. This is how good he was in the drama.

With such casting perfection, it is only under the deft hands of the gifted female director Shim Na Yeon (who is a fan of Shin) that almost every nuanced expression of Shin was captured with all their unflinching instability, brokenness and even beauty. The cinematography of this drama is just so immaculate and even contributes to misdirecting the audience on many occasions. I am sure this young and talented director will go far.

The supporting cast was also amazing overall, especially Choi Dae Hoon as Park Jeong Je and Heo Sung Tae as Lee Chang Jin (many will recognise him from the The Age of Shadows film and Squid Game). I will definitely be watching out for them in future productions.

The drama’s original soundtracks are also amongst the best I have listened to so far and they have been on replay for 5 months now. The OSTs were always on point during the drama and added flavour to the world of Manyang and its people.

Beyond Evil is a story about human nature, morality, justice, grief, self-sacrifice, redemption and hope. But it is also a story about what being a family really means. Set in a small-town world of serial murders, it was surprising how much heart there is in this drama. Yet, it refuses to be cliched and predictable with the constant plot twists dropping your jaw and derailing you almost every single time.

“Eat well, sleep well, poop well.” is a powerful line which recurred twice in the drama. In Shin Ha Kyun’s words, “In reality, that’s all it is. That’s what life is all about.”.

It is a real pity how such a quiet masterpiece is not getting the international recognition it truly deserves although it is on Netflix (not a Netflix original). Nevertheless, Beyond Evil is my favourite Korean drama till date and will be a tough one to beat. This drama burns deep within my heart and soul. But it is only with pain that there can be hope.

One of the best dramas EVER!
What to say about this drama that completely escapes the cliché? I have never seen such a complex story in my life, full of plot twists, minutely interconnected events. And the best thing is that even being a story full of details, they managed to show us all these details in just 16 episodes. Your head fills with theories. It fills with outbreaks because all the time you think one is the culprit, because all the time someone appears who took actions that impact the main story. The entire cast's performances were perfect, but the one that caught my attention the most was Yeo Jin-Goo. His performance was FLAWLESS! We could feel from here all the emotions that the character felt through his performance.
Each episode that ended was a different impact.

In short: a perfect drama, with a perfect story, with a perfect cast and a perfect acting!

I started Beyond Evil expecting a dark, twisty crime drama. I got something even better. Because while the show delivers a solid thriller plot, at its heart it’s a love story. Not a romance, but a close character study of deeply traumatized people fighting like hell for justice, absolution, and each other. The entire cast is excellent, but the real fireworks happen whenever Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo are on screen together. Their frenemy partnership is one of the most explosive actor pairings I’ve seen in years, a raw, bruising encounter of open emotional wounds as two people from very different worlds discover just how similar they are.

Most murder mysteries focus on solving the crime, but this one explores the damage left behind – the way friendships and communities fray, the guilt of survivors, the difficulty of finding closure, the fact that neither vengeance nor arrests are ever really “enough.” The show also recognizes that atonement is an action taken, not a gift bestowed. It never lets its characters escape responsibility for their choices, but it also grants the option of redemption. There is a lot of darkness in this world, but it suggests that even at our most broken, we are worthy of love and capable of grace.

I'm not really into Police murder serial cases. This was good because it didn't really show bodies. I was able to tolerate most of it. I love the actor Yeo Jin Goo in anything he does, he is such a great actor so when I see that he is in the main lead, I know the character he portrays will be believable. Shin Ha Kyun, I have seen him in many dramas and I love him. The storyline was good. The visual was not bloody... bloody! Well, only hands here and there... not something you would have a nightmare about. No romance is this... mmm not used to that. The ending I love!

Impressive Thriller
Have to say at the beginning 2 - 3 episodes storytelling gave the impression of cat - mouse chase only to subvert it later by adding layers of plot twists in realistic way. So do watch for at least 4 episodes before considering to drop altogether, it's a slow burn. Both the leads does fall under some greyish morals making is more interesting to watch.

Cast performance especially shin ha kyun is outstanding making all more realistic to watch, happy to hear he won the award. More than story, the show draws it strength from the conversations and powerful dialogues between leads and characters. Hope to see more thrillers with power pack performances in near future.

Beyond Evil is beyond your average thriller
Beyond Evil is a great example of how to take a simple concept and absolutely run with it. Between the exemplary acting, tight writing and numerous twists and turns along the way, this Korean drama is easily one of the best shows of the year.

Given the simplicity of the story, it’s actually quite impressive that the series adds layers of twists while also making sure there are no plot holes left behind either. Every single character has an alibi, a place to be and – more importantly than that – a motive for killing. In fact at one point there are 8 different possible suspects!

Beyond Evil is amazingly consistent and efficient in its writing; it not only manages to keep episodes compact yet compelling, it also manages to keep up the suspense for its full 16 episodes, which is a big deal. The OST was used skillfully as well.

My Rating : 8.5/10

In my quest to find another drama for the family to watch, I came across the positive reviews of this one and boy, I was not disappointed! This drama took twists and turns without compromising on the character development or storyline. You think you know the answer only for it to take you somewhere else. Each cast member did such a good job portraying their character, and for once, the ending of a drama didn't leave me feeling dissatisfied (of course, I wanted more, but that's a different story). It can be a bit slower-paced, but the details are so intricate and well-done. Definitely give it a go if you enjoy murder mysteries!

Don't Fall While You're Sitting at the Edge of Your Seat
This drama is like a rock you push off a tall mountain -- once gravity kicks in, the rock gets faster and faster, building up unstoppable momentum until it reaches its inevitable end and crashes with a big, exciting explosion. I found myself quickly hooked into this show and constantly wanting to know more: why did a character do what they did? What is the identify of this person everyone is searching for? How does this new information fit into the grand scheme of things? The show answers these questions as quickly as it creates new ones. It is a thrilling ride.

Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo absolutely kill it with their performances. Lee Dong Shik is one part genius, one part jaded, and one part creepy -- a veritable mastermind who will have you second guessing his motives from episode to episode. Han Joo Won is a relentless, naive, boy scout who is a natural foil to the years of life experience that Dong Shik brings to the table. Together, they dynamic brings a very compelling perspective to guide you into exploration of the murder mysteries that the show covers and the themes exploring humanity and the meaning of law order. Throughout the series, I had no real sense of how the characters were going to evolve nor how the story was going to end, and I think that's a good thing. The unpredictability of this show gives it a unique quality and it definitely avoids the feeling of a cliched ""good guy vs bad guy"" story.

The one, minor flaw is that this production does suffer a little from the ""ending part is not as great as the beginning part"" that most Kdramas seem to experience. I found the ending just a little too tidy and the final episode just felt a tad too rushed for my tastes. However, I think the drama is very cohesive: from beginning to end, its characters are very consistent, yet show change and growth in ways that you might expect for people that go through the experiences that they did. Moreover, the themes and values explored come full circle and have a satisfying conclusion. Overall, this is a much watch in my opinion.

Good luck to those who want to watch this show, it's been weeks and I still haven't been able to move on. It's so so good, anyone who fancies a good murder mystery should give this a go. But also, this show is so much more than that. The amount of character growth portrayed and how much they have explored the various themes throughout the show, the level of detail involved and the parallels- oh my god I caught so many new things during my second rewatch, and I'm the type who never rewatches any shows. Just watch the show, it is really good and the writer clearly put a lot of thought into this. Just watch it, and even if you find a certain character to be a bit annoying at first, give them a chance, it definitely gets better.

Everyone has their own evil inside
Watching this drama after BLACKPINK Jennie mentioned it, and got even more curious after this drama won in three categories at Baeksang Award. Using the usual crime thriller plot where the characters had to find a serial killer, Beyond Evil is like any other dramas. But, there is one thing that made this drama very memorable to me. Shin Ha Kyun's smile in the first episode and how it influenced my view on his character. My first impression was ""Lee Dong Shik is a creep"", because we have yet to know the depth of his character so I was suspicious of him too, and then through every episode it was shown that Lee Dong Shik is just 'crazy' not cruel, making me understand his character. This drama made me judge the characters by their gesture, appearance, and a glimpse of their questionable words, it felt like I was analyzing people. Episode 6 is definitely the reason why this drama was named 귀물 (Monster) and Beyond Evil in english, Kang Jin Mook as the serial killer is such an interesting point of the drama. He appeared as the weak-looking guy who stutter when speaking, manipulated the viewers to believe that he was not the type to do such thing until the story unfolds from his perspective. I agree with one of the reviews where it said that every dialogue of this drama carries weight. The last episode showing Lee Dong Shik smiling to Han Joo Won just like in the first episode, but it gave you the impression of warming, completely different from our impression to the first episode, that is also my most favorite part about this drama. If there is one thing that I find regrettable, it's the fact that Han Joo Won didn't respond Lee Dong Shik's banmal by calling him ""hyung"" haha love them bromance

A Dark Psychological Crime Thriller
BEYOND EVIL was an insanely good drama. Going into it, I really had no expectations set and so I was very pleased to realize this was going to be a stellar drama. I realized that right off the bat. It wasn’t hard to guess it would turn out to be great, given the super great acting, intriguing storyline and mystery, and awesome music. The first episode was very compelling. There was so much to love about this show. It was very addictive and masterfully executed. This isn’t your run of the mill crime kdrama by far.

Being a psychological thriller, and featuring a lot of crime, involving some gruesome murders and some graphic and highly emotional scenes, this series is rather dark and certainly not for everyone. It has a way of getting in your head and under your skin, without being classified horror. However, the complexity of this drama is pretty mind blowing. Definitely a series to try if you enjoy dark, gritty, psychological crime thrillers.

While there certainly is crime, murder, mystery, intrigue and heavy psychological elements, this drama is wholly original in flavor and it’s hard to peg down why. Certainly the two male leads (Shin Ha-kyun as the jaded and misunderstood Lee Dong Shik, and Yeo Jin-gu as the determined and incorruptible Han Ju Won) are fantastic actors with definite on-screen chemistry. Though the story is non-romantic, and not sexual in nature, the two partners gradually form a deep bond hard to describe. They grow from enemies to partners to true friends, of course, but the platonic bond they later share is something truly powerful. Possibly result of a shared trauma, or a trauma bond. Either way it’s incredibly moving. A Bromance unlike any other, especially in this genre.

The story itself was excellent and kept me on the edge of my seat. The entire drama is a rollercoaster ride, from one thrilling point to the next. The characterizations were great and memorable. There were so many likable characters besides the main leads, and all were so well written and existing in various shades of grey. I really loved the connections and friendships between the people of the small town. Great casting and great acting. On top of all that, the visuals, cinematography, script, music, it was all top notch. This show makes you feel so much. Just prepare for a wild ride. I really hope there will be another season/series soon.

The story itself does not focus only on ""who is the culprit"", but also delves into the psychology of the characters behind the incident and the families of the victims who were left behind the relationships between the characters and the townspeople are (the main story here). So, you need to understand the gist of this drama especially the 'psychological' aspect rather than watching it for 'thriller' and some brutal scenes. The cast was so good that I couldn't help but love them all even if I knew they were the bad guys.
The only drama that doesn't have plot holes. I like the way the writer told each story in detail. There is no question left unanswered, everything is neatly written.
This drama will make you feel every emotion you may not have felt before. For example: respect, plot, suspense, relief, regret, nostalgia, fear, suspense, blood; You can feel it. They also highlight the importance of friendship, partnership, work ethic, family relationship (even bad guys love their kids), the importance of letting go and moving forward, the importance of making a rational judgment, and so much more that I can't list.
I totally recommend this drama.

THERE'S THINGS THAT CAN'T BE LEFT FOR THE LAW TO HANDLE
Watching Beyond Evil is the equivalent of being handed a very frayed and old yet warm quilt, sewn together colorful patches and scraps collected from the past. The kind of quilt you wrap around on a cold, rainy day while you read your favorite book or a movie from your childhood, while also slowly picking away at the fraying ends of the quilt until the entire quilt unravels over time and all your left with are the strands of the past. Beyond that, there aren't many words I can use to describe my feelings for this beautiful drama, but I will try my hardest. Also, I did mark this review as containing spoilers but I feel like the ones I do mention are very small and insignificant, and I don't think they give away too much.

First, I want to begin talking about the two main leads of this drama, Lee Dong Shik (Shin Ha Kyun) and Han Joo Won (Yeo Jin Goo), because quite frankly, I don't think there would even be a story here to tell without them. At first, they appear to be another iteration of a common dynamic we often see in detective shows: an older detective who is probably been demoted or is considered a loose-cannon, or even both, and then a younger detective who has a strong sense of justice and is perhaps more mild-mannered compared to their partner. In this case, I would say these roles can still be applied to the two main leads of Beyond Evil but also...not quite, only because Beyond Evil really subverts your expectations for these characters and everyone else in the drama, for that matter. Keep in mind that one of the most important messages of Beyond Evil is that everything is not as it seems. Yes, Lee Dong Shik is considered to be the loose cannon of the substation, but at the core of his character is anger: white-hot and unyielding, all because of the injustice he and his family, especially his sister, have gone through. There's also a kindness within him, too, as he tries to prevent anyone else from getting hurt as he and his family did. (I don't want to call Lee Dong Shik the mom-friend but I also do want to call Lee Dong Shik the mom-friend. Sorry.) And yes, Han Joo Won is calculating and cold and seems to be almost willing to do anything for the sake of justice, but his character is slowly unpacked as the show goes on and we see that there is a fear that holds him back from being anything more than emotionally distant.

The relationship, too, between Lee Dong Shik and Han Joo Won is so incredibly important to me; I will be keeping the two of them close to my heart for a while. I think they have the kind of relationship where actions speak louder than words and the fact that they gave up so much for each other, that Lee Dong Shik broke down Han Joo Won's walls in a matter of months just makes me feel so crazy. There was SO much attention to detail given to their relationship, things like the way they addressed each other, physical contact, and how they would parallel or mirror each other's actions. Especially that scene at the end, where it is revealed that Han Joo Won has been spending a lot of time combing through the mountains and other rural areas in search of people with dementia or disabilities who have gotten lost, much like how Lee Dong Shik did before him. POETIC CINEMA. Also, these two had no sense of personal space whatsoever and I love that for them. Despite the biting words and back-handed compliments between them, I think they truly grew to care for each other - I mean, telling someone to 'eat well, sleep well, and poop well' is actually something that can be so intimate - and it was this amount of care that made Beyond Evil so compelling.

Speaking of Han Joo Won, I just want to comment on a few things about his character that will hopefully help me segue into some other things I really want to talk about. For the first four or five episodes, I was really frustrated with him, as I was with a lot of characters in this show *cough cough* Lee Dong Shik *cough cough* but kind of in the way that you get frustrated with a family member or a friend as you're watching them make a stupid decision. Lovingly frustrated. At first, I wasn't really sure what to think of Han Joo Won. He kind of gave off the vibe of [standing-man emoji], and then [standing-man emoji who also gets eggs thrown at him.] Of course, I didn't know that my perception of him was about to be subverted, and for that, I really applaud the writers - I don't like static main characters. And then, of course, there were those moments towards the beginning when Han Joo Won started going around suspecting and accusing everyone, which is when my frustration with him hit its peak. Basically, the first four or five episodes went something like this:

Han Joo Won: I've connected the dots.
Basically Everyone in Manyang: You didn't connect shit.
Han Joo Won: I've connected them.

However, I think the fact that the writer - Kim Soo Jin - chose to have Han Joo Won go around suspecting everyone really connects to another sentiment expressed by the police officers of Manyang, and that is the idea of suspecting everyone in order to no longer suspect them, which really helps to demonstrate how Han Joo Won is able to acclimate to living in a rural area after living in Seoul and is able to make these connections with some of the townspeople and his coworkers. I absolutely love the concept of exploring differences between rural and urban life, and I think this show would have been a whole lot different if it had been set in Seoul instead of Manyang, especially because it really helped to draw in all the characters together.

Another concept/theme of the show I liked was the concept of food. It is one of my deepest beliefs that the action of serving another or making another food is in itself a love language and that it can definitely be used as a metaphor for love. There are so many examples of that here in Beyond Evil that I don't think I even have time to write about them all. There are just so many tender and touching moments where characters are reminding each other to eat well and sleep well and just in general lots of great moments where we can see them taking care of one another (the absolute found family of it all.) Also, I really loved the idea of the characters gathering around the Manyang Butcher Shop in times when they needed each other. (Yoo JaeYi, my beloved.)

Finally, the music and cinematography were both stellar. I loved the colors in this show, and that one scene of the reeds field during the daylight was absolutely breathtaking.

Okay, so, this review got really long. As far as things that I didn't quite like, I will be brief and just say that one particular subplot was not as satisfying for me to watch as everything else in the show, and I wasn't totally happy with how the subplot was wrapped up, but oh well. I don't think it impacted that enjoyment of the show too much.

Obviously, I have lots of thoughts and feelings about Beyond Evil. I will say that this is a show I could easily see myself re-watching again, almost in the same way that you can listen to a family member tell the same story over and over again, a story that is forged with love and sits in the bottom of your belly like a good meal. If you're in the mood for an excellent detective show with unique characters that break the mold and will leave a lasting impression on not only your memory but also your heart, then I definitely recommend giving Beyond Evil a chance.

""Who does not prevent the crime supports it.""
With Beyond Evil, I finally realized that I enjoy psychological crime thrillers more than romances. Though it was one of those dramas that received a momentary hype while on air, I decided to check it out as the reviews seemed promising.

Well, well. Akiyama Shinichi would be pretty proud.

Set in Manyang, a small, rural town where all its inhabitants are more like a real family, Lee Dong Shik, a police officer, has a few strange eyes on him. He was the suspect of a case from 20 years ago, a double event that included the murder of a girl and the disappearance of his own sister Lee Yu Yeon. The almost forgotten cold case is brought back to life with the transfer of Han Ju Won, the perfect, elite son of the ambitious Chief Superintendent of the Korean Police Force. Han Ju Won, unfortunately, has a plan. He is hell bent on getting Dong Shik proven guilty for his supposed crimes… while harboring a secret of his own.

I kid you not, this drama is not ""who is the culprit?"" kind as in Flower of Evil. It's a game of 'tag, you are it!' between two police officers who are forcibly paired up and have no choice but to work together, setting aside their differences. The first two episodes were a whirl of confusion as I desperately tried to make sense of what exactly was going on.

If you are a constant viewer of dramas, then the plot is definitely not much of a suspense -- it's quite predictable. It's the very web of intrigue and questions that tempt viewers to keep watching episode after episode.
It was also a didactic experience for me as it shed light on some of the 'stupid' laws that lets criminals get away. This is a strong shadow over the ""entire"" drama --- characters take actions while attempting to circumvent these laws.

Lee Dong Shik is without a doubt, the soul and star of this drama. The story is nothing without him. He knew his game well. The first few episodes of tag between him and Han Ju Won were absolutely riveting. His mind games and rhetoric questions made everyone doubt themselves and drove me mad. His dubious actions even more so. I loved how confident he was in his craft and how easily he managed to rile up the very egoistic Han Ju Won. It's my first time seeing this actor and I'm in complete awe of his performance. How can a human being portray so many emotions? That too, wild, intense and absolutely mind numbing once with such clarity and depth? All in the same episode? I could figure out his thoughts and actions within the first two episodes, but without Shin Ha Kyun, I highly doubt if Dong Shik would be receiving my approval.

Han Ju Won… ah, yes. I remember seeing a post about why nobody had killed him yet. His stickler for rules and his holier-than-thou attitude made me want to smack him at times. But, he wasn't a hypocrite and I'm glad that the writers didn't make him one. Rather, he was a victim of circumstances.
It's strange, but I loved how Dong Shik finally managed to rub off on him. Yeo Jin Goo has proved himself a versatile actor from his previous works. He did not disappoint.

Park Jeong Je, Dong Shik's best friend, is another worthy mention. And everyone from the Manyang Butcher shop.

The bromance is really slow burn. But, absolutely worth every second of your time. I loved seeing Dong Shik and Ju Won together. Their 'I refuse to tell you that I like you' attitude was highly endearing and fun to watch. Both of them had a terrible habit of blackmailing each other, and watching them attempt to untangle their own net traps shouldn't have been this enjoyable under normal conditions.

I was surprised by how much I liked Lee Chang Jin. A very, very, gray/bad/confused character, I mirrored his reaction multiple times. He had several valid points, but he was also too dumb to exist.

Every single character reached a point where they were pushed to the inevitable moment of making crucial decisions, and watching it unfold on screen was absolutely thrilling. The story veers towards a game of deception during the latter half and had several nail biting scenes that had be binging three episodes a day.

However, there are a few answers that were told just in passing, making it seem almost as if the writer had conveniently written them in to avoid leaving out any plot holes. This is starkly visible as we near the finale. And judging by the fixed episode duration and number, I am willing to forgive everything.

The Soundtrack is to die for. Music is the second most important aspect of a drama and even an average one can become a masterpiece if it has an excellent audio team.
I have 'Timeless by BIBI' and several background scores on repeat since the time I first heard them.

This is definitely one of the best dramas I've watched.
It is an absolute feast for people who love looking like the Pepe Silvia meme and enjoy racking their brains to make connections and assumptions. Its thrilling, emotional, engaging and absolutely riveting.

captivating
this drama was incredibly captivating. unfortunately, i accidentally stumbled upon a spoiler that kind of ruined my first viewing experience, at least for the first half of the show, so that was a bummer, but i was still heavily impressed by the intrigue that the drama was able to arouse in the viewer. is it him? oh. no, it's her right? i knew what happened but i was convinced by the show's narrative of pointing the finger at different individuals so much so that i questioned if the spoilers i read were true or if they were just theorising.

i do have to say, sometimes i found myself reading the subtitles but not really following, and found that i'd have to go back. it could be just me, and maybe i'm not used to dramas that have such an intricate storyline, but i think this is something that is avoidable if you pay attention well. it might not have helped that i typically watched this show before i would sleep.

i did enjoy dong shik and jun won's dynamic. not your typical chummy bromance, but their push and pull relationship only made those moments that they found comfort in one another feel more tender.

the ending did feel very slightly anti-climactic. i suppose it felt too neatly wrapped up, or maybe i felt sad that after all that occurred, dong shik and jun won appeared to not be so close. it makes sense that they wouldn't be, seeing age difference and distance, but it still makes me a little sad.

i'd highly recommend a rewatch. in fact, i think the show would be better as a rewatch. it should provide clarity and you may even notice some foreshadowing.

Interesting but draggy and a bit predicatable.
For me this series is a 8.5/10.

Firstly, seeing Yeo Jin Goo in the cast means, this drama would be worth watching, as he never picks normal scripts, his drama's are always interesting.

Secondly it's my first time watching Shin Ha Kyun, I had no idea who he was, but from the first episode onwards, I am blown away by his acting skills. His acting is phenomenal! Definitely one of the best actors in Korea, and his performance deserves accolades.

Third, it's obviously a thriller, with a plot that spans 21 years back, a small town involved with a lot of central characters, unfortunately for me, a thriller is not a real thriller if the plot is predictable at times. The drama definitely had it's twists but certain key plot points were predictable from very early on, hence the reason why my rating is 8.5 and not higher.

Forth, the strong point of this drama definitely is the unique bromance/relation between Yeo Jin Goo and Shin Ha Kyun's character. This relation is what drives this whole drama and makes this worth watching.

Lastly, the OST! was mind-blowing, kudos to whoever did it, brilliantly placed background music. I usually finish thrillers in 1 or 2 days max, but unfortunately as I found the plot a bit draggy, I took quite a few days of break in-between the episodes.

Definitely worth watching once, for the 2 ML's connection and the superb acting.

The perfect crime drama
Beyond Evil is one of my favorite TV series. The problem that Korean dramas often face is the head of an elephant and at the tail of a squirrel, but Beyond Evil is fascinating through each episode. From episode 1 to episode 6, the fanciful, ghostly atmosphere with hidden secrets made me frustrated. I have to say my mentality at that time was the same as Han Ju Won, annoyed because Dong Sik kept pretending to be crazy. However, after that, the film is like a sweet gift for those who persevere. The details are pushed to the climax in an extremely skillful way that makes my heart pound. I always wonder in my head, how can they make such a great movie. The soundtrack and color of the film are also very suitable for each scene.

What counts is the acting and chemistry of Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo. They're really good, they've subtly portrayed the characters' psychological changes. Even the characters Yoo Jae Yi, Kang Jin Mok, Nam Sang Bae and Park Young Je and Do Hae Won are also very special. Especially, even though Do Hae Won is a bit scary and crazy, I still can't take my eyes off her beauty.

A great movie, leaving a lot of feelings even after it ended

Not perfect, but interesting
I'm going to be honest here and very clear: this drama annoyed the pants off me! I love Kdramas, but I am finding again and again the same cliches dressed up as new, but in fact they are fundamentally unoriginal. It's a shame because other excellent qualities in the performances and production can be so deeply undermined.
The good points : excellent ensemble acting from all the cast; creation of a believable small community, imperfect, but perhaps unusually accepting and supportive; some believable character development for several individuals (though this is not consistent); creation of some complex characters where motives as well as thought processes are not transparent.
Irritations : the plot relies too much on flashbacks to reveal events instead of the discovery of evidence that can be used in court; flashbacks are used too liberally to manipulate the viewer and artificially create suspense - in fact they are the main medium for suspense as I recall it; the plot is made unnecessarily complex by revealing information out of sequence for no reason; some individuals at times respond in ways completely psychologically wrong for their character, even though they are under severe stress - I could not believe these would react in these ways, and these reactions seemed to me to be present only for effect; creation of suspense in the drama was also too dependent on heavy handed music; yet again we find every character with any substantial level of money, influence or power is entirely corrupt. This should not really count as a ""spoiler"" because it seems to be normal n Korean society, but I am tired of this cliche.
Would it be SO HARD to write a drama where the people who actually could help are in fact competent and HELPFUL? or at the very least well-meaning or even benign? Could we not see a drama where the villains are, in fact, villains? Why is it that only corruption is supposed to be interesting or believable? - it quickly becomes boring. Ordinary people are, I believe, far more interesting than these people who from the very start we can feel are deeply questionable: and professional villains, acting in their alternative society, can indeed be just as difficult to convict - more believable and thus more interesting than these tropes.
Come on Korea - give us some different flavours instead of the same old spicing. You are doing a disservice to your actors and directors.

End justifies the means , if you are ready to pay the consequences!
I really like the character of Butcher shop lady Yoo jae yi and The det. Oh ji wa , both of them were passionate, dignified , brave and fierce from the get go! I even liked the CEO of JL construction, who got sucked in the mess!
Initially I was really annoyed with the Lee Dong shik and Han Joo wan , former was like creepy nut case while latter was an arrogant Mr Know-it-all! Only later when I saw there backstory I was able to digest it!
But still it doesn't change the fact that Dong shik did a lot of creepy overacting at the start , I don't know if it was to make the drama more suspenseful or it was to mask his intelligence and plans from the foes!
What I disliked -
Drama at the start is highly manipulative to the extent that it would give you a headache, I think the reason for it is that the plot was worth only 10 episodes , but they had to somehow make 6 extra ep , and the way they did that was to fill the initial ep with unnecessary confusion and fillers!
In the first half in every ep they would convince you that this guy is the villain , but you know that this not going to be the case and hence becomes a waste of time and you lose interest the next time they repeat the same thing in the very next ep! I think they forgot the difference bw misdirection and misinformation!
What I liked -
The second half was good everything was in the right place & pace, even the traps were understandable , the way they worked as the team was exciting,
If they had done a better work in the first half and didn't use those cheap tricks , I think it might have turned out to be the best suspense K- drama ever. Even as it is now it is surely in my top 5 suspense cop dramas.

An amazing slow burn psychological investigation drama, this drama is craaaaazyy especially the first 10 episodes. The first 10 episodes, were amazingg I love every bit of it, it was slow and I hate slow dramas, but idk how to explain, the slowness of the drama kinda build up the curiosity and gives you this some kind of frustrating emotion yet you wanna know what happen next. The curiosity definitely definitely kills me, everyone has a secret and is so suspicious, I swear not a single character that I did not suspect to be the murderer or related to the case somehow. Oh, and worth pointing, the camera work omaigodd looveee the way they zoom to the face and just makes the character suspicious, yo it's killing meee. and of course, the amazing acting especially shin ha kyun just makes the drama even better. swear my brain hurts. but sadly, the last 6 episodes weren't as good anymore? since it was more about fighting with the ones with high power, it became mainstream, and I wasn't as curious or excited to watch the next episode anymore. Probably because the revealed the truth too early and making everything after that predictable. but anyways, since i enjoyed more than half of the series, i gotta give a high rating. love it

A very clever, simmering, at times disturbing, crime drama where one never knows quite what's coming next.
It doesn't have masses of blood, blockbuster style action scenes or romance, but it does have more than its share of shocking moments, an intelligent script, some laughs and what I found to be a gripping story.
I loved the characters; proper villains and a blurring of what makes a good detective. Tested friendships and what seems, at times, blind loyalty from some.
Dong Shik and Joo Won are polar opposites and neither trusts the other at all, for varying reasons that are slowly brought to light as the story grows. They have to work together though and so a relationship of trust/mistrust yo-yos with each episode.
The tragedies in several cast members' pasts are also uncovered and these link characters together in unexpected ways.
Almost everyone looks guilty at some point and the way in which key crime scenes are shown in multiple scenarios, to fit a given character's statement, is brilliant. It also makes it way harder to decide who's done exactly what.
Shin Ha Kyun is excellent in his portrayal of Dong-shik, veering from warm and funny, to maniacal in an instant. His whole face changes when he smiles, but the next minute he can look very scary!
Yeo Jin-goo gives a very understated performance of a character repressing a lot of his thoughts and feelings; no over acting here, thankfully!
The entire cast were great. I particularly felt for Jung Je, such a tormented character, so well played by Choi Dae-hoon. There are some really sycophantic, nasty and loathsome, as well as sweet, caring and strong, characters in this.
A great story with a solid ending.
Oh and I loved the trailing violin music, Bibi's 'Timeless' and gritty song, 'The Night' from Choi Baek-ho; perfect soundtrack.

Alright, where do I begin?

So… I actually not quite liking the first 5 episodes, though I was still continue watching it, I thought that the story was circling around and it was really annoying to watch. Plus, i don’t like how Yeo Jin Goo in act in those first episodes. He acted kinda awkward with his ‘oh-so-cold-and-mysterious’ character, I think he just wasn’t suited with that kind of character ?. And the ending too… I think it’s too abrupt, the resolution was only being told by some news in the tv? Like… c’mon it could have been better.

But, you know what? I eventually end up loving this drama, lol. There were some really great moments from mid to end. Well, especially in the middle. At some points, I thought I was still stuck watching around episode 9-10, but turns out I was already at episode 14 lmao ? because the middle was so more-ish(?) and I can’t take my eyes off my screen.

As I’ve said above, I don’t like the first 5 episodes. I thought this drama would took the usual dragging route, just like some of kdramas in this kind of genre. Well, until I realized that Beyond Evil is actually a slow-burn character-driven drama. That’s why the plot rely heavily on the characters. And I think the actors really does a good job on potraying their roles, especially Shin Ha Kyun. That man is a beast. His acting is just as magnificent as ever, dang. His chemistry with other actors (especially Yeo Jin Goo) is really damn great, I don’t even have a word to describe it.

And… speaking about Yeo Jin Goo, as I’ve said before, he was kinda awkward in the first few episodes. The good thing is, from mid to end, his character has some kind of switch and becomes more ‘humane’, and Yeo Jin Goo’s acting suddenly become really good, and I guess maybe it was because he suits the more ‘humane’ character ??‍♀️.

If I have to mention a western series similar to this…. maybe Mare of Easttown? Both kinda has the same formula, but Beyond Evil is the longer version of it. Well, all in all, Betond Evil is still a very solid kdrama. If you don’t like of how ‘heavy’ this drama is, just watch for the acting, I promise it won’t disappoint you.

After recent attempts to find a good crime series (that hasn't already been seen), finally came across this one that was enjoyable from beginning to the end.

This is one where in addition to your fantastic mains, all of the other actors also did a great job with their roles so it didn't feel like anyone was pulling any heavy weight for the rest. The plot maintained enough suspense to keep the momentum going and the pacing worked well. Unlike many others in its genre, there wasn't any glaring or obvious issues with how the crimes scenes were managed and it doesn't rely on excess dramatization to keep it interesting. Although some actions/reactions didn't always seem to fit the characters, it's easy to overlook because we in the real world aren't always rational.

The minor disconnect I had was they tried to interweave too many players into the underlying plot without providing enough background/focus on some of them. They gave just enough for you to see the connections but not enough for you to really feel them, if that makes sense. Because of this, it can slightly feel as if the plot drags on for just a bit at times. Nevertheless, the character developments were done well and the dynamic between Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo in itself makes it worthwhile to check out.

~One of the best slow burn psychological crime thriller to have come out in Korean dramas
~Shin Ha Hyun’s acting chops is mind-blowing! He gives you the creeps, makes you hate him, cry for him, pity him and love him.
~The plot is nothing new to serial murders and crime thrillers but the execution and plot reveal bits by bits adding psychological point of view and a touch of dark humor is what has made all the difference
~Yoo Jin Goo and the remaining cast are able to deliver emotionally raw performances as well with the best of the dialogues at hand
~The push and pull between the two male leads and the character growth by the end of the drama is really wholesome and surprising
~The portrayal of mentally unstable characters and untrustworthy POVs is another high point as well
~Props to the jazz music OST that fits perfectly with the eerie vibes of the drama

Mixed feelings
I just finished the series and I truly don't know how to feel about it.
I'm going to start with the positive stuff - the cast, acting and soundtrack are all perfect. I especially applaud the actors, who played Juwon and Dongsik - outstanding performances from the both of them. The soundtrack flows beautifully and is just perfect for this series.
However, the story is quite messy and I questioned a lot of the characters' actions. The show falls flat after episode 8, but gets better again after episode 13. Episodes 9-12 were painfully boring to watch. The plot in general is quite hard to follow and confusing, that's why I'm rating the rewatch value at a 10, because then you can rewatch it and try to piece this confusing story together with the context of the characters' motivations and goals. The plot got predictable at times to the point the plot twists could be seen coming from a mile away. The show also left me with some questions, but the most common word in those questions was why. Why did dongsik say nothing when he realised who killed minjeong? Why do none of the characters trust each other? Why did kihwan not stop when he saw yuyeon on the road?
And most importantly, how did they get yuyeon's body in the wall without dongsik knowing? (not a why question but still).
Although this series was frustrating to watch at times, I will happily return to it to give it another chance.

Came for the actors and stayed for the characters!
I watched the entire show in 2 days. That says a lot for me because I take my time when I watch Tv shows. I mostly just let the story unravel itself as the characters slowly weave their way into my heart but with 'Beyond Evil' I couldn't bring myself to wait.


1. ACTING- The actors are the biggest strength of this show and I don't just mean the main leads.
The MLs though, on top of being ridiculously handsome, the way they played their roles is what made me swoon over them and excitedly wait for them to appear on the screen. I would smile wide everytime and then when they were on together, don't get me started! The tension and vibe *everytime* (which is kind of the key word here) got me jumping and clapping like a seal. (No exaggeration).
Every character holds a place in your heart and all the credit goes to the casting! It really was an amazing bunch. Their ""FRIENDSHIP"" is really heartwarming to watch, the way they care for each other and come together, you cannot help but fall in love with them.

2. BROMANCE- It's kind of all that I need in a show sometimes and this show gives you all kinds of feels. The relationship between the two MLs starts off as a storm, definitely makes you question your choice and wonder whether there is any bromance in the show at all but as the episodes progress, its unravels very beautifully and then makes your heart melt. It easily was one of the most angsty bromances I've watched and I cannot explain the emotional rollercoster they put me through together.
There is one more pair in the show, mostly in the background, but it surely pulls your strings in a different way.

3. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT- I REALLY loved the characters- if it isn't already obvious. And I'm a sucker for character development and this show definitely gives you some major turns. It kind of becomes the base of the show.

4. MUSIC AND PRODUCTION- It's very believable and really pulls you in, especially the parts where the puzzles start to fit in place.

5. STORY- It's not particularly the best story, sure there's suspense and some emotional and shocking components but it's not that unpredictable. The serial killer trope is what I came for but the show halfway through loses that concept. I'm not complaining. I don't even consider it as a big disadvantage, like I said the characters totally manage to make you forget all about the plot issues and just make you want more.
A few episodes are messy- not the best but no show is ever perfect. There are no filler episodes though, each moment is important to the story but it gets a little messy half way through. Maybe 2 episodes somewhere in the middle but it's still enough to keep your interest hooked.

6. Shin Ha Kyun. His eyes. I'm just putting it there. You'll know when you watch the show. His character is extraordinarily selfless.

SO, YES! It's an amazing show. Definitely worth a watch. Just continue watching even if it feels slow because the characters really don't let you drop the show and just make you want more.

Have fun!

Deserve the Baeksang Award
I can't asked for a better crime thriller drama. Beyond Evil, honestly exceeded beyond my expectations. Both Yeo Jin Goo and Shin Ha Kyun gave their best performance. Not only that, I love the flow of the storyline. The show had two parts divided equally and perfectly. Episode 1 to 8 contains the first part while episode 9 to 16 holds the 2nd part. And how they relate both parts so perfectly is really amazing. Would have give them a 10 if only they didn't hinted the loveline between Han Ju Won and the girl (can't remember her name) towards the end. I just think that it wasn't necessary for them to put it in but nonetheless it was really good and amazing.

A profound and poignant series.
I have to say that Korean series excel in thriller, suspense and detective genre.
Here I must say that this overall has a superb production, direction and themes are dark which goes in line with the story being told.

We discover a small town supposedly quiet but with a name attached to a bloody and heavy history.
This story goes back to a series of disappearances and murders that happened 20 years earlier.
I must say that the direction is great, we got flashbacks at the most critical moments, the tension is at its height and these flashbacks not being omniscient, they can be misleading and leave us with lots of questions for the future.
So we have a narration of the facts of 20 years ago in parallel with the resurgence of this case which has never been resolved in current day.
A young detective, not so innocent as that, takes the initiative to continue this case, which leads to an unfortunate situation and the plot becomes more complicated. Especially since it turns out that one of the suspects from 20 years ago is now one of the small town police, and he's as dark and deranged as his reputation suggests.

I'll leave the plot here, without saying more, but I must tell you that the story and script were very well written, especially to highlight the acting of the characters.

Having dark tones, the main characters are just as dark, especially those of the small town, who carry a heavy sadness, a lot of pain due to the disappearances and the questions that have never been answered.
Over the course of the series, we begin to suspect everyone - which often happens in detective series - and sometimes with good reason.

The character of Shin Ha Kyun is overwhelming, he is very complex, intelligent and raw, we can feel his pain, his hopes and doubts. He definitely deserves his Best Actor - Television at 57th Baeksang Arts Awards. His character is striking, and it is difficult to forget such a performance.

He is joined in this series with a young actor, Yeo Jin Goo, who plays the young detective ready to stir up the past. Who also delivers a beautiful performance, his character struggles a lot in the series, to know who to trust, but above all how to discover the truth. He has amazing chemistry with Shin Ha Kyun.

For the secondary characters, they are all equally mysterious, complex and their characters have been well written and acted.

To sum up, if you like good productions, plot and character driven, in very dark, mature and complex police and human tones. Then this series is for you.

Questioning the real monster within
If you've watched Flower of Evil and feel like filling that void, then watch Beyond Evil - it doesn't have the romance, but it sure has whole lot of emotional intensity.

The show that is 괴물/'gwimul' which translates to 'Monster' in Korean, gives the viewer food for though into our perception of malevolence and that there may be more than meets the eye when we bring ourselves to search for the root of all evil.
The drama has been brilliantly executed. The entanglement of past and present relationships and how this acts as a catalyst for character development is commendable; tremendous writing by Kim Soo Jin.

I adored Yeo Jin Goo in the past, but this show has left me with so much respect for him as an actor. Shin Ha-Kyun's performance was flawless as it is and their chemistry amazing, but Yeo Jin Goo's character development left me dumbfounded.
In all honestly, I was never a fan of crime/psychological thrillers before entering k-drama world and I only ever watch such shows in Korean as I find their execution much more cinematic. This drama left me with a teaching of the sort about the reality of the line between good and evil actually being a mirage and that the root of such evil may be closer than you think.

Definitely worth a watch, especially for those of you into this genre.

I finished this drama last night and was going to drop this after the fifth episode. It wasn't a bad thriller, some episodes were just really really slow.

I like a good mystery every now and then and this series had my mouth gaped open on several moments. What I thought was what I thought wasn't what I thought. A part of that had my nerves on end while the rest I was like OK, I see where they're going with this.

I went in watching this not being familiar with the main male lead. I remember seeing the second male lead in a drama but couldn't remember what I seen him in which and it led me to finding what I seen him in that was driving me nuts. I seen him in Giant. He was just a teenager at that time though.
His character choice sort of grated my nerves. It was a back and forth for the most of the series. At some points I was thinking seriously, make up your mind which way you want to go!

From the dramas I've seen so far within a year, it was hard for me to get use barely seeing any comedy or fighting. Everything was really serious so it was a bit different from what I usually watch.

I would've given this a lower score but the last few episodes really drew me in and I almost bawled at one on point. If a drama can get me to do that then I would say it's alright in my book.

Okay, it’s really good, but…
Wow. Um. So this show is really good. The central relationship and acting are just SO good that you can just gloss over everything else. But I feel like I want to highlight both the good and not-so-good.
Good:
-Fresh take on the typical thriller/serial killer plot. Firstly, rather than the typical antagonistic clash between the pair of detectives due to personality differences, one of them literally thinks the other is the murderer. And the other thinks he’s an idiot. It’s great! Secondly, the main serial killer plot wraps up a little over halfway, but the show keeps going. I was impressed by how the show still had unanswered questions and so even once the central mystery was solved there was still more to uncover. It was really engaging (mostly). Third, this show focuses a lot on this small town and all the close relationships, and you get the sense that these people would cover up for each other if they did something wrong, so that lends weight to your suspicions towards them.
-Characters. Many of them are very well fleshed out, primarily the main two but also quite a bit of the rest of the cast. Especially the main group in Munju. It feels like an ensemble piece, at least during the first half.
-Relationships. The main two’s relationship is of course the highlight, and they have so much chemistry it’s ridiculous. Whenever the two of them are onscreen it is *chef’s kiss*. But all the other friendships and relationships get their screen time and I love the group of police buddies. I love it when they all meet up at the butcher shop.
-Acting. I have to point out Shin Ha Kyun in particular, he was really amazing. He’s such an interesting character, and I don’t how to describe what “good acting” is but if you asked me I’d just show a scene from this show and say “Him.” Everyone else is great too.
The not-so-good stuff:
No sections here, because it’s just one thing: the plot. Oof. Okay, the first half or so of this show is well written. The plot twists are good as you learn more information about the series of events. You suspect almost everyone at some point, and then it still turns out to be someone else. It’s a good mystery and thriller. As mentioned above, once the serial killer gets caught, there are still things to unravel. Initially, something happens so you can’t uncover any more information from a certain character. Then they pull the same sh*t again with another character. Not that this wasn’t meaningful or impactful, but at that point it started to feel more like it was done to extend the plot. Then a certain plot twist happens and you’re like “oh wow!” Then another frickin plot twist happens and you’re like “… oh wow.” Basically I feel like we could have skipped maybe one or two plot twists. They felt more like “ahahaha plot twist ?” rather than “plot twist ?.” The ultimate “whodunnit” felt a little meh to me because who gives a crap about that person? So the last ~5 episodes are weaker than the ones preceding them. They start to focus on characters you don’t care about and the Munju crew get relegated to the background. It focuses less on the small town and the characters and more on, uh, “police corruption” I guess. Don’t get me wrong, it was still mostly good (though the few episodes where they pull those plot twists were kind of eye roll inducing). The plot twists also happen during flashbacks for some reason rather then when our characters actually discover the facts, which I feel like is a weird writing decision. They still did a good job on focusing on the main two characters, and the ultimate whodunnit is probably written that way to help focus on the main relationship, but it still felt oddly forced. The last few episodes also have some, uh, plot holes in them (I guess we didn’t need to gather evidence after all, cause we gotta wrap this plot up! Oh shoot, that character got in trouble, jk we need them for the plot so they’re free now), but the final scenes with our main two are so excellent it really left me with a very good impression of the show, despite being very tempted to give this a lower rating.
I definitely do recommend this show. Would I rewatch it? Maybe the first half-ish and the last episode. It’s an excellent show, truly, but I just think the plot has some major weak spots.
P.S. Park Jung Je :”(

Evil that wont keep you on your toes, but feels more like a barefoot walk on asfalt.
First rule of K-thriller don't trust anyone and definitely not what you think you saw..,

This is an interesting story with a very logical development its consistent, its realistic, its interesting and the acting and characters are flawless.

I loved the different relationships in this dram they are complex, they develop and they are pron to change. Strong bonds stretched to their limits and you could truly feel the pain the characters felt when someone close to them turned out to have a dark secret or two. Can one mistake erase 30 years of friendship?

This drama addresses several important issues and does it beautifully. Main point being taking responsibility for ones actions and the snowball effect of trying to hide ones actions and the people who make evil possible. However it didn't really keep me on my toes and at times I felt the series it self gave out spoilers a bit to soon making many of the plot twists a bit to predictable at the same time as I had to have in mind not to trust what I saw.

So if you are looking for something thrilling that will constantly keep you on your toes you might want to look elsewhere, if you want some consistent pace high quality storytelling and acting with corruption, a serial killer and really bad parenting this is definitely the place to go.

This series is definitely worth the watch, but keep your expectations on an even level so you don't get disappointed

Munju deception
The characters and setting are introduced through both the present as well as 20 years ago and some parallels are drawn from that,every person in this drama behaves shady which makes the suspense go through the roof and combined with the great OST makes the show very captivating to say the least.The two 2 mains leads are great especially Shin Ha Kyun which is my first time seeing him,he gives of that Joker,Hannibal vibe which is very hard to pull of without seaming fake,the supporting actors also do an awesome job with a few of them being shockingly good at hiding their true motives,easily the best drama in the first half of 2021 in my opinion.

Beyond Evil There's Justice
I really enjoyed watching this drama. It was a rollecoaster of emotions and it kept me on the edge of my seat because of the plot twists. The acting is stellar, everyone did an amazing job with their roles.

I also kind of liked it that no romantic lovelines were forced but I was lowkey rooting for Ju Won and Jae Yi. I think they would look good together in a romcom. I find the actress who played her beautiful.

Even though this is a dark drama, I'd recommend this to others and it is worth a second watch for me. The ending is satisfying, with a hint of sadness, which I think is also the best way to end it.

Overall, I give Beyond Evil a 9/10. It was a good watch.

Shin Ha Kyun is Excellent is all you need to know!
This is my 1st Korean crime drama, and it did not disappoint. Excellent cast, especially Shin Ha Kyun, playing Lee Dong Sik. really good plot It has me by the seat of my pants most episodes. It reminded me of all the British crime dramas I love. The tension I felt watching was palpable. Each episode my adrenaline was high, well up to the point when they catch the serial killer.

The reason I'm giving the series an 8 even though I thoroughly enjoyed it is because once the serial killer is caught; the series lost some of the energy it had reeling me in and impressing me with the plot machinations and all the potential suspects.

I mean it's a really good whodunit however, in the end it was more the good guys trying to bring to justice the actual murderer of one of the serial killer's 1st victims. Not that it was bad, and we wouldn't get the excellent acting from Shin Ha Kyun without this secondary plot, I just think it was a lot of deaths and cover up that seemed unimportant. Obviously, Dong Sik needed to find out who killed his sister, but I don't know if I cared enough about that part.

I can't wait to see more show with Shin Ha Kyun and watch another crime drama.

Crime/mystery/thriller. Complex story rich in suspense, not much fight scenes though. The backstory for each characters were also beautifully written. That's why the show demands a lot of attention. If not, you'll get lost easily.

Actors did good with theirs characters too.. I often wonder who's the villain or who's the victim. The overall tone of a small community was also done realistically. How small town gossip works and even how they've got each other's back when needed..

I may not watch this again but I don't regret watching it either. It's entertaining. And even with its darkness, there's still light at the end.

The fear of death follows from the fear of life.
Reminded me of a quote from Harry Potter, ""To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure"". Indeed, HELLBOUND is the adventure on the way to death and a survival game against the angle of quietus.

TW: Dystopia, Violence, Killing, Cult beliefs, Brainwashing, Superstitions.

Hellbound, written and directed by the acclaimed director Yeon Sang Ho, the PD or some famous apocalypse thriller movies like ""Train to Busan"" and ""Psychokinesis"", has been able to deliver another mind-blowing piece with his experience and skills. Can't really say that it's a groundbreaking show but surely a good one that keeps you entertained throughout and evokes all kinda feelings.

Basically, the story is set up in a dystopian world along with supernatural elements. Some people see predications of their death as a decree of being bound to hell for the sins they've committed and no matter how much they try, they can't prevent it. Some unknown monster-like giant creatures appear from nowhere and execute them and send them to hell. Jung Jin Su (Yoo Ah In), is the founder of the religious group ""Saejinrihwae"" (literally The Truth), tells the world that this is God's work and make people follow the group. They name the monsters ""Angle of Death"".

""Hwasalchok"" (literally arrowhead) are the radical follwers of the religion who are very dangerous. They punish anyone who questions the existence of their God. Min Hye Jin (Kim Hyun Joo) is a lawyer at Sodo Law Firm, trying to find out about the truth of this religion. Jin Kyung Hoon (Yang Ik Jun) is a detective whose daughter Jin Hee Jung (Lee Re) somehow gets involved with the cult.

The plot development isn't steady, rather the story is divided into 2 parts; the first 3 episodes showing about the rise of the cult group and the latter half showcasing it's consequences and got a solid plotline about Bae Young Jae (Park Jung Min) and Song So Hyun (Won Jin Ah) who are married couple with a newborn baby. The execution of these 2 seemingly different storylines set up in the same scenario is very well done by the PDnim.

Personally, I couldn't find anything great in the first episode to feel the urge of continuing the show but I had to do it anyways. The 2nd episode did interest me a bit, ngl. The 3rd episode is what makes you hooked because of the intriguing elements that will definitely raise your curiosity level. There is a leap when the 4th episode starts and whatever follows, is very crazy and insane; enough to make your blood boil. I've already mentioned it's a dystopia so be careful in case you're sensitive because this ain't for the light-hearted.

The back story of the entire show isn't completely explained, just like many other Netflix Korea Original shows, in order to keep the suspense for another season and this clearly is the case here. Some might cite things happening in here illogical, but do keep in mind that it's dystopia.

Acting as an overall, is pretty good. Skillful ones like Yoo Ah In, Kim Hyun Joo, Park Jung Min, Won Ji Ah, Yang Ik Jun, etc have done a good job as usual. Also, the supporting plus minor characters have delivered a decent job. Not to forget, Kim Hyun Joo's action skills were nice, though wasn't shown for long and well, I loved that part. Wish they made her do some extra stunts hehe.

The CGI could have been better bcs tbh, the monsters weren't even scary. I admit the story is mot just about the monsters, rather the story about wrong beliefs plus some sort hidden power, who's doing all these, but still; the monsters looked like somky hulks and least scary... However, as always the sound production is apt which enthralls and enrages you and makes you anxious.

Many important factors, shown in here are: false sense of justice and righteousness, crime and criminal minds, victim and their families, bloodlust, superstition, wrong beliefs, brainwashing, radicalism, abuse, parental love & care, death & it's essence, desires to live or survive, relentless fear, agony, vengeance, sadism, etc.

My most favourite line from Hellbound is from the finale episode where this random person says, ""I don't know about Gods, neither do I care. But what I know is, this world belongs to people. And we should deal our matters by ourselves.""

Again, Netflix Korea has done a bad job in regards of English translation, idk what has happened to them since Squid Game. No one is asking for literal translations but for goodness's sake don't divert the context of a conversation by translating sentences in a sense that doesn't even match the essence of it.

In fact the very ending of the finale episode indicates the beginning of another tragedy, hence implying about a second season. But well, I am disappointed that Netflix Korea keep doing it on a regular basis and go silent about the clarification for a 2nd season. Then they come back after a long while saying they will make it but by that time, a major portion of the cast gives up the drama, wth. Do better, Netflix Korea.

I must admit, the ending consequences have made me cry. Given the storyline, it was bound to be a sad and tragic ending but I don't expect they'll put forth some essence about death, relationship and beliefs, which actually made me see the entire thing in a good light by the end of the drama. The finale episode is the best one out of the 6. I was totally enthrilled by the entire episode.

By the end, from What, How and Why, one thing that wasn't explained was the ""What"" aspect and the root cause of the entire happening. Wish they would make a full-length drama out of the webtoon so that we could rate it a whole, or a movie could have been better. Anyways, the overall development was good, if not excellent. I would have given a 8.0 but honestly not that impressed.

Overally, Hellbound is a very good one time watch and worth the binge. I enjoyed most of the parts of the show, though I am not really awed or taken aback by this. I haven't read the original wentoon so can't say what alterations they've made or whether it meets the standard or not. I suggest you watch with a strong hold on your heart. Even if you're not that interested, please do it for the one and only Yoo Ah In bcs his visuals are top notch, oof.

Terrifyingly Real!
If this doesn't terrifies you, you have seen nothing of the world yet!

Unpopular opinion, but I think a lot of people are watching it wrong. Because what is depicted here is Real. Way Too Real.

I don't think the director set out to tell an entertaining story in the first place. With a plot like this, that would have been easy. Instead, he took a gamble. As someone who lives in a place that is slowly sinking into religious fascism, this was all too real. To see it being decipted with pinpoint accuracy was bone chilling. The Helplessness, the Fear and how some people are always ready to use it to their advantage. Once you realise that, you understand 2 things. First, why this series exists in the first place. And second, how close this world is to insanity. As someome who has experienced it all first hand, this could happen anywhere, anytime and to anyone.

A few unexplained things, and all that's all it takes for all hell to break loose.

Though not for everyone, Hellbound is a strong thriller with very powerful elements. The way human beings are potrayed is extremely realistic, and for anyone who has lived in a situation of religious fascism, extremely relatable. Among all the shows that has explored these themes, this was the best Korea or anyone in the world has produced yet (I have watched them all, even the ones with low ratings). Don't miss it if you are okay with dark heavy themes and are willing to look at Human Nature for what it is.

Few things definitely could have been better, like a more bare sound design to create regular tension. No doubt about that. Search (2020) is an excellent example of how to do that. At the same time though, I think it does what it set out to do brilliantly! Not all cinema is out there to entertain. Some can simply exists as an warning. And this is a strong one.

How's the story: does it exist? I don't think so,
Jung Jin Soo is creepy, monsters are funny (literally), Min Hye Jin is reckless but cool (But what's the use?), Kyung Hoon is... wait what's his role? lol. My brother is annoying, Oops sorry this is unrelated. Well, so is the show apparently.

""When one person suffers from delusions, we call it a mental illness. When the society suffers from them, we call it being normal."" -Anonymous

One of the few things done right is the portrayal of society and its mindset lol... I'd rather won't comment on how religious things are shown... but the whole setup of how people (normal people not the crazy dudes) think... was relatable.

For 50×6=300min (approx), I was staring at my laptop screen, was legit for nothing coz this drama is just so random. Some random characters with some random backstories, with their random purpose put together and bunch of super annoying characters are thrown...wait, that explains poster well. Drama ends up being a hot mess that doesn't serve justice to anything, anyone... characters, actors-their acting.

I'm curious what's the writer trying to show actually...Story is like some scattered pieces joined together without giving proper time to explore any character well. I didn't the webtoon to I've no idea abt the background story.. but just judging from the drama. It lacks in many ways, it's confusing, writing just sucks, editing is choppy, the whole cult thing is crazy, why some characters exist... then they just vanish in a thin air. Other than Jung Jin Soo's purpose everything has loose ends, should I call it a Netflix thing so they can create seasons per season.

I do not have a problem with bad CGI even though it made me laugh at the monsters... they legit look funny, or even cinematography. They can have a small budget it's understandable... but what's wrong with lighting? Okay, I get that Netflix is been trying this for a while now... making dark lighting and cinematography to suit the theme of thrillers, but that doesn't mean it should be this bad that I had to check the brightness of my device two times. With bad color grading, it's weirdly dark.

The acting is spot on. Yoo Ah In legit gave me chills... but he doesn't look himself and if he's the sole reason if you want to watch the whole thing, you'll be disappointed he's dangling carrot. I appreciate Kim Hyun Joo's performance too. Park Jung Min and Woo Jin Ah slayed in a very small amount of screen time given.

I think the main problem with it is they just tried to do many things together is a small amount of time. Trying to put many characters... many things happening at the same time. But this season is just meant for the introduction and things are explained in later seasons... I may ignore it but right now I'm just thinking of it as an individual drama.

It doesn't have many surprising, thrilling, action factors. I didn't find it the least bit scary nor any jump-scaring moments. It's gory, disturbing at times...you might get disgusted on many occasions but I won't call it a good horror.

It doesn't bother to explain anything, just wreck your brain on your own. Nothing is impressive... nothing. I admit it's different but not in an extraordinary way. It's just normal... might be good as time pass, as I'm the least bit entertained and thrilled. I just hope the second season (if it's gonna happen) will prove me wrong and this is just a build-up for it.

Am I being harsh? yes. I should be.

Is This A ‘Hellbound’ Experience?


With director and screenwriter Yeon Sang-ho (Train to Busan) and co-writer Choi Kyu-Seok basing the series upon their own webcomic and original production, this does leave viewers with one ultimate question; “ is ‘ Hellbound’ actually worth watching ?”

For jaded and cynical detective Jin Kyeong-hoon (Yang Ik-june) humanity has offered him nothing but pain and sorrow. Still trying to come to grips with his wife’s brutal murder and having a fractious relationship with teenage daughter Hee-jeong (Lee Re), Jin’s research into the cases leads him face to face with leader of the mysterious cult ‘ New Truth’, Chairman Jeong Jin- Soo ( Yoo Ah-in). The cult has pledged salvation for “ sinners” by spreading gospels of the angels and encourage them to “ repent”. However as episodes progress it soon becomes slowly apparent towards Jin-Soo’s true nature and the brutal goals of the group, with attorney Min Hye-jin (Kim Hyun-joo) pledging representation for the alleged “ sinners”.

The biggest thing to address about ‘ Hellbound’ is that it isn’t a show for the lighthearted. Whilst devoted fans of the webcomic may notice some subtle storyline changes ,the show is violent and not afraid to present brutal murders alongside people being combusted like human torches throughout the series.

Intertwined amongst the shoddy CGI monsters of ‘ Hellbound’ as well as alongside the spine-tingling OST by Kim Dong-wook, ‘ Hellbound ‘ expertly paces its descent into chaos, knowing when to slow down on abominable killings and when to present its moral deadlocks . From the rising corruption of religion and the cultural phenomenon in South Korea of hysterical puritanism, hypocrisy as well as the rise of extreme conservative views paradoxical to the insatiable appetite of society for violence through popular culture, ‘ Hellbound’ addresses a lot of issues without shame or embarrassment and with the entire purpose to expose current issues and realities in South-Korean society. However this is also where the series began to hit a rut after the midway point; it never really carried through these messages with regards to the medium of the series . Whilst some characters are used with a purpose, some seemingly quintessential main characters have rushed arcs or suddenly disappear without rhyme or reason, whilst the climax and rising tension of the drama often went on a downwards slope after the halfway point.

The acting front is admittedly a mixed-bag ( especially with some line deliverances by the supporting characters.) Of course whilst the main cast shone throughout, one of the most dynamic performances throughout the show was surprisingly Yoo Ah-In’s performance as fanatic cult leader Chairman Jin Soo .

Whilst main lead Jin Kyeong-hoon is admittedly a complex character type as the “ cynical cop” and female lead Hye-Jin as the “ attorney”, they often felt tightly crammed into their roles as stock characters tropes . This isn’t necessarily a bad approach per say and did give director and screenwriter Sang-Ho opportunities to reimburse old character tropes for his own gain, but it did little to really diverge these main leads from their expected decisions and actions, often leading them to be shoehorned into the plot ( as well as lacking more profound depth) rather than allowing the characters to move coherently within the contents of the storyline. For example a major subplot surrounding the series for Kyeong-Hoon is the murder of his wife. Whilst later revelations play briefly upon this subplot, the profound details surrounding Hoon’s reactions as well as his relationship with daughter as a consequence were left underexposed, and therefore lacked more sound emotional-depth also.

Of course getting back to our mysterious chairman it isn’t necessarily the case that he was executed as an entirely “ original villain” as after all Sang-Ho does enjoy playing upon Jin Soo as the “ calm and quiet” archetype. However where Sang-Ho creates mystery surrounding Jin-Soo is that he isn’t a “ redeemable antagonist with a painful past” or “twirling his moustache planning world domination”, but just a regular person with a megalomaniacal desire to deliver his warped sense of “ justice”. However whilst Jin Soo helped us to bring together our main characters and kept the storyline moving, his anticlimactic character arc and exit from the series raided more questions than answers afterwards.

This was often a major problem with ‘ Hellbound’- plot points which could’ve been meticulously executed onscreen or poignant for audiences to reflect upon, felt missed out completely by Sang-Ho’s imbalance of subtext against plot. For example even through the cinematography and as the director Sang-Ho never seemed entirely sure how he wanted to capture the world of the characters. Seemingly ordinary or gritty early episode scenes hinting at the unexpected, turned into moody and drab aesthetic shots of Seoul straight out of a noir crime series. This isn’t necessarily unheard of a director playing with mood or lighting to convey messages or by transcending genres. However , directors or cinematographers usually have a vision in mind when invoking these scenes for viewers. Sang-Ho seemed often uncertain even through the objective lens of the director with how this truly captured or presented the emotional mind-frame of his characters . . Adding to this Yeon and Choi weigh down each dramatic scene straight out of a jump-scare movie; the monsters’ attacks feel animalistic and playfully sadistic, but never truly added a more profound and impactful tone for audiences.

The ending of the series attempt to crank up the shock value to the maximum with the delivered revelations of the finale. However whilst the series does leave a more open ending through a cliffhanger major characters arcs, subplots and storyline moments were rarely tied together or felt more complete as a consequence.

So what is left to take from ‘ Hellbound’? ‘ Hellbound’ is a pacy supernatural thriller with an intriguing plot wrapped into six episodes. Aside from some dodgy acting by our side characters, the main cast were decent enough and the standalone performance by Yoo Ah-In did give the drama some undeniably charisma. However one of the major problems with the Netflix series is that it becomes lost in a maze of its own doing; subtext themes and plot were often lacking in depth and more profound deliverance, whilst even some of our main characters lost their gravitation to audiences by abrupt exploration and coverage alongside an incomplete ending. The series attempts to deliver a “ terrifying” experience through the CGI “ monsters” of the series whose design and presence onscreen felt insipid. Overall ‘ Hellbound’ is not a bad per say during a binge-watch session with an intriguing enough plot to keep you engaged, but certainly lacking within delivering a more sound impact for viewers also.

Wasn't Expecting Much & Not Much Is What I Got
First things first, this is my genre. All things supernatural, horror, and psychological thrillers are my jam. They make me happy. Somehow I knew from the trailer that Hellbound wasn't going to make me happy, but like a moth to a flame or a cat to a shiny thing... well you get the picture.

The story had potential. It was obvious from the trailer that the supernatural was going to be on the back burner and the story was going to be more humanistic. It's a slice of life with CG monsters. In a series this short either the story has to develop quickly and you forego character development or your characters have to grow by leaps and bounds. Neither happens in Hellbound. The fault lies squarely on the shoulders of writer/director Yeon Sang Ho. The first 2 or 3 episodes are spent setting us up the characters that disappear by the end of the 3rd episode. You really only know what happens to one. Unless I dozed off, you get no closure on the main character in the first few episodes. I mean none. He's just gone. Then the story jumps 4 years and the 2nd set of characters are tied to the first by the only character from the first 3 episodes to still be around.

The writing was disappointing. I felt like Yeon was trying to preach, but couldn't figure out how to start his sermon. So he floundered, changed his mind, and started again. I don't know if he wanted to take on zealotry and idolatry or religion in general. It really did seem like he was trying to sneak in a message. Yeon also fails at directing. It's a dark series and I don't mean the subject matter. Even when the characters are outside on sunny days, the shots were dreary. We get it. Bad times ahead. Honestly, some scenes reminded me of film school projects. I'm starting to feel the same about Yeon as I do about M. Knight Shymalan, concentrate on the writing son, leave the directing to someone with more talent. Train to Busan may have been a happy accident because of the cast not his talent. But, hey, the visual and sound effects were great!

The cast does a good job with the material given. However, there is no character development. Park Jung Min gave a solid performance. Overall, his character may have been the best written or well rounded followed by Yang Ik Jun's character. Kim Hyun Joo was window dressing. Her character was a caricature of a strong female lead instead of actually being one.

I scored the music high because it does a great job supporting and setting up scenes. The rewatch value is 0. If you have ever read any of my reviews, you know I almost always say I rarely rewatch a drama. I can tell you with absolute certainty that unless inebriated, paid, or under duress I will never watch Hellbound again. Mind you it ends on a cliffhanger so I may watch part 2.

Overall, it's a 5.5- 6.0 primarily because the visual and sound effects and because there is something there. I like the idea of the story but it's just not told very well. I'd only recommend it to die hard supernatural genre fans like myself. For the average viewer I'd say skip it or at least wait to see if there is a season 2 and then watch them together.

From the social sciences point of view
Sociology being my major in undergrad made me appreciate this series. It discusses the purpose of religion in our our society. On the level of the individual, it exists to satiate people's search for meaning, answers questions that science still fails to address, matters that are beyond our understanding. As Karl Marx puts it, it is the ""opium of the masses.""

On an institutional level, it serves to ensure social control. We have laws in place, and religion reinforces them in the form of introducing the concept of morality and guilt, of heaven and eternal damnation.

Not a lot of kdramas offer this kind of commentary, so I should say it's worth a watch.

This review may contain spoilers
Well, well, well…
Make some tea, this will take a while…


!!!ALL the spoilers will be warned beforehand!!!

Hellbound is one of the examples where a story with an interesting concept was ""bound"", not to hell, but to not develop fully so that it could reach its true potential.

Hellbound is a supernatural horror drama not for the light-hearted. Even though Hellbound is not scary, it contains extreme violence and gore which makes it very dark, raw and twisted.

The story revolves around a mysterious phenomenon where some weird creatures burn humans and bind them to Hell. As fast these monsters burn humans, so slow burn the drama is. For a 6-episode length drama, it’s really slow paced. Personally, I like slow paced dramas when this factor helps in building the universe of the story, the atmosphere, the suspense or the characters’ depth. In Hellbound though, nothing of these happens. That’s why I found the whole set up (especially the first 3 episodes) a little boring and I don’t think that the drama can be binged-watched easily as its slowness makes it a very exhausting experience.



~~~What went wrong~~~


The real problem of the story though, it’s not the pace. I think that the story has 2 main problems



~ The Randomness~

DISCLAIMER: ~Randomness~ does not contain spoilers but it describes very generally how the storyline works.


The one problem is the randomness. Many random people were involved in many random situations that led to a random storyline.

Hellbound feels like watching a “collection of stories” which take place in the same universe. The storyline is showing some of the actions/situations of many different people during the crisis, but never you’ll never get to see in depth the character's way of thinking or get to fully know their personalities. Also, you won’t even get to know the whole story for some of them. As a result, you can’t get attached with any of the characters. There are only some cases where you can feel sorry for some of them and that’s it.

In addition, the relationships between the characters feel kind of superficial to me. The fact that you see many people with not a certain relationship between them, strengthened the randomness factor because basically, the drama was just throwing random characters and their stories to your face. The weird thing is that the drama isn’t that long and it didn’t even have these many characters to feel like it’s overdrawn with them and their stories, but it did.



And here is where the critical question arises: among all these characters, who is the protagonist?

I asked myself many times and to my surprise, I couldn’t come up with an answer. In Hellbound there isn’t anyone that you can call “the protagonist” of the story. Thus, as a watcher, you don’t have anyone to follow and process the story with. This is actually the reason that everyone seems irrelevant with each other, there isn’t a protagonist to bound all of them together.

Don’t get me wrong though. Good stories without a certain protagonist can exist but I believe that Hellbound isn't one of them.



~Netflix~

The second problem, that I believe is the most serious one, is Netflix.

Netflix has started to produce more and more Kdramas lately and some of the dramas it has made had huge and global success. Even though I really loved many of them, I have to say that there’s a different aura in these dramas, a more “Netflix” aura that slowly takes the K from Kdrama away.

The main problem I have with Netflix original dramas is the “see you in the second season that isn’t even confirmed that’s gonna happen” thing. As a regular asian-drama watcher, I have been used to watching a drama that has one season with a story that has a start-middle-closure which in the end I like or dislike and then, move on to the next watching adventure. I, and many others I have talked to, like asian-dramas because of this. I’d lie if I’d say that I haven’t liked dramas which have multiple seasons but Netflix has just overdone it lately.


Thus, I started to think if I dislike the fact that Hellbound is another Netflix drama which will have a second season, or if there was something wrong regardless of the fact that Hellbound has to have a second season. The answer here is both.


Hellbound is based on a webtoon by the same name. I haven’t read the webtoon. I don’t know the full story, so I don’t have an opinion about it. Maybe the webtoon is a hidden gem, when I read it, I will see for myself. For now, everything I based this review on is the 6 episodes that I have watched.

The webtoon’s original run was from August 25, 2019 to September 21, 2020. This means that the story was completed and Netflix could have released the whole story in one go, but it didn’t. This led to the creation of a drama which basically has no story progression. It’s remarkable, the first season ended and it answered literally nothing, on the other hand, it raised more questions than the already existing ones. The first season could have been described as the “backstory” of the Hellbound but it’s nearly the beginning of the story.

Maybe, if Netflix had released the whole story in one go, the progression and the escalation of the story and characters, that was needed, would be there. Unfortunately, Hellbound’s story was bound by Netflix to not develop as it should, and this is really sad. As the story hasn’t ended yet, to see the story’s full potential we have to wait until the second season is released (if it will be released) or read the webtoon instead. For me, Hellbound will be saved if the second season comes to set the record straight and puts everything in its proper place.



~~~What went well~~~


Despite the fact that the storyline is messy, there are some things that I quite liked about Hellbound.


~The concept~

!!WARNING ~The concept~ part contains SPOILERS!!





Hellbound has managed to build a dystopian world that's based on a very -as nonsense as it sounds- realistic depiction of human thought. Humans through the years tried to explain the world and the natural phenomena around them using logic. In the early years though, humans couldn’t understand all of the things around them. Thus, they attributed the nature of these phenomena to God and God’s Will and many times humans were scared by them. A perfect example is Greek mythology. One of the Greek mythology myths is saying that God Zeus was using lighting as a weapon and to punish but in many myths, he didn’t use lightning to punish but to seek solutions.

Likewise, in Hellbound we see people become witnesses to a supernatural phenomenon which they couldn’t explain. In their fear and lack of knowledge they attributed this supernatural phenomenon to God’s Will to punish sinners. At the end of episode 3, Jun Jin Soo explains exactly the feeling of human’s fear to the unknown perfectly.


“Do you honestly believe true justice can be served through man-made law?”. This is the moral question that Hellbound asks through Jun Jin Soo and answers through the 6 episodes of the fist season. Law was made by humans when society was created to ensure harmonious coexistence between people. Of course, nothing man-made is perfect and the same applies to the law. Through the years, humans fight for their rights and always try to improve the law as much as their human nature allows them.

In Hellbound, we see people turn a blind eye to the law and only believe in the God’s Punishment, which was actually the product of human fear. The deviation from legal life led to the creation of Hellbound’s dystopian world. Thus, through this world, Hellbound shows the value and the importance of human law and how humanity would end up without them.







~The production and Acting~

The production is not perfect, but it’s decent enough. It has some generally good cinematography and even though the music was average, it was on point and it fitted very well with the drama’s tone and atmosphere. As the drama has a very dark plot, the colors follow this darkness too so the color palette contains strictly cool colors. The visual FX are very satisfying in general but the VFX I think that lacked in some parts. The CGI of the monsters honestly wasn’t bad, the design of them was only somehow weird and not scary enough. Personally, I didn’t care about the monster’s appearance, I had other things that I didn’t like and found them more serious problems. Last, for the acting, Yoo Ah In was exceptional as always and the other actors acted good enough alongside him. Won Jin Ah's performance as mother and Park Jung Min as a father were really remarkable too and I enjoy watching them a lot.



Conclusion

Hellbound wasn’t good, but it wasn’t very bad either. Everything will depend on the second season. Until then, if you want to watch a horror-thriller series and you don’t care about how complex and well-written the story process is, you would definitely enjoy it.

Skip it
This was a disappointment. I feel the biggest problem (among many) with this show was if you’re going to go all out with a CGI monster drama, it should be a fun, character-driven genre drama centered around these monsters. The great trailers made it appear this way and and we were expecting a lot after the best shows of the year, Squid Game and DP. But it turned out to be a serious philosophical story, and a very boring one at that, with no substance or characterization at all, and the monsters were hardly in the picture. There was also lots of unnecessary disturbing violence and torture.

I feel like even Yoo Ah In intentionally jumped ship on this one (you’ll know what I mean). Give the first episode a try and you’ll be able to know if it’s your kind of thing or not because it doesn’t get any better.

What a disappointment!
This drama was a mess, at the beginning was difficult to understand and then when you can start guessing what is happening, everything is just bad, messy and without following the ""original"" plot line (to say everything changes from episode 4 onwards and the story just gets more uninteresting), there's a lot of plot holes, honestly, the visual effects are horrendous (no comments), there's some gore (not really, to be honest, I have seen more gore than this), no suspense or thriller.
The character's backgrounds, don't expect to be explained (they aren't), characters appearing, disappearing with no apparent explanation (there's little reasoning for this drama), some characters are underdeveloped that could have had more potential, others that could have been better without them...
The ending, it's difficult to explain, you could take it as a cliffhanger or not, because precisely the main character's story/problem is solved in the end so there isn't exactly a need for a season 2, the cult will be disbanded as it has lost it's followers and the problem with the monsters aka demons won't be solved, how can humans solve supernatural problems, even more so being that problem a hell one?
So what with that ending scene with the reborn woman? That it is, they are reborn if they are supposed to, I don't Chairman Jung will be reborn (as he is precisely the demon personified).

That's all for me thoughts in this hellish drama.
I don't recommend it, don't waste time on this one, even if the mc's are your favourite actors, it's not worth it, believe me I fell for that trap.

The more you watch, the less sense it has
The show started well: there was some action, reasoning behind the monsters' arrival and a presentation of the weird cult with a creepy leader... and then it went south. I think that it is sad that the potential of this drama was completely ruined by the lack of reasoning behind everyone's actions. Everything started to make less and less sense, and by the end of the show, it was extremely annoying to watch the characters make any decisions.
The ""streams"" of one of the church's fanatics were obnoxious and I think they did not add much to the story, except for the ""plot twist"" at the end, which was very predictable.
Overall I wouldn't recommend this show to any fan of Kdramas, but I may use it to warn someone about the possible outcomes of religious fanaticism,

Epic!
Hellbound is confusing and also scary. I loved watching this Korean drama. Episode 1, and 3 are really good, it scares and keeps you so hooked on it but then episode 4,5 and 6, leaves you so confusing. Everything got confusing to me. Like the story went on a different track. This series by Netflix is definitely worth the watch but watch it carefully.

The ending reminded me of Daenerys Targaryen's birth of the dragon ending, visually so beautiful and story-wise so confusing but mysterious. The sound, cinematography and colors, well done, The VFX was amazing too.

Hellbound? You tried
'A delusion held by one person is a mental illness, held by a few is a cult, held by many is a religion.' -Robert Todd Carroll

I spend the whole last Night watching this, because someone in the House I life in told me they looked forward to it after Squid Game. I didn't go in for any Actor, I really don't think I knew anyone who is on the Cast before this. But I watched other Movies Yeon Sang Ho so I should be used to his style, at least that's what I thought.

But oh boy, I was wrong. From the beginning everything seemed kind of, fished out of the Nose?

Human fear, what they can't kill or understand, and this is a big part of this Drama, I think. The problem is, tho, I can just assume and think what this is all about. Next to the facts you see and kind of understand fast yourself, there is nothing, even in the smallest, explained in this.

I think if they choose just 1 direction they wanted to go in, and not 2 or 3, this could have been a really nice watch, or if it would be a standard 10 Episode Drama, that we are usually used to from Netflix.

The Music is, okay at best? All I remember was the Intro, that I skipped after the first Time watching it, and the sounds that usually came when something bad happens. Nothing new.

Would I rewatch it personally? Not really, there are better Dramas out there that at least does not make me vomit on my desk at 1 am in the morning. (Thank you, episode 3). But if they ever bring out a 2nd Season, I will force myself to watch it in hopes they explain more in it.

Watch it like a long movie, not like a short Kdrama.
Wow there sure are a lot of bad reviews here. It's true that is this an awfully short format for a Kdrama, and that impacted the sort of character development we're used to. What you get here is longer than a movie, but shorter than the vast majority of Kdramas, and for that shortened format I thought it was exceptionally well done. In movies, you often see unexplained plot points and less developed characters, this is more like a long movie than a short Kdrama. The CG heavy baby was a little weird to watch, but the overall story was pretty impressive. Maybe it's the world we live in these days, but it seemed super realistic to me that people would just blindly accept a new faith because they are so desperate for any answer, regardless of whether or not that answer makes logical sense.

The part of this that seemed unrealistic to me was not having the military getting involved at all. Like weird alien assholes saying they're from god show up and melt people and no one even tries to nuke them? For sure if something like this happened IRL it would be more like the people who were given the decree would be taken to a military base and all sorts of testing would be done to see whether the decree can be thwarted or the fat ropey alien golem things killed. Mostly because if this were a decree from god against bad people, all the wealthy people in power would find themselves first on the chopping block and thus eager to learn how to protect themselves. That part of it I really had to suspend logic to get through. Maybe that's coming in season 2 idk.

The acting was pretty good, the visuals were good, and the story was compelling and would have been probably more appropriately set either in the distant future post-apocalypse or in the distant past....someplace with out technology. If it were set in modern day you'd have every scientist in the global community trying to snip off a piece of the aliens to see what they're made of and how they might be destroyed.

If you suspend your belief through all that and just take the story as it is, I think it's pretty compelling to watch how quickly people turn on each other, even their own friends and family, if they believe it will afford them more personal safety. That, I think, is the real message of this show. People are sheep and will flock to whatever group or religion that affords them the highest level of safety. People will greedily grasp at power to achieve some illusion of control. People will judge and condemn others in a heartbeat, if it means not ending up on the losing side.

Overall, this is entertaining, has a poignant message, and is worth a watch. If the plot seems confused, it's because you are watching a world in which all the participants are also confused. You don't have a single main lead guide who stays with you the entire show to fit the pieces together for you, you're abandoned and alone and trying to make sense of it all just like every character in this drama. And I think that's pretty poetic.

Another great series in 2021
2021 has been great in terms of Korean productions as exemplified by ""Sweet & Sour"" and ""Move to Heaven"". ""Hellbound"" is a series for everyone, but not everyone will appreciate it.
The title and the reactions in the series to a repeated supernatural phenomenon, gives the viewers an insight into mass psyche in front of God/the transcendent.
Then, in the middle of the series one person makes a smart remark that goes against mainstream: in reality we are facing an unexplained set of phenomena and some people are exploiting these phenomena.
The author and/or movie maker will make everything crystal clear in the last seconds of the last episode, and I won't spoil it.

GREAT ACTING, and Great story for those who understand.
In my headline, no need to explain to watch this netflix original series. This series will not feel you bored because your curiosity about the story will intruiged you especially the acting was superb. Watch till end before you decide. SIX EPISODES ONLY

THE ENDING WAS....

An open-ended but very satisfying.

The confusion about the monsters was understandble, if comes from nowhere then it ended from nowhere. It's okay not to know because it's SUPERNATURAL FICTION. I hope there is a second season to clarify the confusion of others and most of all, hoping the parents to be with their child again.

The message of the drama was definitely satisfy you.

Everyone needs to stop talking crap about this!
This series is for sure worth a watch. Everyone here is complaining about the open ending. Calm your horses that ending is as open of an ending as Squid game. I didnt see anyone complaining about that? I dont get why some people here are upset with the second half (the last 3 episodes)? Yes the first 3 episodes was a great example of tension and release. And i also get why the last 3 episodes could've been confusing, but the more you watch the more you start getting on track again. The only reason it gets a little confusing is because we suddenly jump to the life of someone else. The story is split in two and the second half jumps a couple of years forward. I really think they did a good job on getting the story stable after jumping to a disconnected continuition. I got absolute thrills during every episode. I couldnt stop watching! Kept it going until 3 am. Now it has been a day and i've thought carefully about the series and the reviews. I think that the bad reviews are overall from people that got lost during the last 3 episodes. I guess its not a series for everyone because not everyone is good at putting together pieces in stories. Dont leave half ass reviews just because the story died off for you after not understanding what the flip is going on. The only thing slightly negative thing about this series was the special effects. It was slightly unrealistic on a few parts like (small spoiler alert) the disintegrator where the man was burning alive. It looked a little funny. And maybe some wounds were slightly off. Nothing significant. It probably wont bother the average watcher. I really recommend this show! Just please keep your attention on the show while watching it. I know enough people who scroll around on their phone and after its done they start complaining about how they didnt understand half the story. Oh two more things. The acting was honestly great. I was impressed on certain parts by the performance of the actors. A great cast :) A little more about the open ending. It will bother the people who hate open endings, but i personally dont mind. The open ending leaves a lot of options for season 2. I for sure cant wait for the second season!

WATCHED ONLY FOR YOO-AH-IN BUT THE STORY IS WHOLE MESSED.
Drama concert is unique and good but the story is many way lacking so much, actually it's not developing except the ending scenes which gives thrill to audiences for next season
If there is no Yoo Ah In the drama , it shouldn't be that hipe Or worth watching. I really had a great expectation of the drama but it's somehow disappointed ,
How can be that type of brainwash be believed by every single people it's not acceptable.
How can there every people exept the things, that it is God's will after seeing their own family members death. How can there be that much of politics other than trying to find the details about those creatures. Except 1st ep and ending scenes none of the scenes are exciting or new. Or be valuable at all, THE WHOLE STORY IS MESSED.
I hope season 2 may not be build like season 1 , hoping for good.
Let's see when ,and how it will go forward.
Thank U.

This is NOT for everyone, but if you try it do so with an open mind and a strong heart.
I am not here to say that everyone criticizing this series is wrong, but that everyone should form their opinion on this drama by watching it and not by reading reviews, either positive or negative.
Personally just today I've said 'this drama is not for everyone' to a friend of mine that asked me if she should watch it or skip it when i told her i had binged watched it. I did say that exactly because this drama is NOT entertainment, it's not easy and it will make you feel uneasy. It's frustrating, it has a desperate edge and heavy meaning with almost no hope, characters are not lovable and many moments will definitely make you cringe while watching.
So no, it's not for everyone or not for every moment, or for every kind of mood you are in. I would totally say to not watch it to someone who doesn't like heavy depressing content, i would say not to watch this to anyone looking for some relax and light content, and so on and on.
If someone who is looking for entertainment watch this and is disappointed based on the development of the plotline hence gives a low rating because of that it's not an objective or fair judgement. I don't like splatter at all, most of the time i find it gross and cheep but if i watch a story whose plot requires lots of splatter and i don't like it i don't immediately assume that's the drama's fault, but that maybe my personal dislike makes me a less objective judge on the value of the product in general and of the value and enjoyment it helds for the audience it's been specifically created for. So everyone has the right to leave any comment or review or rating, and everyone is entiteld to their own opinion on this. Personally though, when i read some reviews before deciding if i wanted to give it a try or not, I imagined this drama to be completely different and very poorly done. I almost gave it up without trying it amd i would have if Netflix did not have the autoplay for new series.
The first minute of hellbound starte automatically for me and it made me curious again so i left it running, still thinking i would be bored or find this ridiculous. Instead the more i watched the more i was disturbed by the deeper thems this drama presents. It's not the 'angels or demons' thing that's interesting, those are mere plot devices to present the truly scary monsters of this story: HUMANS. The supernatural creatures that appears from the start have no other role than being literally the deus ex machina to explain the story.
What dragged me into this drama unwillingly and by the hair, is its bleak commentary on our society and culture through a religious metaphor. I have not found enjoyable one single second of the 6 episodes, yet it made me think about aspects of human nature that i generally prefer to not dwell on too much because they are hard and unpleasant.
So if you are looking at ratings and review of Hellboud before starting the drama itself i'd say it's safe to assume that all the votes in this page are not exactly left to comment on the value of cinematography, writing, directing, and acting of this drama, but more of an expression of what this drama has meant to the viewer in terms of meaning of the plot and it's development or the social commentary that reside in the deeper level of the story. Personally i did not enjoy it, actually i quite hated it, yet i watched it all because to me every episode left behind welts of hurt and a hunger of thoughts that dramas i've loved and enjoy deeply rarely have.

Waste of time
There is a much more awesome series out there to look don't waste time on this. let talk about the story what the point of making it.
I want to ask myself a question.
Did the story gives any messages and show any issue related to the public? I say no.
Did the story entertain an audience? I say no.
Did this story thrill you? I say no.
Are you scared because of scenes? I say no.
Now come to the psychological part.
Did this story make you think? I say a little bit.
Did this storyline make you crave for the next episodes? I say nope.
I even wanted to skip to the next.
Is there any reason why we should watch this series? I say better not to watch. It really disappoints you.
Let me be honest here after watching the Sweet Home series I have too much expectation from this series. But this series is nothing just garbage trash. Thanks.

Hot Mess
PS: it's my first time writing a review so bear it with me
I must say that I feel underwhelmed about the whole drama. The casting choice was good and the special effects were all well done but something important was missing from the plot.
I liked the topics that were addressed and how those were adressed. From the characters' pov, the story was confusing and jumpy. It felt like a lot of important scenes were removed from the script. Instead of those, there were only action scenes.
Regardless of this factor, I completed it. I don't know if it was the smartest move to leave this drama with an incomplete ending knowing how past netflix series have been treated. Would I rewatch it? No, because I would grow to hate it

Disappointment !!!
With the excitement i went into the series, have to say Hellbound was a disappointment. An average watch in many ways.

The series started strong and one would be entrapped with the storyline and the actors have done a good job in their roles. There was mystery, there was a plot and the visuals were really well done. But all this was there till the 3 rd episode following which it took a nosedive and spiralled out totally and lost the plot.

The last 3 episodes was confusing let alone poorly executed. To put it simply, it was unidimensional and flat. It dint make sense or add up and have to say it was bad. If it was done in hope of a second season, then the director dint do his job in the second half to warrant a renewal. In the end, i am left wondering what just happened.

Of all the netflix originals that came out recently, Hellbound would be the weakest of them.

Overall, i would say it would have been better off as a movie. The story started off well only to be ended poorly. The only watching point for this drama would be the acting and that too in the first half.

Yoo An In acting is a masterpiece
I was waiting for this drama, mainly because of Yoo Ah In, and he did not disappoint. I have never seen manga, so the plot was completely unknown, and acetal the storyline was interesting.
There are several actors who can play good and bad guys, and Yoo Ah In definitely nailed his role here. A handsome charismatic pshycopath leading a cult and he played all sides of the character very good. May Hollywood borrow him? I have not seen good villains in western cinematography for ages.

Also Ryu Kyung Soo, I have seen him Before playing More playful and funny characters, here he is a bad guy
and he acted him so well. I hope he get more recognition.

However, I feel like the script did not do enough for the characters. Killing the main lead after two episodes? We don’t even know what kind of a man he was, a little background history would be great.
It felt a little rushed, and a lot of stories are incomplete. This could have been 10 episode series easily, with more detailed script. The first episode was slow, and than after second episode everything escalated so quickly, and became confusing. Where are cop and his daughter? What happened to children of lady from second episode? How the Soda loan firm was formed? How did the MFL survived?

The ending is a cliffhanger, and it looks like they are leaving the rest for season 2. But I am not sure if they will do the second season? If not than my rating will definitely decrease.

Overall, I am not regretting watching it. I like thrillers, and I enjoyed the story and idea, I enjoyed acting and the cinematography. However, I don’t think I will rewatch it. It reminded me of a “sweet home” and I rewatched “sweet home” couple of times, but this one is not that exciting and complete.
Also I am Not sure if that’s a horror genre that would make you scared. “Save me” was way more traumatising and creepy when representing a cult.
There is a lot of blood and people dying, but I think all Korean criminal dramas are like this. Mouse was way more bloody and creepy. So I would say that series was not very scary, but if you are a softhearted person, who can’t watch people dying and blood, than better skip this one.

I am giving 9 just for Yoo Ah In and his acting. If not for him, than the score would be 7 at most.

The definition of lacking.
Even if I overlook the bad special effects I just can't find anything peculiar.

The theme of arbitrary and despotic justice has already been dealt with in both Taxi Driver and The Devil's Judge. Among other things, both titles have very eccentric tones, and Hellbound also tries to replicate that vibe by adding neon influencers.

I didn’t like the casting pairing and the storytelling that focuses separately in characters certainly didn't help in the chemistry. Add in the weak supernatural genre, inserted for the sole purpose of generating the story, and the drop is done.

Overall ""Hellbound"" was presented as a very dark ""supernatural"" title, but in reality it is the usual story about human behavior in the face of the collapse of civil society, only instead of zombies there are black Michelin men.

To hide the weak storyline they threw in eccentric elements and splatter scenes (beatings and blood.)

The overall idea was good but it lacks on all aspects.

Scarily real and dystopic
I love this type of dystopia — seeing how humanity responds to unexplained disaster and following our few main leads trying not only to survive but also to change the world.

With that being said, I think this drama hits the first part almost perfectly and the second part not as much so.

The premise of this drama alone is so interesting and enough to get a 7 from me. I know there's been a lot of complaints about plotholes and the rules of the universe changing but I've been pretty lenient on those, since the drama addresses them directly by discussing how this was intentional. I feel as though this is going to be one of those shows where the world-building requires some sort of suspension of disbelief first, and once you get over that it'll probably make the viewing experience a lot more enjoyable.

The second, part, the characters, was unfortunately the part I had more trouble with. The characters that we followed were not necessarily likable and I kept questioning their decision-making. It didn't help that it seemed as though the subplot of each character ended right when it felt like it should've started there. We skipped over the most interesting arcs of our characters and revisited them after they were over. I appreciate the lack of plot armor and generosity of the body count, but it piles up like a huge mountain of lost potential.

A must-watch for fans of series like School Nurse Files
This series has polarised viewers. Either you like it or you won't.
I really liked it. In fact I watched the last 20 minutes of episode 6 again.
It's not a monster genre show, but like another reviewer said, it's sociological commentary. The monsters are just there to provoke thought: are they a punishment from God for sinners, or are they just a supernatural phenomenon?
Viewers have said there are plotholes and dropped plotlines. Spoiler here: for example, no follow-up to the detective and his daughter. Actually, it can be inferred that he chose to protect his daughter by not exposing the chairman, and this paved the way for the New Truth and the Arrowhead to flourish. End spoiler. Throughout the show, there is sufficient information for you to make inferences and draw your own conclusions.
The last episode sets the scene for a second season. Hence the cliffhanger.
Anyway, if you enjoyed series like Stranger and School Nurse Files, which aren't so mainstream, chances are you'll like Hellbound. I preferred Hellbound to Squid Game and Sweet Home which are more populist dystopian. Hellbound is smarter and more unique.

Not the Best, But Not the Worst
I went into this with zero expectations, having not read the webtoon and having only skimmed the summary. By the time I got to this, I was aware of the disappointment and negative critiques voiced by many on MDL, but as I watched it, I couldn't quite figure out why people were so let down. It is by no means the best drama I've ever seen, despite it's perhaps lofty storytelling aspirations, but it's far from the worst. I'd say it's solidly average, but I don't feel as though I've wasted six hours of my life watching it.

The CGI was fine to me. While I thought the demons looked a bit silly, I didn't really take serious umbrage with how they were presented. I've certainly seen worse and cringier effects in other dramas. Most of my critique comes from the presentment of plot and characters. We're given pretty much the same storyline every two episodes: someone receives a decree of damnation; the Arrowhead and New Truth get involved, causing mayhem and hysteria; the receiver of the decree tries to figure out why they were targeted and how to avoid damnation; and the decree is carried out. In the midst of all of this though, we don’t learn very much about this mysterious, all-knowing cult. We don’t really learn why these decrees started happening, how long they’ve been occurring, or why they are happening. And we don’t make any progress on what, if any, solution there is and how to bring that about. As a result, the storyline lacked a very clear, strong direction. Rather than having a distinct beginning, middle, and end, this felt like six episodes of these people’s day-to-day lives. I’ve read some comments saying that maybe the story will be further expanded, and questions answered, in Season 2 (if there is one), but I am a strong believer in the argument that individual seasons should feel as whole and complete as possible. Ending on a cliffhanger that leaves room to explore more in a future season is one thing, but creating a six(ish)-hour long intro that ends up setting up the actual story that will come later is a bit ridiculous. I also just felt like until the last half of the final episode, the story was kind of slow and draggy in some parts, which I’m never a fan of.

I also thought the lack of a clearly identifiable (at least initially) single main protagonist who serves to guide viewers through this maze was an interesting choice. We spend the first three episodes trying to get to know a set of characters, only to have (most of) them completely abandon us in episode four, where we’re given a new group to follow. It was slightly jarring and made viewing even more disjointed. Because we aren’t given proper time and backstory to get to know these characters very well, I found it hard to connect with and care about them. That said, I enjoyed the characters and storyline more in the latter half, as I found that damnation decree to be more interesting. The cult leaders and members, on the other hand, felt stock-like and two-dimensional. There was no depth or complexity in their actions or motivations, and the one who did have that interesting backstory wasn’t present for very long, and his past was a bit rushed through.

In terms of positives, I found the premise interesting, though execution lacking, and was especially curious to see how the final decree would play out. The acting was fantastic, and the music set the tone nicely.

Overall, I would recommend watching at least the first episode if you’re even mildly interested, because I think it’s one where you’ll have to see for yourself if you like it or not. I wish more plot was given to showing the origins and development of the cult and damnation decrees, as well as advancing it towards some kind of end-goal (good or bad), rather than showing us the same set-up over and over again, but I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they’re treating this as the first half of a whole season, the rest of which will be released later (though if true, I hate that strategy). I’d probably give Season 2 a shot if there is one.

Lots of highs and lows for only 6 eps
I went through different levels of interest while watching this. There are parts of the show thay move really fast amd others that drag. The drastic change after ep 3 really throws you for a loop and it takes a bit to get back into it.
Over all I think its still worth it plotwise. It really picks up at the end and I suggest powering through the rough spot.
The ending plottwists are super interesting and I hope they make a 2nd season.
That being said. I think it was to the show's detriment to kill off Yoo Ah In's character so early. 1. He was the top billed/advertisied cast member so it feels a bit like a bait and switch ... which sucks as a fan of his. 2. His character was super interesting. 3. It felt like we deserved to see more of his story.
(But i suppose, after that last scene there is a chance he could come back anyway lol)
The cgi is ok. Seen better, seen worse. The way the creaters absolutely thrash people borders on torture porn and im actually thankful that they didn't make it more realistic. Like, at first I was like ""if that happened he would already be dead/pulp before they zap him"" but then as the show went on, I was glad they didnt go that far since it happened so often.
The cult stuff was a great reflection on how humans work in times of crisis and herd mentality.
Overall. A solid ""enjoyable"".

Main theme is good but expected more
Well…I dont exactly know how to feel about this one. For me the main theme was interesting, I liked how they talked about religious fanaticism, how people use religion to manipulate others and how they misrepresent religion to justify their actions. The whole thing about right or wrong judgment was also interesting. The acting was also good and I was only bothered by that crazy streamer, because despite thinking that the character is bad on purpose, I still found him quite irritating in the first episodes. I may have a unpopular opinion about this but the visual effects didn’t bothered me here and actually I found it fine because I’ve seen worse.

But then what stopped me from loving Hellbound? Well, the main theme it is interesting but the last episode was a little too forced for me and they ended season one with NO EXPLANATION of anything. I know it’s probably because they wanted to do a S2 but seemed like everything happened and nothing happened at the same time because we ended understanding nothing about how these things are happening, especially about the things that happened in last episode. They just set the whole season on religious fanaticism and that's it.

The other thing that upset me a lot is that Yoo Ah In dies in episode 3, which left me with an uncertain feeling because for me his character was pretty interesting (actually the only one for me besides the female lead). Maybe he'll come back later in the story if they decide to do a 2nd season, but I think that the character's death so early in the story ended up leaving those who waited so long to see him the drama with a feeling of disappointment.

So yeah. I don’t think that drama was bad, I actually found entertaining but I definitely expected more. For now I think we’ll have to wait for season 2.

What Started Promising Ended Promising
Do Not Read If You Don't Want Spoilers.......
.
.
.

Before I fully begin I just want to say that all the actors in this show done a phenomenal job and they should be proud of themselves. Yoo Ahin done a really good job portraying the character Jung Jinsoo along with the other cast members in their specific roles. I remembered Park Jungmin from his role in ""You're All Surrounded"" so I was happy to see him again. All the staff done a great job from the cinematography to the CGI itself, it was really good.

I was originally going to rate this drama a 3 or 5 because of the way I thought Episode 6 was going to end, the first 3 episodes were very interesting and kept me watching at the edge of my seat wanting more. Then we got to episode 4 and 5. Those episodes felt the exact same, it felt like the plot wasn't going anywhere not progressing at all and very rushed due to the 6 episode limit ( they could've done with at least 3 more episodes)

Youngjae and his wife Sohyun were not very interesting nor did I have any emotional investment into them because of the brief period we were with them. The Policeman Kyunghoon's story is wasted potential unless they hopefully expand on it in a Second Season as it would be interesting to know what he has been up to in the 4 year time skip.

Then we get to Episode 6 which revived my hope for the show. When Youngjae and Sohyun died for their baby I thought to myself ""Is this going to end like Possessed"" and felt very disappointed. For the record I really hate the ""Everyone Dies"" endings, I thought I completely wasted my time on this drama getting invested only to be thoroughly disappointed in the end, I had rated the drama a 5 at this point believing that that would be the end of things and that it was going to end so predictable. That's when a scene came on that changed my opinion of the show completely and has jumped it up to a 7. This scene has created so much potential for this show that I want to watch more immediately but unfortunately I cannot. This is why you should have more faith in the screenwriter especially when they have Train To Busan on their record. If you would like to know what this scene was then please watch the show. Thank you.
What started promising, ended promising.

One additional thing I must say is that I love that recently a lot more K-Dramas are exclusively Netflix series with the Netflix money as directors and screenwriters in South Korea are free from the restrictions that cable Tv puts on them and can do more than they could when airing on a network. Nothing is really censored. It is very enjoyable when the creator has freedom of expression. If this drama were to have aired on a TvN or OCN it probably would have been really bad due to a lack of funding and censorship laws that they must abide by.

Projector Face
Projector Face is death angel, not a good animation for a death angel,

The series is written by a known writer, and series was based from a webtoon, some may love it some people might pass this series because a good written script was so so directed and animated,

Can't argue with the actors, they get paid at the end of the day

Music could have been better if it was directed well enough

If you like fiction stories and could not care less about the animation it is a well written series,
however if you are a critic and value the portrayal of the written script and how the series was directed i think some will be satisfied and some will look for more because there is a lot missing as the series was directed.

last scene was a copied from the terminator and species, i think it was cool ( why was the animation good at the end scene only)

A good script, an ok acting, so so direction, so so soundtrack, so so animation
meaning that if a season 2 materializes with improve direction, soundtrack and animation then it would be good

Usually season 1 series always deliver, then high expectations on season 2 materializes
this series, i think it is the other way around, keep it low on season 1 then turn it up on Season 2 (hope so)

Not As Good Or Captivating As Train To Busan & Peninsula
I'm watching Hellbound and no idea how I feel about it yet. It's just so weird

I really really really can't stand that arrowhead livestreamer with all his glow in the dark face paint and a skull on his head. He's really fucking annoying.

Woaw I did not expect Yoo Ah In to die not even halfway through the series. I thought he was supposed to be the main character.

You can truly see hellbound is made by the person who made train to Busan & peninsula.

I truly hate that mother of the baby HOW CAN YOU HONESTLY THINK AN INFANT, A NEWBORN BABY IS AN EVIL SINNER? HOW CAN THAT COME ACROSS YOUR MIND? MY FIRST INSTINCT AND REACTION WOULD BE LIKE THIS IS UNFAIR, NO WAY A BABY CAN BE EVIL OR A SINNER. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. I really hate her.

Lawyer woman is a kickass lady though.

What a fucking moron that mother is. She's lowkey on my list of characters I hated most this year.

OMG WOW OMO! Annoying livestreamer received the decree as well. Damn.... that's kind of full circle. Oh wait he's world's biggest asshole.

Okay, I take it back. The mother really had a redemption arc and both she & her husband protected the baby.

Oh my god no..... not again some kind of zombies. Seriously what is that ending?

I have a love-hate relationship with Hellbound and I have no idea how to rate this.

I hated it but also admired it. Some aspects they did sooo fucking well while others had me like humph this ain't that great. I was also fascinated by some elements while others made me go like bitch not this shit again. The only character I was actually invested in was a baby AND I NORMALLY DON'T LIKE BABIES. I did appreciate a character that was a single mother of a 13 year old boy & a 6 year old girl. Also, the dad of the baby was nice & baby momma really had a redemption as well. BUT SERIOUSLY THIS CREATOR DIRECTOR DUDE HAS SUCH A FETISH FOR PARENTS SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. It is in all the 3 works I've seen so far of him. AND SOMETIMES IT EVEN HAPPENS MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE WORK.

I guess my undying love for Netflix made kdramas is not so undying anymore. I guess it will be a 6 since it is my least favourite project of that creator.

Hellbound? More like what the hell did I just watch?
I was very interested in this drama when I saw it on the ""upcoming"" section on Netflix. I watched the trailer and was very intrigued by it. Even after the first 2-3 episodes, the entire concept still seemed very interesting and my eyes were glued to the screen. The idea of having a small shift in the main character of the drama was rather interesting as well. However, after I finished the drama, I realised that everything made no sense. There was no explanation whatsoever - I mean, why did Yoo Ah-in even coax the girl to kill the man who killed her mother? What was the point of that? And what happened to that girl's father? Literally, what the hell is going on?

This drama had great ideas that were just poorly executed. Perhaps it's because they were only limited to those few episodes. I heard there'd be a season 2, but what's the point in splitting it into two seasons if that meant ending the first season extremely poorly? Was it really worth it, Netflix?

In summary:
What i liked - cgi, concept
What i disliked - incomprehensible plot

Star of the show: ???

Rating: 5/10
Watch if you like to be confused

Confusing and confused
(very light spoilers, nothing major revealed)
As everyone else, I was very excited for Hellbounds release. And I wouldn’t say that I was let down, but I still think that this drama left a lot to be desired.

Without a doubt, this show has a lot going for it, including cinematography and a few stand-out performances, especially coming from cult -leader Jung Jin-soo who had me captivated every time he was on screen. But this is a very plot-heavy show so it feels fair to focus my review of this drama mostly on that.
Hellbound has a few interesting concepts that I really appreciated. I think the most interesting aspect of this show, is how it explores the exploitation of tragedies. How would we act, if the existence of God and hell were confirmed in our universe? Wouldn’t our first instinct be to capitalize on those events? How long would it take us to try and rationalize what is happening, to twist the stories until they fit in our world-view? I think it was very fitting that no matter how out of control the events of the drama got, even after literally proving the existence of Angels of death, capitalism was the one thing that prevailed. That gave the entire show an air of capitalist-realism that I found really interesting. I got a strong Death Note vibe from the whole premise but the story had enough additions to make it feel like its own thing. Analyzing how we as our society would react to such a setting, factoring in the internet, mob-mentality, streamers, and video virality made this feel fresh and relevant. I also know that South Korea has a pretty serious cult-problem so the premise of the show also appealed to me on a cultural level.

So yes, in theory, this drama could have been great. But as the MyDramaList score shows: it’s not. It’s merely alright.
When I first read the synopsis of this show I was wondering, how the hell (no pun intended) they were going to pull off a story as complicated as this one in six episodes. The answer to this question is simple: They don’t. While I could, more or less follow the plot, Hellbound ended up being not only a confusing but also sadly a deeply confused show that doesn’t seem to know what it wants to be. A lot of elements, metaphors, and subtext were introduced and then quickly dropped, because six episodes simply weren’t enough to tell this story. I think the best example for this problem was demonstrated in detective Jin Kyung Hoon who, for a good amount of this drama on every level seemed to be its main character but suddenly disappeared when a new protagonist was introduced by episode four. Now I enjoyed both these characters but still was left kind of stunned when the show, past its mid-point, suddenly decided to tell the story from the point of view of someone we never even met before. Then there is, of course, the open ending, which I did sort of expect but at this point, I am very doubtful that we’re ever going to get a Hellbound season 2, and considering that, this story left way too many knots untied for my taste.

Also, and I don’t know where else where to mention this as it’s only a half-serious criticism of the show, but good God Bae Youngjaes baby is ugly. I felt like laughing every time it was on screen. I understand that the majority of the CGI-budget probably went to the monsters and action (and understandably so) but this has to be the worst animated infant I have seen since Twilight.

I read that many people were disappointed with the drama's lack of gore and that many were hoping for an experience more similar to Sweet Home. While Sweet Home is a show close to my heart, this is not the case for me. I think all the ingredients were there to make this drama special. I didn’t need any more blood from it, just a bit more focus. Sadly the potential to be great doesn’t make something great and so Hellbound simply isn’t.
Still, it’s not a total waste of your time. I am not mad about having watched this. The questions this story poses were interesting enough to keep me engaged. There’s enough about this drama to be somewhat enjoyable, plus while the short runtime might have weakened the quality of the show, this way it at least doesn’t feel as big of a commitment. Should you watch this? Sure but lower your expectations. I will say this: If you liked Death Note you’re probably going to get some kind of kick out of Hellbound. Just bear with it for those few episodes. You’re not going to get a whole lot of explanations from this show but a few interesting thesis statements about the state of the world (plus an ugly looking CGI baby).

Too much philosophy and unanswered questions
This drama is heavy stuff. It is filled with philosophical and ideological musings on religious and pseudo-religious topics which can be difficult material for the viewer. It certainly was for me. I don't mind dramas where you have to think, but I don't like dramas where I feel like I'm in a philosophy lecture where a not very bright professor keeps asking questions without giving any possible answers.
The idea was ok and I was curious how the creators would solve their problems. Although there wasn't a clear main character that I could sympathize with, the main question posed in this drama made me curious enough to stick with it. Unfortunately, the answer given by the creators raised more questions for me and just when it started to get interesting, the drama ended. I waited in vain for the next episode. It left me disappointed and frustrated, and I expect a slightly different outcome from a drama.

CRAZY good!
I have been waiting for over a month for ""Hellbound"" to come out and now that I finished it, I have no words but one...CRAZY. The storyline is fascinating yet thrilling.
WARNING- those who cannot handle violance, gore, blood - please do not watch as it has extreme level of violance!
The actors put out such a great performance that I couldn't help but to get attached to the characters even tho most of them had less screentime and get emotional for their end comings. I think my favourite episode would be Ep.6, it shows the relationship and bond of a family especially between a mother and a child & how you can't help but be beside them and protect them in their worst times to the point of even sacrificing oneself for them.
I went from being surprised to being angry, horrified and emotional. So yeah it was a full on rollercoaster of emotions.
I hope Season 2 will be sooner than expected cause this cliffhanger has left me with SO many questions. Final thought- WATCH IT!

What do you call a story without a conclusion? A purpose? Easy, mean it's useless. It's a nightmare
I honestly don't know what to say with this one. But this show is a nightmare.

Yes the production is ok, the acting was ok, the visuals ok too. But story was shit.

It was never revealed where the otherworldly beings really came from. Then the story jump to the point where the religious group was in the seat of power but is definitely the bad guys. And the street gang, bad guy looking are the real protectors of the people.

It also never explained how a newborn can be a sinner and how it survived judgement. Then suddenly the show was done with no conclusion. The baby was alive. The religious group's abuse of power were exposed. The said group's founder who died at the early part of the story suddenly miraculously alive again.

If this is a marketing strategy for people to watch the next season? Then, no thanks. It's a waste of time.

Lost interest halfway.
Don't get me wrong, I was really invested in this drama since the first trailer came out... But after watching it I feel a little disappointed. It started really well but after the 3rd episode I couldn't really see where it was headed. For me it could had just ended there.
The second half of this drama was hard to watch. The change of characters made it hard to sympathize with them and the plot...(if there even was one) had so many holes. The concept was GOOD but the way they decided to develop it is such a waste of potential.
I feel like this drama could had been so much more...but as it is now I'm not even interested in a second season. Overall I give it a 7/10.

Is this about apocalypse, corruption, judgement day, monsters or what? I seriously don't know
People have mixed feedback about this so if you liked this drama, I completely respect your preference however this review might not be for you. It's all my opinion so read at your own risk.

I don't know where to start how this is problematic for me. I don't have much expectations when I started watching it because it's not really the type of drama that I prefer to watch. I'm just seriously curious as to where the plot will lead me and maybe it's an unexpected gem.

During the first episode, I just thought maybe it's a slowburn drama wherein everything will make sense as I go further but I finished the drama and not much luck on it to be honest. I just seriously finished it because I don't want another pending drama on my watchlist.

Kudos to the actors though. I can see that they gave their all so I appreciate that. Maybe this drama is just really not my style. The ending also makes me feel like, 'what? Seriously they're expecting to drag this crap further?'

If you're thinking of watching this, it's just a 6 episode watch so why not see for yourself. You might like this more than I did. But if you're someone who loves watching series that makes sense, you can skip this one.

Not recommended -_- !!
Watching this drama made my blood pressure rise. It's very confusing and painful. They let the bullies bully anyone they wanted and made innocents look like sinners and punished them.


Those idiot cult priests made a fool out of the whole nation and the people accepted it. Police and Law couldn't do anything about it.


Didn't want to add spoilers but I was out of words. I was bored so I watched it. now I'm regretting it. My mind is a mess now. A total war field!.

Realistically epic
Watching hellbound was a wonderful and beautiful experience for me. The ones who said this drama was not so good or scary they had expectations of sweet home type apocalypse. But this drama showed how just one reason is enough for mankind lose to their sanity and follow a herd blindly. How some people start thinking themselves as god. Eagerly waiting for season 2. To the ones who are still thinking wether to watch or skip, I would say to watch hellbound without any thoughts and expectations. This drama shows that people's thoughts and fear itself is making their lives a living hell.

Human Fears the Unknown
This show may get flagged with mixed reviews, but I honestly quite enjoyed its concept. Despite its flaws in story-telling, I felt like everything was intended.

Even though this is a supernatural show, the real focus isn't actually on the supernaturals, but on humans and our society.

We as humans thrive on information, knowledge and predictability, so as soon as that is thrown out the window, chaos will ensue and swallow the world. And this show captures this idea perfectly as we see how quickly the world turns when the supernatural events immerged. Furthermore, how vile some people are to corrupt the truth simply for self-gain.

So if you were hoping to jump into this, expecting a creatively-written supernatural world, this show will disappoint you because it doesn't really cover many details on the supernatural side. In fact, towards the latter 3 episodes, you will be given more questions than answers. Some of the supernatural stuff seems to just happen out of the convenience to push the human side of the story, which I can see why some people hate. If you ask me, give it a try - the first episode is a bit of a mystery and open-ended but you should know how you would feel by the second episode.

In terms of acting, I was honestly very impressed. All of the main cast was solid, except for the police - I thought his character was a bit illogical sometimes, so perhaps the writing is to-blame instead. However, a special mention is Yoo Ah In's role. He absolutely sold his character.

Unsettling, Brutal, Unpredictable
In the name of god, even violence is acceptable. The concept is great and different. The story line is so unpredictable and curiosity increases as episodes passes by. It is quite brutal and disturbing to watch humanity dying throughout the series.

I did watch this because of Yoo Ah In. He looked creepy and did a very convincing job. Only question is that why did Yoo Ah In character has to die that early? Definitely did not expected that but didn't like this twist killing the main character that early.
Every supporting character did a great work.

It is not as good as I expected it to be and hyped it made

What an insightful proclamation
I enjoyed this drama because it showed a lot of insightful facts and meaningful scenes that can align with everyday life. When the first demonstration happened, I was surprised because I saw monsters killing a clearly frightened man in a very violent way. I mean in my opinion if I'm heading to my death, violently wouldn't be the way. So I kinda disagreed with the way they executed the deaths. I'm a Christian and I know that many of the things being displayed in this drama doesn't align with God's words, but they do align a lot with everyday beliefs and doings. Many people think that humans are born sinners, that fear can eradicate those sins. This drama executed it perfectly. The drama is on point, I loved the scenes and I can't wait for Season 2. I mean the ending was extremely surprising for me, so I'm waiting for any news of Season 2. The music was good as well, though I was too focused on the stuff displayed on the screen. The actors did a pretty good job, I congratulate them for showing perfect emotions. This is my review of this drama, if any of you have any comments and questions, just list them below, please.

How people would react with a constant fear of death?
That's the first time I write a review, I was surprised after seeing ratings because this drama is part of the genre that people like nowadays.

To be honest I put this drama on my list without even knowing what was the plot and started just cause it's short (only six episodes of around 40-50 minutes). Once started, it immediately caught me, and I keep asking what's happening? Did I miss something? What's the truth behind these CGI Monsters?

I liked how the series shows the people reaction, the victims themselves and the ""audience"", it let us see how people act if they believe they're controlled by a higher power or if they think to have free will.

(I apologize if reading this review you will find only disconnected discourses, I would like to say that it doesn't contain any kind of judgment)

A really gripping storyline!
I've seen all sorts of korean romcoms, comedies and action movies and this is the first time I'm writing a review for one because I feel so strongly about Hellbound and what seems to me is unfair criticism.

There are so NINE things about this series that I just felt so deeply about.
(Full disclosure: Im a Muslim and I think that does affect how I look at this series as I try to compare it with the world of today and of the future.)

1- The storyline is one that has never ever been done in the history of any mainstream entertainment.

2- All the characters, including the lunatic cultists and its supporters are so well-depicted even with them being so bonkers.

3- The portrayal of how cultism can cultivate such a grim world run by borderline schizophrenic, narcissistic human beings
having no true allegiance to anyone except themselves is so on point!

4- The fascinated on-lookers filming each demonstration with their phones showing false sympathy as the world spirals further down into turmoil almost comes as a slap in the face to people who live such lives today.

5- The masked stinking rich VIPs paying to get front seats to watch what seems to them as another form of entertainment as the 'lower beings' suffer.

6- The way people have to make the hardest decision to die in hiding just so their families aren't ostracised for something they did or did not do.

7- The look of despair when people receive the decree and punishment, with some of them ignorant enough to continue to live a life of sin as if they were still untouchable in a world where seemingly the sinful are so cruelly and brutally punished.

8- The world-wide organized crime and violence that ensues using the new 'religion' as a false front.

9- The blatantly deceitful workings of the cult behind the scenes to ensure they remain in power.

All in all, I am extremely surprised how the writers were able to so accurately illustrate a world with gullible people having no real sense of direction. The on-lookers, supporters and crime syndicate are the perfect fit for the good, the bad and the ugly. If you put some thought into it, it almost feels like this is exactly what the world would behave and react if something so horrific was to happen.

P.S. The chaotic camera work in the latter half of the last episode is so terrifyingly good.

P.P.S. I've never been the sort of person who would rewatch anything hence the low rewatch value.

A Victim of Squid Game's Success
It's important to remember that there is a difference between bad dramas and dramas not meant for your taste. In my opinion, HB is NOT a bad drama.

The themes of the show are clear and easy to understand, yet open for multiple interpretations. The action scenes are directed extremely well. The music never seems too out of place. Despite being only 6 episodes long, at no point did I feel like the story was overloaded or rushed.

On paper, not much happens but it is still entertaining in other ways. Thinking about how HB applies to the real world and what you would do if you were any of the characters on screen was a really eye-opening experience for me.

I must admit that episode 5 and the first half of episode 6 were painfully boring to sit through though. However, the final fight scene makes up for this.

I say HB is a victim of Squid Game's success because if HB was released first, I have a feeling that it would be receiving more positive reviews right now. Yes, HB is not as stimulating as Squid Game since it focuses on broader themes and a smaller pot of characters.

I urge everyone to be fair with their criticisms of this show.

Even so, HB is not perfect.

A few things that bothered me included:

A. WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT IN ALL OF THIS?: Okay, a trio of supernatural creatures condemn people to Hell in public. After the first public demonstration, this should be a nation-wide emergency. So, where is the president in all of this? And how are peoples' brutal deaths allowed to be livestreamed on TV? Last time I checked, your tattoos could not be seen on television in South Korea. I seriously doubt actual death is an exception.

B. WAS YOUNGJAE BORN YESTERDAY?: There's a random 4-year time skip, and the New Truth is practically a stand-in for the government now. There are museums dedicated to the sinners who agreed to be a part of public demonstrations. At this point, everyone and their dead grandpa knows how powerful the New Truth is and the existence of these monsters. So, tell me why Jae is so shocked when his friend gets condemned to Hell right in front of him. He acts like he has no clue what his friend is talking about when his time is almost up.

C. THIS HOSPITAL IS SO RUDE!: Lawyer Min has a mother in her late 60's suffering from cancer. When her already near-death mother is struck on the head with a metal bat and rushed to the hospital, tell me why healthcare officials threw her on a bed and called it a day. She wasn't rushed to the emergency room. She, despite being in an extremely critical condition, is not given someone to supervise her state. Mind you, the hospital was not busy at all. Poor Min had to be the first person to discover that her mother died. I was in disbelief.

Keep these in the back of your mind, and you'll be able to enjoy HB.

I think some people are watching just to see how bad it really is after reading the reviews and making their own assumption about the film, which by all means, you have the right to. I came in with the same thought but intended to see it through the end. I know a lot of people aren't interested in the drama mainly because they held such a high bar that wasn't reached but I know there are a lot of films out there that didn't make a whole lot of sense until they were released a second part, answering the questions we had and some others we didn't even know we were thinking of. I say we give the drama a chance even though it is ultimately up to the writers, actors, and directors if they want to continue the drama or not.

Better As It Goes
So I got here cause the name and I gotta say, it was an interesting ride. Ok in the beginning I was a little confused about how people could possibly manipulate/control the will of a GOD but then I remembered... we're humans, and there's no doubt in my mind if something like this began to happen (which I'm surprised something like this hasn't happened yet) that it would definitely go something like this. Where everyone just follows like sheep and puts the blame on everyone else (like how we do now). Anyway, the more things started coming together I started to enjoy it more. There's a few parts that are intense but nothing too serious. As a parent I got kinda angry toward the end but if you step back and keep an open mind, you'll see something's came to a good/satisfying end.
That ending had S2 vibes and I'm ready af for it
Enjoy...

What is up with the ending?
That was an okay movie.

The acting and visual effects wasn't too bad. The story was meh, I understand the concept of sinners being judged and sent to hell. The story made sense at first, but it took a dive from the middle to the end for me.

Yoo Ah-in ending up murdering some people and getting sent to hell himself. There's a new founder of the New Truth who seems to have taken advantage of the whole situation. You have a group called Arrowhead that goes around and beat up people.

Basically, the New Truth feels very cult-like.

Also my reaction to that ending ↓
What? Someone explain that ending?!?! I am so confuseeee. So, baby survived because of the parents sacrifice (my understanding), but, then what is up with that ending? Was it just a cliffhanger?

Also, did it change cast in the middle?

I mean what????

They Don't die because they are sinners
The drama started with some serious murder by the monster or we can call them angel from the hell...that really made me feel nauseous,.,,, *lots of blood* as the story progresses it was intriguing and had many jaw dropped scenes and also made me think is it even possible in real life???.... the connection between the characters was beautiful, though there were loop holes in the story and many things that were unexplained and left to viewers judgement, it was good. the CGI was perrrfect!!! and storyline was good. The acting was superb and intense. This season was not draggy and boring. I liked the last scene very much .... they don't die.... so are the all alive... are they born with super-natural power, or are the ghosts... lets wait for next season...there was no moment when I thought of dropping this series. IT'S A MUST WATCH GUYS!!!!

Wow
This was a really good show in my opinion.

I like shows that revolves around cults as most of the time I dont understand why people follow cults in blind faith.

I am a religious person who believes in hell and heaven. and If anything that we are blessed about the fact that we dont know when we will die or where we will end.
I will elaborate more below but it may contain spoilers along with my character analysis of the drama ...

First lets start with the first 3 episodes and our main Lead Yoo Ah In who nailed his role (as usual), the man who created the cult and received his prophecy 20 years ago, within these 20 years this man didnt try for the least bit to be a better person or do good deeds and defy his fate ( like Satan when he was kicked out and defied God, he promised to guide humans into sin?). There is a fact that the cop detective mentioned to him which is the humans will and freedom of choice, we all own that even if our fate is written its written by our own choices and decisions rather than us being dictated by it, has our ML try to do good rather than try to create chaos and fear would things have changed for him?
The Hellbound concept and these creatures were there just as a factor to bring out the human darkness and see how a human would react in such circumstances and situations. People were driven out of fear to make them believe in God but fear were never a long lasting.. motive? or engine lets say as people rebel towards the end .. like it was mentioned in the first episode about making people fear God.
God, religion and prophets for it to long last should be driven by Love, understanding , guidance and true faith I would say.

Then comes the last 3 episodes in which a child receives the prophecy of hell (we all know that children are without sin and they go to heaven) its the factor that was put there to make people question the reality of the cult, and those people who promote fear, as we are taught that God is merciful and kind, the child who was saved by a mothers and fathers love as they defied that destiny and changed the fate of their own child as they believed differently. Have they not acted and just stood there to watch their child would have faced that very same fate, hence our fate is written by us.

Thats just me focusing on the 2 main stories, if we come to think of the detective's decision in the end to save his daughter, or the people who received the hellbound message when their sins were not unforgivable and so or those who wanted to take God's message as they say into their hands and start attacking and killing those who goes against them in the name of maintaining the system (As they showed in the beginning that those people were minors as they were the easiest to manipulate and brain wash, did those actually have faith in that cult? not likely as they would have prevented from doing bad things out of fear at least but they liked the concept of death and people being hellbound, the concept of something new and exciting as long as it didnt touch them, same goes to that youtuber who were a hard core follower but ones it touched him he lost his faith and fell into nothingness ) .. pretty much alot of things to look out for and think of!

Therefore I found this drama to be really good, I havent read the webtoon and I am glad that I didnt as I enjoyed the drama more this way, and I really liked the tension, the depth and characters along the way, the motives .. etc and I would highly recommend it.

It just doesn't let up from the start.
I'm still relatively new to Korean horror. I started a few years ago with ""Kingdom"" on Netflix and I really enjoyed that. Inspired by that experience I jumped on that infamous ""Train to Busan"" and, more recently, ""All of Us Are Dead"". Somewhere along the way I also managed to catch ""The Host"" and ""The Uncanny Counter"" (although not strictly horror, there are definitely supernatural elements at play in ""Uncanny Counter""). So, what would happen if you were to take those supernatural elements, throw it in with the visceral horror of ""Busan/""All of Us""/""Kingdom"" add a huge dash of End of Days/Revelations prophecies, bring all of that into the here and now - mix it all up and here you have it: - ""Hellbound""!

The story starts out simple enough - an Angel comes to visit and tells you exactly when you're going to die. At the appointed time three demons come and drag you to hell. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Easy enough, right? Not so fast. They start in the middle of the story without warning and, in the first five minutes, you are dragged into the streets of Seoul were you become a part of the action. I can so clearly remember looking around trying to find a way out of the horror, but - nothing.

Now, when I watched it, that was about all I knew of the plot, so I will spare you the pot synopsis because, like ""The Uncanny Counter"", I sometimes find it better to be not too certain what you've gotten yourself into. So, just get on and enjoy the ride. Well rounded, multidimensional characters abound, tight plotting and decent CGI. I'm very glad I gave this one a chance. The closest I will give to a spoiler is to say that Episode 4 throws in one of the greatest WTF moments in the history of ever, and it isn't the only ginormous reveal in the series. Seriously, if the horror genre is your thing - psychological horror especially - give this one a try. I think you'll have a good (?) time.

Humans being typically, mindlessly violent
There were not many surprises for me, in this violent and unsettling horror drama.
It is the usual portrayal of people manipulating events, putting a divine angle on them and then basically running their part of the world, as they see fit, under the guise of it being in the name of their God.
It happens for real, of course, minus the supernatural element we have here.
Hypocrisy overflows like Niagra, with the scum and thugs of society using the punishment of sinners as an excuse to gleefully maim and murder. ""Where is their punishment?"" I ranted!
Yoo Ah-in's character is suitably dark and creepy. He rarely over-plays his characters and this was no exception.
There is a time jump part way through, with new characters. I wondered what happened to some and there is one in particular whose identity I'm not sure I understood correctly.
Some people are truly disgusting in this and there are the usual onlookers, making no effort to protect or assist the most vulnerable and outnumbered, against mere mortals.
As with several relatively recent Netflix series (Sweet Home and The Uncanny Counter particularly spring to mind), I just hope they make a S2 with a cast that flows, otherwise the ending is less than satisfactory, with more questions than answers.
A good cast and plenty to shout at your TV about.

To respect or to fear
Hellbound was tense, gripping and with 6 episodes in first season, leaves you with a suspense as to what will happen next. Although it's not the best work I have seen, but Hellbound has its moments of delivering itself without giving much clues of the whole premise whatsoever.

Although it was a bit slow, Hellbound didn't loose it's hold over the storytelling of violent aspect of showcasing God's wish. Hellbound was dark, gripping and maybe turn unsettling to many viewers, but will keep you attached to it.

My Rating : 7.5/10

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""Hellbound"" is an atmospheric drama with a dark story and masterful direction.

The drama has an interesting story to offer. exploring the nature of men when an unexpected new element appears, changing the way we lived so far and spreading fear. Fear that is the common factor that everyone uses in order to achieve their goals. And the ending was masterfully handled as well, with a huge cliffhanger to prepare the audience for what is to come next.

However, and apart from those, the drama felt hectic and partial. The pace was all over the place, with events following one another in a way that wasn't either smooth nor served the drama well. In addition, the drama was disjointed, as its parts didn't blend in together nor followed each other nicely.

Finally, the CGI were not great, but the performances were masterful by everyone in the cast.

So, overall, 5 out of 10.

Too many unanswered questions
Hellbound (2021)

Likes
1. Great acting from the cast. It makes me think what will I do if i receive a decree? Do i spend my last remaining hours hiding in fear or do i spend it saying goodbye to people? I know everyone eventually dies, it's just that here, the way you die is too scary and merciless. The decree also doesn't say the reason why you're going to hell. And how come Jinsu got the decree 20 years ago but others only had a few days to live?
2. The kind of religious fanaticism is happening right now and everywhere in the world. Not just religion, even in politics and social media we have this scary cancel culture. Some people are so righteous thinking their way is the right way and bullies everyone else who does not conform to their truth. And if their truth is wrong, instead of correcting them, they hide the truth and call the others as fake news. I wish everyone would ve more compassionate towards each other and less self serving.

Dislikes
Since there are only 6 episodes, there are too many unanswered questions thus it's hard to feel satisfied with the ending. Hoping for a season 2 to explain not only the last scene but also the overall phenomenon.

Rating: 8/10

Fell for Yoo Ah In . Even he's the ""bad guy here(?)
First of all, I don't know why I hadn't watched any of YAI's drama but I just fell for his acting. His eyes speak so much. I haven't watched any of his dramas before and I regret it. The way he was immersed in the character, you'd feel he really was the bad guy and all these things were real. Whenever he spoke in this drama, except for his last 10 mins of life, there was something dark in them. Like he knew all your secrets and using them to manipulate you but you couldn't understand it and just following cuz the was supposedly the ""good guy"". Whenever he was speaking, his eyes spoke a lot more and they gave me chills. I'm a fan of him now. Gonna watch his other dramas.

Now coming to the story I think there's gonna be a second season? I hope they do it. Cuz the last scene was a cliffhanger sort of. But if that woman came back, does that mean everyone did too? So what will happen now? But what I didn't understand was the basis of punishment. Like why did the baby was punished. And as YAI's character said, he never committed any sin. And if he was telling the truth then why was he punished? And why after 20 years? Why the prophecy thing happened 20 years before and why only for him and not others? Yes, there were so many plot holes. But still, I liked the mini drama. But yes, I'd like the answers to my questions in the next season.

what just happened?
I've been watching kdramas for so long...

IDK what to feel about the whole show, I definitely expected too much that when I finished it, it didn't live up to my expectations which made me so disappointed. The whole story was all over the place tbh.

The sudden cut after episode 3, the time jump Idk how I feel abt that but it's not a good feeling. The story is actually really good but how they execute it and put it all together was kind of not it. I've never had so many questions on a show and finished it without even getting a single answer.

The cast was actually really impressive, bcs I've watched these actors and they are really good but there is no character development in this show and I feel like there is really no main character. Overall, I can't say that it is one of the best kdramas this 2021 bcs it's not. But I'm looking forward to season 2 bcs that was IDK what happened, the ending, and everything but I'm still gonna look forward to the next season. Hopefully, it will be so much better!

Interesting concept. Less interesting plot.
Hellbound is a short Supernatural Horror series that takes a very interesting concept and turns it into a less interesting plot. The premise of this drama is very scary, even if it's not so original. We learn in the very first scene that there are people who have been given a death decree by an ominous being and once that day and time comes they will be sent, very violently, to hell. The idea definitely gave me ""The Ring"" vibes, but instead of a ghost story, this drama focuses on a cult that emerges from this phenomenon called ""The New Truth"" led by Jung Jin Soo played by Yoo Ah In. I am a fan of Yoo Ah In and a huge fan of stories about cults, so I expected to really love this drama, but it dragged too much and was too open for interpretation for my taste. Instead of being intrigued, I got bored quickly.

At first, there were too many characters for me to follow and care about. All the performances were good, but I felt like I didn't get a chance to really get to know characters like the detective and his daughter, and the lawyer and her mom, besides their connections to the cases and the cults. I felt like there were a few scenes that were meant to be touching but I didn't know the characters well enough to be truly moved. Chairman Jung was the most interesting character initially but I don't think his character was explored and humanized enough either. As emotional as some of the acting was I never cried once. As the sin and morality of characters were questioned it was never deep enough for me to relate to or empathize with besides it just being a horrible way to die. I also wanted the cult members and their desire to join to be more realistic. This brings me to my least favorite character... the leader of Arrowhead. Those scenes were the most annoying part of this drama. The cheesy neon and random yelling was silly instead of scary, and not funny enough to be considered dark comedy.

Would I watch this again? Probably. I know that's surprising, but I'm sure I missed a lot of details binging this the first time. I find cult stories interesting enough to give this another shot, especially if there is a season 2. The open-ended storytelling makes me curious about how others may interpret what happened. I'm not sure if I would binge-watch it in one day again. The episodes felt too long. And I would definitely be tempted to skip every single arrowhead web show scene.

Overall, Hellbound wasn't bad but didn't live up to my expectations. It felt like a really longwinded prequel and less like a fully finished season. Dystopian K-dramas are obviously in (Thanks to Squid Game), but this one seems more over the top and cartoony than disturbing and realistic. By the end, I had more questions than answers but there weren't enough characters that I cared about to make me care much about the answers anyway. Although the visual effects were ""fun"" I can see the webtoon maybe being better at telling this story than this drama, possibly filling in some huge character holes left in this drama, although I never read it so maybe not. I do like the moral questions some of the characters faced, those were the most interesting parts of the story to me, but I wish there were fewer scenes with arrowhead and its annoying delinquent vigilante goons. This is another one of those dramas that I probably would have liked better as a much shorter movie. I expect that there will be some pushback from religious folks who don't like the idea of god's wrath being interpreted. I can also see some die-hard Harry Potter fans not being impressed by certain parts of the plot near the end. There's also a lot of violence without consequences, so if you don't like violence this is definitely not the drama for you. I would still say true fans of supernatural horror could lower their expectations and still enjoy a lot of what this drama has to offer. I just wonder what a better screenwriter could have done with this plot (and yes, I really liked Train to Busan, but it wasn't a series). A better writer could have written in some more Yoo Ah In scenes, who I felt was underutilized, and could have made 6 episodes not feel like too many. I also don't usually expect a season 2 but this one feels like it really needs one to feel complete. Until then, at least it can make a great ""What the Hell (pun intended) did I watch"" topic of conversation.

It’s about humans trying to give meaning to supernatural events..
Overall series is decent though not the great one out there.
There are some logical gaps for sure.
Series is about: (these are obvious and many understood in same way, just wanted to state here)
1. How few use the some supernatural phenomenon to their advantage and they eventually end up becoming more evil to maintain that image.
2. Another set of people involve in satisfying their whims using the same event. They are more dangerous from the very beginning.
3. If god created that Supernatural phenomenon , there might be some mistakes in the process. It would take time to rectify/modify them. GOD’S CREATION IS NOT PERFECT. IT EVOLVES OVER TIME.
4. The CGI MONSTERS are just using the brute force and they do not have the ability to care about consequences. Those visuals were unnecessary, horror can be created with simple creatures as well.
5. How humans try to give meaning to any event though it’s never clear why few were selected for that hell.

Few unanswered questions for season 2
1. What is the selection criteria.
2. How did baby survive
3. Why that dead lady became human again .
4. What is the intended message for that supernatural phenomenon or is it just random or is it done by some demons.

Hellbound is a hell to be on your watchlist
Sociology being my major in undergrad made me appreciate this series. It discusses the purpose of religion in our our society. On the level of the individual, it exists to satiate people's search for meaning, answers questions that science still fails to address, matters that are beyond our understanding. As Karl Marx puts it, it is the ""opium of the masses.""

On an institutional level, it serves to ensure social control. We have laws in place, and religion reinforces them in the form of introducing the concept of morality and guilt, of heaven and eternal damnation.

Not a lot of kdramas offer this kind of commentary, so I should say it's worth a watch.

When one capitalizes death and individual experience of death becomes commodity
People start getting prophecies about when they will die, they are ""bound to hell"", soon enough many groups start to be interested in unfortunate souls that got said prophecy. For some it's a witch hunt ""they are sinners, that did awful things! Thus we can violate them"" for others it's a money-making machine. Imagine selling the VIP seats to rich folk to witness how other-worldly beings decapitate the sinner. Imagine live-streaming said death and not be frowned upon for doing so, because it was ""god's will"". Would you watch such live streams? Would you abuse those that presumably did awful things? Are you the one that tries to justify bad/good things as god's will or fate?

Violence is what we enjoy watching. There's plenty of violence in ""Hellbound"", long scenes, bloody, almost intimate. We are the audience that is checking out live streams of judgment day. The violence in the series is utilized as a theme, for viewers to question their taste. Is violence entertainment? what emotions do I feel when I witness such acts on screen?

This show is for those, that enjoy analyzing the subtext which series provides. I don't think that religious folk would enjoy this series as much because the belief of hell and sin are flipped in this series and left ambiguous. (but if one is aware of religious (mostly Christian) texts then it provides interesting subtext)

The acting was great as always, the emotions were raw, some characters were hateable, and in general, it was a job well done.

Rewatch value is there, because once one knows characters' motivations, one can see their actions in a different light.

SPOILER: I'm excited for season 2 because it feels like they are following the ""reborn"" theme, which will be even more exciting!

One of the easiest 10/ 10's I have given in a while - I went into this excited, but scared that the trailer would have been overhyped, and the drama itself would have fallen flat. Instead, this exceeded all my expectations and then some. Each episode had me on the edge of my seat, but also had me stressed out that I couldn't watch another episode even though I really wanted to. Impressed and Intense was my motto.

I am not sure how to explain how much I loved this series. I loved how gruesome and gorey it was. I loved the religious ""undertones"" with Christianity and how the six episode series ended. I loved how it was broken up three and three episodes, the first introducing the ""beginning"" with characters are we thought were mains, but weren't, and the last three introducing this new world. But most of all, I LOVED how dark it kept getting - you thought that in episode one or two or even three, that a certain event would be the turning point, or the most fucked up (excuse my language) thing that has happened in the episode, and then the writer is like...no...we can top it. Especially with the premise of the last 3 episodes, I was impressed that someone would even go that far, but at the same time, was sobbing because it was extremely messed up how far everything was going.

I would recommend this over and over again if you like dark television - and not that there is a ""supernatural"" dark aspect, but the fact of how society would react if something happened that was outside of their understanding. And it's a scary thing.

Human Nature at its worst.
This show was insane. I enjoyed it so much the most gripping part for me was this is the true side of humans. Gullible, cruel, mean, violent, just all around evil. It made you take a real good look at yourself and wonder could I be like this. They say no person is born evil we are just born into evilness. That is an insane but logical statement and it is talked about in the show. Now if we talk about the violence of this show then omg it was crazy but I’m twisted so I like stuff like this. The end episode was amazing and the love shown was truly remarkable… Bravo

Unforgivably dark... just the way I like it
WHAT I LIKED:
Pretty much everything. Despite the fantastical nature of events depicted in the show, one can easily draw a parallel between those events and reality. Pretty much every authoritarian system out there, which includes religion and the current environment of shoving everything down your throat for ""your safety"" because ""they"" know better, is succinctly and brutally demonstrated in the show. To me, the show is about death and the randomness of it, and how certain despicable opportunists have taken advantage of that phenomenon and contorted it to suit their mythical narrative and amass untold influence and wealth.

However, the best part of the show was the end. It's the most beautiful thing I've seen in a show/movie in a very very long time. That one thing balances out the nihilism and overall bleakness of human nature the show is spilling over with.

It's just six episodes long, as opposed to the meandering and repetitive 16 episodes that most Korean shows tend to be. I suppose we have Netflix to thank for it, as they impose that condition, and have managed to get some really good shows produced, e.g., Squid Game, D. P., and the entertaining My Name.

There's no point talking about the making of the show and other technical accomplishments. And those don't matter to me much. If a show can pull me in into its world, regardless of the nature of that world, and keep me invested in the characters and the events, then that show has done pretty much everything right. So was the case with this one as well.

WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:
The show suggests there will be another season. In and of itself, the show is complete. It reaches its conclusion, and there are plenty of answers one can extract from it. The last-minute ""twist"" was unwarranted and made me go, ""Oh, come on. Not you, too"", a reaction identical to the one I had after watching another amazing show, ""Squid Game"". To me, the ""twist"" just overcomplicates the narrative, which clearly wasn't required. I guess the financials took precedence over art here, yet again. Or, maybe, the story was conceived this way from the beginning. Regardless, I don't like it. Too many shows and their impacts have been ruined because of this stupidity.

Another complaint, although this is just me nitpicking, is that one of the main characters in the first half of the show is abruptly dropped, never to be seen again in the latter part. He was a prominent character, and no reference was made of him in the second half. That just stuck out like a sore thumb for me.

BOTTOMLINE:
After a bit of world-building, the show gets going, and is relentless in its bleakness and just the overall repulsive human behavior. As mentioned, the beautiful end is the only moment you get some respite from all the doom and gloom. If you can digest all of this, then this show should be an unforgettable experience for you, just as it was for me.

Basis or no Basis.
See, i felt it's gripping, it will keep you invested, you will be on your toes the entire time because it's very unpredictable, But it's Completely unsatisfactory.
Like you will watch the whole thing and still won't understand shit.
It basically felt like a ground work for season 2 where we will get to know what the heck is happening.
The message that it is trying to send is pretty good and the execution is top notch but totally personal opinion.. i just felt empty after watching it.
People who judge the story with more than just script will love it cause everything else was mindblowing.

The Effects of Juvenile Delinquency And the Role Society Plays
From its opener, this drama came out swinging, and it didn't stop to the end. I had high expectations, and I am glad it didn't disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed this drama, everything from the overwhelming storytelling and cases to the cinematography, directing, and especially the acting of the leads and the supporting cast. Both Kim Hye Soo and Kim Mu Yeol were outstanding, and complimentary of each other. Her strong stance on punishment and his clear belief in nurturing and reform completed each other in many ways. It was almost like when she ran cold, he warmed her up, and when he threatened to go cold, she found a way to warm him up. Their personal traumas helped me understand their stance and shaped the story.

What I like most about this drama is how daringly it tackled the complex and staggering psychological and social circumstances surrounding juvenile delinquency, the juvenile court system, and the effects it has on the victims, the juvenile delinquents themselves, their families, and even society as a whole. The thought that the stories it tells maybe someone's real life reality is heartbreakingly crushing. Right after I watching Juvenile Justice I read a review that described the script as ""having a tendency to devolve into preachy monologues, which did a disservice to the drama"". I was utterly surprised, because I thought those preachy parts were precisely what made the drama so impactful, given the heavy subject matter.

As much as I enjoyed the drama, some episodes were hard to watch, almost cruelly so, especially how desensitized society has become to the pain and injustice of others. The drama was thought provoking. It made me question myself and how I would react to the many uncomfortable situations. I have a newfound respect and admiration for juvenile delinquent judges, counselors, social workers, and everybody who works with and around children. I don't think I could do it. The whole time I watched the drama, I kept thinking that when parents cover up for their children's wrongdoings, are they doing it for their children or for their own sake? I also couldn't stop thinking how children as young as nine could be so disconnected from their community and society that they could commit such atrocities; where and how does it go wrong, be it with the children, the parents or society. A lot to ponder.

I am not a parent, but I know it isn't easy. As an aunt actively involved in raising my nieces and nephews, I know how important it is for children to know that they are loved unconditionally, particularly when they make mistakes because everybody make mistakes. But they also need to those mistakes have consequences, especially when they cause harm to others. Parents sternly disciplining their children is the tough love they need. It's far more helpful in the long run than covering up those mistakes, no matter how bad. And this is especially important in a country like South Korea, where society plays a big role in shaping its citizens, that it becomes part of the solution, not a contributing factor. I wonder if I sound preachy, hmmmm!

Juvenile delinquency isn't just a legal issue that can be taken care of by law, but a major social problem that requires urgent attention. I pray this drama in its ten episodes succeeds in casting the needed attention, and more importantly, to relay the message that punishment shouldn't only be about imprisonment, but also development and reform. As Shim Eun Seok says in the drama, it takes a village to raise a child. It's why we still need the ""village"" strengthening support mentality for our children today. Is Juvenile Justice a perfect drama; perhaps not, but it does a darn good job expressing how the inadequacy of the criminal and judicial justice system, the breakdown of the family unit, particularly parental guidance, and resulting trauma as well as societal neglect exacerbate serious youth crimes. Yes, reforming juveniles is paramount, but their victims matter too and shouldn't be marginalized in the process.

Hate to say this but Netflix doesn't disappoint
""I detest young offenders"" - I somehow agree with it LOL. Although everyone deserves second chances but sometimes it just shows that you shouldn't be lenient with all minors just because they are minors, they will not learn their lessons and their mistakes and grow up to be monsters if you continue to let them go and let them think that ""oh, so I can commit this crime and I won't get caught at all"" and they will commit more and more crimes and each time it gets worse. Honestly got quite pissed when I saw the kids laughing away after killing people. Coming again with another well written series by Netflix. What I'm seeing now is that the show is criminally underrated for now, not many viewers are watching this, not sure whether more people will start watching this after a few days as this was just released few hours ago. But this show was really nice, it shows and depicts the many different social issues surrounding young offenders. Though it's not the first time a drama has done this but this one was quite well written. It was really entertaining and engaging so I binged it in one whole sitting. :) Kim Hye Soo done a great job as a Judge, likewise in Hyena as a lawyer. She really suits playing characters relating to law haha. GOOD SERIES OK TRUST ME!! Very good law drama and unique theme of young offenders, give it a try.

Edit: It is now sitting at #1 spot for many countries on Netflix.

The Bad Kids
Juvenile Justice is a character-driven legal thriller revolving around Shim Eun Seok and her appointment as a judge of the Juvenile Criminal Settlement Division of the Yeonhwa District Court. Her profound hatred of juvenile delinquents provides the backdrop of her approach to dispensing justice upon the minors charged in the court of law as she presides over a variety of deeply complicated and convoluted cases.

The drama is rated R-18 in South Korea due to references to drugs, suicide, physical and sexual violence. Elements of social commentary are present that explore the judiciary statutes, investigative authority, politics and education system. The complexities of the human drama is provided by the respective backstories of the juvenile offenders in terms of their difficult family backgrounds and dynamics, as well as the suffering endured by the victims and their own families.

The screenplay is written by Kim Min Seok for what is his first drama project. Although credited as an original screenplay, it purportedly draws parallels to several high profile cases that have occurred recently in South Korea; the 2017 kidnapping-murder case of an elementary school student in Incheon, the 2018 Sookmyung Girls' High School test paper leak in Gangnam, the 2020 Daejeon middle school student rental car theft accident, and the 2018-2019 Incheon Metropolitan City sexual assaults.

Directed by Hong Jong Chan with Kim Tae Sung (Happiness, Snowdrop, Inspector Koo) serving as composer. Principal photography took place in May 2021 primarily at Jeonju District Court located in Jeollabuk-do, which serves as the Yeonhwa District Court. Other filming locations include Dongseong-ro Spark in Daegu, Dongseong-ro Spark and Misa High School in Gyeonggi-do, and Seoul Women’s University.

What I Liked

There are three main aspects that have impressed me immensely.

Firstly, high praise goes to the overall production values, specifically the mood-inducing cinematography that establishes the noir vibe to the entire visual tone of the production. This fits perfectly to a narrative that delves extensively into the dark subject matter of violent crimes, together with the slow burn and gritty storytelling approach. In fact, a huge portion of the drama takes place at night where one of the more memorable moments included snowfall in its scenes. I’ve also enjoyed the framing of Shim Eun Seok’s contemplative moments in her office through low-key lighting that accentuates the evocative atmospherics throughout the story. There’s no question that a lot of money went into this production and it is apparent for all to see.

Secondly, the exceptional acting in this drama. Particularly Kim Hye Soo’s portrayal of the lead character, Shim Eun Seok. This is quite possibly her strongest performance in recent memory which I believe surpasses her role of Jung Geum Ja in Hyena and perhaps aided tremendously by the characterization that feels very much designed with her in mind. This is the epitome of intensely hard-boiled and ultra bad-assery without so much as breaking a sweat. The emotive expressiveness of her unflinching piercing gaze that punches right through any suit of armour is as intimidating as it is effective.

Other members of the cast that impressed me would include Lee Sung Min as Kang Won Joong, the Chief Judge of the Juvenile Criminal Settlement Division of the Yeonhwa District Court. Initially giving the appearance of the typical annoyingly loud and abrasive boss, he gradually settles into this extremely layered and grey character who is torn between his personal ambitions and protecting his family.

I also have to mention Lee Yeon. My first time seeing this 27-year old lady in what is truly an incredibly remarkable yet unsettling depiction of an extremely unhinged teenage boy! It’s the kind of performance that leaves an indelible imprint in your psyche for years to come. The drama also features a number of familiar faces in the supporting roles including Lee Jung Eun as Chief Judge Na Geun Hee, and Kim Mu Yeol (currently in Grid) as Division Judge Cha Tae Joo. Yeom Hye Ran (The Uncanny Counter), Yoo Jae Myung (Hometown) and Kim Joo Heon provide noteworthy guest appearances.

Thirdly, I was captivated by the intrigue of certain cases. Going into this drama I was anticipating a more “common” or “garden-variety” type of crime committed. After all, how much trouble could kids really get into, I thought to myself. Well, I was proven very wrong because some of the crimes manifested belong to the psychologically disturbing and immensely macabre category. The one that caught my attention from the get-go has to be the first case while the second case provided a fascinating insight into juvenile rehabilitation facilities.

What I Didn’t Like

My biggest issue is with the screenplay. I think Kim Min Seok was trying to weave too many themes and sub-plots into a 10-episode production, most of which finally play out in the final 2 episodes. I can’t say for sure if this drama is merely providing social commentary or perhaps the screenwriter is attempting to convey a statement or message that raises public awareness. Or it could simply be heavily dramatized fiction that’s intended to wow (or shock) viewers.

Whatever the case may be, the end product becomes something of a contradiction for me. It’s not ok for other people to abuse their authority but when it comes to the protagonist, it’s perfectly fine. It’s not a big deal for other cases to reach a dissatisfying conclusion but when it involves the lead’s tragic backstory, then justice must be fully administered at all costs. Judiciary bosses with years of experience are a bunch of noobs in comparison with the junior judge for they do not comprehend the spirit of justice, which justifies acts of insubordination. Finally, that sense of self-righteousness and moral high horse that comes complete with the speech gets repeated several times, only to be refuted by hypocrisy when convenient.

My interest in the second half kind of waned because the focus was lost amidst the tonal shift of the narrative, firstly to the politics of education and by-election campaigning, then finally to Shim Eun Seok’s complex backstory. This aspect wasn’t properly fleshed out but instead given the brief flashback sequence, alongside elements that eventually become inconsequential in the form of the ex-husband and mother-in-law who contributed nothing of significance apart from melodramatic angst.

Final Thoughts

The biggest positive for me is Kim Hye Soo’s performance which I hope would garner her at least a nomination for this year’s Baeksang. Juvenile Justice ended up being a mixed bag for me but all things considered, I would recommend this drama predominantly for the well executed technical aspects rather than the plot trajectory and didactic social critique.

It takes a village to raise a child…
A tale of a broken system and juvenile crime.

Who is at fault when a child commits a crime? Juvenile Justice tries to present the complexity of the issue, and for the most part, it succeeds (as much as a fictional drama can). It presents kids as both the victims and perpetrators, rightfully pointing out the roles are not mutually exclusive. It shows the effects of neglect, bad or lack of role models, abuse.

A small group of people trying to do their best in the system that does not support their efforts and does not protect the people it was created to protect. While showing the gruesome reality, it sticks to a more positive, but still realistic approach. Often justice is served, but only in the frame of the current juvenile court system, that for many is not harsh enough.

From the first, till the last episode the drama does not fail to keep the tension high, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The cases are not one dimensional, showing different sides and perspectives, at times, leaving me with only one conclusion: everyone failed - the parents, the teachers, the judges, the kids themselves.

The plot and presentation wise, the only thing that it lacks in my eyes is the context some of the kids were in. What pushed them to become what they are? What could be the possible motives for their actions? What behavior was a norm in their house? These are the questions I hoped to get a more elaborated answer for than a short note “abused by step-father” in the case file.

Moving back to the positive aspects: I appreciate how we do not get an outstanding character development from any of the main cast. They all made mistakes, they all got carried away by their emotions and fears. That said, how they handled Na Geun Hee’s character by the end of the show left me with a few things to desire. Did not buy that arc, which might have been the result of the lack of the screen time.

Acting wise - no complaints. For a show full of the younger cast, all kids and teens did an amazing job with presenting their characters. Especially impressed by Lee Yeon. To present a believable acting of a teenage boy, when she is a 27 years old woman, must have been quite a challenge.

As for the production, even the opening scene made me love the visuals of the drama. The dark and cold tones used throughout the show intensified the gloomy atmosphere surrounding tacked topics.

Trigger warning - the drama presents quite a number of scenes showing child abuse. They are not short, they are not vague.

Overall, as long as you can handle child abuse and exploitations of children, this is a drama most people should watch. Understanding that kids are capable of doing evil acts is a first step to figure out how to prevent tragedies from happening. Turning a blind eye and giving excuses is not a solution, as it gives only one message: no matter how drastic measures you will take, no one will care. Supporting them through their struggles while punishing for the wrong actions should become a standard.

""I detest young offenders""
""Offender, Criminal, Killer"" what comes to your mind when you hear these words?

Maybe, a maniac, a psycho or a monster and disgusting adult human being? But what about a child? In most of the drama/movies we see adults committing crimes, but young offenders exist too.

And this is what ""Juvenile Justice"" wants to remind us, that criminals can be anyone, even a little child. ""Juvenile Justice"" deals with a very interesting, yet very difficult and provoking theme. Fortunately, though, the drama succeeded in managing its heavy theme and ended up a very eye-opening drama for me.

As ""Juvenile Justice"" it's a law drama which deals with many inhuman crimes (and it's also a Netflix original drama), it's an R-rated drama, which contains a lot of violence, gore scenes but mainly, it contains a lot of scenes that may upset psychologically some viewers. In addition, the drama doesn't contain any funny moments, or comic reliefs and its pace it's slow too. Thus, the drama is indeed a heavy and difficult watch, it will punch you in the stomach without any pity for 10 hours straight. Therefore, be very careful when you make your decision to watch it.

The story

The story revolves around the Juvenile Judge Shim Eun Seok. Through her eyes we are able to see how Juvenile Justice works on many different cases and affects the involved ones and that's the biggest advantage of the drama.It approaches its topic from many different aspects and shows the two sides of the coin of crime but also the law system.

It has to be mentioned though, that the number of different cases may have a negative effect on some viewers because they won't like all the cases the same as the cases aren't on the same level and some are more interesting than others. Despite this fact, I believed that all the cases offer something valuable to the story and also, that the story's coherence is great as every event of the story is very well connected with the other so the overall story is very balanced.

The story starts with a shocking abominable and macabre case which gives a strong and promising start. The middle cases are milder but the story doesn't lose its interest neither becomes tedious and repetitive. The story throughout its whole run, asks moral questions and tries to make the viewers think of various different situations and dilemmas. The final case, the story’s finale, gives a decent and powerful closure. The story indeed leaves the best for the end as from all the cases, the last one is the most suitable for closure . Thus, the story manages to end without the feeling of being rushed or unfinished. To my surprise, Netflix made a (maybe) one season kdrama that is complete and I'm very glad and relieved about this.

There's a high possibility that the first case and some others are inspired and lightly based on real cases which have happened in Korea and I personally really appreciate it. It's very interesting to see how writers use real events to deliver their messages and basically, to see the impact these events had on them. In addition, the story feels more down to earth and more realistic. Korean dramas and movies have their way of making excellent and entertaining stories based on real events. Fortunately, ""Juvenile Justice"" is one of these stories. More details about the cases in the spoiler comment on this review (because they are, of course, spoilers).

The characters & acting

Almost all the characters of the drama have depth and their personalities are very well built. Their actions are always composed of their life experiences, scars, insecurities and the drama explored with success the reasons behind their behavior. None of the characters is perfect, everyone made mistakes and some learnt through them, some not. It’s pretty amazing how the drama made so many well written characters and developed their personalities through the story, this is very rare to see.

And of course, the actors did an amazing job portraying these complex characters. I couldn't be more satisfied with their performances. Their feelings were on point and the characters really came to life and took shape. There was also great chemistry between the actors that made the characters more bound and the drama complete and more impactful.

The production

Production is the last ingredient of a drama. It's the finishing touch that will make the drama more appealing. The ""Juvenile Justice"" 's production, as far as the directing is concerned, isn't one of Netflix's top-notch and artistic ones, but still, it's great and gives the drama the right tone and atmosphere, making the drama very decent and beautiful. The music is wonderful, full of emotions. It gives the right tone in every scene and it never feels off. The music is the cherry on top of the drama, giving you the last push to fall in love with it.

Overall

""Juvenile Justice"" is a very tough watch and not an easy ride. Still, the things this drama will make you feel and think are countless. If you believe you can bear its cruelty, then ""Juvenile Justice"" really deserves a try because from the story, to acting, to production, this drama has the whole package. For me, ""Juvenile Justice"" is the first Netflix original kdrama I loved after ""D.P. "" and I'm glad I watched it.

~~~Epilogue~~~

""I detest young offenders"". Young people are the future of humanity, humanity’s hope. When they behave like adults and commit crimes, the world loses its hope and everything becomes darker. Why do young people commit crimes? How can someone so young do such a macabre thing? Can we teach them what is good and what is wrong? Can we set them back to the right path? In the end, is it their fault or ours?

""I detest young offenders"" because they are showing me how cruel the world is and how we fail to protect them.

Kim Hye-soo really never disappoints
Kim Hye-soo really never disappoints. Outstanding performance from Lee Jung Eun and Kim Hye Soo. All the ten episodes of Juvenile Justice will leave a strong impression, there is so much more to the justice that is being served. There is one thing that literally amazes me, that is Shim Eun Seok (Kim Hye Soo) character, her hatred and despise to the young kids who commit a crime, her anger, and her facial expressions every time a kid stands in the trial, felt so real.

The ending was so beautiful. I hope there is a season 2.

Everyone deserve a second chance?
This drama came from my same list that had Amanza, melancholia, move to heaven and Doctor John, all of them set in dramas that I am not used to seeing and all of them were my favorites.

It is very slow, I even watched it at 1.5x speed because if I don't I would never end, but that was not a problem for me.

It has graphic scenes of violence and they are always talking about the heavier cases like prostitution and rape, which I found very interesting, since Korea itself has a lot of these cases but they are usually very ""covered up"".

Does everyone deserve a second chance? I think this is the main point of the dorama, here, we see two sides, the FM even mentions that they could minor offenders and gives maximum penalty whenever possible, after all, they committed a crime, being a minor or not. On the other side, we see ML who understands that they are young offenders but that some need to have the chance to possess a second chance. I thought it was very well written that in some moments, which one of the two is right weighed heavily on the episode, but in the end we came to the same conclusion:

It is not up to us who saw it to judge who deserves a second chance or not and yes, to the judges based on evidence.

Overall, it was a very different drama from what I watch and always in the second episode of all the stories I was extremely heartbroken because I realized that the story doesn't end after the trial, after all, the victims and the families will always suffer about what the minor offender did.

""No one's living a fairy-tale life in this world""
A drama that tells really good stories about all the broken souls of adolescent and the unleash of atrocity at young age. Humans could be born that way in their nature, or it could be induced by various societal issues, though the latter part of the drama highlighted more on the selfishness of irresponsible adults. The drama also poses serious questions on the judicial system and the effectiveness of the law and order in its juvenile act. This is why the drama works brilliantly as it reflects a highly detailed sad and torn reality beyond fixing.

An Interrogative Insight Into Juvenile Crime, Though Often Delving Into Melodrama...

American philosopher John Rawls famously claimed that justice was the 'first virtue of social institutions'. However in societies where corruption has often taken root and the liberty of ''justice as fairness'' is not always possible, then how can ''justice'' be achieved?; This is ultimately the root question of ' Juvenile Justice'.

Set in the heart of the justice system, the ten-episode series focuses upon the court proceedings at a court for juvenile delinquency. Sim Eun Seok ( Kim Hye-Soo- ‘ Coin Locker Girl’, ‘ Signal’ and ‘ Hyena’) is an elite juvenile judge infamously nicknamed '' Judge Max"" in Yeonwha’s juvenile courtroom. Despising young criminal delinquents, Eun Seok's draconian methods have earned her widespread respect and criticism by the families of the prosecuted and colleagues alike.

However Eun Seok comes across her polar opposite and foil Cha Tae Soo (Kim Mu-Yeol- ‘ All Bark, No Bite’, ‘ Bad Guys: City Of Evil’ and ‘ Grid’). Tae Soo principles justice as taking a ""benevolent and fair"" stance towards the accused and criminal cases. As the drama progresses, viewers are offered certain insights into contrasting moral and ethical stances on crime and punishment.( In particular presented through the contrasting beliefs of the main leads.)

Kim Min Sook is likely unfamiliar to a lot of viewers picking up 'Juvenile Justice'. For those unfamiliar with the lesser-known screenwriter, Min Sook's previous work has included titles such as horror-flick ‘ Hansel and Gretel’ (2007) and slice-of-life movie ‘ Notebook From My Mother’ (2015). Similar to the screenwriter's previous projects, 'Juvenile Justice' attempted to strike a balance between sentimental melodrama and unflinching tension with differing results.

It is important to point out that 'Juvenile Justice' did offer an intriguing insight into conflicting morality and ethical values. In particular, Eun Seok stance upon justice verged at times upon what one could define as deontological ethics ( actions are either "" bad or good"" due to the rules or the laws in place by an authoritative system rather than the emotional subjectivity of each crime), while Cha Tae Soo valued the stance of consequentialism. ( The consequence or outcome of one's conduct are the complete basis for outcome and morality.)

However while the series did offer certain opportunities for viewers to understand this complex setup and the differing approaches taken by both characters towards criminal cases, this is admittedly where we could often hit a rut with the criminal cases of 'Juvenile Justice'; the sourced morality would come from a particular bias towards Eun-Seok.

While admittedly this isn't out of the question for a series and does not always provide that the main leads' personal stances are right, it did become notable as the storyline progressed that there was a somewhat preachy approach by screenwriter Kim Min Sook towards "" all crimes being wrong"" without always acknowledging when Eun Seok was in the wrong.

Ten episodes may not seem as though it is a long period of time for character-growth to occur or be explored. Of course as the series does progress into the final stages of the narrative, viewers do become aware of Eun Seok's past as well as her arguably corrupt stance upon deontological ethics ( from personal and subjective circumstances). However, it is undeniable that while we do see Eun Seok being challenged by her views and perspectives, particularly through her moral opposite, Cha Tae Soo.

Yet rather than sometimes offering leeway for Eun Seok to reflect more upon her views or reevaluate certain stances that she has adapted ( the classic example being outside the courtroom when she threatened to run over the mother of a prosecuted assailant after she pleaded to take mercy on her child), Tae-Soo would often be labelled as overly “ambitious and naive” by Eun-Seok rather than as an equal. Kim Min Sook seemed to place heavy emphasis on Eun Seok's ideologies, tacitly endorsing them even though they may not be entirely captious is quite another.

Of course there is also the debate surrounding genre pitfalls in a ""crime and punishment"" drama. This was exemplified by Chief Judge Kang (Lee Sung-min)'s viewpoint that cases should be downplayed and not subject to public knowledge. Due to Eun-Seok's involvement as an infamous judge and the media attention towards difficulties faced for the juvenile court irrespective of their crimes. Effectively as a consequence for Eun-Seok having to rely on investigating a case through external sources, Chief Kang would scorn the female lead for her actions. ( Although interestingly not due to the fact that Eun Seok had no legal ground or right to play detective. Interestingly this was not raised by the series, instead often casting Eun Seok through her reliant usage of deductive reasoning.)

Of course it is wrong to entirely fault the series per say. Kim Hye Soo is admittedly brilliant as main female lead Eun-Seok. For those familiar with Hye Soo’s previous projects, ‘ Juvenile Justice’ is admittedly a somewhat typecasted role for the actress, but similar to her previous projects, Hye Soo offered a cool, complex and charismatic charm that instantly drew viewers to her onscreen persona. Costarring alongside Hye Soo was Kim Mu Yeol. Whilst the actor is perhaps less familiar to some viewers , Mu Yeol delivered an equally solid performance as main male lead Cha Tae Soo; a judge with a heart of gold. In addition to his performance, Mu Yeol possessed good onscreen and platonic chemistry with his costar Hye Soo; helping to add a touch of heartfelt drive towards their onscreen characters’ partnership.

The supporting cast were admittedly decent. Whilst some line deliverances could feel somewhat inconsistent at times, these performances were still watchable. (One of the most outstanding performances in the series came through Reyn Doi's performance as schizophrenic teen Baek Seong-u.)

Nevertheless the execution of ‘ Juvenile Justice’ was admittedly limited from the outset due to its duration of ten episodes. Surprisingly the narrative does make an impressive effort by enforcing a lot of complex topics such as murder, mental illness, domestic abuse and corruption appearing in the series. On the other hand a lot of those “ prominent” themes were only implicated upon a surface-level in the plot. There is an intriguing interplay of crime and procedure within 'Juvenile Justice' but often this could fall victim to a repetitively tiresome setup in later episodes. This would typically consist of a violent or lurid crime occurring, Eun-Seok playing Sherlock Holmes after facing abject scorn by Chief Judge Kang, Eun-Seok would come across the case and face a conflicting opinion from either Kang or Tae Soo, before passing her own judgement, often regardless of the circumstance or individual, in order to '' serve justice''. This wasn't particularly a bad approach per say and did offer some brilliant moments for Kim Hye-Su to show off her talents, but it could often highlight a grating tone when it came to the moralistic messages of ' Juvenile Justice'.

Under the directing reigns of Hong Jong Chan ( ‘ Live Up To Your Name’, ‘ Life’ and ‘ Her Private Life’), ‘ Juvenile Justice’ offered an odd accumulation of slick and professional editing and camera shots, as well as somewhat insipid focuses and palettes. The OST is sparsely used in the series; dramatically placed in order to intensify tense or sentimental scenes , but lacking an impactful coup de grâce during tense moments also.

‘ Juvenile Justice’ attempted to offer viewers with a tense and twist-filled procedural drama. The series offered opportunities for viewers to seek differing moralistic and philosophical opinions and a dynamic performance by main actress Kim Hye Soo. On the other hand despite the gritty and complex edge added to certain viewpoints within ' Juvenile Justice' , the execution of plot could admittedly fall victim to genre pitfalls and restricted narrative perspectives. Overall while 'Juvenile Justice' offered a strong first-half, the second-half admittedly felt weakened by a lack of closure.

A show where judges masquerade as police officers
I am not exactly sure what genre this drama is supposed to be. Legal? Police procedural? Thriller? And in all honesty, I don't think the showrunners know either. This drama tries to be all of the above yet succeeds at none. The ""police procedural"" parts of the show are horribly unrealistic and do nothing but to detract from the main theme of the drama. ""Judges are not supposed to get involved in prosecution or investigation!!!!"" are words that have been yelled by 2 senior presiding judges yet main character (Sim Eun Seok) still throws caution to the wind and go on with her own investigations. Despite this, the evidence she obtained through her illicit investigations are still admissible in court! Like what??? I'm not a lawyer, but I sure as hell don't think JUDGES would get their hands dirty or even have the TIME to conduct investigations themselves. And I mean if the judges are gonna do the investigations, why do we even need the damn police? This is too ridiculous. But wait, the icing on the cake is in the last episode. In the last episode, she waltzes right into a baddie's hideout which for some reason, isn't locked and doesn't even have a DOOR to prevent entry. Surprisingly (or not) she gets ambushed and only escapes by the skin of her teeth. Injured and seriously bleeding, she gets into a taxi and makes her way speedily to guess where? HER FKIN OFFICE. I literally laughed out loud. Like ok, the show has consistently portrayed her as an obsessive workaholic (more on her character later) but this is just too far beyond the realm of realism. Not to mention all the evidence in the baddie's hideout was also nicely displayed for the authorities to collect. Just absurd. Parts of the dialogue also sounded like they were right out of a PSA on the social system of Korea, with characters literally rambling on the differences between a social care home and a facility. I get that viewers need some context on Korea's social welfare system but what?! NOBODY speaks like that in real life, unless they are narrating for a documentary. ""Show, not tell"" is a really apt saying that this show should have heeded.

Unrealistic parts aside, I also felt that this show had a lot of unrealized potential. There was commentary on social issues like income inequality, nepotism, lack of funding/resources for social welfare programmes etc but they were all skin deep and didn't do much to explore the issues further. For example, many cases centered on kids from disadvantaged backgrounds committing crimes. Judge Sim comes into court, makes a few holier than thou comments like how circumstances push the kids to commit crimes but at the end of the day, the kids make the decision to commit crimes themselves. The end. Next case. They could have done more with the material by portraying kids from bad backgrounds committing crimes VS kids from good backgrounds committing crimes (nature vs nurture) OR even gone deeper into Judge Cha's story of being a reformed teenaged delinquent but oh well.

This brings me to the next point of the characters. Judge Sim is extremely unlikeable to begin with, and even when her tragic backstory is revealed (they always have tragic backstories don't they?) she is still unsympathetic. She is extremely self-righteous, curt, cold and seemingly devoid of empathy whatsoever except towards the victims. Her stunning lack of empathy was on full display when she confronted her boss about his alleged corruption in the freaking HOSPITAL where his son was warded after an attempted suicide. Yes, as judges, one has to be upright and honest but dude?? Time and place man. Her self-righteousness also spills over to how she treats the defendants and even her colleague Judge Cha who is forced to capitulate to her every demand. Judge Cha is the typical ""nice guy"" who believes in treating kids with respect and believing in them, but Judge Sim constantly steamrolls his every opinion. In their conversations, Judge Sim goes on long tirades about how she detests juvenile delinquents and do not believe they would be rehabilitated, that they need to feel the full force of the law... leaving poor Judge Cha quaking and unable to resist as she is his senior. The show validates this strangely, going out of their way to portray the juvenile delinquents as unrepentant, lying scums of the earth who should be locked up for good since they'll just end up as adult criminals anyway. Makes me wonder if the writer had a grudge against juvenile delinquents or something.

Overall, this show is fairly entertaining but don't go in expecting to be educated on Korea's juvenile court system. The acting is decent, with the teenaged actors stealing the spotlight. Kim Hye Soo was decent as Judge Sim, though she wasn't able to show off her range as her character was mostly cold and reserved. Watch only if you can ignore the unrealistic parts and if you do not mind a show with an unlikeable main character.

In the world of repetitive korean law dramas, this was unique, heartbreaking, devastating and sickening
The villains were kids and the victims were kids, how more heartbreaking can it get?

The cases tbh I couldn't look at them and if I did I had to keep repeating ""it's just acting"" cuz my heart can't take that much evilness

The fl was a queen. Eventhough I didn't like her roboticness or the need to add a traumatic past to explain why she's so reserved and cold was unnecessary
But I did love her soft side

The ml was a nice cutie and the silver lining to this bleak world

The 2ml was also a mix of ambition, greed and yet hope
They tried to make 2fl judge the villain just to show she like any other human makes non perfect decisions


And that the point. Not all verdicts were justified. Not all victims were saved. Not all villains were captured. Law is ""in the eye of the beholder"" cuz there's no real justice
No one knows the whole truth. No one can ever find justice. They can only do their bests. Find evidence. Listen to the hidden stories. And that's a devastating job tbh
Especially with kids. Cuz the real justice would be to reform them. Not all criminals are ""born that way"" but you can't put an end to it even when you know the problem..



I didn't like the cheating crime.. it's literally just a test, people cheat, people steal answers, people buy grades.
I personally preferred my own results, once upon a time a I actually went to an exam not knowing there was one so I hadn't even studied that subject in weeks and someone offered to help but I shrugged it off and got 7/10 on my own xD
Another time the exam supervisor saw me finish while another kid was suffering and she came to my paper and helped the other kid. Once I tried to help a friend but it was a lost cause so afterwards I'd pretend I didn't study and sit away from people I knew..
This got out of hand but basically cheating is not the end of life. Stealing, murders, rape, kidnapping, even bribery are worse than school cheating...


In the last ep tho I didn't like how they had to make everything extremely connected and I wished for the verdict of that crime cuz it either needs life sentence or execution.... TT_TT


I loved the ost but I'll never rewatch this

A mother loosing her child is more painful than a internal stomach ache
I wanted to rate it higher for its unique plot focus but wasn't enough for anything higher.

Juvenile Justice was a social commentary about the broken legal system of South Korea, its clear through the cases and dialogues, but I felt like at times it was trying to push the narrative too much, ending up with unnatural dialogues that wouldn't even happen in a normal conversation.

In a brighter note, I love how is it showing the reality as it is and doesn't push and tell us to believe who and what are the right actions, this character or occurrance might be wrong, but we realise that this it was actually happens, this the law that we have right now.

Furthermore I love how cases are not sugar-coated and isn't all butterfly and rainbows at the end, there's a quote in the show that goes es ""the law doesn't protect all victims"" our system is based on evidences, without it, justice would also not be found. Also this builds up good unpredictability while showing reality, good job writers!

Kim Hye Soo was the light of the show, such a delight to watch, her eyes speak volumes. Other main casts where also great, can't say the same about exaggerated acting of almost a lot of the supporting cast.

Quite the filler episodes and law drama clichés, felt like it took so long, and that isn't good for a 10 ep drama, resulting in my low story rating.

I wanted to say it was a masterpiece but i just can't, quite the things that cannot be overlooked, still was a great watch and would recommend it to fans of the genre.

Interesting legal drama
There are times I would veer away from my typical drama list and watch something serious. For me, Juvenile Justice didn't disappoint.

With just 10 episodes, the drama was able to show several examples of delinquency among youngsters. It is a difficult thing, handling juvenile cases. It could make or break a minor's future. I liked how the writer was able to spin different cases to highlight how the judges' decision are made.

The FL's facial expression were kind of bland but as the drama progressed, you will get an insight on how she came to be the aloof, aggressive judge...

Personally, I would not mind another season of this legal drama

Juvenile Court room drama
Binge all 10 episodes of this court drama went from 0 to 100 in its 1st episode and hasn't stop ?

Kim Hye Soo character Judge Shim does not hold back during her ruling in juvenile court even going out on her own to investigate to the chagrin and some level of respect from her Presiding Judge.
We see cases unfold under the ruling of Juvenile Law in need of restructing....

Each episode hits you in the feels, you'll see cases on Premeditated murder, domestic violence, underage prostitution, school cheating scandal and juvenile defense victim blaming.
This series is heavy, HEAVY - Brace yourselves with this one.

6 gripping juvenile cases in just 10 hours that both entertain and enrich mind and soul
""I have nothing but hatred for young offenders""
""This is just the new grim reality of juvenile crime""
With such opening lines, Juvenile Justice seems a promising drama exploring the mentality and behaviours of young offenders and how to manage them to uphold justice for the victims in today's society, and this drama did not disappoint.

Juvenile Justice tells 6 gripping juvenile cases in just 10 hours, of kids committing crimes on kids, throwing shades at the realities and inadequacies of the juvenile act and delicate balance to punish-educate vs protect young offenders, peer pressure, parental responsibilities for their children’s behaviours, domestic violence, rat race in the educational system etc.

Throw in the solid no-nonsense Kim Hye Soo, as the Judge of the Juvenile Court who has nothing but hatred for young offenders, and viewers are in for a very compelling watch that not just entertains but enriches the souls and minds. Some standout quotes for me:

“Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is after. What happens after determines who you’ll become.”
“There’s a saying - don’t steal a candle to read a Bible. It means if the ways are corrupt, the purpose is as well.”

And if only Judge Kang can think and care for his son just like Prof Park #DesignatedSurvivor60Days..

A little heavy on the melo, but an original take on juvenile justice
It is a common fault for writers to try too hard. To think that the more emotion they put into the writing, the more the viewer will feel it. Paradoxically, it is the opposite.

The art of moving a viewer is to leave enough space for a reaction to arise within them through their own volition. The more the viewer is told how to think and feel, the less they actually will think and feel. This is not just because we all hate being told what to do, but because it is coming overwhelmingly from the outside, pushing against us and closing down the available space for our own response. We need only enough to peak our empathy, then we will naturally do the rest. And because it is not the emotion of the actor but our own emotional response arising from our own understanding, we will feel it twice as much. Knowing where the trigger point is and just how much is enough for any particular audience,is the thing that separates a brilliant director from an average one.

Here, the director (Hong Jong Chan) did the writer (Kim Min Sook) no favours in overplaying the melodrama. Trauma does not automatically lead to excessive and noisy crying. It can lead to anger, denial, confusion and often numbness and silence. This range of responses can also be utilised by a good director to emphasise the horror of a situation but they were not featured in this drama. By the time we reached episode 9, character after character was either crying or wailing in a string of consecutive scenes that became less and less effective as they rolled by. The result was to distance me rather than draw me in. Which is a pity because this was a powerful drama and had the potential to be more so.

Music also plays an important part in evoking emotion, and here the swelling orchestral music was way too heavy. There was far too much of it, it was far too loud and far too emotive. I found it oppressive.

Having said all that, there was much to appreciate in this production. The characters of the two leads are interesting and well fleshed out. Kim Hye Soo and Kim Mu Yeon gave convincing performances. They represented opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their attitudes and judgements. It was a wise choice not to have them as adversaries but genuine colleagues who maintained respectful regard for each other. This gave an opportunity for a more rounded viewpoint of the case scenarios, and highlighted the ambivalence that is always present. It meant that the focus remained on the ethics and morals of the action and was not diverted by inter-personal conflict. As a result, there was plenty for the viewer to reflect on.

The treatment of the young people also aimed at more realism than is common in k-dramas, especially in terms of their language, behaviour and attitudes. At times there was confronting material to watch but it was never gratuitous.

This was a deliberately victim-centred presentation and constantly emphasised the impact of anti-social and violent behaviour. As most court and crime dramas are heavily focused on the perpetrators this was a refreshing take on things.

A lot of the dialogue was educational in tone. Some of it out of character for the professional environment it took place in, but not so much that it was irritating. It was forgivable in the circumstances as the juvenile court is rarely depicted and little understood. As a piece of social commentary the show was very successful. As a drama, slightly less so but well worth watching.

Could've been great
I love law dramas. Law dramas with dark cases even better. Yet, this one couldn't really grasp me the way I was hoping.
There were a lot of horrible cases yes, but they tried to make us feel for the prosecuted and that's were it fell flat. Yes most of the kids wouldn't have committed the crimes they did if they weren't abandoned, abused or worse. When they don't feel remorse until after they get sentenced it's hard to feel for them. There were a few kids that I did feel for, like Seo Yu Ri, but I think that was because the crime she committed versus the things she was exposed to causing the crime was not as bad. But it wasn't really until the traffic accident case (ep7-8) were I really felt it and that is way to late for a show that is 10 episodes.

But I'll admit that it was an interesting take to watch a law show where all the crimes where committed by kids. It's interesting to see how horrible of crimes kids can commit and what leads them to make such decisions.

Now there wasn't really any bad acting but I was finding myself caring for most of the characters, even the leads. The female lead is a character that hates juvenile offenders and we never find out why until the last 2 episodes. There is maybe 1 or 2 hints before then that hints why but that is not enough, causing us to have a lead that is harsh towards everyone for seemingly no reason making it hard to like her. She does show some sort of kindness towards some of the kids which is in my opinion her only redeeming aspect of her character.

Now the male main lead doesn't really do much, he is just there and is kind to everything and everyone. He sees the best in all of the kids and maybe that's what we need in this show. If he also would've been harsh to all of the kids, it would probably be even harder to like this show. I do think that he was one of reasons though why I felt the Traffic accident case so much. I'm not saying I didn't like his character but rather that I don't think he did very much for being a main character.

My favourite character was probably Kang Won Joong, the character that would have been the villain in any other Kdrama. The first couple of episodes he even falls into the cliché path of his type of character that causes them to be the villain. The difference is that he deep down is a good person and even though he does some wrong choices later on, he in the end does the right thing and never truly becomes the so called villain.

Na Geun Hee that doesn't show up until the last 4 episodes is not a likable character at all. She does show some redemption in the end but still too late in the show and not enough time to be able to like her character.

The music is really good, not a whole lot of soundtrack with lyrics but that is not a bad thing, I'm just used to have Kdrama have like 5-7 song with lyrics in its soundtrack.

Now because I don't find most of the characters that likable I don't see myself rewatching this one in the future. I would probably still recommend this one for people that like law dramas though.

(+) amazing performance from the cast. para pemeran utama bisa dibilang ngga punya visual 'sebunga' aktris/aktor muda yang lagi digandrungi, tapi gimana yeee jam terbang gabakal bisa boong. emang beda pemain layar lebar mah.
(+) penulisan dan penceritaannya apik tenan! hubungan dari kasus satu hingga kasus terakhir mulus banget, pengungkapan backstory para main lead juga alus. detil sebab akibat dari segala sudut pandangnya lengkap. cakep dah pokoknya, rapih.
(-) dua episode pertama udah kece dan solid abis dengan pace yang satsetsatset, tapi sayang kesananya pace udah mulai kendor jadi berasanya agak lama gitu.
(-) sinematografinya oke, tonenya juga cakep, tapi ada satu yang cukup mengganggu karna sempet kenotis; cgi waktu lagi di mobilnya keliatan banget ???

Sometimes law can be so crucial not for the criminal but for the victims
The concept was really new to the kdrama world so people should watch this to know more about young offenders if you are going to watch this drama for thriller so i will not suggest you to watch this because more than a Thriller juvenile justice more focus on the concept of how a crime committed by young offenders can really Break the victims but law are there to protect the criminals not the victims the show was really good
The first case really broke me like how can a child murder another child this brutally and the other cases were also really emotional

Children need attention
This series has become one of my favorites, without any effort. I have always appreciated the detective, detective and investigative series, but above all series that take place in court. This series amazed me, the best I've seen.

The protagonist, Judge Shim (played by Kim Hye-soo) is simply perfect, she has a very interesting approach to dealing with ""young criminals"" and gives them the right lesson to grow at their best. The backstories of the various characters are treated very well and manage to make you empathize with each of them, from the protagonists to the tertiary characters.

I highly recommend this series, it is very interesting and is perfect for a marathon.

Juvenile Crime Drama with Adult Undertones
LIKES: The production was well done, no shaking camera moments to add drama because the acting was pretty good. Good zoom ins, camera angles, etc. Directing was also well done for the most part. There were some evening and dark area scenes, that had just the right amount of lighting, which made me applaud the director. Acting was well done for the most part and some of the supporting characters in each episode could outshine the main leads. The OST was suitable and not too loud or overbearing. Also while this crime/court drama did show some of the procedures, the good and bad of laws, it didn't get too bogged down by that. The first 5 episodes were really good, but the last 5 seemed a little less engaging. I wasn't as excited about the next episode, like I was in the first half of the series. For the most part I really liked how Kim Hye Soo delivered the character of Judge Shim Eun Seok.

DISLIKES: Some over-acting when doing emotional scenes, but no one too annoying or too often doing that. The second half of the episodes and conclusion, weren't as interesting as the strong beginning. I didn't feel like there was true character growth for any of the leads, but that might be due to the limited episodes and hence time. Also when trying to give the back story of Eun Seok, the drama of the ex-husband and his mother (parts) really weren't necessary.

Over all it was a decent story, interesting and I watched the whole thing in one sitting. I would recommend watching it and rewatching it, because it makes us think about our choices and actions in respects to how it can effect others. A solid 7/10.

High Mighty Judge
The drama was interesting to watch. But come on now what judge is going to do what the leading female does in a real-life scenario. She was so vocally about her boss removing himself from his son case, although he did cross the line, but she does the same not willing to remove herself. She had a high and mighty attitude about her, she right and no one else, opinions matter but the female judge. The system is shown how it truly is, it not as equal has people think. The law does always serve justice. The other lead male judge had a good heart, but he is a rare find in the court system. I like how even after she treat her boss the way she did, in the end he still tried to help her. Because she could have gone to him and not just forced her way into seeing him at the hospital.

Must watch Korean drama shedding light on the realities of issues in Korean law and society
This is one of the best Kdramas of 2022. If not THE BEST and will always be a top tier kdrama in my heart along with Mystic Pop-up Bar, Flower of Evil, and Move to Heaven. This Korean drama has amazing writing, pacing, and dialogue brought to life by top-tier acting and music we have a kdrama that sheds light on juvenile offenders, the leniency they receive, the ubiquitous repeated offenders, and other issues in law and society.

Characters

We have a cold hearted and emotionless judge, who despises juvenile offenders with the philosophy that the law is too lenient towards young offenders. Contrast to that we have her colleague, Cha Tae-Ju who is a warm hearted and has a philosophy of rehabilitation of offenders. Each with opposite ideals but the same goal: serving justice, but in their own way.

Examples of the many ways it sheds light on Korean society

My favourite episode of this kdrama were episode 3 and 4 where it focused Seo Yu-Ri's case. Seo Yu-Ri was part of a runaway gang and has a history of minor crimes including theft. But when we get to know more about her, the kdrama teaches and important lesson which is a re-occurring theme throughout the show as we see more juvenile offenders: you're a product of your environment.

This child dealt with horrific abuse from her father. But what I loved most about this story is the grandmother. She is good hearted but she discouraged her granddaughter to report the abused because ""he's her father"", how she tried to convince her son to stop, and when she confessed to the police that she raised her son wrong and how his father was also abusive; which led to her son continuing that cycle down her granddaughter.

I know this sound shitty of the grandma but this really touched me because this is exactly the problem with Asian society in general. Hitting your child as a form of discipline is normal (not to that extent) and it is why child abuse is so common. The sentiment of ""respect your parents"" and ""respect your elders"" is also the standard in Asia.

I've never seen a Korean drama talk about truly deep and sensitive issues about Korea like Juvenile Justice does which is why it's my favourite. It doesn't just talk about issues in Korea that everyone is okay with talking about like corruption, or beauty standards; It sheds light on genuinely critical societal issues that most don't want to talk about such as academic pressure and competition, child abuse, forced prostitution, gang violence, juveniles being unafraid of the law because of how lenient their sentences will be and fucking scary they are because not even the law is stopping them.

It's not like some other dramas about law where justice is ALWAYS served (cough, cough, While you were sleeping). It shows the reality and how the law doesn't always protect the victim and those perpetrators do get away or get extremely lenient sentences.

Conclusion

This kdrama is on the darker side of things but if you're okay with it I strongly recommend it! I finally found a kdrama to be on my top tier greatest of all time kdramas through the stories important stories it tells.

Maybe from this drama what I can appreciate is only the type of case,, other than that there is nothing,, in my opinion, the storyline of each case is very slow and boring, even though the duration is no more than 1 hour, it feels very slow,,use speed 2x is not enough

The use of professional terms is not understood, although it is often discussed, the way the law works in this drama seems unclear in my opinion, a bit difficult and dizzy when watching, especially subtitles with words that are difficult to understand, a bit dizzy

In this drama, it tells the weakness of the law, not the strength of the law, the punishment is not proportional to the savagery of the perpetrator

In the case of domestic violence, will prove that who will be imprisoned is the perpetrator, not the victim, the one year sentence was not enough, when the perpetrator was released, it would happen again and even worse.

Family is the basic unit of society
“They say it takes an entire village to raise a child. In other words, a child’s life could be ruined if the entire village neglects the child.” - Shim Eun Seok.

What a great show! Great story, excellent casts and I think we need this series to show us how every decisions, actions and words, could affect not us but the people around us. That every actions there's a corresponding responsiblity included.

We should always take into consideration the things that we will decide to do. That as an adult, we should always reflect how it would affect younger generation. Also, that family is really important and that when you become a parent, you are responsible in shaping your child on how to become a responsible member of the society.

Hard topic done well
I found this drama highly realistic and truly informative about a problem most first world countries have - juvenile delinquency, and the inadequacies of the legal system to combat it. I myself retired from DSS which is social services in the US - and I had teens coming in for help with medical (pregnancy too often!) & living help. Kids who came thru the foster system & were flung out on their own at 18. Kids from bad or indifferent parents. Kids who were thrown out of their homes for not conforming to the morals or religions of their parents. Just heartbreaking.
This drama had as the central character a woman that I did not like at all. She had no business being a juvenile judge in the SK system as portrayed, because of her constant 'I hate juvenile offenders' spiel. Nope, nada, not acceptable. However, her journey was imminently worth watching. She overcame her prejudices and gave fair & impartial judgements, trying her best to help these kids on a path away from crime towards being productive citizens, despite their parents and their home situations. I very much enjoyed the way she went after the truth, like a terrier, thru-out.
Now, I do have a huge problem with that first case. A young teen (13???) who is schizophrenic???? WTF???? That psychopathic older teen used and manipulated this vulnerable, MENTALLY ILL child, and he had no business being put in the penal system at all. He needed psychiatric care, pure and simple. However, this really highlights for me the big problem SK seems to have in regards to mental illness - somewhere reform is needed. Lord knows, the US has areas (huge ones) where a ton of reforms are needed, BTW. In fact I'd say it's possible that the SK legal system overall is more efficient than the one here in the US (not a huge achievement). But the way mental illnesses are ignored is just insane.
I did not like the way the chief judge was treated by the main character, BTW. At no point did she ask him when he found out about his son - which makes a big difference. She exhibited a very holier-than-thou attitude thru the entire drama in fact, which made me long for someone to slap her down. Her boss was going to have his career ruined, as he knew when he found out about his son - despite the fact he hadn't a clue the kid & his wife had disobeyed him. That's another problem with SK - the way mere proximity (as in a family member, or someone you know/work with) to a criminal, or to scandal, can wash over one and destroy YOUR career etc! The way the families of criminals, who often have been victims of said criminals themselves, are demonized! This is something shown really well in the drama Come Hug Me.
I really loved the ending case - it showed what her problems were, and wrapped them up well. I could have done without her ridiculous lecture to her superior, which really had no truth in it whatsoever (throwing 11 year olds in the penal system does not 'teach them' anything except how to be better criminals next time). Those kids needed actual counseling and the kinds of consequences that children need - ie education and a sense of responsibility. Their parents failed them woefully, and it's not the job of the justice department, nor the schools, to give kids this. Both those boys looked to be sociopathic from the start, which is not going to somehow 'go away' by throwing them in jail or juvenile detention. Anymore than schizophrenia will somehow disappear using the same method. However, the older judge did slap her down a peg at least, and both seemed to learn something from this experience.

All in all this was a very worthwhile watch. Acting, of course, was top-notch.

!!!!! Wow
Story: AMAZING. There were so many twists and turns in the storyline that just came out of nowhere (in a good way) I was constantly on my toes and never knew who was good or bad and who was in the right or wrong. Are they on the good team? Have they now switched to the bad team or were they there all along? Who knows. (Well me, because I’ve seen it ;) )
It made me feel ALL the emotions, even the ones I didn’t want to feel, I was on edge one minute, then swooning at Joon Hwi the next and then crying about something afterwards.

Acting/Cast: For me, the acting never felt stiff or forced, obviously I can’t speak for others. Everyone played their role well and I think the perfect people were cast for each role. I loved that we got backstories and plots for a lot of the characters as well, it helped immerse me in the story because I felt like I knew everyone I was seeing on screen, I could understand their actions and motives better.

Music: Gosh that one song was catchy “it’s pulling me undeeeerrrrr, it’s driving me CRAAAAZYYYY”. The music was dark and sinister when it needed to be which made me feel in danger at the right moments and help keep the pacing of the show.

I would definitely watch again, if not for Ye Seul’s storyline and Joon Hwi’s heart eyes then for the rush I felt during the high intensity scenes.

If you like investigation/law (kind of detectivy I guess) dramas, then this is a good watch for you. Enjoy!

THE BEST LEGAL COURTROOM DRAMA EVER!
Are you a fan of the American legal thriller TV series HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER? Then, LAW SCHOOL is definitely for you. Not a remake, but the premise of the drama and the primary set-up is inspired by the said English series.

Law School had been one of the most anticipated drama of the year 2021, that too a rare legal courtroom thriller drama. And everyone can see how it has paid off to everyone's expectations. Kim Myung Min, Kim Bum and Ryu Hye Young are indeed the reason all of us were damn sure about the quality drama it'll be. What a powerful cast to begin with!

The very first scene of the very first episode of this drama; that one single scene where the writer and the director decided to show the faces of the cast for every major character and proved what the class and standard of their drama will be. That was so lovely of a scene to witness and made me feel woah. The production actually succeeded in dragging us into the drama.

Law School has a straicase plot development which means, it's neither steady storyline or a combination of connecting plots; rather a series of related events where everything is revealed in a step by step manner leading to the main climax in the end. I loved the way every character in it catched up to a new event that they were completely unaware of, resonated it on the individual level utilizing law that they study, gave it a trail for good and finally let it go.

Law School has the typical urban thriller editing but they keep the intense mood up all the time by running the screenplay at the apt speed, hence making it interesting and not boring.

To be honest, the first 2 episodes felt a bit dull and confusing. They keep going forward and backward in time, multiple times which didn't allow me to catch up to what exactly was happening. But it caught momentum from the 3rd episode and got better since then. And from the 6th episode, it actually became very interesting and I enjoyed watching.

Character development is a thing that's been shown for only limited characters among a huge number of cast but that's fruitful given how they changed from facile and one dimensional beings to stronger individuals with the drama's progression. Notably, the screentime distribution is even for all the characters, the lead trio being the ones to get slightly more duration; one of the handful dramas where both male and female characters are equally emphasised and well balanced. A major credit to the writer for that.

Kim Myung Min being the arrogant and most lawful man (in the entire world), might make your blood boil to the point that you might wanna smash him down but before you realize, he shall capture your heart with his badguy charisma (I've actually fallen for him :P). DO NOT expect to see much romance between Kim Bum and Hye Young because the drama ain't about that though Kim Bum sometimes love to flirt with Hye Young as he kind of admires her a lot. On the other side, Hye Young who is unaware of her fluttering heart for Kim Bum, is always annoyed by Kim Bum and herself is so annoying, haha. Her character development is notable for she grows to being a righteous law person from a girl, not good at studies.

Let's talk about the legal aspects. I have always felt that not many people watch pure legal dramas unless it has a major part of romance and melodrama but if we are talking about a courtroom drama or movie, it has to be like Law School. Some people might wanna give up because they keep blabbering about the criminal codes, constitutional laws, articles and sections at a rate that you have to pause many times to understand and channelise the things but trust me, that's what happenes in a real courtroom. They have included and discussed a lot of clauses but they also made sure to make us understand them with examples and elaborations even during the trials. They've also wisely introduced the shortcomings in the existing law & order, thus implying a need of change in them. This work is hence highly commendable.

It's done pretty well even if you judge it as a thriller. They kept increasing our urge & curiosity to know who the actual culprit is. Unlike many thrillers, you might hesitate to predict and make theories about this drama because everything is simultaneous and transparent and which is why I thought the revelation of the culprit will come as a huge shock, but not gonna lie, it was disappointing. It turned out to be an already very bad guy so I wasn't like woah. But I doesn't matter because it's primarily a courtroom drama and evem after the revelation, it didn't become boring or anything rather more cases were added on the same episide as compensation which never felt like getting dragged at all.

The background sound editing and screenplay is nice. The direction is amazing as well that kept people going, especially for viewers like me who are into binging. But I think this drama is a huge disadvantage for those who watch ongoing. It's not frustrating as there's nothing to predict or think about and honestly you won't have to wait for a week eagerly to watch the next episode.

Law School is indeed one of the best thrillers of 2021 and overally among all the thrillers too and let me call it the BEST LEGAL COURTROOM KDRAMA EVER PRODUCED.

P. S. I sometimes got the DEAD POETS SOCIETY vibes because of the way Prof. Yang gathered his students and they even had a hideout in the copy room. HAHAHA

Sometimes average is just perfect
The first episodes were dull, show gained momentum in the second half and the episodes kept getting better.

A great plus is the stars-packed cast and the relationship between the characters. Even though the characters seem one-dimensional first, comparing their actions and overall appearance in the beginning to the end of the series clearly show character development.

Also, I just realised, I like how the depiction of character was evenly balanced out between male and female characters, if that makes any sense. Normally with K-dramas (not always of course), especially thrillers, I feel like male protagonists end up with more screen time, more depth in character and therefore are more likeable, while the female ones at some point are just annoying and dull, whereas here, for once, each character (except for the obvious villains) was likeable and the female characters were as top-notch and well-written as the male ones.

That hot shot of a professor, who seemed to be a knock-off of Annelise from HTGAWM was hard to bear in the earlier episodes but, I don't know how and when this happened, you end up liking him, even looking forward to his badass scenes.

The story itself wasn't that intriguing, but somehow still managed to pique your interest and make you look forward to the next episodes. The background score - actually just one song - was fitting and had a catchy tune like ""We All Lie "" from SKY Castle.

Even though romance is not part of this drama the scenes between Kim Bum and Ryu Hye Young were too cute - more chemistry than in some dramas tagged as romance. However, this was more high-key low-key in earlier episodes.

Also, I like how the show elaborates on shortcomings in the law. Especially a case in the beginning of the second half accentuated this. The 'law school' itself was not the main focus of the show, but the little insight into the lectures, study groups, mock trials and the overall struggle of (law) students with exam preparations, pressure to do well at school and fear of failing was captured well.

The show is not perfect and not even close to an outstanding thriller, it's pretty average, and that somehow works in favour of this show. It was something I would look forward to each week, but not like ""dying"" to watch, nothing too captivating, stressing and frustrating (like Mouse), but at the same time nothing where after a while you just can't be bothered with the revealing of the truth (like Beyond Evil, sorry) - just a decent thriller with a solid pace and surprising revealings which are not mind-blowing and yet, satisfying.

Also, this drama has definitely potential for a second season!

HANDS DOWN, THE BEST LEGAL DRAMA EVER
I just finished law school a moment ago and dont know where to start. Everything is really really good OMG. The satisfaying feelings when you watch a perfect drama, thats exactly what i feel now.

Law School is a fast paced drama. The early episodes are quite dull and serious, but the pace is getting better, its funnier and intriguing at the same time. Its not heavy eventhough its a legal drama. Its not draggy even we got to know the real killer on 13th episode.

What i like the most is every character shine and well played in this drama. There's no unimportant character and put aside. The plot twist are very VERY unexpected. Its thrilling i feel like screaming watching Law School.

There's no love line but chemistry and cute scenes between Joon Hwi and Sol A is enough to bring spark. I love how i cant guess what will come next and happen in the next episodes.

THE PLOT. SCRIPT. STORYLINE. CINEMATOGRAPHY. CHARACTER. OST

ITS ALL PERFECT. I find no flaws in this drama.

Hear me out, i am very selective and rarely love a drama but Law School bring exception to me. This drama holds a special place in my heart. Would definitely rewatch and recommend others to watch.

YOU WONT REGRET TRUST ME.

One word: disappointing
The text below might contain orthographical mistakes since I'm not a native english speaker.

I was anticipating for this drama even before it was released: a friend sent me the teasers and I got super excited since I was looking for a mystery drama to watch. The beginning was pretty confusing (I had to rewatch the first four episodes to fully understand), I thought the random informations we got were going to be addressed while the episodes were passing, but it never happened. The writers were just opening new problems in every episode and never clarifying the ones created previously, taking the focus away from the main subject and creating a whole mess. It's hard to connect every piece of information we got about the murder itself when the drama focused more on exploring the life of secondary characters, and there comes another problem: how come we know more about the supporting roles than about the main characters, Kang Sol A and Han Joonhwi? They never clarified what happened with Sol A's family or what Joonhwi's uncle said to Jiho when he was on drugs. It was just a mess from start to end. But what made me watch it until the end? 1. The OST; 2. The charismatic characters: Even if I see the deepening of the student's life as something unnecessary for the plot, it made it easier to like them. I loved how the study group's character's personalities were contrasting, but they still had interesting interactions, looks like something I would see on a 2010s Nickelodeon TV Show. The subtle hints of a possible romance between some of them were amazing too (Bokgi crushing on Yeseul was so cute!). I knew there wouldn't have space for romance, but at the start I waited for something like Suho/Jukyung/Soojin from Joonhwi and both Kang Sols, instead, they worked very well as a trio; 3. Yeseul: If it wasn't for her, I think I'd have dropped the show. Different from the others, her arc added something to the plot and I LOVE how the scriptwriters portrayed her feelings: The blind love she felt for her boyfriend, the fear she had of him, The Moment Of Realization, the confusion someone feels when dealing with an abusive partner. Overall, I don't think it is a good drama and would not recommend it. I'd never watch it completely if I wasn't keeping up with the weekly updates. Anyways, it's a pity that it doesn't give what it promises, but I don't fully regret watching it.

It's driving me crazy
If you’re reading this wile thinking if you shall watch this or not I’ll make it easy for ya, if you’re searching for looooots of law, thriller, plot twist, great acting and production and a bit of comedy and bromance this is one of the best choices.

Ugh I don’t usually write reviews but I need to talk abt this one. I watched ep1 on a day when we didn’t have any internet; I was feeling bored and it was downloaded on my pc so I watched it. It was half-interesting half-not interesting.
When the internet was back I decided to give it shot and watch ep2 and I became a FAN.

I like every little thing about this K-drama and it’s my first time feeling this. From the production that was veryyyyy awesome imo.. the acting!! The cast acting was neither more nor less it was just perfect. The OST is one of the most amazing things about it, it’s gorgeous it totally suits the vibes. There were some things and actions that weren’t clear at all but later they became. Not to mention the plot twists ???. I enjoyed watching this and waiting for it.

If one day I forgot the drama’s events I’d absolutely re-watch.

And lastly may god gives me a professor like Prof. Yang when I join university <3.
Thank you for reading till the end-?

A SMOOTH WATCH
Law school is captivating in almost every way. the plot takes place around a group of students who solve a murder with the help and lead of their daring and shockingly charismatic professor.

To start with the plot, it was adequate being set in the premise of murder is almost the story for most legal-based dramas. the pull from this one was the amazing way the cast brought their personal perspectives and connections to the main story making everything flow in perfection. I did not plan on loving this piece when I stumbled upon it with no expectation at all but it leaves you wanting more every episode. The performances were amazing especially Rye Hye Young and Kim Myung Min who displayed such lovely balance in a teacher and student relationship but her ability to really allow her audience to empathize with everything she went through as a student. I feel like a lot of students can relate to feeling inadequate especially in a hyper-pressurized environment in the academic world, surrounded by people who make your hard work look light with a talent for that same craft. This drama definitely represents most of what university or college might look like and it comes with so much more in terms of dating and even feeling pressured to evade moral law in exams and tests.

I loved the soundtrack even if there were like 2 songs, they did more than enough. for anyone who still doesn't know the amazing opening, it's called X by SafiraK and it is a blessing to the OST world. the editing was something I didn't like. the way some scenes were slowed down for dramatic effect proved unnecessary and mediocre.

Overall it was really pleasant, I am petitioning for a season 2 and I will continue to do so. If you love the legal world of dramas or even school life with a bit of murder, this watch will drive you crazy (;)) in a good way. WATCH IT!!!

Better watch Judge Judy
I don't know where to start. The main plot was mostly predictable. If you watched more than 1 criminal drama, you will know exactly the final result.

I don't know a korean law system, but I don't think that a judge would allow a witness or a lawer to do whatever they like. It small thing but the more you see the more you get tired of the whole thing.

Almost all characters were flat - good or bad, nothing in between. There are few evil characters and it won't take long to figure out who the main bad guy is.

Music is boring. Nothing else.

Overall, a big dissapointment.

Toying with Law Can Be Exhilarating
One of the most exciting things of a drama sub-genre is the ability for common viewers to learn a topic specifically via entertainment media. Law School is an epitome of that when it comes to legal drama sub-genre. Not only the series being set in a learning environment of masters degree but it also incorporates the academic community facing real-life-like problems, in extreme measures. While some events occur *too* coincidental from one to another, the insertion of law generates a decent a visualization for viewers without particular law backgrounds (like me).

Law School has successfully executed an eagerly complex law-heavy plot. While the first few episodes might bring viewers into confusion due to rapid and excessive delivery of law articles, the later episodes appear to be more relaxed. Seo Byungju’s death is the obvious main topic of this drama. However, the writers did not disappoint in bringing up his past thus creating subplots that neither interfere nor being too far off from the main case. A bit of detour happened with Yeseul’s trial but it breathed a new air to the drama once the main plot started to stall. Although Law School keep its plot focus on legal/courtroom and not romance-related, some subplots felt like they were left hanging. Yoo Seungjae’s case started with enticing movements yet they left him off the screen during his whole trial. Seo Jiho’s case was also left with an ending open to interpretation. There might be differences against each other, but there is a unique thing that laps over the other: a strategy of toying with law to set yourself free from the case.

Apart from the favorable plot, Law School likewise offers appealing characters. The overly-rigid Professor Yang might be annoying at times but his clever instinct is one of his redeeming qualities, a terrific portrayal by Kim Myungmin. With most dramas, the writers tend to latch into romance to develop more subplots and characteristics while this is not the problem in Law School. The exclusion of romance did not necessarily means bland interaction among the characters, in fact most of them (especially the study group) appears to be very natural. I personally found Han Joonhwi and his friends (especially Kang Sol-A’s) bond to be entrancing. The supporting characters are generally fine and stayed in their lane.

Furthermore, Law School is backed with decent supporting elements. The sets, cinematography, music pan out to be good but nothing particularly special. The series already had a thrilling plot hence having average supporting elements is already enough to construct the drama to be good in general.

In closing, Law School is a great drama with strong plot and characters and decent supporting elements. In the end, it’s a one way of enjoying entertainment while learning law by watching people toying with it. Although, I would like to end my review with this common saying, “Law school taught me one thing: how to take two situations that are exactly the same and show how they are different.” — Hart Pomerantz

'The law is imperfect justice'
This show may not be perfect neither did it serve us an outstanding performance of law, thriller or suspense but either way I have to say this show had to be one of my favourites this year! It might be an average law-related drama but it did keep me on the edge of the seat at the ending of every week's last episode. The first few episodes were quite slow-paced probably to try and keep us in suspense and for the whole story to start to fold out later but that didn't keep me from not continuing and I did continue it and trust me the story does get a little more faster later.
As for the OST, they had a really catchy one for this drama which didn't really go that well with the first few eps but it started matching the overall theme of the episodes later.
And as for the cast, this show really had a great cast and honestly, it had one of the best squads I've seen in kdramas. All of them performed really well and Kim Beom and Ryu Hyeyoung's chemistry was my favourite. Professor Yang was one of my favourite characters in this show - HE IS SO SMART AND A TOTAL BADDIE. Loved his iconic entries and lines!
One thing I really quite didn't enjoy was that the last episode felt like it was rushing to tie all the open knots and give us an end but it ended up making me feel kind of empty because I'm glad we got to see Sol A and Joonhwi's future careers but what about everyone else? Does Bokgi finally get to be a human rights lawyer? How old would Seungjae's child be by now? Is Sol B a judge? Could Yeseul be a legislator? What does Jiho do now? Or even Yebeom? JTBC could've given us maybe one more episode to cover everything else since they never thought about giving us a second season.

Either way, I would give it a 9/10, it was a good one~

The characterisation alone makes this drama worth watching
This drama is not a light watch and requires great concentration especially in the first few episodes, otherwise you will get confused. Choosing to present the main plot in such a scattered fashion was something of a gamble on the part of the directing team as it inevitably cost them casual viewers. However, if you carry on watching this drama, you will come to realise that everything falls into place fairly quickly as the story progresses. (Worry not, the feeling of confusion shall pass rapidly. You might not even feel it at all!) Having such an intricate plot allowed each character to have their own subplot which made them all relevant to the story. Some subplots were more thought-out than others but, overall, they were all significant and added depth to each character.

What makes this drama stand out in the crime genre is the fact that it wasn’t so much about finding who the real killer was — at first —, but more about proving that those wrongfully accused were innocent. Therefore the emphasis was put on the trial process which I found really informative for someone who doesn’t know much about law. (The drama title takes on its full meaning, doesn’ it?).

I won’t dwell on the plot as I want this review to be spoiler-free.

Now let’s get onto the characters which are, by far, my favourite part of this drama. It’s been so long since I’ve watched a drama with such a brilliant and accurate characterisation. Every character in “Law School” is fleshed-out, humanely flawed, and relatable. The fulfilling friendship between the Law School gang enables them to feel confident in what they’re doing and also acts as a constant reminder of their own flaws (and qualities). Indeed they won’t hesitate to call people out if need be — including themselves — and they will always find a way to talk (and think) things through.
They have a true spirit of friendship and so instead of bearing everything on their own, they all come together so as to help each other and whoever is in need. It doesn’t come easily nor naturally to all of them — seeking and offering help I mean — but it comes nonetheless.
Their warm and close friendship is definitely one of the reasons as to why I’d recommend this drama.
Special mention to Yang Jong Yoon who didn’t fall into the trap of being yet another archetype of the cold-hearted and stone-faced male lead. His relationship with his students was very wholesome and I loved the dynamic he had with Kim Eun Sook — you could see a whole other side of him when he was with her.

I can’t write a review about “Law School” without mentioning the relationship Kang Sol A and Han Joon Hwi have. I was thankful for this drama for not being romance-centric, however, I still think there were some romantic elements, but those were subtly incorporated to the story which I greatly appreciated. It followed, in a way, the “show, don’t tell” maxim in literature.
Kang Sol A and Han Joon Hwi are undeniably close, but they don’t seem to realise that they know each other on a much deeper level than the others. They never once questioned their feelings and so they’re not fully aware of what they mean. Joon Hwi’s love for Kang Sol A is genuine and selfless: he is always there for her and, when he can, he tries to cut short her self-doubt which helps her build self-assurance (Don’t worry, she does so on her own as well but Joon Hwi is of great help). Out of the two, Kang Sol A is the most oblivious of their feelings. Her trust in him is complete and she is most vulnerable when she is with him — he is the only one she confides in. Kang Sol B seems to have understood that — the innermost feelings they have for each other — since the way she sometimes looks at them is quite telling.
If you’re not convinced of the implied feelings these two harbour, then just pay attention to the way Joon Hwi looks at Kang Sol A and the way he looks at other people: his gaze never fails to soften when he speaks to her (so does his voice).

As for the OST, I believe it successfully captured the overall mood of the drama and was very fitting. I liked how the lyrics were in keeping with the whole story.

Now on to my closing statement (see what I did there ?). The first episodes aren’t the best ones as I felt the drama was trying too hard to enthral and impress the viewers. The timeline was overly confusing and some comparisons initially felt forced or were clumsily introduced — i.e Yang Jong Yoon’s obsession with puzzles. The whole puzzle metaphor left me a bit skeptical at first because of how emphasised it was, but Yoon Hoon himself convinced me. (You’ll see what I mean once you’ve watched the drama). However the characters make up for that given how engaging they were. The plot is pretty well-crafted and strengthens as the story progresses. Each character was able to play a part, which some people might have thought was too much of a coincidence — every character was somehow connected to the events which were unfolding — , but I, for one, appreciated the fact that the side characters weren’t just there to help the main ones: they were equally as important.
The beautiful friendship the Law School gang develops throughout the drama makes it even more enjoyable, and I can safely say that they will definitely grow on you. I also loved how professors and students helped one another in their own specific ways. It was refreshing to see! This drama’s characters are truly gems!

On that note, I rest my case.

Will make you like legal dramas!
OVERALL
This drama is one of the few (way too few!!!) ensemble Korean dramas out there and that's great! Watch if 1) you like legal dramas, 2) you're looking for a well-written show, 3) you enjoy dramas with a (mostly) serious and realistic vibe. Think twice if 1) you want fluff or lots of comedy, 2) you're craving some romance, 3) you're into suspense or you like philosophical-type shows. But I'd say still give it a try, you might be surprised by how much you still enjoy it. I know I was.

THE STORY
It took me forever to start this drama because I'm really NOT a fan of legal dramas, but I eventually got bored (*cough* desperate *cough*) and had a look. It was unexpectedly quite good! Probably the drama that does legal the best (imo)!!!

The Good
- There is an overarching plot in this drama, but since it's about an ensemble cast (students each have their own story, plus the main prof), there're also lots of smaller plotlines and they are ALL super interesting. No skipping needed in this drama at all! It's also great how the drama weaves in all these smaller plots into the main one so effortlessly. That's good writing!
- This is linked to the first point, but almost all the characters (I'd say all but some of the villains) have considerable depth. They have their backstory, they have their weaknesses, their flaws, their little something to overcome. And of course, they have their strength. It's nice to see a drama in which characters are more than plot devices!
- I say this drama does legal the best because as someone who hates legal dramas and finds them boring, it managed to actually get me to care about the trials and the clauses and laws. How it succeeds where others have fail is still a mystery to me, but I think it's because the drama made me root and care about the characters a lot. Also, the entire drama isn't spent in courtrooms. We see what happens backstage the most (the crimes, the preparation for trials, the lessons, etc.). It's pretty cool!

The Bad
- Maybe they didn't care, but there's close to zero suspense in this drama. Although it's set up as a whodunit, it's pretty clear from episode 1 who is probably responsible for the murder. The same applies for a few other crimes in the drama. So it becomes a bit irrelevant how 2/3 of the drama, if not more, tries to postpone the reveal of who is really guilty.
- The ending is very underwhelming for me. Underwhelming and just...dissatisfying. Too rushed, too shallow. Not sure why they decided to go for the choices that they made.
- Overall, I think the drama was meant to encourage thought on justice and law. That's how they set it up in the pilot. But it really sort of...doesn't? I feel like it's a bit of a let down in that department. Especially at the end; they try to wrap it up nicely but it just feels like empty words...

THE ACTING
Pretty good, I'd say. Some performances felt a bit more extra (especially villains and less important students), but nothing that ruins the experience.

THE MUSIC
Not a fan, but it was fitting. It's a shame that the BGM didn't stay as good as it is in the first episode though. The first few minutes are pretty awesome!

REWATCH VALUE
Not very high. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice watch. A really nice watch. But it doesn't have the ""umph"" factor that will make me want to watch it again. It lacks grip, and I typically prefer rewatching addicting shows. Still recommend though!

Spell bounded storyline with unique characters arch
The premiere episode sets the mood and is slow at times, the continuous time lapse leaves you confused but still manages to keep you hooked on wanting for more, the music and cinematography deserves it fair share of credit due as it is not only exceptional but helps viewers to understand the tone and emotion of the respective scene

The way this show showcased light on dating abuse is applaudable the clear cut details which are at times disturbing but shows only a drop of reality is a eyeopener to the corrupt society, the power struggle which the law at times ignores and completely turns their eyes away end up causing a huge difference and trauma to certain individuals , the way the victim's side was explored, the hesitation, the emotions the individual feels when going through such toxic phase in their life and how hard it for them to accept the fact that they are indeed victims and require courage and determination to overcome such phase to start new and learn from such disturbing incidents and their aftermath of finding hope

The first four episodes are rather slow and makes you question your sanity at times but it least in a good way and does not make you feel overwhelm with the amount of information the show wanted to convey

Han Joon Hwi our golden boy who seemingly has it all but the the emotional scars he has due to feeling of betrayal by a close one remains hidden to the outside world at least for a bit, a uncle whom he considers the most important person and gradually drifting away from him and the emotional imbalance with such changes. His close relationship with the professor how he cares for him or at time you really question his intentions towards him, his down to earth personality but with a notch of arrogance from all that academic excellence really makes him stand out , the emotions he displays in the initial episodes really gets to you and you sympathize with him and at times question what is he even doing

I really loved how Kang Sol A she was hella relatable we always see these bright smart kids who end up in a prestige institution but never learn the struggles one has to go even when giving it your all, the way she never gives up and works hard it's rather unique and quiet admirable character trait which many of shows do not showcase . In the initial episodes she was exhibiting as a dumb and immature FL but gradually you see her character arc broadening I love her character development and admire her courage she never holds back from expressing her opinion and her priority to clear her doubts which often leads to her giving us second hand embarrassment is a con and a pro but hey we've all been there ain't that the case chief

The professor's dedication towards his students is some next level shit man even when is being questioned to prove himself innocent he strives and changes his course to treat that as a lesson for his students , without making it obvious he always motivates and encourages his students to strive harder for their goals and is always there for them , even when one doesn't believe he gives them benefit of the doubt and never lets judgement from society get in his way to treat every individual fairly. In the second half which can be clearly observed and his morals which even lead him to resign being prosecutor shows authenticity and sincerity to once profession and importance to certain element in life

The focus on power struggle and rich getting away from their crimes have been highlighted but karma comes to you and gives you the taste of your own medicine it's enjoyable to see the responsible individuals losing their mind and paying for their crimes.

The storyline is quiet enjoyable in the first half but the last few episodes becomes increasingly predictable the story lost the attention of viewers at times gets kind of draggy that but still you can't really predict what gonna happen and who is responsible for it

Overall really enjoyed the show kinda wish it had bit more romance but oh well the storyline and characters made that empty hollow in my heart go away

I heard about Law School when it came out, but was never really interested since it gave me How to Get Away With Murder vibes. But then one day my boyfriend and I were just looking for a show to watch and I'm glad I gave it a shot!

Right at the beginning of the show, a professor gets murdered and a lot of the plot revolves around figuring out what really happened and looking at all of the possible suspects / getting to know the backstories of different characters. It's a show that hooks you in and keeps you guessing, and I think all of the characters were really well fleshed out and interesting. As the audience, you keep questioning the motives of people and if they are the bad guys or not but I also liked seeing the friendships in the show as it progressed. The study group of law students truly became friends and supported each other, and there is a very subtle kind of romance between Sol A and Han Joon-Hwi although it never really gets explored.

The show has this murder case at the heart of the plot, but along the way explores the relationships between people, how good people can make terrible mistakes and conversely, how people are also capable of doing the right thing even when it's not easy.

I found the ending a bit weird in that I would have liked more details on what happened to the villain of the story and I would have liked to have seen more of Kang Dan, but I enjoyed the show and would watch a second season if it came out. And I haven't seen Kim Bum in what feels like forever, but he still looks so young! I still remember him from Boys Over Flowers, so it's nice to see him in a drama again.

STOP, Just Go Watch It Already PLEASE, I BEG YOU
Man I don't even know where to start. This drama was exceptional. I really enjoyed it down to the core. Every week was a painful wait because every episode left me with suspense and questions. This drama and the mystery in it was executed brilliantly. I now want to become a lawyer helpppp, I want Yang to be my professor omg.

Anyways, I found that the cast was really good, each of them played their characters so well. I really liked how there were many stories in this drama and it gave each character a bit of importance and an important role to play. The only thing I'd warn people about is if you're looking for romance, this isn't really a romance drama. it's more of a mystery law drama that focuses on justice. And let me just tell you, as an avid romance drama watcher, I did not find this drama uninteresting in any way. It was very good, I usually skip my way through dramas sometimes, but this made me want to rewind. I really would die for a season 2. I feel like any watcher would enjoy this so sit down and please give it a chance! It'll leave you craving more. I really really enjoyed this so much. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did!

Thrilling plot with a ""who done it?"" at the end of each episode.
Firstly, if you are interested in the investigative/law genre this series will not disappoint, I often found myself questioning each of the characters, as parts of their timeline were revealed surrounding the incident.
Initially, I found the character of the first female lead slightly immature and overdramatic. However, her character grew on me as I could empathise with her desire to prove those who doubted her wrong, and eventually, she became the comedic relief in some scenes, despite the heavy storyline surrounding the students.

The cast delivered exceptionally by individually portraying the different personalities of the characters and their chemistry on-screen felt natural and the interactions ranged from light-hearted bickering to serious conversations regarding the incident. Even the main villain of the story had an outstanding performance, to the point that I was so frustrated and praying for the character to be brought to justice

For me, I went into this drama without any expectations and the story blew me away, to the point that I wish I could watch this drama again without knowing what happens in the end. I still got the intro music in my head and now that I have completed the drama it makes me miss looking forward to watching a new episode.

Overall, I gave a 10-star rating because I honestly could not find anything wrong with this drama and will definitely re-watch it in the future.

I wish uni would actually be this exiting but also not... You know :D
Law School is, as the title suggests, a drama about a group of law students and their courses.
During a training process (which looked quite fun) a professor gets killed and all the people whose footprints are found at the crime scene are suspected, which leads to a professor and some students being the prime suspect. Some students are sure that their acquaintances are innocent and want to find the true murderer.

I do not know anything about the law and how it works (on that base), but I found it very interesting. I watched some American shows, which deal with similar topics already, so I knew that I would probably like this one, too.
What was absolutely amazing was that all of the characters had a story line. Nobody was there to only have a helping, commenting or antagonistic function. Everyone contributed to the story on their own, and everyone had to carry their own baggage. Especially, Jeon Ye Seul story got me on the edge of my seat.
Repeatedly I was unsure if somebody was on the main character's side or if they switched. In addition, the audience's minds were challenged by the falsification of scenes, which I found genuinely interesting. This is also one of the dramas where you are delighted to see the group growing together over time. People will break out of their comfort zone and realize what's best for them.
I gave the story 9 stars, because it also had length in-between which could have been avoided.

The cast was impressive, no expectation, and I immensely liked the dynamics between them. I think they had a lot of fun of the screen as well, because of the behind the scenes. Shortly to the main lead, Kang Sol [A], played by Ryu Hye Young really portrayed Kang Sols struggle. I am a university student myself and not naturally gifted. To be on the top, I have to work harder than everyone else, and I could see myself in her very well. It made me feel less alone. I guess.
A lot of people in the comments say that they found her pathetic or weird, but I enjoyed watching her.

The drama has two amazing soundtracks. They fitted the situations well and are catchy. But besides them, I did not find the music very remarkable.

You can definitely watch the show again, but it takes some tension, if you know who murdered the professor and how the other problems get solved. But, of course, this is one of the dramas which will be seen from a different side afterwards.

Overall, I thought Law School was a pretty decent drama for people interested in crime scenes, investigations or strong friendships.

A peek into Korea’s legal structure
I love the fact that the drama starts with a bang – a murder in the mock courtroom and it moves ahead from there. If you aren’t familiar with the legal terms like me then I suggest go a little slow…maybe rewind a bit to understand it. This is only for the first two episodes. Subsequently, you will get used to it and start enjoying it.
I cannot attribute the success of this drama to any one particular character. They are all important and very good in their roles. The core cast of the legal students all have stories attached to them and they all point out to the main culprit somehow.
The professors are the strength of this school. I am glad to see that they have showcased more positives than negatives as far as teachers go. We need to restore our faith in our teachers. There are good ones everywhere too.
The drama showcases the typical innocent getting charged while the actual wrongdoers go scot-free.
The strength of this drama is its cast and its amazing performances. Kim Myung Min as Yang Jong Hoon is a teacher who is revered and feared at the same time. The experience he brings to the classroom is priceless(since he was a former prosecutor). The students respect him and he becomes the main suspect for the crime much to his student’s horror. They know he is innocent. We know he is innocent but does the legal system? Obviously not. And that’s where the story begins – with a flawed legal system and the corrupt power of the rich and mighty. But Yang Jong Hoon is not deterred. He is determined to clear his name and catch the real suspect. Imagine the strength of this character.
His peer Lee Jung Eun as Kim Eun Sook is as smart in the classroom as she is in the courtroom. Her support to him and the students carry this drama forward too.
The students portrayed by Kim Bum, Ryu Hye Young, Lee Soo Kyung, David Lee, Ko Yoon Jung, Hyun Woo , Lee Kang Ji and Kim Min Seok each probably represent students in real-time law school with their real problems. Here each of them have their own demons to deal with and they are beautifully incorporated into the flow of the plot. There is a subtle undertone of romance but its really not the focus of this drama.
The character of Lee Man Ho played by Jo Jae Ryong has to have a special mention as the plot rests on his side of the story. He is creepy to the core and that’s brilliant acting if he manages to evoke those emotions. His character apparently has been coined on the lines of a real time offender (Jo Doo Soon).
Jin Hyung Woo played by Park Hyuk Kwon is this sleezy know it all prosecutor whose aim is to bring Yang Jung down no matter what. He teams up with the corrupt Assemblyman Ko Hyeong So in all his evil doings. Both these characters are well played by their respective actors.

This was a refreshing change for me. Well tackled and kept the thread of interest alive throughout.

My new favorite kdrama!!
The first day it came out, I had decided to watch it and I am so glad I made that choice. I was hooked from the start and waited for episodes to come out each week. I was really surprised i enjoyed it bc this genre was something new for me. Not only was the plot amazing but the drama was well made. Also, the plot wasn't dragged on at all and the plot twists always had me shocked. I never knew what was going to happen next. the music always came on at the right moments and the acting was very natural. I love the cast and solhwi's relationship made me so happy!! I rlly hope they give us a second season for some solhwi content and to see how the other characters are doing. It was wrapped up very nicely and im definitely going to miss watching this every Wednesday and Thursday. PLS GIVE THIS DRAMA A CHANCE AND WATCH IT!

Law genre at its best!
When I finished the first episode, I immediately thought of the similarity between this drama and the variety show ‘Busted’. This drama is basically the drama version and the longer version of Busted in my opinion. So if anyone of you loves that variety show, you definitely need to check this out!

There are a few things that surprised me while watching this drama (Fyi, I didn’t open MDL or even other links about this drama. All I know is that this drama has great ratings and many people loved it. I knew nothing about the storyline and only knew some of the casts that was going to be in it. And thankfully, I didn’t encounter that much spoilers on social media about this drama. So in conclusion, I had a little to no information about this drama before watching it.):

1. The one that surprises me most: The casts
Please don’t open MDL before watching this, because it’ll ruin the surprise (and a plot twist in some later episodes). I’m telling you this here to warn you all about the brilliant plot twist that left me speechless when I watched the episode.

2. The storyline
I’ve never expected this drama to be fully about murder mystery. Don’t get me wrong, I’m basically in love with anything about murder mysteries, but this drama just brought it to a whole new level. This drama doesn’t show you the perfect protagonist that could solve all the hidden mysteries flawlessly, or that one protagonist who always works alone and doesn’t need any help from others, but instead it shows you how the the main protagonist (Professor Yang Jong Hoon) really needs the help from his fellow professor (Professor Kim Eun Suk), his silly lawyer (Park Geun Tae), the funny photocopy guy (Sung Dong Il) and most importantly all his students (Kang Sol A, Kang Sol B, Han Jun Hwi, Seo Ji Ho, Jeon Ye Seul, Min Bok Gi and Cho Ye Bum). What’s better is how the drama shows you a super dedicated teacher who’s willing to do anything just to help all his students know better about the law. He’s discipline and unpredictable—he doesn’t care about anything else besides stating his point of teaching law to his students.

3. The genre
I expected this drama to be dark and serious, since most law dramas tend to be long and philosophical, and full of theories that doesn’t really stick to my head that long, but this drama managed to bring some good comedies in between the scenes—it was short, but it was rewarding. The first few episodes was pretty hard to watch actually, the dialogue were full of theories and all the actors were basically rapping all those theories out. But as you go on, this drama explained all those difficult theories by applying them to real cases where the viewers could understand the meaning of those theories easier. That’s what I love about this drama, and this is what differs them with other law dramas.

I’m a sucker for friendship dramas. This drama doesn’t really focus on the friendship, but the way all the characters team up to defend one another is just crazy great! Sol B’s character development was just executed perfectly, and she officially becomes one of my favorite characters here in this drama. This drama teaches you to be fair and just, and they teaches you (especially those who work/will work for the law) to not be affected emotionally while dealing with the law. Don’t let your emotions affect your decisions. This drama shows you the law from another perspective, and it was very exciting to watch!

The reason why I couldn’t give this drama an excellent score is because some of the scenes couldn’t really get my attention. I always loved the scenes where Sol A, Jun Hwi, Sol B, Ji Ho, Ye Seul, Bok Gi, Ye Bum is together, and all the scenes involving them coming up with a great plan, but the scenes with Ko Hyeong Su and the flashbacks with Seo Byeong Ju is rather boring for me. Nonetheless, the court scenes and the friendship scenes were super duper great! Great casting, great story and the cinematography was also spot-on! Overall, a 9.5/10 for me! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I had originally showed the teaser of this drama to my parents to get them to watch it, but they were completely uninterested. It was only after a series of failed attempts at other dramas did they finally agree to give it a try. I would say that they liked aspects of it, but they were also fine missing large chunks of the drama which my sister and I sometimes just watched on our own. My personal agenda in watching this was because I really wanted to watch another Kim Bum drama, and I thought he did a great job in his role! The cast as a whole were really great, and it's also so fun to see their dynamics off-screen as well. The plot line isn't always the most exciting, as things can get a little technical with the law and all, but I did enjoy seeing them in action in the courtroom. There were at times that I thought the writing felt a little all over the place (trying to shove in sub-plots that diverged from the main plot), but everything thankfully ties together well in the end.

A Must Watch LAW Drama
Law school is the perfect mix of thrill, suspense, humor and portrays many cases surrounding laws. It shows how the law isn't perfect but if you make the right use of it, then the law is perfect and you can punish all the evil doings by law.

Plot: I would say, definitely it's well written, from the start till the end, it'll never keep you bored. The writer has well-researched and shown us different shades of law and how well can it be used. Once in a blue moon, we see such courtroom scenes with full interest and powerful dialogues. Not to mention it also has humor, friendship, and family elements in it. It was a total fun ride for me !!

Acting and characters: The actors are just wow, their whole chemistry and teamwork, their dialogues in sync - everything is just perfect. Especially Kim Myung Min as Yang Jong Hoon was just mesmerizing and his on-point dialogue delivery, hilarious reactions always caught you off-guard. There are many characters but the highlight everyone is given high importance, and we get to see them evolving over various struggles and difficulties. All of them stood out, and they'll remain forever in your heart. The whole is cast is just amazing and well-casted.

Others: The drama is fast-paced, it slows down but only when it's required. There are many jaw-dropping scenes, Understand this is not a thriller but more of law based drama, so you get to see a totally different genre of drama. The ost 'we all' is till on my mind right now, the bgm was really good.

Cons: Maybe the ending felt a little bit rushed, not too much but yeah all questions were answered and all loose ends tied together. The major one you may find it confusing but don't drop, it'll get cleared at the end, the more you go, the more you'll get familiarized with the drama style and characters.

Overall, I really enjoyed it from the beginning till the end, it's perfect for binge-watch cause it'll give you anxiety too lol. So it's totally worth a try, do watch this !!

The Perfect Law Drama!
Out of the many dramas i've watched, this definitely beats the rest and is one of my fav ones. Almost everything about the drama was perfect. The thrill, the suspense, this drama made me feel a whole lot of emotions and im here for it!

The actors have done a tremendous job in playing their roles. I could feel the chemistry between all of them. My favourite pair would have to be Kang Sol A and Yangcrates. With the past that they had, it's amazing how he's always guiding her but he makes it seem as though he isn't. I love Professor Yang's role so so much and his brain god i wonder what does one have to do to have a brain like his. Everyone in this drama played an important role even if they weren't the main character and thats also one of the reasons why I love this drama. Every little thing that happens, is for a reason, it's connected.

The student-professor dynamics! Loved it! I felt as if Professor Kim was more of a mother figure to her students rather than a professor. On the other hand, Yangcrates was as professor as a professor could be. He's strict, professional and doesn't hesitate to go harsh on his students because in the end he's doing it for their benefit. He's also very protective of his students and that's always a plus! It just shows how much he cares for them. Well, in his own very way.

As for the production, it was amazing but i have to admit all the flashbacks did kinda get me confused but then again it did help me understand the whole story better and added to the thrill and suspense so i guess its fine. The story plot is amazing! although i'm not a law student, i could still understand what was going on.

The OST! god don't even get me started with this one. This drama's ost will easily be on my mind and i'll for sure remember it for years to come. It's something about the lyrics and the time the ost was played. The lyrics was a direct reflection of what i was feeling. ""Pulling me underrrrr, driving me crazyyyyy"" Yes, Law School definitely drove me crazy. A good kinda crazy :)

This drama is a perfect thrill, suspense with a dash of comedy kinda drama. Kang Sol A is a role everyone would be able to relate to and to see her journey from a young delinquent to an established lawyer was just amazing. This drama covers family, friendship and most importantly portrays the right image of law and justice. Trust me, Law school won't disappoint! Definitely waiting for a season 2!

How to get away with murder meets Chief of Staff
You could divide this drama into two main parts. One part that is a murder mystery in the style of How to get away with murder, and one part that is taking down a politician that is corrupted to the core, which is more of a typical K-drama. The murder mystery part kind of gets more irrelevant as the show goes on as the second part gets more relevant.
The drama also has other plots that are told, though some that are more important and fits more to the main story (Jeon Ye Seul, Seo Ji Ho) and some that feels more like fillers even though it has some relevance (Yoo Seung Jae, Kang Sol B)
So if you are interested in a murder, mystery drama then this is probably not one for you.

I did find some episodes a bit to slow and almost went down to the boring category but it picked itself up straight away and when the show goes for a satisfying moment, it succeeds really well. Not to mention the last scene of the show is so smooth. Great camerawork and everything.

The acting was fine, it does not have bad acting or anything like that in it, but I did have some trouble with Professor Yang in the first episodes, once again the acting is not bad, but there was something about the character I didn't like but that disappeared after a few episodes. I did like that a lot of the support cast (the students) got a lot of screen time and not just there for filling the spots up so to speak but actually got as much shine as the main cast. And THANK GOD for no romance. I'll admit the scenes between Kang Sol A and Han Joon Hwi was pretty cute and I did like their chemistry but I'm happy it didn't got blown into a full romance cause knowing from other K-dramas I've seen, that plot point would've taken over their (at least the female lead) screen time and not the main plot.

Now the music was simply great. I know I'm not the only one that went nuts every time the 'It's pulling me undeeeer, It's driving me craaaaazy' part came on. The whole soundtrack was great and had a lot of choir/church vibes but still fit really well.

So did I like it? Yes, it wasn't great as in one of the best things I've watched, but I've seen a lot worse. Like I said some plot point where better than others but it is an satisfying watch and worth checking out.

DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST LEGAL KDRAMAS OUT THERE!!
STORY: This whole drama is the absolute definition of what they say in other english movies of ""the one that'll leave you on edge"". It really leaves you in the dark trying to think of who the guilty one really is. It really makes you think hard and all over the place. It leaves you thinking who really is telling the truth. With all the evidence going against Prof. Yang, and then him proving those wrong. AISHHH very addicting legal drama FOR SURE.

OST: OMG this has to be one of the best osts out there because, IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!!

You can't tell me you've watched legal dramas before without telling me you've watched Law school first. Definitely watch it. 100/10 masterpiece.

Thankfully NOT How to Get Away With Murder. Hint: It's much better
I don't think this is a criticism. But this drama definitely wasn't 'Stranger' or 'Forest of Secrets' or 'Watcher' where the plot was in the driver's seat and the characters took their lead from the story. There was no nuanced exploration of how small steps and slips into corruption for the greater good lead to dark deeds and dark ends. There was no deft questioning of how the suspect motivations of the Law Professors impacted their students. And, disappointingly (the show flagged this as an issue re Sol B and Joon-Hwi but then ignored it) no questioning of how the insular world of privilege and relationships creates economic and social schisms as demonstrated by the students of Hankuk. But what it did show over and over was how evil, banal though it might be, diminishes us all.

No, this was very much character driven. In that respect, the cast was stellar. I enjoyed how the members of the ensemble cast had their own storylines, which were explored in detail. And I particularly liked the fact that women protagonists got equal screen time and dialogue to their male counterparts. This is, quite often, missing in other dramas. They were fleshed out, well articulated, and fierce. No milk-candy-water misses or candy queens here. BAMF women with personalities and outlooks much like the women I know in my life. A terrific change of pace in representation! After Ye-Seul's story concluded, I felt the drama ran out of steam. However, her story was well handled. I'm grateful that the writer and director carved a space for Ye-Seul to be her own avenger. After forensically examining the gaslighting she experienced, she had control over the narrative and her decisions. The acting was top-notch too! That arc was a hard one to beat: as the remainder of the drama proved in the lead up to Ko's anticlimactic takedown.

Like several other viewers, I find highly entertaining that a drama billed as not romantic ends up giving us electrifying chemistry between Ryy Hye Yeong and Kim Beom. And that too chemistry that would beat out most of the other rom-com duds that have aired this year. I lived for the thrill of their 5 minutes of togetherness per episode! Thank you to all the incredible fanvidders who fed my obsession. I swear their chemistry in a rom-com would be mind blowing ala my faves in CLOY. Anyone have a crackling script for them?

Not Perfect but Better than Most
Professor Yang's ending narration of the law is an imperfect justice. Still, it must be perfect for those who teach and learn it alike, for there's nothing more violent than an unjust law is the ideal ending to an imperfect drama that was better than most. I am sad to see it come to an end. I enjoyed it. I was more than grateful to have Kim Myung Min grace my small screen; he is one of those actors I genuinely appreciate, from his voice to his facial expression and mannerisms. I will miss him and the unique way he approached the role of Professor Yang, who gave his all to his students while demanding the best, wanting his students to know they have it in them to be the best. As Maya Angelou said, if you are always trying to be normal, you will never know how amazing you can be. And how fitting that in the end, he had Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol A by his side.

I liked all the actors, each for their very individual approach to their roles, from Lee Jung Eun as Professor Kim to Lee Soo Kyung as Kang Sol [B], and Lee David as Seo Ji Ho. Go Yoon Jung as Jeon Ye Seul, Hyun Woo as Yoo Seung Jae, and the rest of the wonderfully talented cast who clearly articulated that as much as the choices they each made changed them. It didn't define them except for Sol B, but she is a work in progress. I will, of course, be remiss in not giving a special mention to the fabulous Kim Bum in how he portrayed Han Joon Hwi, who never once let the circumstances around him sway him away from his principles. And much-gained respect to Ryu Hye Young in the role of Kang Sol [A], who, despite all odds, perceivers if not shines in an environment that wasn't set up to help someone with her background succeed.

In its unique way, the drama touched and addressed some aspects of the many dilemmas it brought up very nicely, especially the issues it presented in date rape, sexual assault, physical abuse, corruption, political manipulation, and crime and murder. But at the same time, it was vague in addressing the consequences of the more prevalent issues that plague everyday life, such as bribery, hacking and cheating, plagiarism, eroding principles, and the fragile lines between good and bad -- evil done in the name of good, or evil done in the name of evil, which is worse, isn't it the same in the end. I am not entirely sure the show lived up to its motto of truth and justice only by the law. As someone once said, law and justice are not always the same; justice is an ideal, and law is the tool. I enjoyed it highly recommend it.

It'like nothing else..
I loved the story. Towards the end the plot is a little bit rushed yet given that its tempo fastened after episode 8 I can understand it.
*Truth and justice only by law*
That pretty much sumps up the whole show. There is no easy character. All the back stories were carefully thought about.
Watching their conflicts kept me on edge, and I have to give it to them I couldn't really guess the murderer of Seo Byeong-Ju case. Not even one moment is boring if you could get through the first episodes. Cause...I don't know it wasn't easy to connect to ML Yang Jong-hoo. The first time I watched the drama I gave it up after episode 2. He looked like your stereotypical know-it-all professor but after wacthing the whole show I can say that he stands on no man's land. Not even on law if it is not perfect.

Fyi, if you wonder about any romance there is almost none. Almost, because there were enough hints about Han Jun-hui's crush on Kang Seol-A. What is more important than that is the friendship though. Dynamics of the study group is colored pink for the sake of the show but that's the beauty of the drama. It's dreamy to watch.

Well built, but with an uninteresting villain.
Somehow the legal plots have always attracted me, the construction of its world, its mysteries and entanglements are interesting to see.

The series portrays some little-seen topics in Korean series, at least within the mainstream, including sexual abuse and harassment, manipulation of the media, corruption of the authorities, murder, among others.

I would especially like to talk about how the issue of sexual abuse is approached, from the beginning we see that Jeon Ye Seul and Ko Young Chang maintain an abusive relationship, although as a spectator we realize this, it seems that for the environment in which that the characters exist, these abuse problems are not so clear, until the physical effects of the abuse (blows) are seen. The situation that Ye Seul lives is unfortunately the situation experienced by a large number of women, who under the idea of being ""loved"" endure being in a relationship where they are damaged; when the problem escalates to sexual abuse and manipulation through an explicit video and everything goes to trial, one of the topics discussed is the public scrutiny that her character receives and how the defense thinks to justify the whole situation by a alleged infidelity in their courtship, which speaks very deeply about how society (in this case Korean, but actually appeals to practically all societies) is more willing to judge women and blame them for the problems of abuse that can lead to live in your relationships.

This theme is one of the best explored in the series and Go Yoon Jung's performance is brilliant, the evolution of his character is brilliantly well treated, although we see moments where his character suffers and doubts and makes bad decisions, in the end we see how he overcomes all obstacles, and how he has found his own path both personally and professionally and even how he found the strength to help people who live the same situation that she once lived in their own flesh.

Now speaking of the main theme of the series, it is also very well treated, from the beginning it generates intrigue, and the way in which Yang Jong Hoon, Kim Eun Sook, Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol [A] are involved in the conflict at times does make you doubt their intentions, but as the series progresses and we get to know them better it is impossible not to become fond of them, I think my only complaint in itself is with respect to Ko Hyeong Soo, since this character is the typical bad guy, we don't know so much about him beyond his ambition for power and we never really see an evolution or internal struggle, so it seems to me that he is the least interesting character in the whole series, perhaps I would have enjoyed more than the conflict would have included a ""villain"" with more nuances and with whom the public could feel more connected.

Another of the conflicts I have with the series is Kang Dan, we really don't know much about her and when she returns we don't see her solve her conflicts with her family either, when she is supposed to run away from home and has not maintained contact with them in a long time; which initially seemed to be a conflict for her sister, but afterwards she is given absolutely no explanation and serves more as a “deux-machina” to solve the plot of the series, it is an easy resource to give her a solution in the last episodes.

Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol [A] are the most interesting characters in the series, because the two of them are just innocent students when all the conflict begins and they are involved, many of the things they believed are broken, little by little they even come to doubt the course of the laws, however they never give in to all the bad things that are happening around them, they trust that the only tool they have to fight is the law and they cling to that ideal, their convictions become every stronger, until they truly become top lawyers, following the example of their mentor Yangcrates.

The last topic that I would like to explore is the manipulation of the media, it is well known how important image is when we talk about politics (especially in societies like Korea, where reputation and appearance are more important than achievements) and what some people are able to do to get good comments from them in the media (even if they are not true), I found it very interesting how we see that on the show, the basements with people who dedicate themselves day and night to producing content and comments false in order to harm or benefit one or the other, and how this seems to be so easy to control if you have the appropriate amount of money.

It is possible to combine in a very good way, the fact that most of the characters are university students, so despite being surrounded by a world of corruption, they still have to deal with the normal things of any university: grades, exams, friendships, loves, parents, etc; and within what is possible, it is possible to maintain a certain youthful spirit, especially with characters like Min Bok Gi and Jo Ye Bum, on many occasions, they lighten the emotional load of the series.

The main advantage of Law School are the performances, the entire cast does an incredible job, they are truly committed to their roles and they achieve a good mix between the seriousness of their occupations and the situations that you are living and the normality of being students trying to survive a little longer, especially Kim Bum and Kim Myung Min did a spectacular job, they felt so comfortable in their roles, and despite using a lot of legal terminology the show does a good job of explaining well the necessary points to understand what happens in court and in his studies.

The series, in its quality, does not disappoint in any aspect, the direction, the photography, the script, the montage are very well done and create a show with a more compelling atmosphere.

Only good for it's cast?
When starting a new drama I usually go in expecting nothing because the drama ends up being more impressive without expectations and gives me a lot to drool over. But this drama gave me nothing. The twists were expected, the storyline was boring and the characters were less than likable, a big problem because there are so many. It tries to do way more than what it has time for. Just barely exploring the plot points it brings up. Details are just flat out told to viewers via character dialogue/flashbacks (there are so many flashbacks). I wanna see some action not storylines handfed to me. I don't know who the director is but I would avoid future dramas shot by this person seeing how bad and bland the shots were. At times the camera cuts to this first person shaky frame which is so unflattering.

As for acting, I think everybody did their best with what was given to them. Though, I did find Kang Sol A's acting way over the top. No show stealers here though. There's a lot of screaming (thank you old office man who has zero significance to the plot), this show seems to think loud equals funny or emotional. You're not delivering anything, just hurting my ears. I can't handle the morally righteousness of the main characters. The one character that strays from that; Sungjae is given the bare minimum. There being so many characters is the downfall of this show. You can't establish an emotional connection with them because of the lack of deep diving characters are supposed to be given. So at the end I don't care about who gets to be happy, I just want the show to be over.

As for music, there are only 3 songs here. It gets really old really fast. It's annoying that the songs come on and basically tell you hey this scene is supposed to be emotional, hey this scene is supposed to be suspenseful, and oh hey look the characters are studying. It's annoying when the emotional music comes on and you're not even moved by the scene. You're stuck there cringing because what the characters said wasn't deep at all and here plays th-We are We are Where are we? We are We are.

With all that said, I don't like this drama, I feel like I wasted my time and was blinded by an all star cast. I would still recommend you watch it, it might be your cup of lukewarm tea. But there are way better dramas out there, enjoy watching.

It'll keep you on the edge of your seat
I didn't really have high expectations coming into this drama because it's not the type of genre that I usually watch. To be honest, the first few episodes were quite slow and it was a little difficult to get through. However, the drama really started to pick up speed and became much more interesting towards the end.

Story:
The story was written really well and was filled with plot twists and unexpected turns. However, I would have liked to know what happened with Jin Hyung Woo at the end.

Acting:
The acting throughout the drama was excellent. The characters were cast really well, especially for Professor Yang, I really enjoyed his acting throughout the drama. The other characters were great as well and the acting was quite natural.

Overall:
It was a great and very enjoyable drama. It definitely gets better towards the end, so don't give up in the beginning!

THE BEST LEGAL DRAMA EVER!
Legal dramas are a hit or miss, usually. It caters to a specific type of audience and definitely not everyone’s cup of tea. You would seldom hear someone say, “Let’s watch a legal drama for healing or to past time.” It requires your full attention, and it can’t be played in the background while you’re doing another task. That’s why when a legal drama receives so much attention and praise, you know it’s ~that~ good. And yes, long story short, Law School is worth checking out!
Yang Jong-Hoon (Kim Myung-Min) is a former prosecutor. He is now a professor at a prestigious law school. He is straightforward and tends to unleash biting remarks. Students don’t like him because of this, but Yang Jong-Hoon does not care what his students think of him. Yang Jong-Hoon is focused on cultivating personnel for the law field, members who will be able to contribute meaningfully. Professor Kim Eun-Sook (Lee Jung-Eun) is his only colleague that he can speak openly.
Kang Sol (Ryoo Hye-Young) and Han Joon-Hwi (Kim Beom) are first-year law school students. Kang Sol barely got into law school. She comes from poor family background. At school, she is surrounded by students who are smart and come from wealthy backgrounds. She feels insecure and even shameful due to her background. Kang Sol slowly learns about the true legal profession. Han Joon-Hwi is at the top among first-year law school students. He is an attractive young man with leadership qualities, but he has a secret.

I thought they would take the episodic route of taking case studies per week, but they did not. Instead, they focused on the main characters’ background stories, incorporate them into the main premise, and built a solid story from there. It’s also unexpected for me to ship a non-OTP this much that I am shaken.
Murders and corruption aside, the drama is actually a slice-of-life drama about the life of law students. Everyone in the freshmen squad is relatable in terms of how they handle their academics. Of course, Kang Sol A (Ryu Hye-young) leads them as the most kindred spirit in the study group. She struggles in both finances and academics – but she never gives up. She barely passes her exams, yet she pulls through with the help of her reliable friends. Aside from her good nature, Sol A is also a filial daughter and sister. She genuinely cares for her family without hesitation.

Anyway, as a character, Joon-hwi had so much depth, and Kim Bum portrayed him convincingly. He was an orphaned boy whose beloved uncle got killed by an unknown murderer. He was even one of the prime suspects but he managed to prove himself innocent while still attending his classes. Whew! Joon-hwi didn’t even have the time to grieve in silence because he was too busy balancing his academics and solving his uncle’s untimely death. I’d like to think that this was also why SolHwi never materialized because it’s just too much for a student to handle these overwhelming emotions all at once. Even though there was no legit confirmation of SolHwi, deep in my heart, I know that Prosecutor Han and Lawyer Kang was the endgame.

My favorite Yangcrates moment was when he was able to break Ye-seul’s wall by effectively questioning her in the witness stand – law school style. Ye-seul was deeply hurt and in a state of denial and shock. She couldn’t even identify the difference between love and abuse, but Prof. Yang was able to shake her and let her realize what she’s fighting for and whom she’s fighting against.

To be honest, the drama felt dragging halfway and the revelation of Lee Man-ho (Jo Jae-ryong) as the real killer with Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su (Jung Won-joong) as the main bad guy were underwhelming. Or maybe because I expected this to be an over-the-top whodunit series when in fact, it’s just a simple story with complex characters. What do you think?

Never regret my decision to watch this drama since it strated :))
Actually i didnt knew anything about this drama, i was too busy hyping another dramas back then and didnt really pay attention to the upcoming drama.
When i ran out of ongoing dramas, i found this on my netflix's dashboard and it took my attention.

i watched this drama without putting any expectation!! after watching the 1st episode im VERY confused ""whats this drama about??"" ""wtf???"" ""i dont understand law"" the confusion continued until the 4th episode😂 (tmi, i took notes until the 6/7 episode so i didnt missed anything😂😂) AFTER THE CONFUSION i finally understand whats going on and IT MAKES ME VERY EXCITED TO CONTINUE!!! And here i am, have completed the all 16 episodes :)))

The main story itself was not quite complicated at first, but once it revealed one by one ITS REALLY COMPLEX. One plus point for this drama, it teaches us a lot of moral value. I suggest you guys to give this drama a try. the cast are also good playing its role!! The story wont disappoint you and the bgm is just perfectly fit for the drama🤙🏼🤙🏼

Law school's cinematographer is really good!
Okay so the story is a bit unrealistic because of some scenes but it was interesting.
The cinematography is really good. I mean I started watching this drama for ryu he young, but I finished this drama for the cinematographer.
The story is interesting and even the acting is good but for me the cinematography was the bestttt!
The osts are great as they match the theme of this drama.
The chemistry between the leads is so good that I've watched some of the compilations on YouTube.
Well I gave it a low re-watch value because this is a thriller and it becomes boring if you already know who did it.

I started the drama on a whim because I was bored and may or may not have been persuaded to watch it for Kim Bum (hehe). The drama was interesting from the get go with the whole concept of a murder taking place within a law school (kind of juxtapose-y irony which is cool), but the timelines were definitely confusing to keep up with initially and the way they talked about law seemed a bit advanced for people out of the field to grasp (had to rewind and replay). However, it got better with time and as the show progressed, I began to look forward to Wednesdays & Thursdays as the plot became more gripping. The law school squad became very endearing, feeling like my own friends as we get insights into their backgrounds and stories, become personally involved in the murder case and with the concept of law. Do not expect the drama to be thrilling in the way the murder case is explored because the show focuses more on how law can be used to reach the truth and ensure justice rather than giving goosebumps in a thrill-laced plot. Also, do NOT expect romance especially if you have watched edits on YouTube and that brought you here lol...it does have its cute moments but the focus is more on friendship. It's a relatively good watch and you will be compelled to binge so I would definitely recommend this show!

my favorite kdrama so far!
I personally really love mystery and crime dramas and this one is WORTH watching. Every mystery was solved so it leaves you with no questions and big misunderstandings. It's also really funny , which makes it enjoyable to watch. I especially loved the OST (that's actually what made me watch this drama). All of the main characters have a nice character development which is also really important. I even cried at the end even tho it was a happy ending. Anyways give it a try and I'm sure you won't regret it!!

OMG MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE DRAMA
Law School is probably my favourite K-drama of 2021. Even as a person who knows nothing about law, I found it very interesting. Every single character and case was connected in some way or the other and this made the drama have a more continuous storyline unlike some other dramas based on law. We saw the hardships law students face during their time in law school. The cast did an amazing job in portraying their characters. The main leads had immense chemistry and so did the supporting cast. The episodes always ended on a cliff-hanger and that made the viewers thrilled and excited to watch the next episodes. The acting and production of the drama was so good that I still think such a school exists somewhere in South Korea. My favourite character in the drama was Kim Eui Sook played by Lee Jong Eun. There were times where I wondered if she was one of the main leads. That's because her character didn't have much impact in the first few episodes. But after episode 10, it all started coming together. She was working behind the scenes but her hard work payed off in the end. Overall, Law School is a drama I enjoyed a lot. I'm sure I will find the cases interesting even if I watch the drama again.

If you like suspense and mystery this is the drama for you
I watched this while it was still airing and im very glad i did.
It is a very fun watch the will leave you at the edge of your seat, it has a cast of very likable characters that you will enjoy seeing. It has a lot of lessons of law, politics and corruption, winch the story handled well for the most part.
It is not a perfect story, the ending seemed rushed and a few story lines just fizzled out or never got completed. at the beginning it has a very complex way of seeing the world and how the law works and how corruption is inescapable, but at the end everything just got resolved in a fairly simplistic way.
But overall i really enjoyed watching this show and it made me feel interested in law, so i recommend you give it a watch :D

Courtroom Drama can't get better than this
Law School laid a strong foundation from the very beginning with twists and turns, and never once distracted itself from the intense court sessions in proving who's guilty and who's not.

The performance of overall cast was terrific, especially of Myung Min as Prof. Yang along with Kim Mun as Han Joo Hwi and Hye Young Ryu as Kang Sol A. The screenplay was tight and the execution of the story was very effective. Adding a cherry on top of the cake, the OST was brilliant reaching straight to my heart.

Law School displayed a great execution of laws that prevail in South Korea and the way they are executed in a very effective manner, leaving the audience with nothing but awe for its entire premise altogether. This is definitely an addition to my Top 10 dramas of this year.


My Rating : 9.5/10

The plot is really interesting but...
This shows is one of the few shows that I enjoyed vary much and I would definitely recommend it to others. This show can be a great opening for those of you that havent watched kdramas before. I have watched many kdramas so far and Im a strict person but this show really surprised me. My expectations are sky high now but there’s only one little thing that pissed me off towards the ending: the “identical twin” thing. I just find it overmwhelming. To be honest many of the recent kdramas had atleast one pair of identical twins. Its good when you see this kind of thing every now and again but too much of it is just not good. So of I were the director, I would definitely delete it. The casting and the acting was so good. Music really surprised me it was better than other kdaramas Ive seen.

Amazing
I am not going to lie, I was debating whether to start it or not because many law dramas are kind of fictional. I was so wrong for even thinking about not starting. This was mindblowing! I was immersed from episode 3 with not only the story but every character and their background. This story perfectly narrates the potholes when it comes to law and how justice may seem achievable but it is far from easy. I love the bond between the characters where it doesn't get toxic but instead strengthens as time goes. I recommend this a hundred times so please start watching... also happy ending:)

umm... I kinda want to study law now?
Guys it was really really good. I just finished watching and like I can't even express it right now.

I will organize the positives and negatives into points and then go into more detail.

Positives:
- the story is bomb
- evidence isn't always ""by chance""
- the characters are likeable
- you can emphasize with the characters
- the drama is almost separated into sections
- it is sassy
- it makes you feel smart
- the music is great
- humour and seriousness at the right times
- somewhat realistic
- not cheesy
- you might learn something about the law (Korean law)
- good actors/casting
- it makes you want to study law

Ok so the story is very good. If you've watched ""Class of Lies"" it kind of reminded me of that, but in ""Class of Lies"" a lot of the evidence was found by chance. In this drama the teachers and students actually looked into the cases and proved a lot of evidence instead. That I liked, because the students kind of got better at doing it as the drama continued and there was some character development in that department. On top of that, the drama is based off/the main characters are the members of the study group. Everyone in the study group is quite different from the other, which makes it interesting to watch them together.
It's also easier to develop a favourite character, which personally, I think is very important. While watching the drama, it might not seem obvious, but the drama had sections for a couple of the study group's members. You'll see what I mean, but during those sections, you learn a lot about one certain character.

Now, the contents of the drama is also great. It has the right amount of sass, humour, seriousness, cuteness and sadness. Of course since it is a drama about law, it is mostly serious with hints of the other components. An important thing to note is that it was rather realistic. Occasionally I will catch a drama that is serious, but not really realistic. I would say that this drama is pretty realistic because all the evidence and clues make sense, although it'd be quite rare for what happened in this drama to happen in real life. To add on, the music is perfect. There aren't many lyrics, but when there are they're very simple. I liked that factor because I always picture a very academic place to be minimalistic. They also use simple things like heaving breathing as background music. Despite the music being simple, it is always freaking stuck in my head and I literally repeat them to myself all the time.

A couple bonuses is that you might learn something about the law. I believe that the staff and cast did their part of the research on Korean law. I think that the legal lines and some of the cases are real, but don't quote me on that. I loved the casting and I thought that everyone was fit to the role they were given. A random thing is that it might make you interested/want to study law. Ngl it low-key happened to me....

Negatives:
- they talk fast (maybe I'm just slow at reading)
- you have to remember a lot of names/law terminology to minimize confusion
- easy to get lost
- a lot to process

Ok not many negatives, I promise it won't be that long lmao. So, I thought that they talked fast and I had to go back to read the subtitles. It is a negative, but I understand because I would imagine that lawyers speak faster. This also might just be that I'm a slow reader. Another thing is that there's a lot of people's names to remember. I would suggest to know them by heart because their relationship to one another could get complicated and everything will be easier once you match the names to the faces. However, it is not something I would change because then it would affect the complexity of the case. It was just a little hassle that's all. Now, other factors when watching a rather complicated drama like ""Law School"", is that it is also much easier to get lost and there's a lot of information to process. So maybe clear your mind a little bit before starting and pace the episodes.

Amazing Acting and Perfect Plot
I hope that this drama will be valued by many, because it is an example of perfect team work of all the crew.

The plot is well though through and always leaves you wondering what's coming next. I haven't seen such a tense and dramatic story for quite a while. I just couldn't stop myself from starting the next episode right after finishing the previous one. And in the end, though the ending was balanced and good, I wished for more. The story is well written, all main characters have their own histories, and it is put in such a way that you don't get bored, but somehow being drawn in their lives until the point when you sympathise with each of them.

The main theme is demanding, but also so understandable to anyone. That helplessness that you feel, when someone with more power, money, connections gets the best in life and tramples over less fortunate ones. Through the prism of personal tragedies of the main heroes it didn't seem pompous or artificial, but very human and heart-breaking sometimes.

The cast is awesome. Kim Bum proved once again his talents, and the chemistry they have with Ryu Hye Young is superb. I so wished to see more hints that they stay together in the end, but the slight mist of unspoken words didn't make it less good. There is enough cute scenes, in which you see the real emotions and can guess all the rest. Anyway this romantic tint was a perfect find, adding even more human touch to the show. I often miss this in investigative dramas. What is also important each character undergoes changes, but never steps out from the character itself. I saw many shows, where main character who in the beginning was a certain type suddenly changes into something else, when his deeds and behaviour become inconsistent as if it is a completely different human being. Good script in this drama and awesome acting never gives you this kind of dissapointment.

Music is very good. I've added a few new songs to my playlists. Every song is in its place highlighting the atmosphere and so memorable, that I know if I hear it anywhere else the scenes from the show will float before my eyes.

I recommend the show to all who like tense mind-twisting mysteries, but it would be also good for those who like criminal shows focused on human stories, which are being brough before the law.

Story/Plot: At first, I was super confused and lost. All these back and forth throwback scenes made me puzzled but I continued it anyway. As the story progresses, I gradually understood every bit of it and was able to get interested. I think it was a nice crime drama coupled with introduction to some laws (which made it interesting for me because I'm taking law subjects, though ofc I know we have different provisions here). As I get to understand, I was intrigued and was able to empathize with the characters.

Characters: Now this one is the perfect choice for the drama. Ryu Hye Young as Sol A nailed her role. She was so cute, funny, and relatable. Han Joon Hwi also is so smart that it makes me like him more lmao. The students were funny together and they had good chemistry. The profs also, specially Prof Yang. I admired their knowledge of the law (because it's rare to actually see people sooo knowledgeable of the law in real life) so they were cool. I just wished we get more Joon Hwi x Sol A moments but then, this is a crime drama so what do I expect lol. I just think they were cute togetherr, we only got crumbs ㅋㅋ

OSTs: They were also good, perfect, and catchy.

Overall thoughts: I wish the cast get together in another drama. I'd love to see them work in another genre. I didn't give it a perfect rate because at some points I was confused and some things were just so-so but overall, I like this drama.

Law School = one of 2021's best K-drama!
Story:
The plot is pretty good with a good amount of plot twists and the individual study squad's stories/cases were fairly interesting. There were moments when I was genuinely pleasantly surprised, but there were also moments where I can already predict what will happen. The characters were all well written. I loved Kang sol A, Kang Sol B and Han Joon Hwi. I personally love their attitude, dedication and determination towards their goals and towards their passion for law. It can be seen through their stories.

Acting/cast:
I love the cast's acting a lot. They bring out their character's emotions really well, and allowed the audience to feel it.

Music:
The OST is fitting for this drama. It does give a sense of suspense.

Rewatch value:
Personally, I would rewatch this for certain scenes!

Overall:
It is a good law drama which would allow you to have a look at what law students do in law school. I learnt a lot about law in just 16 episodes. I would recommend everyone to give a try, it was worth my time.

A must watch
It's definitely a 100.
The story begins with a murder mystery and entangles with the emotions of the law school students. Every episode is a new turn, a new twist. You can never get bored. You just keep asking for more. It has all the elements of a perfect drama- comedy, friendship, romance, mystery, murder, fight, psychological war - all right in the law school. Every character is new and refreshing with their own dark past. Slowly, as the story untangles, everything falls into place. Amidst all this, the friendship/romance between Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol A gives us a quick getaway from all the seriousness and adds the element of a typical k-drama.
I really like the music and I love the cast. Especially Kim Beom ♡. I don't usually watch dramas again but this is definitely worth it.

Intriguing and fun to watch, kept me guesing throuhout the drama!
Law School was intriguing and fun to watch, it had me guessing throughout the drama! This is a story about a law school the teachers and the students. They are doing a mock trial and someone is murdered. The police and prosecutor arrest the one teacher who used to be a prosecutor, and the story begins there for trying to prove the teacher is innocent and trying to figure out who murdered this person. In most of the episodes they would suspect someone else, while still trying to prove the teachers innocent then we would see what that person was doing and why they could be a suspect and how to prove that it wasn't them either. I liked how it would have flashbacks of the scenes or something that happened prior, but then come to the present to figure it out. There were a lot of twist and turns by suspecting so many different people and trying to unravel the puzzle. I enjoyed almost all of the characters except the really bad ones. Some parts of it had me smiling at the antics of Sol A (there are two Sol in the class so one is Sol A and the other Sol B). Sol A the things she did and how she acted kept me rooting for her! I also enjoyed all of them in the study group who most of them tried to help the others out!

The only thing that could of put a damper on the end was two trials were going on for two of the characters for things they had done and we don't know the outcome of those trials. I would love to have another season were we find out, but not knowing how those trials turned out doesn't take away from the ending or the story.

Amazing Plot+Cast+Music
Storyline: The journey throughout the 16 episodes was filled with twist and turns, cliffhangers and a whole load of suspense making the viewers hooked onto the next episode.

Cast: AMAZING. The protagonists, the villains, the supporting characters, all did a wonderful job potraying their characters. The main leads made you feel relatable, the villain's acting really made you hate the character, and the acting felt very natural.

OSTs: THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAD TO DESPERATELY WAIT TILL THE DRAMA WAS OVER TO GET THE OST SAYS ENOUGH. One of the most unique and catching OST.

In a nutshell, a drama worth watching if you like suspense, law, crimes and a lil bit of humour and friendship.

Tried to be a little too clever
Not a bad watch overall, but it got quite confusing at times, in terms of what was role play and the real thing.
Some interesting characters, the females weren't just eye candy and reliant on the guys, but intelligent and outspoken in their own rights. I particularly liked Kang Sol's personality, as coming from a poorer background gave her a totally different personality and perspective to her peers.
Character Joon Hwi was suited to Kim Bum's poker face, when he was up against it and his cheeky, arrogant side, when messing with people.
It is a drama and I didn't feel they were going for realism. There were some light moments in an otherwise 'whodunnit' classic format.
I didn't dislike it and thought the cast were good, but felt it got a bit convoluted and I lost concentration and interest at those times, as some aspects felt laboured.
The usual jealousy, pushy parents, cover ups by the wealthy and abuse of the poor are all in the plot.
Not one I'd watch again, but not disappointed I chose it either.

What are you waiting to start this masterpiece?
Warning: This drama has a heavy plot that may contains: Psychological Abuse and Violence. If you are sensitive, I believe some parts of this story may be difficult to watch.

Starting with ""Story"": The plot of Law School (being sincere) brings nothing new to the table. But what is different and makes this drama so special it's the way it was writted. The writer did a good job! Seeing - in a spam of 16 episodes - all the characters having their development, as well as their back story it was so nice to watch.

Acting/Cast: Wow! Knowing that this drama has nothing that we never saw before may makes you feel insecure to watch, but the cast will make you get immersed in history. In their own ways, all of them (even the antagonists) are so charismatic. The lenght of the episodes are approximately 1h05m... but seeing the great acting of the cast makes the time fly... it's incredible.

Music: I can resume the OSTs from this drama in one phrase: ""quantity is not quality"". Law School have two OSTs (and some different versions of these two) and they are incredible powerful. Just these two songs were perfectly enough to cover up the different feelings of the episodes and they do not fail in making you get into the mood, they are so addicting. It was an intelligent way of making this drama unforggetable.

Rewatch Value: Since the story of Yeseul felt so heavy for me to watch (but it was super necessary not only to the plot but for giving confidence to women who are in the same situation to report these kind of abuse)... i gave 7.5 to the rewatch value (but i think it depends on you and what you think).

(i will miss the study club so much :()

I hope that they can make more Law school style kdrama
well it was a k drama full of potentials, i was hoping to see more trials and more school life of a law student not just focusing on one problem, i thought that each episode or 2 there will be a new case, new mystery, so for me this show is too slow they could have more stories to it.
The story was good some episode were exiting, some events were too obvious to tell, so i think a 7/10 is fair.
As for the cast i didn't like the act of our two protagonist, the teachers were good, the support actors were good, i specially like Jeon Ye Seul (Go Yoon Jung) acting she show us her emotions and made us feel her pain.
i recommend watching this drama it is good if you want to have an idea about law schools and the law.

BEST OF THE BEST
I really didn´t expect too much from this drama but it was AMAZING, the acting, the history, the progress. I really liked this drama, kinda wish that Kang Sol A and Joon-hwi had shown a little bit more of their relationship, just cuz I'm a fan, but it was soo good even without it. I'm expecting so much to have an S2 (which I don't rlly think that is going to happen) it would be so amazing, it literally was so good that I became a FAN. Everyone should watch it***

GREAT! BEST! AWESOME!

Can't get enough of watching it once so I watch it twice. I can say that LAW SCHOOL is one of the BEST Korean drama and legal drama of all time. This is the very first time I write a review on a TV shows because I find it worthy of my review. It's quite confusing at first because of the law jargons, but if you give attention to it you will be hooked and keep asking for more because every episode gets better and leave a hanging and intense ending. I think all questions and cases from the start to end has been solved but they don't show it on detailed because they think of it unnecessary and can make the series more complex. And it is also a nature of Korean drama that they end the drama hanging. So, it's just perfect for me! The storyline was quite amazing and mind-blowing because you can't guess what will happen next. All actors did a great job in portraying their roles. Kim Bum's acting is so lit! His so charming and natural. Of course the OST is also amazing because it fits well to the mood of the drama, kudos to the music team it give chills and goosebumps to the drama. Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol A's chemistry? Just perfect! Korean drama cliche? LAW SCHOOL doesn't have it! It is more on ""new side of Korean drama"". This drama did a great job in giving and showing the viewers knowledge on law and justice. Another is, it gives a lesson to every student especially college students that no matter how you struggle in your course, you even think on quiting and giving up because you think you are not capable to it, don't lose hope. Even though many people are dragging you down, there are also people who are willing to be on your side and help you until you succeed. Kudos to the whole law school team! A job well done! I am not asking for SEASON 2 because season 1 is just perfect for me, but if there is another season I will be rooting for it. I highly recommend this exceptional Korean drama! If you haven't watch it, you're missing a great masterpiece!

Worth Watching
I really enjoyed this drama and I mean i REALLY enjoyed this drama. I felt emotionally attached to the students and it felt like they were my classmates. They’re unique and lovable and you can’t help but to root for them. Professor Yang and Professor Kim are teachers that people should have. You learn a lot about the legal system and its flaws. The show does a phenomenal job in showing that the law is not always right or just. Honestly I just recommend it. 10/10 for me I wouldn’t change a thing.

Advanced law drama genre
if you love law dramas you will definitely like this one i'm not a big fan of such genre although i watch them just because of the cast. the first two episodes was quite confusing for me but then it start to be interesting but i had hard time to understand all the law terminologies since it was pretty advanced this what made me loose interest with this drama eventually and after when the killer was reviled i was so disappointed because from the beginning he was the evil guy and the one that was very suspicious i wished the killer was someone unexpected.
one thing i loved is kim bum acting because his performance in his previous drama ( the tale of nine tailed) wasn't that good but he surprised me in this one also the university vibes and the studying group made me miss going to university.

I rate shows depending on how they made me feel at the end
the story was actually good i like what was about and i wanted to see some thriller kinda shows and more mystery but i felt as if they tried sooo hard to add things to make it look soo mysterious and deep when the story was pretty uninspired and kinda average. they definitely failed in transfering the emotions when i finished the show i felt nothing i zoned out in most of the ep , the cast and the quality obviously carried the show but the story was blant i enjoyed watching the ep where they talked about violence and when the student are in court. in the end its an okeey show very predictable and left me with no impact or a need to watch it again it was blant and slow i wouldn't recommended it but i'll definitely say just try the first ep atleast cus as i said its not that bad so you might like it

Not perfect but very entertaining
This is my first review ever; I really wanted to share my honest views on this series to help others who are on the fence about watching. This show was very entertaining from the first episode! The cast is what caught my eye at first. Each member felt comfortable with one another and it felt like actual dialogues you would have with your friends (of course if it involved law most of the time). The small details in the beginning episodes that give out clues to future episodes were really appreciated especially since I was able to rewatch the beginning episodes and notice things that I may have missed or forgotten. The beginning episodes were confusing at times because of the constant time skips, however, it was manageable to look past once you got further into each episode. The drama by far wasn’t the most shocking however each cliffhanger left me anxiously waiting for Wednesday and Thursday. I really appreciate how each character whether main or support had their own storyline/reason for attending the school and the series didn't focus solely on the main characters. Also since the cast had wonderful chemistry together, specifically Ryu Hye-young and Kim Bum, the scenes they were in together acted as a grey area where it was kinda up to the audience to see the relationship as a close friendship or even the beginnings of romance. All in All, I feel like this drama is something worth checking out whenever you’re free!

An amazing kdrama
It was an amazing show! I really enjoyed the plot twists. There were many times I could not predict what was going to happen next so it kept me on the edge on my seat, The first few episodes were really confusing for me though since they kept jumping between the past and the present and sometimes I didn't knew what was actually happening haha. After those time skips become less frequent it gets really good though.
The actors were really great, there was some action, tension, some comedy here and there and some scenes broke my heart. The chemistry between some characters were really good and I wish there was more romance because of that lol but even without it the show was really enjoyable.

I totally recommend this if you're into legal dramas!

Lost Steam Towards the End
Law School game out of the gates like a prize winning horse that nobody could catch. It was fast paced, witty, interesting, and mysterious. In a word.. THRILLING. Then somewhere around episode 12 it started losing it's way and failed to cross the finish line. Set in a prestigious law school and Korean court this drama gives us and the students of Hankuk University Law School some classroom and practical lessons in Korean civic and criminal law.

It just so happens that all the students that have past trauma caused by 1 man (whether they know it or not) are all in the same classes and taught by 2 of the professors who also have trauma. Ok that's farfetched, but you go with it because it's fun. Every thing is fine and dandy until you realize the drama has no intentions on addressing some points they brought out earlier in the show. One student has a major emotional reaction to a visitor to their class in episode 1 or 2. I spent the next 14-15 episodes waiting to find out why. The drama is over. I'm still waiting. I'd like to say the writing was great, but nah. Only one person is credited with writing, but it seems like 2. The writing is stilted and disjointed. The production is very good with great sets and camera work.

The cast is a good one. I think most of their talents were underused. I wonder how they talked Woo Hyun into taking his role, but I'm glad he did. This is my first time seeing Kim Bum since he finished his military service. I feel like his talent was underutilized. The obvious attraction between his Han Joon Hwi and Ryu Hye Yong's Min Sol-A was left smoldering on the ground. I enjoyed the entire cast. They were very good. Moreover, I liked their characters and would have liked to know what paths all the students took at the end.

The theme song was driving me ah crazy. I couldn't stand it. I would have loved it had the singer not sang ""it's driving me ah crazy."" Honestly, I know where the song writer got it from. It's misappropriation of the African American vernacular. That in and of itself ticked me off. So, yeah, didn't like the theme and I don't recall any other music. I'm not a rewatcher. Very few dramas get me to take a 2nd look. This will not be one of those dramas. Rewatch value is honestly 0.

For me Law School started fantastically. I love it when I get to learn something about another culture and how their law and politics work. I really love it when I don't have to find my entertainment around an utterly unnecessary and pointless romance. High 5 for Law School!! Had it not started to rush leaving questions unanswered, it easily would have gotten a 9-10 from me.

""Truth and Justice Only by Law""
What an amazing legal and law drama !! If you enjoy shows like ""How to Get Away With Murder,"" then you will sure love ""Law School""

Story:
While I enjoyed the drama, the progression of the show lacked here and there. Some episodes were absolutely mind blowing and engaging, while others were too slow and all over the place. However, I really enjoyed how they introduced all the characters/members from the squad and how each had a type of role in the different trials that took place. In addition, I really enjoyed how they also focused on other issues regarding the law and apply it to this show, for many of these cases are events that have potentially happened in real life. The realistic approach it provided about law students and their struggles in law school steps away from the romanization of law school which I really liked, because many shows tend to romanticize difficult years in one's life. The student-teacher relationship was one of my favorites, for Prof. Yang would do anything to not only prove innocence of his students, but help them grow as future law professions. Along with how the students would also go the extra mile to help prove Prof. Yang's innocence when many didn't believe him.

Acting/Cast:
The casting for this drama was absolutely amazing !! They were able to get well known names such as Kim Beom, Lee Jun-eun, Ryu Hye-young, Lee David, and more to be casted. Everyone in this cast were phenomenal and their acting skills really showed and proved the diversity in the acting skills. I have grown a larger love for Ryu Hye-young and I hope to see her in future projects :)

Music:
You cannot tell me the intro goes so hard. I think that is one of the most iconic K-drama intros ever. ""It's pulling me underrrr. It's driving me crazyyyy""

Overall:
I would definitely recommend this drama for those who enjoy slow burn dramas with crime and law in it. It gives more of a realistic portrayal on how law schools work and the reality of trials and cases.

""Law School"" squad = best squad <3

Sweet, funny, slightly infuriating at times but deffenetly fun to watch
This dramas is pretty interesting combining some important issues with some sweet, sweet corruption, a dash of murder and allot of wonderful friendship, no romance but I think I may have gotten the urge to ship...

I enjoyed the pace, the story, the characters development as well as the pussel. Some characters annoyed me at first but grew on me. I also liked how complex they made some of the villains almost making me forget their really bad deeds (only almost) as well as showing how one bad choice easily can ruin ones life... + leads to another and then another and before you know it you are intangeled in a big ball of yarn/lies.

Another thing I like about this is the importance of motive as well as pushing people to look beyond what is in front of them who had the most to gain in this situation.

Beeing a big fan of twist and turns I'd say this drama scored a 7,5 on twists. Some twists where more predictable than others, while a few turns came as a suprise, some diversons where a bit too obvious resulting in the reduction of half a point from the final score, the other half for annoying character and a bit unsatisfactory ending. While the complexity of issues added quite points to my final score that was rounded up by how it made me feel.

All in all worth a watch, maybe not worth the hype but deffenetly worth the time.

For those of you who have spouses that are not very interested in dramas, I got my husband to watch it with me and he enjoyed it.

Excellent Show
I liked everything about this show - I thought the plot was well developed, the acting was first rate, and the music didn't annoy me. Passes the Bechdel test with flying colors - also a positive.

I enjoyed the gentlemanly tension between the ML and a secondary male of similar position and age. I thought the students did a good job of showing stress and how they coped with it, and there was a good balance between the main story line and the secondary (and tertiary) story lines - it was well blended.

I would rewatch this with no hesitation.

anger, sadness, and happiness eh?
God, watching this show there was one show running around in my head...how to get away with murder... the dirty politicians, innocent lives being taken, the student with the poor family background...
They're very different but also alike in a way. I was so mad watching most of this, I won't lie. Justice...it is definitely not something always guaranteed. This show has covered so many important topics that made me give it such a good review. Kang Sol A...she's fucking amazing. The others are also pretty cool but her. I reacted to her the most, the college student who is trying their very best but still aren't doing so well...god.
Each episode had its own twist which made me keep watching more and more. I'll come back and revise it later...I am sleepy lmaoo

Everyone grows on you and are understandable if not relatable.
I LOVED Kang Sol A and Joon Hwi and their professor, I loved all the other main charecters as well, but mostly them. Kang Sol A is such a relatable students, other than the fact that she cares too much about everyone else. Joon Hwi is the kind of student every law student aspires to be, coming from a person studying law. This was the first drama I've watched where I can actually relate to the characters especially when it comes to studying unlike high school dramas because the Korean education system is completely different to that in England.

Every law student we see at this school has their own case to bring, an important and big case. Not only are they students learning the law, they're also practicing it through their own cases, biggest case being the murder of one of their professors, where at some point, just about everyone seems suspicious. They all got an internship with their rival, the people they are litterally fighting against in court which was ironically funny.

I LOVED how all the characters were their for each other and stood by each others side through all the ordeals they went through. Everyone had their own problems, but they made time and sacrificed their opportunities to stand up for the friends and professor, not just out of loyalty, but out of a sense of justice.

I have never been this frustrated because of the ending of a drama. So many hints, so much CHEMISTRY and so much time and yet they DON'T end up together. They had 2 time jumps going several tears into the future and we still don't seen Kang Sol A and Joon Hwi get together. I was hoping for an ending like Vincenzo where the leads end up together, as a couple at the last minute, but we got NOTHING.

I LOVE THIS SHOW
i watched this drama because i wanted to watch something without romance, AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.

story:
the story is amazing, at first i thought it was gonna be kinda like criminal minds, a different case every episode or something, but NOPE it's so good and everything somehow ties together PERFECTLY.

acting:
each actor portrayed their character super well!!
(i'm ngl, even tho i watched this drama because i was tired of watching romance dramas, i kind of wanted a little bit of romance to happen between them.. iykyk)

music:
the music was very intense, which fit the drama very well. i don't really pay attention to music unless it's a wuxia c drama so i'm just not gonna give my opinion on this one lol

rewatch value:
i'm not sure because i literally just finished it, but all i gotta say was that it is an amazing show.

overall:
i loved it! i learned a lot of things about court, the defendant, prosecutor, and i learned a bunch of hangug-eo! everything ties up together very well, and the ending wasn't irritiating (unlike some other dramas that leave us on cliffhangers). now i'm gonna look for more k dramas haha

A Wickedly Clever Story with Mild Failings in Character
The main thing to note about this drama is the plot. It's the best aspect of the show, and the greatest reason, in my opinion, you'd want to watch it. It's so incredibly clever and convoluted I found myself gasping out loud multiple times. This great story is supported by a strong cast of actors and an iconic score that's instantly recognizable. However, while I was certainly gripped by the endless twists and turns, the show occasionally stumbled on things important to audience retention like tone balance and proper set-ups.

First, let me praise (in greater detail) the plot. The style of plot is somewhat like that of a mystery drama, but reframed in the interesting light of the legal world. Crimes and morals are all viewed through the eyes of law students, teachers, or practitioners, which- while occasionally making certain discussions seem unnecessarily obtuse- certainly lends credence to the unfortunate necessity of bureaucracy in a fair legal system. Moreover, the legal element introduces new challenges for our protagonists that we wouldn't otherwise see in a typical law enforcement mystery drama. However, the real draw of the plot is the intricacy of it. Just as you think you've discovered all there is to know, a new piece of evidence comes to light. Just as you think the mystery's been solved, a new witness arrives that changes the entire story. And-in the end- all the relevant evidence comes together to produce a reasonable yet astonishing to conclusion to the number of interconnected mysteries and conflicts present throughout the story. It's quite entertaining, exciting, and gripping, even for those who might not always like this type of plot.

To quickly mention other well-done production details, all the camerawork is good, audio is above average in quality, and the OST is very memorable. The acting, while occasionally a little flat, for the most part conveys incredibly nuanced emotion in complicated situations, and serves the character development well. Said character development is present in those characters with nontrivial flaws, and for the most part reaches a satisfying conclusion by the end.

Unfortunately, while this drama excels from a plot perspective, there are certain aspects essential to story telling that don't quite hit the mark. First of all, the tone is mostly very dark. While there are some much welcome moments of comedic relief, we often get long stretches of incredibly serious (and potentially tedious) dialogue and exposition. I watched this drama weekly as it was coming out, so I was not exhausted by this, but for those looking to binge the series I would be cautious and mindful of your own tonal preferences. I do not view the dark tone as a blanket negative to the show (in fact it may be a draw for some viewers) but I personally would have appreciated more balance in this area.

Secondly, and most crucially, is a lack of setup for many characters. While the plot is given an exciting kick off right from the start, this leaves almost no time to introduce the somewhat large cast of characters, the setting they're in, and their personal morals and goals. This becomes troublesome when the character becomes involved in something critical to the plot, because by then it's difficult to even remember their name. It's especially sad since certain characters would likely have had quite interesting introductions had they been given one. Notice how I said certain characters; this brings me to my last point.

I have found a certain degree of inconsistency among characters. Some characters are portrayed realistically, with interesting and human flaws that influence their decisions and interactions. Other characters are portrayed as gods amongst men, doing no wrong and containing vast intellect and encyclopedic knowledge, no flaw in sight. If it were one or the other, I would have no problem, but since the two are mixed together it seems to invalidate the struggles of the more flawed and unfortunate characters. It also leads to the discrepancy in character development we get between characters, as some characters are already so perfect as to be immune to further development. It offers an interesting insight into why flawed characters are more compelling, as it is difficult to connect with those characters who are perpetually right and therefor difficult to root for them. It also leads to a certain dissatisfaction with any character development of the flawed characters, as no matter what they accomplish they will never be as perfect as the others. Characters who are both flawed and extremely smart in the series prove that we don't need the perfect characters, and yet they must exist.

In conclusion, we have a vividly fascinating show which is at the same time intricately constructed and poorly established, just in two very different areas. We can say it is an incredible plot marred only by inconsistencies and missing introductions of characters, a wickedly witty work worsened only by tone too tumultuously tense. With that I will conclude that I do recommend this drama to those with even the slightest of interest in mystery and intrigue, with the caveat of a warning to those averse to overly serious tones.

I got so invested in the show (especially Sol A and Joon Hwi) I even made YouTube videos https://youtu.be/eV8QxEcmO28

This drama was kinda terrible in the beginning. Trust me, there were moments when I wanted to stop watching this drama because it felt like the writers couldn't set their minds and changed the plot. There were times I was like, ""writers, where are we going?""
Poor choice of music. At the beginning, the vibe of the songs/ ost didn't fit the drama but it did later on (as the show improved) and I realised that the problem wasn't the music. The producers put the ost wherever they liked and that nullified the scene's relevance because it was overly used. Just imagine, in every little suspicious or surprising scene, you play an intense song whose lyrics go like 'it's killing me under, it's driving me crazy', who would've taken it seriously?

I usually watch the first two episodes and then decide whether I'll continue or not. But these problems with the show continued, so why did I keep on watching it?
Because of the chemistry between Kim Bum and Ryu Hye Yeong
Their chemistry is OVERFLOWING. I usually don't ship couples who are very different but these two are an exception. They act like a fucking married couple and that is the CUTEST. I kept on watching for them and the show improved drastically and totally improved. And the show really picked up what it was about; the mystery. Trust me, the mystery part gets better. It was kind of all over the place in the beginning but it gets better and starts to make some sense as the show continues.

I really really loved Professor Yang or Yancrates. He's such a baddie, a total vibe. His ""your bullshit made me choke"" is the most iconic line ever! The other characters are very well performed and laid out. Other than Joon Hwi and Sol A, I really loved Ye Seul, her character was so interesting. I love how all these characters have a past that really explores later on the show and that makes it truly interesting.
I'll definitely reccomend this show. It's plot twists and cliffhangers are nicely put. Other than the mystery and the little bit romance, the friendship in this show is really goals. It's very realistically made. Since all of them are in a law school together, obviously many of them see each other as competition (which is natural) and they might seem selfish at times (you'll know once you watch it) BUT at the end of the day, they're ready to help each other out and that is really remarkable.

great but

The story line is great and all the plot twists are smart and i love them. but aside from that im kind of disappointed with solhwi development. the way Joonhwi looks at Sol A with such deep lovely gaze and smiles and laughs for legit EVERY little thing she does, will give you such butterflies, they dont even need a single love line. but dont expect too much abt them. i mean i wont ship them if they did nothing but they clearly started something here and we dont even get a clear conclusion abt it. I wasnt even expecting a kiss bro maybe just a hug would do it but damn we they were just playing with my feelings

Really enjoyed this show. I Like such an unpredictable story with turns after turns. There is no boring moment. I personally get bored even when the cast talks about their lives. From the very 1st episode, it's really exciting. I did not expect it to be good since I watched a clip of this drama from youtube titled study motivation and thought I need some motivation too but ended up enjoying this mysterious ride. They also gave great stories to each character. no single character was overly pushed to us. Each character had their own story. Would like to watch another season too. I am not into romance so It was also good for me.
Highly Recommended this show.

Very law heavy, but story and characters made it memorable
This series portrayed how law can be used to serve justice and at the same time, be abused. It portrayed struggles of being a student well enough that I could relate even though I did not study law. I enjoyed the theme of dating violence being explored in the drama, as I think it was executed really deftly. I also liked how the characters had underlying issues that would be uncovered later in the series, although some characters not as well executed as others. (*release season 2 to develop those stories better thanks*) The downside of this drama is definitely the breadth of law stuff being thrown in the script, such that one might think it is boring. (*don't watch this if you are entering into a food coma, or sleepyland*) Also, I think the ending was definitely rushed, hence I felt some characters' stories did not end as well as I would like, and the main plotline of the murder was wrapped up too conveniently/neatly. (*or maybe I am just dumb and confused*) Also, despite it not being a romance drama of any sort, I do enjoy the chemistry of the main leads such that I am deluding myself into shipping them as a couple, as their scenes were really cute. (*there is a plethora of fan-made edited vids of these 2 characters being shipped as a romantic pair, I kid u not*) Besides the main 'couple', I thoroughly enjoyed the comradery/rapport among the students and the teachers/professors, such that I would not mind another season and cannot bear to part from these characters. (*they tried to give a happy ending for the main 'couple', BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY ME, im sorry*)
The rapport was portrayed well partly because the actors/actresses were well-casted/acted really well. Even the villains were pretty darn easy to hate, primarily because of the fantastic acting.
Another downside to this drama is probably the repetition of one line of one song in nearly every single episode that I cringe at times when it is played. Thankfully, in later episodes, they change up playing a different section of the song, but it is boderline annoying. I do think the style of music is reminiscent of sky castle. There is 1 or 2 instrumentals that is opera/classical-ish that I like as it fits the prestige theme of being the top law school in korea. (*pretends to be a snob, pretend to know what classical music sounds like*)
I will rewatch fan-made vids of the characters, particularly the main *couple*.
Conclusion/TLDR: Law School is intense and thrilling drama that shows how law can serve justice or how law can be used for the wrong reasons. It also shows conflicts beyond the legal court, more than what meets the eye.
Sidenote: I watched this series alongside Vincenzo, and cannot help notice its similarities. If you are looking for an adjacent to Vincenzo (about serving justice and corrupt politicans/committing atrocities), this is definitely a drama to watch and preferably binge.

Honorable Story
Enjoyed watching it because in each episode it will give you an answer to each question from the cases that was put in hang. The story is okay though it maybe similar to other between students and the teacher as a mentor. In which I think one of the lead case Kim Myung Min forte. But he exhibits a tremendous excellent in acting that's why I was more get interested to his other drama series. Ryu Hye Young the last drama series was Reply 1986. But in here she is charismatic student. But her acting is just okay. But she is funny. However we know Kim Bum whom I watched his potential in acting Tale of Nine Tailed. But still here he is now performing very good in his acting ability.
The story is not new to any law firm that entails student and teacher relationship however it's more than that because also involves the attributes that which each character portrays.

Indeed informative but bad as a drama
The title is precise. Once you watched this you will get to learn things learned in law school (which is basically the title of this drama) though, depending on your country.

It was such an edifying drama that it made me interested in law. I have seen legal-themed K-dramas and this was the only one that prioritized and maintained the most to its genre.

Yes, the show was promising however some negative aspects prevailed for me. In this drama, we were shown peculiar camera angles. Personally, I did not appreciate the experimentation of the angles but it was fine and I think I was the only one who perceives it.

Watching a few minutes of the first episode made me already confused with its plot yet, the timeline in this drama made me more bewildered. As they had this different timeline I was left with questions unanswered in between.

The aspects that I loved regardless were the OST, the knowledge, and the mystifying feeling. In conclusion, it was a nice educating drama.

Their Friendship
I actually thought this was just gonna be one of ""those kind"" of dramas, with no realism in the production. But OH BOY I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed it. You could possibly never get enough of it. I would a 100% recommend watching this if you are interested in Law or like dramas that focus on hardship and friendships in life rather than romance. I personally liked it because of acting skills of the cast. It was just perfect. Without any kind of overacting or cringe scenes.

Excellent Show
Story: AMAZING. There were so many twists and turns in the storyline that just came out of nowhere (in a good way) I was constantly on my toes. I wish they will create a Season 2, I would like to see where they all are and if any of them got into a relationship.

Acting/Cast: I thought the casting was excellent, each one played their role extremely well. I didn’t loose interest and I couldn’t wait to see what was next.

I have already watched this show 3 times and I didn’t loose interest, since each time I watched it, I saw a scene which I didn’t catch the first .

Please create a Second Season and use the same casts (don’t replace any of them)

no words, head empty
at a prestigious law school, a mysterious murder of a professor occurs and causes chaos. based on the initial evidence, the perpetrator is believed to be his colleague. however, the murder is a part of a much greater scenario. professors and students combine their efforts to investigate the case and convict the real culprit. in the process of doing so, they trigger a chain of surprising revelations and unexpected events.
one of the best and most realistic dramas i have ever seen. 'law school' takes on much larger dimensions and transcends the boundaries of the law genre. although each episode offers a variety of diverse, thrilling cases and depicts the significance of legal knowledge and achieving justice, the characters still acknowledge the reality of life. not to mention the marvellousness that is the soundtrack. it immediately attracts anyone, ""pulls them under and drives them crazy.""
in the end, i would like to take a moment to declare my eternal love for the cast and their precious bond (and the top-notch mutual chemistry of solhwi).

Young Adults Overthrowing The Corrupt Government
The drama has it all, intricate plot without any holes, lively acting, the grandiose of law drama, etc. But you know what else makes me so in love with this drama? The barely-there-romance (or the romance-baiting, for the lack of a better word).
In this drama, a group of law students unexpectedly gets tangled in a mess, and ended up working together to solve a big case, in which powerful government officials are involved. It's serious, but also funny, lighthearted and relatable. This absolutely deserves all the hype!

P.S. Prof Yang is the ultimate eye candy here, I'm sorry Han Joon Hwi

Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
There's so much rich writing here. This is not a drama to zone out on. It keeps your mind hopping, challenges your values, and opens the doors of legal learning, in a fun and intruguing way.

Every twisty situation was magnetic, every character was played masterfully. The cast chemistry crackled. The male lead? He's no pretty face, but MAN, he's spellbing and masculinly hot. No lie. He explodes with charisma, and has a voice that melts...well you know what. Good grief!

He did another legal drama called A New Leaf, that was never completed.
I was left hanging, but this totally makes up for it.

love this!
i reallllly enjoyed this. for me, the story was quite well-paced. its never too fast or too slow and its also not too complicated and not that messy. the whole time i found myself wanting more of it, like i was very very curious but not to the point that i was feeling like restlessly excited, if you get me hahah. the whole drama just gave off some kind of a vibe for me, like a very calm but still so super fun kinda vibe. uhh idkkk maybe its the characters or the story idk but i just love ittt. also love the law jargons in it, its sooo interesting. if there’s one thing, maybe there were some things that i wished it could’ve been better but it doesn’t bother me that much. and also, the case is really not that complex and although there were some shocking truths or plot twist but its just okay, not too mindblowing. its simple and not that super thrilling for me. but kudos to alll the characters that made me just fell in loveee with them. definitely enjoyed this and soo worth my time.

A gem of a Legal drama
Short: A very clever legal drama, if you enjoy the legal dramas where it's all about winding your way through the ""devil in the detail"" clauses and exceptions, the machinations and maneuverings of the various characters as they try and achieve their goals and all on the legal stage then you will absolutely love this. I think it comes off really pretentious, but is perhaps justified through its quality. ""We Are"" sound track still going around and around in my head too!

Detail:
I'll start by explaining the use of the word ""pretentious"" above. It was the first thing I was thinking as the drama starts, wow, this one is taking itself SUPER seriously... deep voices, stern comments, powerful people, important phrases and people reflecting sternly and importantly on the statue of Lady Justice. In the first episode especially, it's almost too much, I remember thinking ""oh geez just get over yourself and get on with it"". It does lighten up, but this tone persists throughout.

Now that i've finished it however, I think it earns the right. There's a lot of detail and effort gone into the story and some really clever twists and turns as the characters fight to gain the upper hand through the use of the law. It definitely feels like you're watching a chess game played by experts.

Characters are great, they have flaws and strengths. Sol-A was definitely my favourite - she's the complete underdog, the under achiever, she barely belongs in the university at all and is struggling to keep her grades high enough. But what she lacks there, she over compensates with her drive and passion and when the genie is unlocked proves that she at least as good as everyone else.

I thought that Sol-B's issues were also nicely done too, there's a common thread in many dramas about how the wealthy are often driven horribly by parents who place unreasonable demands on them, and I liked how this one was handled. It was a well played character and must have been quite challenging to both write and embody, she's cold and has flat expressions and constant tone but she's not uncaring or unfeeling and she's there for her fellow students and friends.

There was one scene that I thought just felt really off, and it was another ""oh here we go taking ourselves too seriously again"" moment, in the court, one of the characters is in the defense and the professor is her defense council. At a key moment he announces sternly and proudly, that he we will be resigning as council, shocks and gasps from the viewing gallery... and then he says he will allow his student (the defendant) to use her write to defend herself and proceeds to turn the whole thing into a lecture, even at one point rebuking the prosecution when they object to something by saying ""in MY lectures, there are no objections"", completely ignoring that this is actually a court room and a real proceeding... but it's ok because the judge also forgets that too, so we carry on with the ""lecture"" :) I mean it's not the end of the world, it worked for the character development very well, allowing him to empower the girl to find her strength and stand up for herself in a situation where she'd otherwise been on the receiving end of everyone elses manipulations.

Overall it's a superbly written story, if you like the legal maneuverings and careful interpretations of phrases, all that super detailed stuff that's the essence of the law, then you will find that in spades here. There's some great twists, great characters, fun moments too, and a nice sound track (the song ""we are"" is still going around in my head and will be for some time i'm sure!).

Definitely recommended.

It's ok if you're ok with a show that's ok
I think this show deserves a lot of credit for telling a story that is miles away from the typical cliche' drama. It also deserves credit for establishing some highly unlikable bad guys and making no attempt to humanize them (which I like). This is entertainment. I like it when I don't have to feel conflicted about my distaste for the antagonist. The cast is deep. Lee Jung Eun is always terrific. Lee Soo Kyung sticks to the type of character where she excels but credit for being excellent at that style of character. I was not familiar with Jo Jae Ryong or Ryu Hye Young before, but they acquitted themselves admirably (especially RHY's Kang Dam). Lee David and Kil Hae Yeon were also wonderful.

But the cast is huge and weaving all of them in makes for an unwieldy narrative and it doesn't help that we lurch from this suspect to that suspect and back and forth between trials (both real and mock). It badly needed to crop 3-4 characters (like Woo Hyun's pointless copy room attendant and a couple of the school's administrators). More importantly, other than Kang Sol A, there was a rotating group of main characters at any one time but none of them had been developed sufficiently for me to care about any of them (including Han Joon Hwi who would have been a more realistic character if he'd slapped a big ""S"" on his chest and paraded around in tights and a cape).

The show somewhat redeems itself near the end with some clever twists, but it's not enough to really paper over some glaring flaws.

absolutely loveee ittt!!! it’s been some times since I love a drama this much. It has this good vibes despite being heavy, but not too heavy to the point that sakit otak. what I love the most, is that just like the title suggest it makes me feel like I was the one who is in law school. the progress of the cases isn’t similar with any lawyers/prosecutors dramas I’ve watched at all. it was more of a progress of learning, like somehow teaching us with this case, this could be indicted and this could be acquitted. In some other dramas, when the case takes time to be settled, it feels draggy and i kinda lose interest somewhere in the middle cause it wasn’t as ‘WOW’ (?), but for this drama, it was so damn interesting each time, new evidence new perspective to the case and still making me curious on the real story at least until before the last case. (not saying last case was boring, but i love other cases more).

I love the characters, all the case study in class, diversity in cases like jury trial and constitutional wow I feel like I’m learning bout law but it wasn’t boring at all, university can’t relate ugh. I want to emphasise on yeseul case, it’s not relatable to me but I understand her so much, the case really got on my nerves and make me cry. I guess this is like my first law related drama which makes me so immersed and emotional in one of the cases. and pleaseee not yangcrates trying to lecture in the court at some point ? I love every thing bout this drama, it has this unique charm, and I love that. this drama makes law seems interesting and I wanted to know more and more about all the acts and interpretations. but not to the point that I want to be a lawyer cause damn that looks hard asf (hwaiting to all law students out there!!) I have no complaints except wish we could get more joon hwi x kang sol huhu

It all starts with one murder..
This was such an unexpected hit. I did not expect to like this drama when I first started watching it. This is easily one of the best dramas of 2021 for me. The fact that the story while revolving around one murder case, managed to follow multiple characters' stories weaving them intricately without losing steam for 16 episodes is amazing in itself. An extremely well-paced story with 3D characters who have their own problems and motivations, what more could I have asked for.

The glimpse into the lives of law school students and how various cases are handled in general, albeit being fascinating, lacked a little bit of realism, in my opinion. Although I am no expert on law, it would have been impossible for certain courtroom scenes to happen in real life. But what's a law drama without that little bit of flash and bang in courtrooms. Apart from that, my only complaint about this drama is that despite each case having antagonists and villains of their own, ultimately everything lead to one main villain which was a tad predictable and lacked that little amount of punch for me.

Other than that, I absolutely loved everything else. Yangcretes who couldn't help but give lectures even in the courtroom, Professor Kim who used the bad guys to eventually make the good guys win, Sol B who I initially disliked but grew on me as the story progressed, stoic faced Jiho, brave and beautiful Yeseul who's final courtroom scene made me cry, soft-hearted Bokgi, kind but a little lost Seungjae who managed to find his way back in the end, and even Yebum who manages to say the wrong thing almost every time.

Of course, one of the best parts of the drama for me was the will-they-won't-they couple JoonSolA ^o^ Even though the drama didn't specifically confirm that they ended up dating, in my mind, they are endgame periodt. Their little interactions sprinkled throughout the drama were what I looked forward to in each episode and they are what I'm going to miss the most about the drama.

Give it a try you won't regret it...!
Just came across by accident, but hooked up completely. The drama was ok until the death of that Prof.Seo, then it would take a complete u-turn. Even if you have chips, if you look down to take it, something would happen in that microsecond. You have to pause and read the articles they have given below, don't skip it its important to understand. The story was amazing, even though I have watched many law dramas, nothing hooked me up like this. Everything was just perfect.But you would face many annoying characters in this drama, even you would killer in your dreams bcz of them. What I like about this drama is every character has their own stories. You might think that you are having the worst life and experiences, but when you watch it you won't think like that. The drama will teach you how to survive. They completely nailed the topic JUSTICE. They brought it out picture perfect. And you would wish to have a professor like Yangcrates. There would be many scenes you would like to rewatch it. I can assure you that ita not like any other normal dramas, its perfect for binge watching. In one line, you won't experience the thing REGRET by watching this....

A nice weekly dose of Drama and Mystery.....
The beginning gives similar vibes of HTGAWM but it is better without the unnecessary drama.

I think it portrays how the morality and ethics of our actions are generally in shades of grey instead of clear black and white, and why this fight is harder for people who are fighting for justice and sees the world and actions of humans in clear black and white.
The acting of the cast is really great so is the cinematography and OST.
I think this drama is not for binge-watching but to kind of enjoy like a cup of hot coffee.
The hints of romance are low-key which only makes it more fun to watch, it always heartwarming when romance starts with two characters respecting each either than the usual I will save you bull shit.
So for me, this is a must-watch drama for people who enjoys this genre and if nothing else definitely watch for cute ML.

Well-thought out and well-structured, enjoyable show.
Absolutely loved this show.
The OST especially, is played at all the right moments, it's absolutely perfect!
I know it has it's flaws, but the way the entire story is actually thought-out is simply amazing. The reveals, the court proceedings, the way the cases and their verdicts actually influence and build up the final moments, flawless!
Absolutely loved this show and learnt so much about law in general. If you want a serious show, that is not TOO serious, and has a really well-thought out, structured and intriguing plot : this one's for you!
Go for it. :)
Happy watching~~

Perfect for those that like How to Get Away With Murder
If you're a fan of How to Get Away With Murder's premise and set-up, Law School will most likely appeal to your taste as well.

Both dramas are very similar to each other, to the point where I wouldn't be surprised if Law School took inspiration from HTGAWM for their writing. Both are set in a law school and open with a murder. Both students and professors come under suspicion, suspect each other, exonerate each other, etc. as they try to figure out who the true murderer is amidst the secrets that each person is hiding. While it's early yet, hopefully Law School can show us something different from HTGAWM, as it currently just seems like a Korean remake of this drama. My rating will change depending on how this drama fleshes out its characters, and if it will bring something new to the table as it progresses along.

Actors and actresses are very well cast. I enjoy how there's no clear-cut hero/heroine, and everyone's characters are morally ambiguous. With the right price and condition, even seemingly righteous characters can do ethically questionable things and vice versa.

OST so far reminds me of Sky Castle's OST, so a little haunting, a little tense. Nothing that detracts too much away from what's on the screen.

THIS IS THE DRAMA
law school is such an interesting drama full of plot twists and with a very talented cast that blew my mind away with every single scene. for the reply 1988 enthusiasts, sung bora (ryu hyeyoung) is here with adult noeul ((woo hyun) and also young noeul's ex gf (lee sookyung). this drama mainly focuses on the death of a professor in a law school and with each episode you learn something new about the professor's death and also the story of the characters. apart from the drama itself being really really good, the ost is also amazing, i was definitely not expecting such a good ost (stream we are by lee seung yoon on spotify). please give it a watch!

The script is too much
The movie plot is nice, but there’s a lot going on. There are so many characters to focus on, and it’s making the movie a lot stressful to comprehend. There’s no particular storyline, and the time jumps are a lot. It’s almost like they’re trying re-enact a Korean version of How to Get Away With Murder, but they’re doing it all wrong, and the execution of the movie is terrible. The actors though great, also seem like they’re forcing their roles, they are not flowing as much as i want them to with the storyline.

Voice got a lot of mixed reactions, ranging from perfection to utter garbage. Being a crime drama hater as well as a viewer who consciously avoids OCN shows, I’m more than surprised to belong in the former category. Voice was a splendid crime thriller and for me, the best OCN drama I’ve watched by far.

Story
Same old, same old, 2 police officers whose relatives get murdered by the same person, are teaming up to create a new division based on the emergency call police department and their end-game is to catch that bastard.

Been there, done that, so what did Voice do to break the mould of crime dramas?

First of all, the concept of Voice profiling. Not sure if this is a thing, but even if it’s not, we accepted a crime drama about a walkie talkie that could make a 2 guys living in different timelines to communicate, why can’t we accept a woman who can hear extremely well? The voice profiling was original for me, gave a different vibe and an innovative twist to the all-too-usual police procedural recipe.

Furthermore, the impressive cinematography and music. The drama is gritty and dark in all the right ways. Creative directing, haunting dark colors and soulful music just came together perfectly and clicked, making a drama that not only gives off ominous vibes but it is also sinister only by looking at it.

Continuing, the incredible side stories. Every two episodes or so there is a new crime story introduced for the “golden time team” –the aforementioned new division created- to resolve. This is where the writing along with the directing and montage click together doing miracles. All of the side stories were intense, engaging, thought-provoking (although the first two ones were my favourite), well-written and did not drag at all.

Finally, the most important one, the marvelous core story. Cliché done right. The concept of putting a psychopath as the main villain isn’t foreign to dramaland; however the drama’s atmosphere, world-building along with the casting literally did miracles. More specifically, I appreciated that there was not a lot of red herring involved –crime dramas seem to think that we enjoy being led astray every 2 episodes for some reason; while, it felt like there is a whole story going on in the background making this drama look like a part of a whole. Effectively, we were focused on the police side of a bigger narrative - plot twists, havoc and despair ensued.

Furthermore, it’s worth noting how every character, plot device and potential twist are beautifully connected and intrinsically linked to the bigger picture. Good writing - the drama is actually so good even when you see the twist coming, you're still gonna like it anyway cause the whole aura of the drama won't let you a moment's rest.

Lastly, It would be a serious negligence, at this point, to not mention the exquisite Serial Killer. Undeniably, the drama owes how well it worked to its main villain. As far as I’m concerned we’re talking about the best villain I’ve ever witnessed creepy, scary, disgusting and disturbing, the type that crawls up your skin only by seeing his smirking smile. He enhanced the drama while simultaneously we do get the environment in which a serial killer is born that was spectacular to watch.

Honestly, not many drawbacks can be cited by me. If I could address one it would be the somewhat conveniently written side stories. But, come to think of it, isn’t every kdrama ever like this? Rich hot arrogant chaebols falling for poor innocent girls, silly coincidences and other cliches and we accept that but can’t accept a crime drama with stories being a little far-fetched or exaggerated here and there? This is dramaland, if everything was absolutely rational there would be no drama to watch!

Additionally, it was claimed that the drama had gruesome scenes and a lot of blood. Having grown up watching American TV shows this felt like child’s play to me but I do understand if some scenes were too much for some people. Everything is censored (actually, too much censoring going on to be honest), but be aware if you are sensitive to such scenes. Moreover, I read comments saying the side stories were boring and dragged, which contradicts completely what I said. I obviously disagree. Frankly, the side stories might be the best part of it all.

What's more, people argued that the drama takes a hit after a strong beginning. Strong starts bring high expectations too. I think the drama did well in keeping up pace, not dragging and staying strong plot-wise. Yes, middle episodes weren’t as strong as the first 2-3 but still a solid drama overall.

In general, Voice isn’t perfect, but it is time well-spent for sure. It is extremely thrilling; the side stories addressed interesting issues like child abuse, rape ect and were generally on the humanistic side of society, definitely struck a chord with me. The drama deserves a 9 for its flawless story line (side+main) +0.5 for the fact that it was utterly stimulating and increasingly intense with fleeting moments of strong sentiments and despair that just make the whole thing feel that much more real and emotional; I was at the edge of my seat during pretty much every episode either being thrilled or feeling hopeless.

Acting
I admit I was purposely avoiding Lee Ha Na. I only saw her once before Voice, didn’t like her. That being said, thank god I picked this because she redeemed herself completely. I couldn’t even recognize her here and I drew the conclusion that she just doesn’t match cute rom-comy characters, but rather darker ones. Her performance was impeccable here and she had great chemistry (as co-police officers) with Jang Hyuk. I’d love to see her in a similar role, or even in a melodrama in the future.

It is established how good Jang Hyuk is, and here is no exception to his unending talent. Fearless and brave character with a broken and emotional side, he pulled off his role immaculately and he was a perfect fit for it. Such a well-rounded actor, he can do everything. Respect.

Where have Kim Jae Wook been all this time? Flawless and creepy, an absolutely perfect match for his role, I need to keep an eye out for him in the future. I can safely say he made the drama!

Recommend
Concluding, I’d say don’t turn a blind eye to this drama, it’s really good. Crime and thriller drama fans I call out to you, viewers who enjoy intense and provocative dramas/stories that aren’t extremely complicated this is for you. I can’t see how someone wouldn’t be entertained by Voice if you disregard the convenient part and you don’t have a problem with some violence ect.

This drama cemented the fact that I am really a big fan of Jang Hyuk. He can be anything! Absolutely anything! Even a crazy ass policeman with a bone to pick with all the bad guys! Such a great actor! A gift to dramaland, really! It also doesn't hurt that this drama's story is plainly amazing! I am always excited for the new episodes because there's one mystery after another and it's never over the top.

The whole crew created this drama beautifully. Powerful and finishes with an ""oomph!"". I highly recommend this!

CONTENT
- A female character with very little personality, bravery and cowardice, intelligence and stupidity and the superpower of visualizing very faint sounds.
- A male lead who strongly respects the law but curses, threatens, yells and physically hurts people a lot.
- A ""psychopath"" murderer with a very superficial diagnose and very adventurous symptoms.
- Corrupt people with power and informative side characters with somewhat of a spark.

This drama contains a lot of blurred gore and insane deaths. There will be blood and what they claim are ""smashed heads"", a lot of fighting scenes, stabbing, shooting and punching. There is no romance, and chances of crying are low. Medium if you're sensitive.

Not very bingeable. I got tired of it easily when some episodes felt dragged out and predictable.

Some scenes were very powerful and dark and really made it hard for me to sleep. They had some very creepy elements and the director did a good job sparking discomfort in the viewer. I liked the concept that every episode had a new, smaller case, that lead the main characters closer to the person they were trying to catch. Although some scenes were very unrealistic and this drama contains a ton of mistakes, some cases were very exciting to watch and kept me at the edge of my seat.

I have to say though, this is not the best crime drama I've ever seen. Most of the time, I was annoyed with the characters, disappointed with the twists, and calling plot holes. I can't praise the actors too much either. The only person I think did an amazing job, would be Kim Jae wook. He played his role perfectly until the end.

If you want a daring crime drama without romance, but don't care too much about details. I guess this drama is for you.

ENJOY!!

The core story was strong, but had weak branches. You could climb it sure, and when you reach the top you feel delighted, but you have to be prepared for weak footfalls on the lower branches, at the threat of wanting to jump to the ground, and come back another day.

The main story is of a serial killer, using an iron ball to satisfy his sadistic pleasures. When Jin Hyuk's wife is murdered in the opening scenes, the game is strong and you watch him (Jin Hyuk, not the serial killer^^) team up with Gwon Joo, who's cop father was also murdered by the same guy, as she heads the ""Golden Time Team"" at their local precinct.

A team that is dedicated to reaching any crime scenes within the golden period before it ends for the worse - 10 minutes.

With this set in place, we have to sit through this team being put into use, with my favourite side story, of a foster kid behind abused by his mum, in a repeat cycle of what happened to her so he called 112, to my least favourite set in a mental centre, where homeless people are being fleeced and then killed. Seemingly random, but providing leads to the serial killer. I didn't know whether to be pissed or happy. Happy, is what I went with. Imagine if I had sat through all those cute, protracted spin-offs and there wasn't a point?

The serial killer does not hide.

No, he is almost luxurious in the way he hunts and reveals himself. Extremely arrogant of being untouchable (typical privileged Korean kid, lol^^) However, he was willing to lose that power, just so it would create maximum torment within the two he was obsessed over. Jin Hyuk and Gwon Joo. One of the best scenes including Mo Tae Gu (and there were many) was when he was wheeled out of hospital, escaping, but yet he roared because he didn't want to escape, but be back in their clutches. Wow!

Kim Jae Wook is excellent, the best thing in the last four episodes.
Lee Ha Na has this breathy style of speech she adopted here, which I grew used too, so I was cool with the girl by the end.
Jang Hyuk was in the middle of these two, somewhere in terms of acting talent and commitment.

I could see myself rewatching the first two episodes, and the last four alone. That's it. For that, I will give a high rewatch score.

If you like crime/detective dramas, this is the best one out of 2017 for sure.
But the year is early yet 8D

Lately I've become disappointed with OCN dramas and I was hesitant to start this one. Now I'm glad I did though.

The summary sounds like every other crime drama out there and I won't say it's different from others either. But in the end it depends on the script writing and the execution - and the acting, of course.

So Jang Hyuk's and Lee Ha Na's characters team up to catch a killer that murdered their family members. Both of them work at the emergency call center. That doesn't sound quite thrilling now, but let me tell you that the producers did a great job to get you excited about it immediately. Because the Golden Time (the first hours after a crime occurred and is reported to the emergency center) is one of the most crucial parts in hopefully solving a crime or prevent worse ones (i.e. kidnapping cases). And what is special here, is Lee Ha Na's character's ability to hear more than others. Due to an accident she developed some kind of supernatural hearing that allows her to hear more than others - even through headphones.

Right from the beginning the drama holds the suspense on a level that definitely makes your heart race. Fast camera movements and a good timing of scene editing ensure that.

I can't say that this drama doesn't have any problems. It's still a k-drama and there are some flaws and again sometimes the police just looked stupid. You also have those characters who you want to punch because their behavior is so wrong when it comes to being professionals. But! There are also characters that I didn't like but who grew on me during the story, no matter that their behavior went into opposite directions.

I also must admit that the story had some problems in the middle and lost some of its speed. I also think that the killer's identity was revealed too early in the drama which caused a big slow down as the story went a bit into some shady business themes. Although this doesn't mean that the killer's charisma wasn't engaging. He was a great psycho who gives you goosebumps.

The whole acting of the cast was fantastic. From the leads to supporting characters to guest roles. Especially the latter. They captivated me during their short appearances in the drama and made every single case into something special. I never found them boring. They were thrilling and emotionally moving. At some point they were even more interesting than the main plot.

The finale completely made up for the the middle part though. It picked up the speed and suspense again and let the drama end in an enthralling way.

The writers should be fired...always same old tired lines ending with ""bastard"". The way the detectives waste time talking meaningless lines during a time that they should be rushing to save someone is sooo irritating, good grief!. Nothing positive to say about this drama. I think some of the other high reviewers must have been hit with the kettleball.

This drama has a lot of violence in it. But it's a crime drama, violence needs to be a part of it.
I'll not focus on the plot this time. It was ok, almost brilliant. There weren't black holes, everything fit perfectly together so I have nothing to complain about the plot.
The most interesting thing about this drama is its characters.
Some of them were written really well, some of them were too plain for me to like them.
Let's start with Jin Hyeok.
A pretty skillful cop, he chases criminals and murderers like a crazy dog chase a car.
Clever, never disappointing when it comes to his way of dealing things and troublesome situations. He seeks revenge toward the psycho who killed his wife, he's a protecting father yet his son has never been a pain in the ass (Like SY has been in Duel).
At first he can't team up with his new team, he just wants to do his job alone like a lone wolf. But after some episodes we see that he's actually stronger while being in a team.
Kwoo Joon is the tough female cop that works as his sidekick.
Both seeking for the murderer who killed their darlings, Kwoo Joon is the brain of the team.
She has a really good hearing, almost a supernatural power I might say.
She knows how to handle things, but, most of all, she knows how making a team work.
She's not the best female character I have ever seen in Kdramas but she was a really strong woman.

REASON TO WATCH IT.
The villain is one of the most interesting and creepy villain I ever saw.
I'm not just talking about how he kills people, a really gruesome way, but I really enjoyed his personality and his background story.
A villain is a villain and a well made villain doesn't need to have a sad background story to being with.
Taegu grew up with a mental illness. His father didn't want to cure him so his father made TaeGoo become that kind of adult.
I really enjoyed the way they killed him off.
Maybe it was too unrealistic, but he was killed the way he used to kill people.
And, in the end, he was scared.

Great drama, I'll give it a 7.5 out of 10.

As a BIG fan of OCN dramas - Voice was probably one of my top 5. Wait! - make that top 3.

I always look forward to when another OCN drama comes out, lets just say, I get excited and giddy. As one of my favorite stations in South Korea, OCN always brings out the brutal and scary sides of cop dramas.

The way Voice was shot, was amazing. Dark alleyways, mysterious figures and bloody crime scenes. Typical in an OCN drama, but always needed and wanted from a fan like me.

From other thriller dramas, the choice of weapon from the killer was freaky and strange. If I ever see one in real life, I know to stay far away. I know I'll never see them the same way again.

Of all the acting, Kim Jae Wook's really got me. I saw him in Who Are You (the newer one), and Voice was a complete change over. I don't want to spoil anything, so just watch Voice if you like to see how his acting plays out. Superb!

So yes, big fan of Voice. Really really loved it! My mom isn't a fan of OCN dramas, but this one I recommend.

(Now, waiting for ""Tunnel""!!)

How this show got multiple seasons is beyond me.
I go into detail about the plot here so this review is full of spoilers. You've been warned.

Oh, boy. This one was a journey. I'm glad to say I've survived it.

I'll start by saying that crime shows are my all-time favorites and after finishing Beyond Evil a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon VOICE and the premise sounded nice (they are nothing alike besides the fact that we have a serial killer, but I was on a roll). An overall score of 8.5 here was also a plus. What I've learned, however, is not to trust scores too much. I've gathered all my strength to give a 7.5 although as I write this I keep feeling it deserves an even lower score. I feel I'm being too nice because of Kim Jae Wook. He's messing with my head.

Speaking of him, let's start with the good stuff.

A good crime show needs a good villain. It should make you feel disgust or fascination, or both. I think Kim Jae Wook was successful in achieving both. His voice, his looks, his facial expressions, were all on point. Towards the last 2 episodes, he carried the show on his back. And that's the reason I could finish it.
I also liked his MO, I don't remember ever seeing a killer using a kettlebell before. That got us some gruesome (although blurred) scenes, at least for kdrama standards (which doesn't show too much, let's be real). What I didn't like were the random killings. At first, I thought he focussed on killing women, that that was his ""thing"" but there was nothing specific about his killings besides the fact that he wanted to (as a good psychopath). The ones with a motive were people who got in his way, which, okay, I get it. This is not an inconsistency of the writing whatsoever, it's just personal preference. You couldn't do a profile of him considering his victims alone (not at first), because sometimes they didn't have anything in common. Again, personal preference regarding serial killer shows. I like the ""he kills girls with dark middle part hair because it reminds him of his ex"" like Ted Bundy or something. KJW wasn't like that, he didn't have a type. But you do you, booboo.

But overall, he's a highlight in the show, at least when it comes to acting, plot holes aside. And you get to see him in a bathtub at least 3 or 4 times. I swear every time I've said ""I'm about to drop it"", there he was in the tub again. Jesus.

Another highlight was the cases the team had to solve. I think the guest actors deserve all the praise in this show. They did everything they were supposed to do and more. You could feel their pain. Unlike the main duo who both had big traumas but failed to show the amount of raw emotion the guests showed us. Props to Choi Seung Hoon who was only 8 or 9 years old when the show aired and did amaaaaazing in his case!! This kid is so, so good. Can't wait to see him nailing main roles when he reaches his 20s. :) But honestly, all the guests deserve praise here, they were all great.

Now for the ugly part.

The main characters - Moo Jin Hyeok and Kang Kwon Joo - were really lackluster. Jin Hyeok was rude most of the time, hit the same note the whole show and it was hard to... I don't know, like him? The same goes for Kwon Joo. She's soft-spoken, which I think was a great contrast between her character and the job she has, which needs to be very fast as it is literally a race against time. But it also made me very frustrated while watching, her ""nervous"" tone didn't differ much from her normal tone except that she talked faster. I know she needs to be calm while talking to the victims, but you want her to be more active and she never is. She has ""super hearing"" which should be the main point of the show because that's what makes it different from other crime series but the only thing you know about it is the fact that she suffered an accident as a kid that made her that way. What about showing her accident through a flashback and give us a little of how was for her to get used to this new ""ability""? How hurtful it was a first, how it changed her life? We get none of that!!

As for Jin Hyeok, we see 2 flashback scenes of him with his wife. Tops. I know they loved each other because, well, they were married so that's that! I mean, okay then??

I want to root for them because I care about them as characters and not because they are the good guys and that's the right thing to do. Give me something more than that. Give me development.

The way they investigate things was such a joke sometimes. We have countless scenes of the policemen running like a bunch of morons, without any success whatsoever. I swear to god that I almost throw my remote control at my TV when they started chasing Kim Jae Wook's character, who was INJURED AFTER BEING SHOT AND SORT OF DRUGGED AFTER THE HOSPITAL SHANNENIGANS, and he managed to escape!!! With 15 fucking people chasing him!! How useless can the police fucking get? I kept watching because it was the last episode but I swear I was done episodes ago.

That scene when they arrive at his beach house and both of them notice there's fresh blood in the ground right at the entrance and they are like ""look, fresh blood!!"" and instead of going inside the house where there's probably a very serious thing happening, they start talking to each other about things they can talk about later! I mean, didn't you just saw fresh blood in front of a serial killer's house? Maybe go a little faster and you might save someone? You've just let Dae Shik get his head smashed, congrats!

For a show about how time can save lives, you guys sure like to waste a lot of it.

Jin Hyeok's avoiding the gunshots by doing tumbles was just laughable. Oh, but at least they used their guns this time, which is better than nothing considering that part where the killer goes to Kwon Joo's house (and she knows about it because Jin Hyeok warned her) and she grabs a KNIFE to defend herself. You have a gun, why are you using a knife? Like, why? I'm not even going to talk about Jin Hyeok talking to her through the phone without leaving the police station during this very dangerous situation. Oh, I think I just did. Anyway, can't you talk to her and run to your car at the same time? Is that too much for you? But you can avoid being shot by rolling like a ball. Sure.

Did they ever explain why the hell there are 3 characters with the same weird mouth sound? Did I miss something? Was that really necessary?

I could go on and on about the bad and weak points of Voice and writing this is making me remember all of them, but this review is already long enough. I've said in the beginning that I gave this a 7.5 but now I'm changing it because I was being too generous (I feel like I still am). Kim Jae Wook and the guest actors deserve all the props for managing to make me watch this til the end. Too bad the main plot did them dirty, making this show with high potential at not-so-solid 6.5 at best.

This drama was amazing! I loved the plot and the thriller part but if it, but there were times when the plot did confuse me but other than that... this drama is really good. I totally recommend this thriller/mystery drama to anyone who wants to expand more in this area.
I love the actors especially Jang Hyuk who portrayed a good character. His acting was splendid and so were the other characters such as Lee Ha Na (love her), Lee Jae Wook, Baek Sung Hyun, etc.

This drama, in my opinion, is a drama worth to watch especially the plot and the message of this drama to the viewers.

I've been of police/crime related drama for quite awhile now. As long as there's one with a good plot, I'll give it a shot. With that being said, I'm also OCN network biased. They're my favorite network and I've watched all of the shows that they've aired to date.

In my opinion, the beginning few episodes were a bit hard for me to get into. Truthfully, I ended up skipping a lot of parts in eps 1-3 but once ep 4, I don't think I skipped any parts. I thought the first couple of episodes were decent but was still slightly lacking. I wasn't able to connect to the characters immediately which was a downfall for me. But once you got over the first few episodes, you will be glued to your seats in anticipation for what's going to happen next.

The acting by the actors were superb. I'm a huge fan of Kim Jae Wook after watching a previous drama of his, so seeing him in this role was definitely a positive sign. Also a fan of Baek Sung Hyun, he's an absolute cutie pie.

Overall, the drama did have some hiccups in the first few episode, but it was ironed out well in the later episodes. This drama might not be everyone's cup of tea but I do believe that if you're a fan of crime, you should definitely give this drama a try. The OSTs that played were a nice touch and complimented the drama nicely. Too often, I see OSTs that come out of nowhere and don't belong in a particular scene but I do like the placement of the OSTs in this drama.

As for re-watch value, I gave it an 8.5 specifically for the fact that if I were to rewatch it, I wouldn't watch the first few episodes. But that's just me personally.

Watchable, but that's really about it
The only reason I'm giving this a 6 is because I don't finish dramas that I would rate below a 5 but looking back, I'm not sure how this gets a 6. There was nothing compelling about the plot, but it's somehow very bingeable because I finished this in 4 days (which is the fastest I've ever watched a 16 ep kdrama)

Honestly, if you take away Kim Jaewook as the charismatic eye-candy villain, there's nothing to look forward to. The main problem with the show was that there was no character that you could truly feel attached to, since they didn't build anybody's personality outside of the case. I was hoping the male and female lead would become friends or form sort of bond at least but they didn't, which felt like wasted potential. On the other hand, those 2 random side characters from the golden time team were given bonding moments????? I think they tried to have them be some sort of rom-com relief but they were both horribly annoying characters, and part of that might be because their acting was also quite bad.

As to the actual plot, the amount of repetition was probably the only actually funny thing abt the show. Every single episode they would arrest culprit A, FL would say ""something feels wrong...."" and then thanks to her hearing they would realize that the real culprit is culprit B; case solved after identifying the red herring that somehow occurs every time. The main plot only picked up once Kim Jaewook's chara was introduced, and he kinda carried the show from there... and he wasn't even that great of a villain. It's just that he's really attractive. But to be fair he genuinely acted well, very convincing. The ML did have some moments that made me think he's cool but as a whole his dialogues were awfully written and repetitive (take a shot every time he says gesaekki, u might die of alcohol poisoning 20 mins into an ep), and the fact that someone had to stop him from bashing the culprit's head every episode made me laugh bc how many times can u make him do the same thing over and over...

Overall:

Positive points: kim jaewook is hot, some of the side plots that the golden time team solved were interesting, leads were occasionally cool, fl's hearing ability (this isn't technically a positive point bc altho it was a nice idea, it was poorly executed. maybe it's because the FL herself wasn't an interesting chara, but having an ability like that should've made her cooler... but it didnt.... like how do u manage to make superhearing boring and normal. for example in stranger, hwang simok not having emotions wasn't an ""ability"" but that trait of his was executed so well and made him such a compelling lead)

Negative points: every plot twist (if u can even call those ""twists"") was predictable, no character was interesting or likeable enough to get invested in, aside from the flashy name the golden time team had nothing to offer bc there was 0 attachment value, soundtrack was cheesy

Final words: just watch stranger instead. if you've already watched it, then watch it again

If Kim Jae Wook wasn't in this drama, I wouldn't have watched it. I was surprised that he played the baddie, but his acting was fantastic! He has pure talent, such an underrated actor. Hope he plays the villain in more dramas.

Watched it cause of Kim Jae Wook
First of all... I started watching it because of Kim Jae Wook but ended up liking the series.

But...

What the hell was the ending...?
Maybe it was the 'karma'

He was not doing it with a sane mind then why he met with such a fate.
I know he killed and stuff..but he was sick.
I understand not all psychopaths are killers, some even try to live a life but he chose different cause of his father. Then why?
Isolation could have done the job but why such fate.

- Now on to the reality -

Every single cast were on point. Not a single complain (expect for the ending).
Kim Jae Wook.. gives his everything for any role he plays and that's why he is my favourite and forever will be.

Must watch.

- Maaya

There are dramas with quick paced screenplay. Then there's this one. It felt as if everything occurred within the span of a couple of days. There is no cool off period between one case to the other or the main overarching case involving the two leads. This high velocity bound to create some blatant omissions and put a dent in logics. Unfortunately the omissions and lack of logic were not really easy to look away.

Character with superhuman powers is not something that is new to Korean Dramas. But it is unusual to find one in which the powers are not well defined and used casually to make up for lazy writing. The ability bestowed upon the character by the writers were not overused. Yes, the stories were bent to suit the power but they did not seem forceful at any point.
The other lead, a tortured police officer on the path of vengeance might come off as a little irritable and at times getting on the nerves of the viewers. But he served as a symbol of defiance against a hierarchical system mired in corruption, bureaucracy and lethargy.

Different cases handled by the team, individually, had a nail biting screenplay and/or exuberant pathos. The evil in each of the cases were progressively diabolical from one to the other. So the victims needed to be really powerless and their weakness was written really well by amplifying the dementedness of the bad guy/s.

It is because of this very reason the main big bad of the show seems weak with a cluster of cliched psychopathic tropes amped up by dark biblical and literary references. He is neither astute nor enigmatic. There is nothing remotely engrossing or even likable about him. A flawed attempt at writing a character with flaws.

This show has the one of the most alluring cinematography and elevating music with nice balance of sound designing. Some of the shots transcended the screen to show pure evil while the music just enhances the experience. Since this show is more about the minute sounds, there needs to be an amplification of the same during a tense situation along with background music. It had its fair share of appropriate scoring with the congruent noises enhanced.

A show need not picturize all the events in a particular arc or phase of the story. Some of those would be obvious and it is subconsciously understood by the viewer. But here, they have ignored including some scenes assuming those fall into the above category. It is really difficult to conclude how the characters came upon that clue or a particular revelation. The chain linking it all seemed to have forgotten to include a few things. Adding to this some logical errors, it causes a massive harm to an otherwise decent thriller.

The flow of a good thriller with immersive cinematography and chilling sound design and music were interrupted sporadically by these errors which are not negligible enough.

Net net: The two ML’s drove this show for me. And by 2nd lead, I mean the killer, not his sidekick cop. The FL actor and her character are just OK. Could be interchanged with any actress. A better one might have made me latch onto the character more.

Besides the well-known male main cast, the main story and some of the side stories is/are compelling and riveting. Suspenseful and thrilling. I never got bored but sometimes antsy when the show was going off on tangent stories unrelated to main thread. While they served to create a drama, I would rather have seen more time spent on character development for ML and some of the supporting characters.

The writers/producers timed it so that only when half way thru, they could re-engage the existing viewers and possibly draw new ones with the exposure of the killer...a favorite male leading actor who happens to be a scene-stealer and stunningly handsome. He was superbly evil. At this point in the show there is no turning back. You are seat-belted in.

I have a bias toward Jang Hyuk, he’s one of my top 5 fav male K-actors, so I knew I’d watch anyway, BUT it is worth mentioning that after first 6 eps, I put this show on hold for long while. When I re-picked up I watched those eps over again. Good thing — becuz there are some foundational clues in those eps. I tend to not like side filler stories that deviate from the main path. That’s just me though, and I realize this is a kdrama that needs content to fill 16+ eps. :D

Overall I am glad I watched and restarted. If you are watching and getting bored, just make it to ep 8. Then all will be well...and crazy. Will I watch the following seasons? Not sure I can watch them without Jang Hyuk. As the lead, he carried this show from start to finish. (<—Thank u JH). I dropped some points due to some of the way they drove the plot along here and there. And becuz they trusted me to make it till ep 8. In the end I did and enjoyed it. I never got bored.

Note: there was nothing memorable or bad about the OST this a middle of the road score.

If Kdramas had a cinemasins, the sin count would be 1000+
This drama wants to be cool, but it fails. Because the writer and production crew are lazy, this drama messes up on the smallest of details. It was waaaaaay too distracting for me to overlook, causing me to drop this at episode 9 and just skip to all of the Kim Jae Wook scenes. (I had watched this drama for him, and I was going to watch all of his scenes no matter what) Kim Jae Wook was just brilliant. It was such a shame that they didn't use him until episode 8 or so, because he could've made it soooooo much better and more engaging. I liked the scene when MTG was caught and arrested, and he's still taunting MJH. It's all a game to MTG, and he truly is psychotic.
ML and FL did not have much dimension to them (up until episode 9. I don't know if their characters improved in the later episodes). ML has terrible self control, almost beating up every criminal, only to be stopped by FL or another officer. He keeps calling people bastard and says, ""I'll rip you to pieces"" over and over. FL was very emotionless. I know she's emotionless for her job, but she's just boring. I was ok with her breathy voice, and then I started to hate it when that was ALL I heard. She was so monotone.
Some of the lines were so out of place. In episode 5, ML and FL talk about the criminal and his possible motives. ML then says, ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you'll get."" lol, WHAT IN THE WORLD?!?!
I hate how the first 5-10 minutes of a new episode was a recap of the old episode. They needed to fill the time, I guess.
I kept pausing and cringing, and my sister asked me why I was watching the drama.... sigh. Only for Kim Jae Wook...

I will say that one good thing this drama does is tension build up. Often times, I had to turn down the volume because it was creepy/suspenseful and I was scared of a possible jump scene. The killings did get to be a bit too much for me, so I had to fast forward through some of them. Don't watch this alone at night. You'll either get bad nightmares or start wondering if there's a serial killer nearby in your area ready to strike.

(and OMG, I HATED the ""clicking"" sounds!!! It was obviously teeth grinding noises and my teeth could feel it.....)

Kdramasins rant begins:
In episode 1, police was ok with drunk ML contaminating his wife's murder scene. ML's fellow officers said they couldn't ID her because she was so badly beaten, but when ML lifts up the cover, what was seen wasn't bloody and beaten at all. Investigators and criminals refuse to wear gloves alike. There was no DNA evidence when the murderer was touching the victims and their phones with his bare hands. In episode 4 when ML rescues the boy, he lets the boy talk to FL and doesn't rush upstairs, while the boy is supposedly bleeding out to death. In episode 5, they did not think to trace the IP and see who the website belonged to track down the criminal. FL is in the field when she's not a field officer, but head of the call department. FL interrogates suspects when that's not her job. FL makes a call while with a suspect in the interrogation room to warn ML that he was being set up. FL knows exactly what sounds to hear and hone in on when it should be an overload of noises for her. In episode 6, police is so incompetent the suspect finds cuff keys on the floor of the police van. It took FL a good couple of seconds to hear the struggle happening in the bathroom on the other side of the door (and she's supposed to have superhuman hearing). Chief Jang was so intent on arguing with FL that it was a suicide and not homicide, when strangulation marks should've been obvious, or at least logic should've been used as to HOW he set himself on fire (assuming they did their jobs and took away his belongings when they cuffed him, he has nothing to set himself with on fire). Even if one officer was corrupt, they all seem to miss the obvious evidence (i.e GDC's fall. Police should've seen blunt force trauma to his head and determine that it wasn't a suicide....). FL says with 100% confidence, ""the voice was of someone in their thirties,"" when in reality, some people sound older/younger than they really are.
I didn't include everything from the 9 episodes I watched. I'm sure that if I had watched the entire drama, I could write a whole lot more too.

Nothing Simple of Amazing!
I had high hopes for this drama and it exceeded each of those hopes. The plot was engaging, I didn't want to wait for another episode. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. The show had one overlapping case with smaller cases thrown in the mix so you didn't get bored waiting on developments of the bigger case and the villain. Another amazing villain actor that I never expected. Definitely worth a watch if you're into a bit of supernatural (her hearing was bordering supernatural levels) and detective work.

Different Crime Thriller
Short: Based in the 112 Emergency Call Center this one has a bit of a different premise which starts to look like a really interesting incident-per-episode but after a couple, it becomes a fairly standard police crime thriller where the team leader of the call center is going out in the field to chase bad guys... It's fun, the bad guy is ruthless, but there's a ton of inconsistencies. Recommended but don't expect a flawless story. Cast are on point.

Detail:
I had expectations of this one being different and for the first two or three episodes it really starts to deliver, they create this high energy moment when she presses the button and announces ""Code Zero!"" and everyone shifts gear, with the call center suddenly becoming the HQ coordination point for a remote team of police officers out aiming to resolve whatever the issue is within the ""Golden Time"" (the time that means highest success for saving lives). However, there's a back story of the male leads wife being murdered, and the female leads father being murdered - and this fairly rapidly takes over the story, leaving the Emergency Center concept for dust (mostly).

Overall, I want to say that I have really quite enjoyed it so I'll say that now just to put everything that follows in to some perspective. Definitely worth a watch if you're interested in the crime thriller genre, and particularly if you like really well depicted psycho bad guys (which this one really is). The story takes a few twists and misdirects you into who the bad guy is and a couple of other things, so it keeps you guessing. It's not the most complex of stories, but I felt it was highly entertaining.

Ok, so the flaws.

What the heck is the team leader for the 112 Emergency Center doing going out in the field ALL THE TIME ? She abandons her post frequently! It's as ludicrous as on Star Trek when the captain keeps going off on away missions, it just wouldn't happen, you're the boss, you're quite important, sit down and trust your team :)

She wants to hire two specific people when she forms the Golden Time team. One of them a former white hat hacker, he accepts and his value and contribution is totally clear throughout. He's the guy who can instantly access anything anywhere even if in reality such things just aren't online, but, let's not worry about that, it's ""magic"" and he's awesome :) It keeps the plot moving at a good pace. However, the other one initially says no and goes back to the Airport Police she was based at - during one of the 112 incidents however something happens and it makes her realise that joining the Golden Time team is where she really wants to be, brilliant moment, love it... but... I don't think she actually brought anything new to the team at all when she joined. She's supposed to be this great officer with multi lingual skills but she contributes nothing unique to the team in the slightest so I was left wondering why the female lead was so bothered about getting her on the team.

Last one - she has this unique ability with fantastic hearing, she can hear things nobody else can to the point that she has padded her room out with sound proofing (well, in reality it's actually echo proofing not sound proofing but... we'll let that slide) and sometimes she can tell the most amazing unrealistic things like listening through a mobile phone speaker she can tell if the ML needs to go left or right to navigate! Other times, it seems like her hearing is less good when that good hearing would be inconvenient to the story.

I'm of mixed opinion as to how I think it should have gone. On the one hand, I now *really* want a weekly procedural drama based around the call center (someone tell me if it exists :) ) but on the other I do quite like the overall plotline of this one and how it developed. As silly as it is for the call center team leader to keep going out in the field it did move things along nicely.

As I say, overall I enjoyed it. It's not without its flaws but it was entertaining and I am definitely looking forward to starting Season 2. This story *does* fully conclude, don't be concerned about the presence of subsequent seasons, Season 1 is properly finished. I have no idea if that holds true for future seasons but for this one, we're all good. :)

First, can we please take a moment to appreciate the miracle of the gods that is Kim Jae wook? God, like how could someone be this beautiful ???? and his acting is so subtle and he gets completely engrossed in the role he's playing, and I don't know what will happen to my heart after the finale but I'm in tears and just messed up. Anyway, I'm going to try and review this show without any more ranting about Jae wook ???? ahem, hopefully. Right, on to the actual review. I feel like I'm going to be in the minority here by saying much of this show was a little overrated. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with it at first look. Those first few episodes were great.

Then, I didn't know who the protagonist even is, is it the Golden Time Team leader woman? Or Jang Hyuk? His partner Baek Sung hyun gets severely injured and he's just going about doing other things. WTF? The characters interactions with each other is strictly business so what the hell am I supposed to root for? The son who I barely saw in maybe two episodes, tops? Who also btw they conveniently forget unless they want to use him for a plot line. I enjoyed the little mysteries constantly coming up, that was pretty much the only enjoyable thing because the main story arc was ruined by two main leads who had zero relatability. They just went about solving the plot lines, no deep actual conversation, no insights into their psyche, their needs wants, nothing except for 'that bad thing that happened in the past.' It just started to drag and became pointless after a while. Let's say leave the fact that the main leads don't feel any emotions for anyone period ???? (call me hyung or unni and I'll care for you BARELY for the length of an episode WTF ????) no relationship building over time, it doesn't have to be a romance, can't they just still care for SOMEONE???? It was all just a surface, shallow, story until then.

They put so much emphasis on making everything look good, they forgot to add substance to the script. Even the mystery plot got affected by the fact that the SECOND the ACTUAL villain appears, you know it's them ???????????????????? literally, where was the suspense? The person appears in way too late in the story! I've seen romantic comedies with better mystery plots (Do Bong Soon for instance). See, if you don't want to have romances and bromances, then make the main story arc something epic and subtle like Fargo. There was nothing subtle about Jang Hyuk's acting or anyone else for that matter! It was the typical ""who screams louder"" Korean drama fest so just make it Korean drama good then! The script was again, just okay.

Bad Guys at least had a fabulous script and epic bromance but Vile City had the same kind of issues VOICE has. All glitter and glamor but zero substance. I did cry a bunch of times, mostly for the secondary characters, like Yesung, when they show the stories and solve that was done brilliantly. Honestly, I was considering ditching it when Kim Jae wook showed up! !!! In love with him ???? even his acting was subtle and not loud, just wow. Honestly, I wouldn't have actually finished it if it wasn't for him. Btw, this show is really disturbing but that was the one thing I actually liked! They were not afraid to get their hands dirty. But having a script where at one point Jang Hyuk says to his nine year old son ""Men should always be brave"" when he's crying after being traumatized, made me question what year this show was made in ???? so yeah. Some really good stuff but an overwhelming amount of pointlessness and by the middle I was honestly cringing every time Jang Hyuk went on one of his stupid and pointless and terribly delivered tirades mostly ""I'll rip you apart blah blah"" and the female lead wasn't much better. The secondary characters were acting so much better.

The things that I fell in love with: The messed up darkness, visually it's shot so well aesthetically pleasing, the OST, and of course Jae wook! Even the story started getting more addictive after Birth of the Devil. But I have to admit, the final two episodes, sheer BRILLIANCE. I was completely speechless. Even the main leads annoying habits couldn't destroy that, so I basically went from a ten rating in the beginning, to a six in the middle, to an eight when Jae wook enters, to a straight ten for the last two episodes! So, I'm going to rate an overall 9 because in the end, this show gave me a lot more than it annoyed me and because Jae wook deserved it and whoever decided to make it so dark and messed up deserves it.

I've just finished this Kdrama yesterday and I was totally amazed by it. First of all, all actors were absolutely perfect. Especially Jang hyuk and all actors who've played the victims in this series. You, as a viewer, will feel every single emotion because of how well they acted. Some scenes were a little bit too slow. Most of the time, when the female lead was shown. This was kinda bothersome since her facial expression and how she handled things were somewhat repititive. But apart from that, she did good ! I love how you will see progress with every single episode. It creates a very good image of how everyone has lived and what has happened to them as well as why they behaved like they did. This is a MUST watch for every thriller/krimi/detective fan. The scenes were absolutely crazy!

I strongly recommend it, if you love to be thrilled.
I was already in love since the first airing. If I should compare it with the second and third seasons, I prefer this one, the second and third are kinda similar. It's a good quality product, to begin with. It's getting fiery when it's almost getting in touch with the end. The acting and cast, I really pleased with it. But about the ost, it does not really matter coz you'll focus more on the story. But some background music help construct the story. I'm not so close to re-watch but I definitely see myself do it!

I strongly recommend it.

I watched it because I saw there was already Season 2 and assumed it must have been good.
Lead Actor & Actress:
The male lead Jang Hyuk is one of the actor I like since I been watching his dramas since I was young, so I was excited to watch but the actress Lee Ha na is one of actress I tried to avoided watching as lead because of her kind of awkward acting but surprisingly she did her job pretty well in this drama and she suited her character. But character Jang Hyuk was playing kind of annoyed me for some reasons. I feel he should listens more to female lead, not always act tough and get in fights all the time but his character does improved in later eps.
Kim Jae Wook did an amazing job as psycho character. And he was pretty handsome which is a bonus for us.
Storyline:
It was quite an interesting concept and loves the cases they had in the drama but somehow in later eps I got bored. I feel like I was more interested in those small cases rather than finding out who the actually killer was because I feel like it was pretty obvious who is actual killer is. When they concentrated more on catching that killer I lost interest but I did watched till the end.
Sometimes I feel like cops in the drama were too slow and I got so frustrated watching when they dont move quick enough and just standing there or started talking with each other and I be there like:""Hey she/he is going to die....Stop fighting..Go and save them"". Overall the drama was okay and I finished till the end but is not the best crime drama I ever watched. The acting was great but some of the characters were annoying or useless. I dont hate the drama but I dont really recommend anyone to watch it unless you have too much time and love the leads.
OST:
I dont think I even remember any songs from the dramas.

Psychotic killer
The story line is rather interesting and thrilling but there are some brutal scenes that are difficult to watch. The actors/actress that play as Moo Jin Hyeok and Kang Kwon Joo perform well and make the ""Voice"" exciting to watch from the first episode to the end. Some side stories that is interrelated to the main story line. ""Voice"" could be shortened to 12 episodes since there are too many scenes that are repeated here and there. The good thing about this K-drama series is that it sticks to its core of the story and no ""love scene"" or ""sexual attraction"" between the two lead characters. The one that is difficult to stomach is that when we find out that Shim Dae Shik is the ""mole/rat"", it is typical K-drama series that the least expectant person is the ""mole/rat"".

When the fact opened up....
The drama ""voice"" season 1 tells the reliability of the golden time team led by Moo Jin Hyuk and detective Shim as the detective who handles cases in the field and Kang Gwon Joo who receives cases via phone calls. The Golden Time team always solves the case well within gold time (12 hours). Jang Hyuk's toughness and courage as a detective. Here I feel that Jang Hyuk is very suitable to be a detective because he is well known as time bombs that can go crazy catching criminals. Uniquely, here, he collaborates with a call center headed by Kang Gwon Joo who can hear above the average. She can hear voices in great detail, no matter how small the sound, She helped by Oh Hyun Ho who is an expert in tracking and Park Eun Soo who is an expert in multi-language. Unfortunately, Eun Soo's skill is yet to be shown in this season.

Cases that are accepted by the call center and in ""code zero"" status directly faced by Moo Jin Hyuk himself. Starting from the mutilation case, then ah ram, a 3-year-old child who was tortured by his mother who was abused and received cruel treatment from her stepfather, the case of Oh's stalker who nearly injured another person even Eun Soo with using hydrochloric acid, a case of a homeless shelter that turned out to be a clinical testing location and organ sales, etc. I always wonder ""Why"" Jin hyuk must catch criminals by himself and another cop mostly late and arrived just for cleared up the crime scene and arrested the criminals. In another that, This drama is really cool, it has shows a view from the past, when and after the incident happened. because most detective dramas only tell the background of the incident or only when the police are trying to find evidence to catch the culprit. No wonder why this drama will continue until season 4. This drama is also not naive like other dramas. What usually a detective gets fired or a prosecutor defends a guilty chaebol to the end does not apply in this drama.

Case by case is successfully resolved by the Golden Time Team to uncover the problems that killed Jin Hyuk's wife and Kang Center's father as police in an attempt to catch the murder of Oh Ji Hye, Jin Hyuk's wife who is famously known as Enhyung. -Dong case. Ji Hye works as a social worker for the homeless. She was close with Go Cheol Han, one of the homeless people who became victims of Moo Tae Gu's savagery, whose hobby is killing people with his iron ball until the victim's bones crush. Unfortunately, Ji Hye found out something about this. People who know about Moo Tae Gu's dirty deeds will surely die cruelly at his hands. The living witness who saw the incident, Gyeong Il also burned and died by nam sang the. WHen gyeong il caught after his action kidnapped and in an attempt to kill toward park eun byul because he has revenge because his mother had an affair with Eun Byul father. He also killed some people and burned alive his mother. In another case, Other people who cooperate with the police that is Park Bok Soon grandmother who was famous for the Surim-Dong case died hanged by Moo Tae Gu. The surim-dong case is the case of Park Bok Soon's grandmother who refused to sell her apartment. Unlucky, she was finally removed by being murdered then stored in a cupboard. Not only that, he threatened and plastic surgery someone to be park bok soon to cover up their actions. Madam Jang also became a victim after cooperating with the police. Her eyes were removed and her dead body covered up with plastic.

Moo Tae Gu is a psychopathic killer who is sadistic, cruel, and inhuman. Nam Sang Tae, the son of his father's trusted gangster, cleans up his every move. Even he became suspect in the Eunhyung-dong case and Madam Jang murder. At the end of his life, he also became a victim by Moo Tae Gu. Moo Tae Gu has also always been protected from the law by his father by bribed the police commissioner and prosecutor. His father did this to redeem his guilt feelings already turned his son into a monster after seeing his father accidentally killed his business partner who refused to obey his orders. Her mother also committed suicide. After that, Moo Tae Gu turned into a psychopath. The underground villa that had turned Moo Tae Gu into his place to kill homeless people when he wanted to hunt for prey. Thirty even more homeless already died as his victim
one of a sad scene which is Dae Shik as Jin Hyuk's detective partner forced to obey Nam Sang Tae order to cover up his murder when Nam Sang Tae's subordinate was accidentally killed during a fight with him. He also covered up his father's murder case when accidentally crashed someone who died on the spot. Dae Shik became a person in the police who had betrayed Jin Hyuk. With the condition that Jin Hyuk must not be hurt because he knows that his hyung will reopen JI Hye's murder case. Jin Hyuk and Kang Center are the two people who hunted and wanna kill by moo tae gu for bothering him. Honestly, when watched this drama. I'm really scared guys, really sadistic but really exciting.

For me, The ending was superb, cool, crazy, !! I was really satisfied. I thought Tae Gu would die when his action one on one with Jin Hyuk eh it turned out that he could still run away after being caught with his father's help. Until he was caught again by Jin Hyuk after he was trapped when he attempted to kill Kang Center. Jin Hyuk shot all his hands and feet. After that, he was taken to a psychiatric hospital. He died when all patients in there stabbed him brutally. The ending felt not real, it's like Fantasy but it's damn crazy. I'm really thankful with Jang Hyuk, Lee Jae Wook and Lee Ha Na's acting made this drama so real and so lively. . It's a shame that Jang Hyuk doesn't continue on voice 2 ☹.

For you... uri chingu that love detective and investigative drama lovers, like me. Come on, put this drama on your watchlist, and don't forget to watch it!! This is the first time I'm really scared to watch it. This drama is different from other detective dramas. Dabong ""Voice"" !! Can't wait to watch season 2 :))

Keeps you at the edge of your seat for the whole time
I like how the cases were really unexpected and interesting. I was intrigued from the get go.

Of course the acting was amazing but I have to say the story and the character development fell flat. The character and even the evil ones felt like they didn't have depth and their personalities are only skin deep. There's no developing of any relationship, it's just the main team solving case by case.

Sometimes it's really unrealistic that the team can save the day just in time every time. But besides from that, I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a show to keeps you at the edge of your seat every second of the way!

Very violent but some intriguing storylines
Viewers intending to watch this show should be aware that it is extremely violent, gory and depicts shocking levels of physical violence.

It is a mystery to me how such graphic violence can be rated as suitable for viewers from the age of 15 in S Korea!

Oddly enough, harmful objects such as the blade of a knife are blurred so us viewers aren't exposed to the shocking sight of a bare blade (?!) -- but seeing a killer smashing in the heads of their victims, people mindlessly kicking and bashing people (usually WOMEN) to a bloody pulp while they are lying on the floor begging for their lives (and they are NEVER ever trying to defend themselves, kick and scream and shout and cry or hit back) is shown at length and in detail...

I am really starting to hate this violence trope in Kdramas - specifically in crime/police thrillers...

I watched this show for Jang Hyuk and the acting was good (no surprise there!) but I was disgusted by the gore and violence. I liked the more humane side stories, when the police discover the scandalous exploitation of the poor, homeless, mentally-ill and help those victims.
Those storylines were very well-portrayed and I would have liked it if they had focused more on psychological insights to the characters (i.e. Moo Jin Hyuk's marriage before his wife was killed, his grief process, the father-son-relationship, Kang Kwon Joo's pursuit of her father's killer, her struggles/grief and determination to right past wrongs...) - but I guess this is just not that kind of show.

love thissss. i enjoyed thiss. i’m not really fond of hot tempered characters, but thankfully the male lead is just like that in the beginning. i especially loveee the idea of how the fenale lead mastered voice profiling skills and its not really like a mere gift or wtv. the cases are interesting tooo and so thrilling!! and love how some of those cases were inspired by past real cases. the pace is great too except that towards the last few eps it gets a littleee slow but its still okay. the two main characters were okay, smart too but sometimes not fast hahahah but its okay. overall, i enjoyed this and i find the cases thrilling eventhough theyre actually a bit cliche but the voice profiling and the emergency call centre made this drama different and more exciting.

This drama had an extreme love and hate relation with me.
It started extremely good, a lot of suspense and thriller that actually was following the storyline, the first two episodes let me breathless. But slowly that story started to fade away and gets farther from the first episode and seemed like more an American serial than a Korean one. I loved Jang Hyuk acting, it was so natural (a little bit exaggerated into the action scenes, probably) but I loved him, really! I can't say the same thing for the other protagonist, the story of her and her perfect ears actually didn't develop, they gave a glimpse of her in the hospital that had to learn the world throughout ears but this story was left behind without a warning. The cruel scenes were very realistic, but they didn't make it till the story turns out to be predictable on whos the killer, seemed like that everything was rushed after the 8 episode, just to make the show ends as soon as possible. That's pretty sad, because the plot was interesting but leaded to nothing.....

Good crime-solving, very annoying lead actress
The good:
1. Jang Hyuk - One of his finest acting in action-drama. He's like a mad dog when he's angry and just as passionate when trying to find victims and suspects.
2. Lee Jin Wook - The captain of the rescue team in Voice2. Another mad dog and also very convincing. I'm going to look out for his other dramas.
3. The crimes - The reported crimes are ones you really hear in the news. Gory most of the time. When the rescue team is on the move that's what fuels this drama.

The bad:
1. Kang's expressionless face - How can an actress be so devoid of facial expression? Each of her headshots looks exactly the same no matter the situation.
2. Kang's expressionless voice - The same monotone. Sometimes fast, sometimes faster. The same monotone.
3. Kang's selective hearing - Ok, she has a gift of hearing things others can't hear. But i think her real gift is that she can hear only those things that are relevant to the situation. Come on writer, if you want to show that she has a special gift, at least give a reason why her gift is very selective. otherwise, you should show that she actually hears soooo many things that it would drive her crazy.
4. In both seasons the writer has the habit of making the golden time team interview the caller first about non-urgent details before actually sending emergency teams to the scene. Drives me crazy each time.

I'm here for the crime-solving. everything else and especially Kang is a distraction.

Please turn your brain off now... thank you.
This one is a huge mixed bag for me. On the one hand, the story was pretty ridiculous. It stretches the realm of possibility at virtually every corner, and doesn't care if its ""explanations"" (if you can even call them that) make a lick of sense. But... on the other hand, I was still very interested to see how all the plot points would come to a head, and had at least a bit of fun anyways.

The biggest draw to this show would be Jang Hyuk's brow raising performance. I don't even know if you could call it ""good"" in the classic sense, as he really decides to play it as eccentric and weird when the script seems like it doesn't call for either? In any case, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen when he was doing his thing. Even in the first episode when we get his insane drunken moment (read: WTF?), I was thinking to myself I should probably be feeling bad for the guy right now, but the whole scene instead came across as just plain odd. Still, it was strangely captivating.

The other leads get the job done well enough. I wasn't nearly as bothered by the FL as many of the commenters here are. The rest of the story is watchable, despite a lot of predictable moments that mostly rely on the good guys' ability to be as stupid as humanly possible in a critical moment. Again, turn your brain off before jumping into this one. I don't think it strays from its early shown formula, so give it an episode or two to decide if you like it.

As my first foray into Kdramas, it was a little lackluster. However, decent enough that I'll eventually give season 2 a try.

watched this without any expectation, and yesss it turns out good. the storyline was okay and quite a good pace with a good acting. the main case which is about the killer was common and predictable, but the whole voice profiling was unique and very interesting. i mean, i don't know if that's actually exist but it was super cool. the first episode already hooked me and it keeps the tension till the end. although some part in the middle was kinda draggy and slow but the other small cases make up for that. the whole dark vibe cinematography really suits and makes the drama even better. gonna watch season 2 next hope it was as good or even better.

Yuck!!!
Too real for me….. I didn’t enjoy the blood, gore or evil intent behind the murders. The fact that the one guy doing the many killings is in power because of daddy is too old a tale and sadly too true at times. Anyone in power should be watching out for those who are weak and less than not exploiting others to fulfill selfish desires of their own greed. The second season was much the same and I have to say I’ll never pick it up again. I liked the idea of voice profiling and loved that side of the story but the gore and violence was too much for me.

The plot of this show is interesting and all of the actors are amazing. The three main leads (including the villain) show incredible acting skills. Especially the villain. That person absolutely have me chills. The side characters are great as well. Especially Oh Hyeon Ho (played by Ye Sung) and Park Eun Soo (played by Son Eun Seo). When those two were on screen together, those were my favorite scenes to watch. They just worked really well together.

My biggest issue with this show was the gore. Not the violence so much because since it's a cop show there has to be villains and I understand that, but it seemed at times that the gore that went along with the violence was gratuitous. Because of that, I often had to pause watching the show and watch something else for awhile. It was just a little much for me.

I almost lost interest from the second and third episode, the acting was fine in them but they didn't add anything to the main story, but I decided to continue as the first episode was so good. I'm glad I did, when I reached the mid-episodes I was completely hooked, watching multiple episodes a day, which I never normally do with K-Dramas.

The acting especially by the main two actors was brilliant, perhaps the best performances I have ever seen. I wonder why the main guy didn't return for the second and third episodes? (I probably just haven't found about it on the internet).

I loved the twists, turns, shocks that associated themselves with this show, and I'm definitely going to check out the next seasons. The only improvement I wish upon is to focus entirely on the story, instead of a couple of episodes which seemed to be a little irrelevant in my opinion.

Voice is a above average crime thriller drama with a very good background story, plot and interesting cases.
While watching this drama there is not one dull moment, it always keeps you on your toes. If not the adrenaline rush, its anger or frustration. There is always an emotion.
Each case always has a twist and it's not always what you think and this keeps you more hooked to the show.
The actors in this drama have done a fine job at portraying thier characters. Kim jae wook and jang hyuk especially.
The bgm and osts are pretty nice to hear but I personally felt at times that they didn't match the scenes.
The female characters is actually one of the coolest characters I have ever seen on drama land. she's strong, smart and rational. Her abilities and skills are mind blowing. I really can't wait to watch her again in the next season.

But I feel the opposite about the male lead's character. He was extremely emotional, impulsive and kinda hypocritical. His lines consist of mainly 2 words and he its really hard to hear him swear at every person he meets expect his son. Most of the frustration happened due to his meaningless actions.
Though the overall storyline is solid, the small inconsistencies and plot conveniences are present all through the story.
Still I would say it's worth it. It's entertaining and interesting to watch.

Far fetched
This was very dark at times; some truly horrible crimes and I'm surprised at the 'Teen' rating really.
Gripping story, good mix of characters, decent acting.
Lots of shouting though and a few really (like really, really) dumb moves, which spoilt it, sadly. The script writing isn't great (some very amateur dialogue), although the story idea is pretty good.
I have to mention a favourite actor (you'll know if you watch it) in one of the best serial killer portrayals I've ever seen, which definitely makes it worth watching.

Rollercoaster + not for sensitive watchers
The first episode was absolutely gut wrenching. I was not prepared for that.
Please note that it is quite violent and it also contains child abuse etc.
Some episodes left me with a bad feeling in my gut.

The story is great and it has a good plot. The music is on point and they don't drag out unnecessarily.

However, if I have to rate Ms. Kang. Wow, please someone shoot me already.
First of all, she's a cop, but she absolutely does not behave like one.
Cops are supposed to be trained, right? Well you'll question if she had training as a cop at all as she is vulnerable asf and she fends herself like an 80 year old ahjumma. This is my first annoyance.
Secondly, voice is pretty much about her ability to hear and her quest to find murderers.
Except... Every time she hears ANYTHING at all she just decides to stand there like an absolute babboon and wait half an episode (just kidding but at least 5 minutes) before taking action. Half of the time she just says ""I think I hear something"". No sheit bro, that's the whole point of the show???
*someone gets murdered or attacked in the next room* Her ability to hear more gets yet another eye catcher. ""I hear something"" She hears signs of a struggle: ""I think I hear something"". If I see smoke in the hallway, i'm not going to sit around and smell the air and wait until the whole building is on fire to then casually say ""I think I smell smoke"".

Moo Jin-Hyuk, played by Jang Hyuk, is a very good actor and very suited to play an angry and motivated by vengeance detective.

Just finished this drama yesterday and I'm satisfied with the storyline. It is really good. But there are some thing that I disagree. Some of the drama has video shaking as its effect and at some point it's unnecessary and make me dizzy. The crime scene is quite disturbing for me and I skipped it a bit. Another one that I find that Lee Ha Na's voice is not suitable with this drama. Bcs her voice is so soft and I feel less charismatic but her acting is good.

Anyway, despite all that, I gonna continue watch Voice 2!

I thoroughly enjoyed this drama. It met with things that I like: crime, fighting, mystery, thriller.

Although I barely like Korean thrillers because they miss the mark a lot for me, this type of thriller was OK.

I loved the cast. The chemistry wasn't strong but it wasn't weak either.

I said this contain spoilers because I had a few takeaways from this drama.

The main character was good at deciphering voices. That's how the series started. Then all of a sudden she could hear sounds but could never tell what it was. One episode had me saying 'what?' aloud because she could hear tapping on a cage hidden inside a cement wall but she couldn't hear footsteps coming right up behind her. That's how a few instances were in this series.

The main male lead was just angry throughout the whole series. I liked his fighting but he was just too angry. They should've called him 'angry dog' instead of 'crazy dog'.

The main villain....boy did they do too many closeups of his eyeball, mouth, hands....I'm thinking is the thriller part they were talking about? He was creepy I get that but at some points I really wanted him to just die already. Plus the clicking of the teeth from the two bad guys hurt my ears.

I don't know how I felt about the last episode. I did like how it went off. I guess I'm just impatient with how Korea wrap up the very last episode of their dramas. They either get it right or the majority of the time they get it wrong. Plus the first 40 minutes were drawn out and then in the end they just talked about how the other scenarios ended for the other bad guys.

I'm glad there's four seasons to this. Korea barely make sequels so when I saw there were three more series I feel compelled to watch. This time I feel like I'm being spoiled at this point.

Good potential but not captivating enough
Voice tells the story of Moo Jinhyuk, a police officer, and criminal voice profiler Kang Kwonju as they team up to form the ""Golden Time"" team and solve cases. The show has a very interesting premise. The serial murders that tie the two protagonists together is complicated and intriguing. However, this captivating factor quickly diminishes when we find out the real culprit halfway through the series. Yes, the serial killer is revealed to the audience really early on. Then watching our protagonists fumble and make really avoidable mistakes is when my interest started to dwindle.

I did think that voice profiling part of the show is quite interesting, since I've only watched another show with a voice profiler (Tell Me What You Saw), but I struggled to like our resident profiler. Kang Kwongju really got on my nerves each episode so this made it difficult to continue. Moo Jinhyuk isn't that much better. He spends most of his time raising his voice when things don't go his way. Yet the two of them work well together, kudos to them.

Voice begins to drag slowly past episode 6. The pacing isn't great and the reveals are ill-timed. Though, the premise is quite good.

Dropped. Script is confusing and nonsensical. Seriously, so many times you think ""What? I'm confused."" Or worse, and this happens more often, you thing ""Oh my god, that was the stupidest thing anyone has done ever."" Bad guy is boring. Tons of violence and blood, especially against children, and women. Story isn't enough to make it worth sitting through it.

Repetitive
Premise is intriguing but execution is lacking. Every case goes like this: FL uses her super hearing to solve cases and guide the ML who then goes around fighting all the baddies. Rinse and repeat. There is an overarching story about how FL""s father was murdered but I honestly lost interest with all the repetitive cases. How they managed to squeeze 4 seasons out of this I do not know. Not to mention FL's acting is lacking and only has a few facial expressions YET they keep her for 4 seasons while changing the ML each season.

This series have a good premise, an interesting twist to a standard crime drama, but I don’t think it’s executed well.

There are too many waiting scene, waiting for something to happen. Just long take without any meaning other than making the run time longer. There are also a lot of waiting around and repeating a scene from another angle that is as boring as the first time it’s shown.

There are also a lot of stupid decisions that doesn’t make sense from the characters. Like when you’re in a dangerous situation, get outside... not just running around inside. If there’s someone hurt, don’t just ask them if their ok, get them outside to get some help. It’s too stupid and cliche in a bad way.

Cannot stand it any more. So I decide to drop it after only watching 5 episodes.

I really wish more attention was paid to details with this show. The main detective is an actor I've enjoyed watching in other series. They've focused too much on the depiction of the episodic crimes but not so much on what makes sense.

If the voice profiler has supernatural hearing, you would think she would be overwhelmed by noise instead of being able to narrow down certain sounds that just happen to break the cases. When someone is on the phone and she's standing right beside them, yet unable to hear the conversation on the other end? As for the murders, I get that the whole concept of the call center requires victims to have access to their phones in order for her to hear what's going on but the realism of this area should have been written better.

The first case was already off the mark when she knew the woman was hiding. Even if her coworker did reach over and call the victim back, she made no effort to stop him. This doesn't make any common sense and less so when she was knowingly aware of what could happen. It was also extremely irritating when the woman told her the church she was nearby and yet no one seemed to make an effort to do much more other than to sit and listen in apparent shock. With the second case as an example, does it make sense for a serial killer to simply leave an unconscious body in a building without being tied up or taking away her phone? I don't even care much about them putting enormous effort into detailing the crimes but at least the flaws shouldn't be so glaring. The annoying aspect is how brutal or traumatized criminals suddenly feel remorse through her saying a few words. This severely downplays the reality of those suffering in our world.

As much as I want to continue watching, even for those few actors I appreciate, this one will have to be dropped. The higher marks despite dropping this one is due to the other actors less the lead female.

This drama was so good! If you want intense stories and good characters then this is the drama for you. The two leads killed it and i loved every scene they had together. The twists and turns were always coming. I will say towards the last few episodes it gets kinda wonky with the way it plays out, but well worth the watch. I loved every single person in the call center and loved their individual personalities and how they shined through on their episodes. The story can be frustrating at times, but the actors make it.

This is rubbish!
This is total rubbish! I don't think I've watched such a bad show before. It is through and through ridiculous. Totally unbelievable, terrible dialogues, repetitive, lots of plot holes and bad acting by the majority of the cast. Only reason I kept watching is Kim Jae Wook - 10 out of 10 stars for his portrayal of a mad serial killer. If you just watch for him don't start watching before episode 8 and don't hesitate to fast forward just to see his scenes. You won't miss anything! I don't get the higher ratings for this show or why it got more seasons.

A power-struggle between morals.
I started watching 'Extracurricular' on a whim, I didn't think much of it and just wanted to see something that was on Netflix. The simple action of watching one episode turned into a 10 h binge, and I have to tell you it was one hell of a ride. This drama didn't hook me on the first episode, I felt a bit hesitant: Will this be another unrealistic shitty teen thug type of story? But nonetheless I continued.

After the second episode I knew, this is something else. The premise seems simple enough, a normal setup for a Korean thriller/action movie but this took it deeper. During the 10 episodes the viewer get to know its main character Oh Jisoo and his contrasting behaviors as well as his partner Bae Gyu Ri. The character work on these two was phenomenal, I loved seeing their facades crack little by little to show what these young humans held within themselves all along. Although they commit actions that goes by the law of morals you cannot help but route for this unfortunate pair. I personally related to the characters, especially to Bae Gyu Ri and her struggles to keep her image in front of her parents, the school and Jisoo. Although the circumstances that these characters goes through is unrealistic you can draw similarities to their struggles of fitting in, money, grades and love.

The acting was simply amazing! Nothing more is needed to say, all cast members seemed to act well in their parts and the production was done so smoothly that I almost forgot that it was all an act.

Well all I can say is that this blew me away, I was chocked at the amount of enjoyment I felt watching this short but thrilling drama. Everyone that enjoys to feel nervous and wants to see something a bit fucked up and dark: 'Extracurricular' is something for you!

WOW. I was already excited when this drama was announced because of Kim Donghee and Nam Yoonsoo (who I mostly just saw in music videos), but I think I severely underestimated how much I liked the show. It's a relatively short watch-- ten hour long episodes, which also means it's all too tempting to binge. Which I did. And I have no regrets.

Both Extracurricular and How to Buy a Friend were really refreshing takes on the high school genre, which I had previously lost interest in due to the fact that most dramas of the same vein were now being reduced to simple, relatively mundane rom-coms. Having attempted to watch many other dramas this year that felt like they dragged on aimlessly, the fast pacing was a huge source of relief.

The main characters are, for the most part, morally ambiguous. The world of Extracurricular isn't solely black and white-- there are various shades of grey in between, which makes them all the more fascinating to watch. The cast does a great job of delivering their roles, and while I initially took it up for the boys, I ended up falling for Park Joo Hyun (I can't wait to see what kind of roles she'll be doing next!) Kim Donghee did a great job of embodying the role of the reluctant, disillusioned antihero. I also loved the snappy dialogue and the dynamics between the characters.

The plot isn't entirely unpredictable, but that didn't take away from the story itself. I was still on the edge of my seat at every turn, both anticipating and dreading what would come next. Overall a really fun watch.

Let's just say, one of the best shows I've watched. There's no exaggeration in that statement. It is what it is. I wanted to talk about this show because is something I needed.

I'm gonna talk first about Kim Dong Hee. I'm very happy because it's his first main role, one of my favourite actors on the rise. He became popular through his participation in A-Teen, Sky Castle or Itaeweon Class. He's done a great job. I love his acting. The other actors done a great job too. I only knew Nam Yoon-soo. I've never seen any work of the main girls. But I love their acting. Really. All of them were great.

The other thing I wanna talk is about Jisoo. Everyone is debating whether is a victim and in a way he is but he's definitely not. Like sir, this whole sex trafficking side hustle you have is legit the not smartest thing you could do but considering his background and the struggles he's going trough, made me realize, people will do anything for some quick money. Especially if they are motivated to achieve a dream.

Dreams are expensive like Jisoo highlighted and made me think about how money hungry human beings actually are. Even the rich (Gyuri) can't get enough.
I don't wanna talk about Gyuri because oh my god... (SOMETIMES I HATE HER). Gyuri got Jisoo in some deeper things then anticipated and it's also bad on Jisoo's part because he listened to her. Which was because of him liking her a lot (ANOTHER THING I HATE BECAUSE REALLY JISOO IS TOO SUBMISSIVE).
Overall, I thought the drama was good. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat.

10/10 would recommend :)

A Drama Not Meant for Everyone (A Hidden Masterpiece)
Extracurriculars may be one of the most misunderstood dramas in recent years. One of the most common criticisms I have seen are that the characters lack development, lack a well structured backstory, or make ""foolish"" decisions; these are also relatively true remarks. However, one would be remiss to think that it is simply the antithesis of these ""criticisms"" that makes a great, but more importantly, consistent story. How foolish would it be if people accused Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or Sophocles' Oedipus of being poor plays because the characters lack development or the deuteragonist and supporting characters lacked comprehensive backstories?

""The true sense of tragedy is the deeper insight, that it is not his own individual sins that the hero atones for, but original sin, i.e., the crime of existence itself.""
""A man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills.""
- Arthur Schopenhauer
Extracurricular depicts a Schopenhauerian account of tragedy. In other words, an account that comprehensively acknowledges the existence and difficulties of a pessimistic reality. In fact, one could go one step further and view this series as an experiment: It presents a handful of antiheroes whose environment is constantly out to change them and mold them of their essence to align with the status quo. If they desire to remain who they are and hold onto their innermost desires (e.g., Jisoo - success, Gyu-ri - freedom, Min-hee - acceptance/love, Mr. Lee - worthiness), they must directly challenge that world. What will happen when the world stubbornly acts contrary to the characters' wills? What does it take for the characters to accomplish their desires and to escape their misfortunes?

These questions are what the series constantly asks until its end. Thus, if you were expecting a series where everything aligns perfectly then this is not for you. You should expect the opposite and have almost every external forces working against the characters. If you were expecting the characters to be virtuous or to be bounded by Morality, then this series is not for you. The series will focus on the descriptive elements of reality and show how the ego may wrestle with these concepts to preserve itself. If you desire a series for casual viewing, this show may not be for you. Many times, it requires the viewers to be attentive to the dialogue and the details in order to fully grasp why a character was motivated to act in such a way. I have seen many commentators and critics either question some aspects of the show, or, even worse, accuse it of bad writing, when often, it was them who were not attentive enough.
On the other hand, if you wish to try out an unconventional series filled with many thoughtful and reflective concepts (and social commentaries); a series that is not afraid of delving into the darker natures of reality, I highly recommend it.

I started this drama out of boredom and after seeing many recommendations about it....I didn't realize this was going to turn into a 10-hour marathon with not even a food break in between episodes. This is how immersed and fascinated I was by this drama.

Highest selling point of the drama? Its plot. I was expecting kids running a good grades related business, instead I got a high school outcast who could give any gangster/killer/healer dramas a run for their money. You would think this is not very realistic and yet through the screenwriting, acting and directing they effortlessly make you believe it's real.
More impressively they make you root for our main character regardless of how immoral or unethical are the things he does.

Extracurricular offers a refreshing take on the high school genre far away from cheesy and innocent first loves and yet much closer to today's reality of high school (to a certain extent). I'm glad this is a Netflix production, in fact had it been picked up by any other channel I doubt they would have shown such mature and triggering subjects at least not at a high school level.

TL;DR: Must watch drama! Probably one of the best dramas this year.

Disturbing story of suffering people.
It's hard for me to wrap my head around what I have just seen and what exactly I was supposed to get out of watching this show.

The idea behind the story and the issues presented were extremely interesting, but at some point I had a feeling as if too much was happening in too quick of a pace with too much of over the top action. It moved from dark psychological school thriller to dark action flick? I felt like instead of giving us a cohesive story, the writer wanted to outdo himself by writing more extra and shocking scenes and plot lines one after the other.

The biggest problem I had was the fact some characters did not feel grounded in the story. Gi Tae and Hae Gyung were the two that stood out for me the most and I failed to understand them and their motivations. The change from school bully and teen delinquent to whatever Gi Tae became at the end seems random. Hae Gyung's introduction to the plot and her obsession over the case were also questionable.

On the bright side (if you can even call it that), all the characters were bad people, morally gray at best. While it was refreshing and interesting to watch a show where there are no heroes and no one to truly root for, it can also make you feel depressed and overwhelmed.

Some plot lines that were introduced led nowhere and were mere devices to push the characters into a corner, hence never got a proper closure, like the whole side story of Ji Soo's father or the guy Gyuri's parents worked with, that clearly was interested in her.

But then, truth to be told, the whole drama had no closure and clear cut ending. The last few scenes literally presented more new questions than answers. With that heavy of a story, leaving viewers without proper explanation may be risky. I myself feel as if my brain was just turned into pudding and any attempts to understand the ending or certain plots would lead me to more confusion and frustration.

The acting was quite a masterpiece. All the lead actors aced their roles, which were not easy to pull off. To sell a story, performers often use their own experience as a reference, but with crazy stuff happening in this show, it's hard to even imagine what the characters would feel, not to mention act it out. On other technicalities, it was beautifully shot. While the pictures were gruesome at times, I still enjoyed the camera work, use of colors and shadows and the transitions between the scenes.

Overall, not a drama for everyone. Gore, death, pain, suffering, abuse, mental and physical struggle - it's a perfect combination to get yourself in a depressive state or murderous mood. I took my sweet time watching this drama, not being able to watch more than one episode per day. But then binged watched the last three just to get it over with. While, in some weird way, I enjoyed the process of watching, I also feel exhausted and happy it's finally over.

Extracurricular is unlike any highschool k-drama I have ever seen. This show takes a very raw, and dark take on highschool students and leaves its viewers at the very edge of their seats. Each episode made my heart race and left craving for more. The plot itself is very interesting and unique. The main character is a highschool student who handles a protection service for sex workers. Thus you can already tell that this is a show that really makes its viewers guess their values. Should prostitution be legalized? And is it okay to route for a highschool student who does this? He is running a protection service so he isn't a pimp, right? Albeit, since prostitution is illegal in South Korea, things become a lot more complicated and it isn't simply a discussion of ethics. I was often quite conflicted whilst watching this show, but I also felt myself facing our horrifying reality. Like the movie Parasite, I feel like this show holds many deep messages and makes you think about the hierarchy system in our society + the importance of the social determinants of health.

Other than that, the acting, music, production, and direction are all fantastic. I was in awe of all actors! Kim Dong Hee really proved himself to be a versatile actor! I was especially surprised to see Nam Yoon Soo's role! In Temperature of Love, he completely made me fall in love with him, yet in this show, the mere sight of him annoyed me. Park Joo Hyun and Jung Da Bin also did a phenomenal job!

The show is a little exhausting to binge since it is very dark. However, it is a very thought-provoking show written in an excellent manner. There are many twists and great character development. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers, then this one is definitely made for you!!

Sorry if this goes against the general opinion but this drama is just a giant ball of frustration and disappointment for me.

1. The beginning of the episode was interesting but then it just gets boring.
2. The main characters in the show are just really unlikable and there are no character development at all.
3. Its just stupid to think that the main character is smart and daring enough to run his security/pimp operation but then all of his other actions shows him just being a wimpy, indecisive and scared kid.
4. No backstory to explain what happened or why the characters are in these situation. Pretty convenient that Jisoo just happened to be saved by an ex-military man and proceeds to form a loyal partnership?
5. Positive is when we are not being frustrated, we are treated to some good and thrilling scenes that keeps you wanting more.

Is the drama doing something wrong or right when I start actively disliking the Detective for investigating so deeply even though I know she's the one whose clearly in the right?
Which is to say I loved this drama and a big part of that is because it did a good job you getting you deeply invested and rooting for our protagonists even though you know they're doing some seriously illegal, unethical stuff. Oh Jisoo is the clever underdog who dreams of an average life that his circumstances might never get him and you can't help but get attached immediately. Kim Donghee is a really great actor, I hope his star only rises from here. Bae Gyuri meanwhile is privileged but trapped and definitely sociopaths on some level. I'm pretty certain her connection with Jisoo is the first genuine one she's had which makes their story so much sadder. She was the clear highlight for me, even though she's manipulative and unlikable she's undeniably clever and quick on her feet and just so enjoyable to watch. I wanted her happiness as much as Jisoo's! I'll be keeping an eye out for Park Joo Hyun's future projects!

The drama is graphic and drops in heavy topics when it comes to sex work and the criminal underworld so I'd avoid if those topics are uncomfortable for you. But otherwise I highly recommend! It's a rollercoaster with our teen leads as all of them navigate a dangerous world none of them are fully equipped for and attempt to somehow come out the other end unscathed. It's definitely dark and angsty but like watching a crash you can't tear your eyes from!
P.S. No spoilers but the ending is slightly open-ended if that's also something you avoid.

Overrated
I found myself thinking that I just wasted 10 hours watching this drama. This could have been impactful because it dealt with the serious subject of crimes committed by high school students but the story did not move me. The problem was the way it was presented. There was no depth. Jisoo, the central character had an absentee father, his partner in crime Kyoo Ri's parents seemed to have subjected her to abuse but there was no way for the viewers to find out more about the dynamics that defined the two characters' relationship with their parents. It would have been clearer if there was a bit of a background story that explained Jisoo and Kyoo Ri's damaged characters. There was also no backstory with the rest of the characters ie, Mr. Lee, how he became involved with Jisoo, Minhee, how she turned into a prostitute and Kitae, the bully and abusive boyfriend.

The characters were so unlikeable. Jisoo, at the beginning gave the impression of an intelligent kid with a heart that somehow lost his way. And then, he turned into a snivelling idiot who was in over his head. Then there's Kyoo Ri who caused Jisoo to unravel; she manipulated him and her stupidity almost killed both of them.

It's like a watching a hodge podge of a story with a terrible ending. Don't waste your time on this drama.

"" Extracurricular "" had an interesting story, but there were many flaws for this drama that lessen the enjoyment.

Though the issues that extracurricular is dealing with are not the typical korean school drama presents, even though the angst, drama and having the character hit a low point is part of the korean drama repertoire, the drama did a good job with dealing with them, keeping the pace fast and the cinematography dark and moody. So, the idea was there and so were the elements to make a good psychological thriller, however, the drama didn't succeed in doing so.

First of all, the characters, not all of them, but the main ones, were annoying. Actually, the leading lady was unlikable and not easy to root for, in a drama were you have to like the criminals. The main character was a bit too toned down, with the title of genius being only a tag that followed him, but in reality, or, at least as far as the drama showed us, he was just a boy with a good idea, but lonely and in a desperate situation. The characters overall were acting way too mature for their age and it was difficult to be believable.

Second of all, the drama had its boring moments. The whole action thing got tiring to watch after it followed one twist after the other and the frustrating moments were too much. And yet, somehow, they managed to get the interest hit low beats towards the end. However, the ending was nicely managed. The performances, also, were brilliant from everyone in the cast, even though most of them are young actors.

So, overall, six out of ten.

Jaw-droppingly GOOD! A show about survival.
Ok so one night I was on the Netflix front page and impulsively clicked on this drama because of Kim Donghee's face in the preview; seeing it pop up was a pleasant surprise! Since I really enjoyed his portrayal of Hamin in A-Teen, I had high hopes and was super excited to watch him act in another high school drama. Turns out his new role as Jisoo, like Hamin, fits that straight-A model student trope, so clearly he excels at these types of characters.

In the many directions this drama could've gone, I gotta say I never expected this drama to turn out this way. Don't be fooled by the label of ""high school drama"". If you think this is going to be your typical high school rom-com with conflicts related to academic pressure, social belonging, people drama, and filial expectations, you're in a for a big surprise because this drama takes all of these to the next level.

*Just how far are you willing to go to ensure a good, stable future?*
This drama raises the question of the moral integrity of criminals. Are crimes crimes regardless of who is doing it and what they do, or are they forgivable under special circumstances? Are they always driven by greed? What if they were necessary for survival and weren't hurting anyone? Those were the questions floating in my mind as I watched.

Our male protagonist, Jisoo, is this hard-working, ordinary high school student who normally keeps to himself and lives a pretty mundane life. Except the one thing people around him don't know is that he anonymously works as the head honcho of a prostitution, or as he likes to put it, ""protection service"" app that pairs buyers (prostitutes/gigolos) with sellers (clients). If the participant is confronted with a dangerous situation, one middle-aged man named Lee Wang Cheol's job is to step up and protect them. So he ends up doing most of the dirty work, while Jisoo organizes everything behind the scenes.

In the beginning, we learn that Jisoo lives alone. Both his parents abandoned him years earlier, leaving him to fend for himself. That's why he needs this high-paying job and uses the money he makes from this job to pay for all his tuition, fees, and bills. As viewers watch scenes displaying his work ethics at school while doing his job at the same time all for the sake of achieving his dreams to graduate, we find ourselves admiring his level of conscientiousness and can't help but empathize with him, even though deep down we understand what he is doing is wrong. At least in my case, I was rooting for him the whole time. It didn't seem right to not want a good kid like him to succeed in life, so I kept praying that he wouldn't get caught. haha

Then a girl named Bae Gyuri, a member of the same club Jisoo is in, comes along and that moment was when everything changed. She eventually found out about Jisoo's secret part-time job through snooping through his stuff. Eager to escape her constricting life, she told Jisoo that she wanted in. Although Jisoo was reluctant at first, after multiple blackmail threats of exposure and destruction from Gyuri, the two agreed to join forces, becoming partners-in-crime. Their relationship dynamic and vibes reminded me a lot of the main characters in another Netflix show I love called The End of the F***ing World.

Soon after the two got caught up in dangerous situations they never thought they'd be in. People who were against the app sought out their identities and wanted revenge on them. Jisoo's plans of staying safe through distancing himself backfires and things turn into a matter of life and death. The two start lying, fleeing, and doing everything they can to save their source of income. I had to sit and watch as Jisoo's life started falling apart little by little and the worst part is there was nothing I could do about it. I guess the thing that shocked me most was how far he was willing to go to keep his job a secret. Of course, if caught, he would get sent to jail but curiously, in his mind, not graduating and having a stable career was worse than getting arrested. The frustration felt as if taking one step forward was two steps back. Every attempt at concealing themselves only made matters worse.

By the end, the character I became extremely attached to was Mr. Wang Cheol. Him acting as a (grand)father figure to Minhee made my heart ache. Hats off to Choi Minsoo for his realistic, melancholic portrayal. You can tell he is wise, really cares for Minhee and would do anything to protect her despite her protests. That's why I was so affected by his death. Although I saw it coming, I still bawled my eyes out during the final battle scene between him and the karaoke house owner. The coolest thing about this Ahjussi, though, was how tanky he was. haha I mean he was able to withstand damage from a mob's attack AND getting a f*cking axe in his back, started walking not long after he woke up after being unconscious, went back to fighting a larger mob, suffered repeated punches, kicks and stabs, and still ended up having the strength to beat the shit of psycho karaoke house owner. What an absolute legend!!! I respect his commitment and sense of duty to the job.

Kitae was the character I didn't know how to feel about at the end. I detested the way he bullied the kids for no reason. Just seeing his smug face made my blood boil. However the last few episodes somewhat humanized him as it depicted his heroism. I think they were supposed to be his redemption episodes since he stood up for Minhee. But don't hate me if I say I can't forgive him for being a d*ck and a heartless boyfriend to her. But now that I think about it, the question again is is he truly worse than Jisoo? Or Gyuri?

The final thing I want to mention was the creativity in the host of symbols and metaphors scattered throughout the drama. Scenes like the one of Gyuri imagining bullets through her parent's head represented the true feelings towards her parents. The hermit crab represented Jisoo tendency to retreat into his shell and when his dad stepped on it, he was crushed as well. The self-burial dream scene represented his own (metaphoric?) death and the loss of hope for his future. Every scene was incredibly well shot and delivered. The actors performances were mind-blowingly intense and raw. When they sobbed, screamed, and cursed, I was able to feel their mental distress and insanity through the screen. These actors will definitely go far in the future.

As for whether I would recommend this drama, as much as I love this show, I can't say it's for everyone. If you like fast-paced, dark shows and can handle seeing lots of blood on screen, I'd check it out. They should have put a trigger warning because there are some R-rated scenes. The violence can be pretty shocking. I'm glad I gave this a shot though. This might be my favorite drama this year thus far!

What a wild ride!
DAEBAK in all caps!!! This drama was such an exciting and wild ride and so easy to binge. I started watching it randomly because it showed up in my Netflix recommendations and I'm so glad I didn't judge it by its teenage angst looks. This really is a thriller more than anything, full of unexpected and extremely frustrating twists. It's also super dark, and violent, so don't let the High School setting fool you. More than anything it's a twisted coming of age story about a shy and awkwardly passive yet extremely ambitious student who's nothing like he seems.

Kim Dong Hee is brilliant as Ji Soo! I love when characters who should be ""bad"" are the story's hero. There's something fun about rooting for the supposed villain, and Ji Soo is so sympathetic that I was invested in his story from the very beginning. This is also the story of the most toxic relationship ever! That's where Park Joo Hyun comes in as Bae Gyu Ri. They are a great match in the worst way and I loved despising her, although she too had her sympathetic moments. Their relationship felt real, not just playing up cheesy chemistry. This isn't really a romance, it's more about a deep connection between two unlikely friends that gets way out of control. Still, the dynamic between her aggressive narcissistic personality and his soft-spoken and passive nature became addictive. I wasn't impressed with either of them in the dramas I've seen each of them in previously (A Piece of Your Mind, and Itaewon Class), but I was very impressed with them both in this.

The entire cast is also amazing! With a story like this is very easy to get on a soapbox and make the characters too one dimensional just to make a point. The cast helped make all the most unbelievable moments seem plausible. I absolutely loved Mr. Lee and the Homeroom teacher. Min Hee and Kwak Ki Tae were annoying and also very real. The true villains were a little campy but still sinister enough to be effectively scary. The character I liked the least was the female cop, but that's not because of her performance. I really cared about what happened to all of the characters, and that's impressive for a shorter drama.

However, the heart of this story is literally watching how one bad thing slowly leads to another until the story picks up to an unrelenting pace. It's like watching a train fly off the track and keep picking up speed. This is the kind of story that makes you want to yell at characters through the screen for their actions! I liked the earlier episodes better than the later ones, the final episodes were much more action-focused, but I was hooked the entire time. It also all happens at a pretty fast pace since there are only 10 episodes, which felt like the perfect amount for this story, although I do wish it had a better ending. That's my only complaint. I can appreciate the imagery, and there are a lot of cool imagery driven scenes, but I just want to warn folks that the ending is an open one. Whether that's leaving room for a second season I don't know, but I wish they just had a definitive end. This didn't ruin the story at all for me, it just stopped me from rating it a 10.

Would I watch this again? Definitely. The thrill of the unpredictable would be gone but I think rewatching Ji Soo's journey, knowing where it all leads, would still be very entertaining. It's also visually exciting, so there's no way that I would be bored.

Overall I would definitely recommend this drama, but with a warning for those who find the subject matter too sensitive. The lines between what's morally right and wrong are continuously crossed (that's obvious by the disclaimer with each episode). I personally found it refreshing that a KDrama wasn't afraid to get gritty with the subject-matter without adding a preachy moral lesson. I also like stories about imperfect characters and this drama has plenty. Don't judge a book by its cover is definitely a reoccurring theme. This drama is the perfect example of that, with the perfect title too. If you're looking for an addictive and easily binge-able drama, with a teen Bonnie and Clyde meets Fight Club's self-discovery sprinkled with Parasite's morality mood, then without giving too much away I definitely recommend that you add this drama to your watch queue. And If it's all too intense it's the perfect length for a one day binge with still some time to watch an episode of something more lighthearted once you're done. Or, if you're like me, you can start watching it all over again.

Despite the many good reviews on this drama, I felt that this is the most stressful and frustrating K-series I have ever watched. This drama sets such a high expectation for the viewers with the unique storyline but it fails to deliver what was expected of the drama.

In terms of the story writing, I felt that the foundation of the series as to why each character behaves in such a way does not justify their actions. This is probably due to the poor script writing which ends up ruining such a good series that could have been the best K-series if done right. The most frustrating thing about the show is probably the fact that the ""genius"" male lead isn't a genius at all. He made alot of mistakes that could have been well avoided. The show kinda felt like it was trying to achieve the level of money heist where the protagonist is well liked by the people despite the wrong doing but yet due to the conservative thinking, they decide to fall back to its safety net where the show served as a lesson for us to think about how each mistake leads to a dire consequence and there is no turning back.

Despite the poor writing, I must commend the actors and actresses for their emotional and impactful acting. Their character were however, difficult to relate to which results in a lot of conflict trying to understand how each character felt and why they make certain decision.

Regardless, I managed to finish the series as it kept me on the edge with every episode and made me continue watching as I had to find out what will happen next.

Lately I got tired of the same old K-Drama doing the same old thing and all the cliches and predictable things happening again and again. And then this gem appeared. I actually don't write reviews unless I really like a drama, so this is definitely one of them.

At first I wasn't sure whether I should watch Extracurricular because of the trailer that didn't really speak to me. (Specifically the girl shooting her parents by whistling and the gory genre is not up my alley) But nonetheless clicked on it and didn't stop bingewatching until I finished its short but sweet 10 eps.
Yes. its that good.

-Main Characters
I loved the male lead's unique personality (awkward potato at first, but very chaotic neutral near the end) But as the story went on the awkward potato became less awkward and more things started happening not according to what i thought he was like in the beginning. So it fell a bit into the abyss of -every male leads personality ever- . Luckily because of the story and the choices he got to make in that story made that abyss a lot more -background. Near the end his personality became a bit more stable, and some traits came back more frequently (but darker hehehe).

I was amazed at the female lead's personality, which sadly seems to be an unpopular opinion. Personally I wouldn't like FLs who are the forever damsels in distress and cant seem to live their lives without the male lead saving them. But as a matter of fact, Gyu Ri was more badass than Ji Soo throughout the whole drama. What people found annoying (From what I've read) is that she is born in a rich family and shouldn't mind others' businesses. But what no one seems to get is the way she is feeling and her goals/ intentions, and just describe her as annoying because she doesn't do exactly what the male lead wants her to do. That exact point makes her a more believable and realistic female character.

Story
The initial setup was amazing, you immediately notice this is not your usual Korean drama. The amount of swearing, violence, the prostitution plot and mentioning of things that are usually not mentioned in kdrama ever (homosexuality for example) are already a few of the ways why this show is unique. They even had a few non-korean pop culture references (Ji Soo underlined the sentence 'Life is strange before the storm hits' for example)

The story itself is almost completely unpredictable. its a rollercoaster ride in the dark and you missed all the safety exits, whereas now it is impossible to get off. The premise started out fairly simple (except the ml being a pimp basically) with not much going on, tho the further you get the darker the issues become. Until you reach the point they cant get out, nor do you know where you would have gotten out if you were one of the lead characters. Near the end the choices they made became somewhat illogical, but not unbelievable (still could figure out the why) and the angst was very well portrayed in those situations. I cant tell much else without spoiling so I hope I at least convinced one person to go and watch this very good and addictive show.

(I gave the music an 8 since it was good but not 'I need to shazam this' -good. Rewatch value became an 8 because i never rewatch anything, yet feel like it wouldnt be boring to rewatch it if I wanted to)

Ps: I loved kwak ki's dimples, and the old (not that old but ok) -man, also really hoping for a season 2!

BEST HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA OF 2020
As many people before me have already said, this is not your typical high school drama. This not the typical love triangle thing or rich-poor story (I’m not saying they’re bad or anything just not my genre - the only high school dramas I’ve seen are ‘Extraordinary you’ which had the whole comic world thing which made it exciting and maybe ‘Cinderella and the four knights’. I wanted to watch the ‘School’ series but then it seemed kinda heavy and repetitive and I was scared to drop it in the middle, which I hate doing). This drama shows the darker and more dangerous side of the high school experience which includes issues such as smoking, bullying which are relatable to almost everyone who went to high school and some that are less relatable such as sex trafficking and gangs. Definitely a good, exciting and educational break from all the cute but unrealistic stuff that happens in a Kim So Hyun drama, for example (I don’t hate her, but she’s the one that I can think of at the moment if I think of romance-high school dramas). All being said, I don’t hate high school dramas or love triangles or anything so please don’t come at me, I’m just expressing my opinions.

Going back to Extracurricular, I started watching it as soon as it came out just because it was showing on my Netflix lol. Like, I knew it was coming but as the mains were high school students so I thought the maybe I was not going to like it and I already had way too much on my currently watching list but then the illegal activity after school made me curious. I stopped it for a couple of days and went to watch Sky Castle with my sister and then Kim Dong-hee made me wanna finish it. I mean in both dramas he is a high school student but the difference in the two characters is astronomical. Like Ji-soo, wowow, whatcha doing boy!? And Park Joo-hyun was great too. I loved her. I mean, we’ve seen many female characters in dramas that are unhappy with their parents and hate their life but she took action and did something about it, even though what she did was illegal. She’s portrayed her so strongly, showing all the emotions and making Guy-ri a real person not just a character in a story. Actually all the actors did such a good job. I was literally feeling everything while watching it.

As for the ending, wow again. I’m not going to say much as I don’t want to spoil but I really wanted a season 2 at first, I always do, I am still used to the American series having all those seasons and then k-dramas rarely have them which makes me sad. I don’t want to let them go, if you get what I mean, I just want them to keep doing their things lol (only if the drama was really good though haha). But now I think that a season two does not really make sense. What are they even going to show, right? Even though how they left the ending is just to much to decide on our own, I feel like maybe another season is not necessary. But if they decide to make it, I wouldn’t mind. I mean, what do you think?

One of the most exciting high school dramas ever ⭐️

An After-School Passion For Crime...
The message of the Extracurricular becomes clearly evident for viewers over the course of the show ; South-Korean society can become a “ dog-eat-dog” world if individuals are impoverished, or if they do not match-up to the expectations of being “ successful ”( succeeding in school, being rich , going to university and getting a good job), and none so are these pressures more apparent than for our main protagonist, Ji Soo.

Kim Dong Hee ( Itaewon Class , SKY Castle) ventures once again into another South-Korean social critique as the high schooler Ji Soo; a model-student who soon falls from grace when he becomes involved in illicit after - school activities in order to attend and pay for his fees to go to University .

Directed by Kim Min Jin ( Time Between Dog and Wolf, Lawless Lawyer) and written by screenwriter Jin Han Sae ( Irish Uppercut) , Extracurricular undeniably addresses many realistic issues typically glossed over by mainstream South-Korean high school dramas; delinquency, prostitution, violence, the poverty gap, crime and academic stereotypes, are refreshingly neither “played down” nor ignored over the course of the series.

Nevertheless, despite its realistic topicalities and issues, Extracurricular was severely flawed by its characters, plot inconsistencies and overarching storyline as well.

Whilst it is hard to really fault any of our main cast within their performances, the character progression around many of our main protagonists was fairly lacklustre to say the least. By default, Ji Soo should have been an intriguing protagonist; hardworking, impoverished, a tragic past and who becomes a victim of the forced social pressures in order to “ succeed” by partaking in numerous shady crimes. However, in reality, there were few prominent or truly captivating traits or elements present within Ji Soo as a character. Although he arguably had some form of strength within wanting to survive in a cruel world, his impassivity at key moments often made him hard to feel any strong sentiments towards as an individual.

Arguably our female main lead Gyu Ri ( Park Joo Hyun) had some elements such as coming from a well-to-do family , holding a nasty grudge against them and her mysterious reasons for getting close to Ji Soo which made her a more intriguing character than our male lead. On the other hand similar to Ji Soo, Gyu Ri lacked a lot of character depth during key moments, making it hard to hard understand both her initial enmity towards her parents as well as exactly how she became so interested in Ji Soo in the first place. Similarly, the second leads of the series, school bullies Min Hee ( Jung Da Bin) and Ki Tae ( Nam Yoon Su) were undeniably intriguing characters, however, their lack of emotional depth and backstory often made them feel more like “ stock” leads simply used as plot devices, rather than actually intriguing individuals.

To summarise, it’s fair to say that the series Extracurricular, isn’t your run-of-the-mill high school drama; it isn’t afraid from offering a deeper insight into tricky issues, themes and topics, as well as having an intriguing plot, however, a fairly inconsistent ending , several badly-written characters with poor depth and backstories and lacking realism at times, often made this series feel a little lacklustre in comparison to other psychological high school dramas out there. Worth a watch if you’re looking for something to pass the time, but certainly not worth actually investing time towards.

I hate this drama. There's barely anything worth watching about this mess. Don't watch it.

There's barely any point to this whole series. The premise started off kinda interesting, but it grated on your nerves soon after because of how roundabout and pointless it is. The reason I watch dramas is to feel good, but so many things about this drama's plot pissed me off. The first two episodes were meh, the middle part was wholly forgettable (it was mediocre), and the season finale was a complete shitshow. I have no words to describe how HORRIBLE the last episode was. It's as if every single character development flew off the window and the writers just threw in every possible shock value to the last 30 minutes of the series. Totally didn't make any sense at all. I ended this drama feeling like I've been robbed of the 10 some hours I spent watching this series.

There is zero character development, absolutely ZERO. I ended this drama hating everything and everyone, ESPECIALLY Oh Jisoo. He's totally useless, totally uncool, the absolute lamest main character I've ever seen in a K-Drama in my entire life. Bae Gyuri was a b#tch but at least she's got stronger personality (I still hate her too, though). Seo Minhee didn't even have a character, she's just... there. Kwak Gitae is a classic piece of sh#t bully that somehow made it to the main role...? Sure didn't feel like it because of how little role he played. The actors and actresses did a great job in acting but they're playing for such poorly written characters I didn't get any enjoyment from watching.

Music? What music? I didn't remember anything remotely interesting about the music aspect of this drama.

Rewatch value is big fat zero because you'll have already seen how absolutely terrible this drama is. I won't touch it again with a 5 ft pole.

Overall... it's bad. Don't watch it. I'm not sure why so many people liked it, maybe their tastes are vastly different from mine, maybe I'm just too skeptical, but I hated watching this drama. I'm watching dramas to have fun, and this drama was NOT it.

This is a short review. A more in depth review will be posted on my blog.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this drama to anyone. I would have absolutely dropped if I wasn't buddy watching it. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. The concept behind this drama was so intriguing and would have really been great, but I kid you not when I say that everyone in this show is fucking stupid. EVERYBODY.

The show, although well acted and directed, is actually completely illogical. No character growth, no flow of story. Nothing.

Episodes 1 - 2: Fine
Episodes 3 - 8: Stupid
Episode 9: Interesting
Episode 10: Irrelevant

Skip it. Thank me, later.

The problem with this drama is it was extremely boring and frustrating. The whole of this drama is made to make us question the MC actions however there are numerous SC who show us that they are wrong. First of all, the premise of this drama is that the guy is a pimp and how after someone finds about this everything just goes into a downward spiral.

There are numerous problems with the fact that this drama is boring. Let's start with one of the main problems. The characters seem to not have many motivations and are doing things for only one viable reason. This makes them appear quite flat and bland. They have little to no ambitions and the whole point of this was to make the characters be simple but their life complex. This idea sounds good on paper but when it is executed there is just a big old mess of ideas and themes they want to take up. To show so many problems make it unclear what direction the drama wants to go and makes the whole ride a bit messy.

This can be shown within the characters themselves. For example, Seo Minhee is a girl who offers compensated dating and gets one bad experience which ruins the way she views the business. She grows from this experience and views the world differently due to this incident. She becomes closer to Mr.Lee and genuinely wants to pursue a better life. Now, this premise sounds interesting and it could've been interesting however they make her a truly flat character who doesn't seem to have any motivation to do what she does. There seem to be no reasons for her offering services like that at such a young age it's just forgotten about. The only reason that is shown is that she loves her boyfriend though there never seems to be any evidence of this to follow through.

Another good example is Seo Minhee's Boyfriend, Kwak Kitae. This is the classic school bully trope who has an army of cronies under him. They show him as smart, quick, strong and an egoist. This is another example of an extremely interesting character who's gone to waste. I must admit I am a bit favourable to the actor of Kwak Ki Tae but the way they presented him was extremely one-note. He's just pure evil, there are no motivations, no ambitions. It's just that he's a bully and he's obsessed with his pride. Though he seems to have a soft spot for his girlfriend they never expand on that and instead shut it down by saying he's doing it for his pride though it doesn't expand on why. The problem with this character is that he's such a one-note bully and that would be fine if the drama presented itself as a Makjang however it didn't so this character becomes flat and boring.

The MC themselves are not people without problems and they probably have the most. While you do eventually get used to these characters, they both are extremely frustrating to watch and also have little to no motivations. They are presented as the ACE of their schools however we never see anything to back up that claim. Throughout the show, they seem to be doing extremely stupid actions that will land them in trouble. However, I did like the romance arc as their chemistry was natural and it was charming when they showed hints of their feelings. They both aren't interesting enough to carry the show or be in most of the scenes and this wasn't the actor's fault it was more of the script that gave this problem.

The ending is one of the most frustrating scenes I've ever seen as they just wanted to continue this for a new season. As almost everything is tied up but they still needed a few strings loose for a new season. It doesn't truly make sense why this happens and why they couldn't wrap up everything and make it end. This move was more to make sure this drama would renew for another season than just end it once and for all.

This drama was frustrating and missed a lot of great things it could've done. It had an interesting premise, fantastic promotions but was done badly. I wouldn't recommend you to watch this drama and wholly agree with the rating I have given!

Modern-day Korean Raskolnikov
A good, sensitive boy notices, how bad the world is, and comes up with a rather bad idea himself. His sharply intelligent, sociopathic girlfriend is a nice replacement of the Dostoevsky's Sonya character. Practically all characters are mentally disturbed. The bully and his minions seem to have no understanding of good and evil, or, if they do, they happily choose the latter. The teenage prostitute sells her body in order to buy her boyfriend's love. FL's mother is a travesty of a tiger-mother, who seems to draw sadistic pleasure from humiliating her daughter. ML's ""business"" partner most probably suffers from PTSD. Only the teacher and the policewoman seem to be sane and decent, but their world is so far away from the world of the students that there is no way they could help them.
The series is just as dark, as you can expect.

Talk about a drama coming out of nowhere and kicking my butt. Like fine, you can kick my butt, but then you took my head and smashed it against the curb. I'm okay with that by the way.
Seriously though, I hadn't even heard of this show before it premiered on Netflix. I decided to give a go basically on a whim. Like I recognized the lead because I had just watched Itaewon Class (which I wasn't a fan of btw), and was like sure lets see what this kid can do as the lead now.
Well damn! Took me by surprise and then some. A gritty and fantastic show that I was completely hooked on. I can see why this is a fully Netflix show and not something that was on a Korean channel. No channel would have greenlit this. The entire theme and characters are pretty dark. There is no fluff or sweet k-drama fantasies here. There are no typical k-drama caricatures here either. The characters are unique and realistically fleshed out. All the actors do a great job and you can tell that the director really let them loose.
Honestly I have nothing really bad to say about this show. Maybe only that I wish it was longer. Maybe a second season? Though I'm not really sure where they would go with it, but I would be on board. As long as they put the kind of passion into it that they clearly did with the first.

With Kingdom, and now this, I really hope more writers, directors, and producers look to Netflix to make their more daring projects, that would more than likely be stifled if handled by a Korean station (even the cable ones).

If you are looking for something more dark and daring than your typical k-drama fare, don't hesitate on this one. GO AND WATCH IT! NOW!

Btw, I loved the intro theme, despite it not really being a full song. It was short, but I still never wanted to skip the opening theme.

what's the point
Of course it's my own perception, but as pedagogue I won't advice you to watch Extracurricular.
Youth dating for money, robbery, emotional and psychic pain and school youth bullying eachother are a daily reality all over the world. Perhaps a point of discussion in the Korean society, always good to discuss these thema's but I don't need to see that in a K-drama.
I'm a happy and positive person otherwise I would be tent to get in a depression. I was really happen to finish this K-drama, so I could start a new one and forget Extracurricular.

Definately not my cup tea, an average 6 is far to much.

A Concept with Potential, But a Failed Potential at that...
This show has a pretty good concept, However, Netflix is back at it again with dissapointing originals like no other. The show is predictable and hard to watch due to either too fast pacing and vice versa. OST was a banger, but the acting wasn't. In the show the MC is portrayed as the ace of the school, but in his weak actions and his over-emotional personality, I see no ace in him at all, kind of reminds me of a certain Netflix movie (which suprisingly did better), 'White Yagami Syndrome' anyone? Honestly, the show is such a let down, it has a fun concept, but ultimately failed due to poor character writing and poor pacing.

This series has been so much publicised in the social media. Everyone told me to watch it. I was very slow to watch that drama. And no wonder I finished it so late. Already the first episodes did not attract my attention. I think the series has great potential and I was really shocked by the end of it. However, I hope that production will decide on season 2. If not, unfortunately for me the series will remain unfinished. I miss something about him. Though made with Western audiences in mind, a story like the typical American series, it does not convince me. The advantage for the whole series is an unusual climate, dark colours and the overall impression it get.

oh. my. god. where do i even start?

this drama is so amazing, since netflix started producing their own dramas i havent been too impressed but this absolutely blew me away.

if you thought the world of the married pushed boundaries this will make you think again. i have never seen a kdrama as dark, gritty and graphic as this. extracurricular is like an anti-kdrama.

while yes, crime dramas can get quite dark they still have the fluffy kdrama glaze over them. netflix have thrown that all away with extracurricular and spat right in our faces. but in a good way.

kim dong hee portrays jisoo incredibly well. he really has an eye for dramas and im really excited to see where he will go in the future.

anyway to conclude this ramble; watch this show

In the beginning, it seemed like just a simple mystery drama as I didn't really read the synopsis or pay much attention to the trailer. However, I'm glad I didn't so I could watch the story with a fresh eye.

The story was really intriguing and as things progressed, the story became more interesting as the female lead got involved. Really, and truly if she never got in evolved the story wouldn't have ended like that. Although she was selfish, unempathetic, stupid and plain stubborn, without her we wouldn't have been able to see exactly how much situations like this can escalate and boy did things from 0 to 100 real quick. (To be honest, almost all the main characters had some unpleasant traits, except for Mr Lee, he was an MVP.)

All in all, it was an intriguing and enlightening story. The number of emotions that jumped out towards the end really showed the great skills of the actors. Not to mention that the main cast is around 20-22 years old. The amount of suspense and thrills the story displayed literally, as cliche as it is, had me on the edge my seat biting my nails waiting to see what happened next. Not to mention the addition of reality was what really made this story so astounding. And the ending wasn't exactly ""a happy ending for all"" but more of a bittersweet one. 10/10 would recommend if you like thrillers and don't mind some violence. Honestly, I could write a whole essay on this from the plot to the SFX, to the osts.

Oh, and chances are, there might be a season 2 since there is a lot of significant loose ends but I don't think they will since while the drama was entertaining it was also meant to send a message. I'm personally satisfied with the ending though.

HOLY SHIT

I just finished this drama and I'm absolutely speechless. Wow, this drama completely exceeded my expectations. When I started watching this drama I didn't have much expectations about it and the first four episodes of the drama were a bit boring in my opinion but lord it improved towards the end! As I watched the last episode, I stared with my eyes round and my mouth wide open without saying a word. This drama is indescribable!

This drama has everything I hope for: suspense, interesting plot twists, lunatic characters, decent romance and most importantly it really made me feel every emotions behind the screen. I shouted, cried, laughed and everything between.

The plot of the drama is really great and takes the viewers along with it, therefore, you can’t stop watching. All the characters are absolutely fantastic and interesting, but Jisoo in particular is magnificent! From the outside, he seems innocent, calm, and cowardly, but actually he has psychopathic traits that make him an awesomely mysterious character.

I would also like to mention how amazingly the actors throw-in to the role. The actors fit their characters perfectly and really performed wonderfully. Especially the performances of Kim Dong Hee and Park Joo Hyun were phenomenal! I can't wait to see them working together in the next season.

Whoever is still missing out on this show, please go watch it cause otherwise that’s just sad

This drama. I can't even put into words how great this drama was! The 1st episode will make you want to watch more and before you know it, you're at episode 10 already. That's how good this drama was.

It was well written. I see no plot holes in this drama. The actors were superb! The main couple giving us that Bonnie and Clyde feels with their heist. Kim Dong Hee's acting was so great, he looks so good being a bad*ss despite that calm, pupply look he always has.

The OST! This is the only kdrama that I didn't skip the intro. I loved the opening intro! I wish Netflix will release the song soon enough.

If you are a big fan of crime dramas, this is definitely for you! Intensely great in every way. One of the best kdramas ever!

10/10 perfect ?

I don't write reviews so i'm going to make this simple and straightforward for those who want to watch the show.
This drama is definitely the best drama I have watched of 2020.The cast is so young yet all of their acting is amazing. I had mixed feelings about certain characters however, that's what makes the writing better and adds more complexity, it definitely kept me interested. It also really felt like more of an adult show although it is a high school setting as it includes more swearing and use of more adult things so I loved the feeling of it not being like your typical teen drama. Sensitive topics are discussed in this series so I would give a trigger warning but I loved the drama overall. Would love to watch it again with someone.

this drama has good story to show which everyone knows exist in society. But i feel like there were so many questions remain unanswered. Like so many. Plus they just try to push the story by showing unexpected twist which is not possible. How come the main character is that talented and have guts to do such kind of work but so stupid to keep making mistakes. Why does he carries the hat everywhere when it was given by minhee? After by accident hitting her and taking her mobile wy didn't he switched it off??
And who take their school bag with them to their ""prostitution "" job?? I don't feel any sympathy to any character. Not even that minhee girl,she brings the disaster on her by herself. There were no background story,no reasons behind action, and no logical process at every ""twist"". It feels like that the story is just keep going without any fixed ending,with so many plot holes.

I like this drama cause first of all, it was different from the normal romcom kdramas are all about.
This is the kinda drama that even when the main character does bad stuff, you like them and you are obviously rooting for them to get out of the situation and have an happy ending, its not always so, anything can happen, he is doing something wrong and we cant deny that, they can get caught and die also.
I love the fact that they were realistic on what some teenagers actually think and talk about, sex, smokes, rebellion, top notch.
As frustrating as this drama was for me, the main cast jisoo being smart but actually very dumb, there were so many situations he could avoid with a simple lie, and Gyuri being so annoying and butting into jisoo life but there's really no drama without people like that right, i actually ended up liking her while watching it, she acted smart when she needed to, something i expected from jisoo, i love the girl that acted minhee(cant remember her name) followed all her films,shes a very good actress, but i didnt feel she was the right person for this role
I liked gitae, he didnt mess up anything really and helped even though he didnt know he was doing so, finding out that he actually cared was nice.
I kinda like endings like this, but i need more, whats gonna happen really

The Korean highschool Breaking Bad you didn’t think was possible and never knew you needed
When Extracurricular starts, it's hard to work out what you're watching. A highschool kdrama? A gritty American teen soap? Some weird amalgam of both?

Weirdly, it works in the same way that Parasite worked. And it's the success of Parasite combined with the distribution power of Netflix that probably sparked the production of a show that is basically Breaking Bad but with highschool student pimps set in Korea. These are words I never thought I'd write.

Anyway, everything about this production is good. The acting, the music, the cinematography. The script is fast-paced and disturbing and violent and full of expletives and if you're like me you won't be able to stop watching. Show is pure crack. And as an indictment of the destructiveness of capitalism, it's brutal in the same way that Parasite was brutal. And brutal in a way that few Korean dramas have had the courage to be until now.

Kim Dong-hee is mesmerising as the quiet, repressed straight-A student, Oh Ji-soo, who runs an online security service for prostitutes from his phone to pay for his tuition. Park Joo-hyun proves that her recent role in A Piece of Your Mind barely scraped the surface of her talent. Her Bae Gyu-ri is a complex but nonetheless entitled bored rich kid itching for some self-destructive behaviour to make herself feel alive. She discovers Ji-soo's secret and the world unravels from there.

Extracurricular never allows the viewer a moment for complacency but it does tease optimism frequently. Despite the borderline-sociopathic nature of our two leads, the actors give them both a perfect air of lost adolescence that makes us want to see them succeed. One is impoverished, neglected, and isolated. The other wealthy, over-parented, and popular. And yet they are somehow the same. And that sameness comes probably from the way that society has failed them.

Extracurricular is an addictive drama born from a marriage between a culture that brought us Makjang and a dramatic heritage that includes Breaking Bad. It's a narrative child that works somehow, even when it shouldn't.

With a lot of swearing, violence, adult themes and references to things like sex trafficking of minors, it won't be for everybody. But for this viewer it worked. Can't wait for the inevitable Season 2.

A story of a person who is a loner and have nobody to ask for help , a person who is surrounded by people but cannot ask for help.When they both meet,trouble starts brewing.

I started it as it was a psychological thriller and after watching 2 episodes i knew i would take a breath only after finishing it.
Instead of blaming fate for the life Bae GyuRi(Female lead) is leading, she just tries to stay strong and is not afraid of doing anything to just make things in her life easier . JiSoo(Male Lead) is no different,in order to lead a decent life in the future he gets ready to do anything to earn quick money .After watching this drama i was really amazed to see how a person can change based on the situation he/she is in.It perfectly depicts the inner conflicts of humans(Should we do the right things? or do things right?)

This drama got me so indulged into it and literally i was hoping for an ending which would be favourable for both the leads.When i thought OK,now things are getting better for them but then came BOOM.... plot twist and then again i thought, it will get easier for them atleast NOW!!! and then another BOOM BOOM ending followed.Though i did not understand the behaviour of few characters at the end,I thoroughly enjoyed this drama.After completing it i was left with No Regrets,No Disappointment and No Thoughts.

I have three words: what the ****. In a good way. This show was so intriguing, brutal, stressful and it caused me to think so many things. From the first episode to the last I always thought ""oh no what is gonna happen next"" and even though it sometimes got too brutal for me and I had to look through my fingers this was such a good show!

It is difficult to write this review when I don't want to spoil(which I wont so don't worry), but if you want to watch a show where you are gonna question why you feel the way you do, this is the show for you. (at least that's what happened to me). Even though I must say I don't think this drama is for everyone given the heavy themes it deals with.

The story is dark and serious, well written, not too fast-paced, no irrelevant side-stories and such, and even though it's 10 hours it only feels like a 2-3 hour movie when you're done.

The acting was also so so good. I have now watched almost everything Kim Donghee has been in and he only gets better every project he's in. I didn't know the other actors/actresses playing the main characters prior to this drama, but they also did a really really good job, and so did the supporting characters.

I put the rewatch value at 9,5/10, mostly cause I think if you watch it again you are gonna notice more stuff, but I'm not sure I can watch it again right away. It's a story you need to process.

I hope my review was helpful!

Extracurricular has the best Korean serial quality in my opinion right now.
My beginning when watching didn't have much expectation, but when episode one made me think it had a pretty good plot and when I entered the second episode it made wow this is amazing. I got carried away in this story which was packaged simply but made the audience really feel this was real. Issue like this are indeed considered closed but this is real around us, and must be recognized by everyone.
I have no complaints for this series, all the casts are very good at playing their roles even though they are still young. In the romantic story between Jisoo and Gyuri, it amazes me because it is so deep where they are with each other. Hope the next season will be in 2021, because this series is highly anticipated by fans. Thank you Netflix

Coming into this drama I thought it would just be any other thriller type drama and I honestly watched it because of dong-hee as he played in ateen, sky castle and itaewon class , and his acting is pretty good. After just watching the first episode I was really suprised because I didn't it to be this good. And after every episode, I found myself just shocked because of the plot twists and just the shock factor after every episode (sorry if that didn't make sense). But anyways this drama is really good please watch it.
Also I fell in love with park joo hyun, her acting was soooooo good, her emotions were all so real and *spoiler alert* she was able to cry on the spot like wuuuuuuuuuuuu. I feel like alot of very good actors and actresses can't cry on the spot and the fact she could change emotions like a full 180 is insane and i just hope she can get casted for more work I really love her work. dont worry im not a sasaeng fan

Superb Acting! Not your typical high school story AT ALL!
I LOVE this movie. I got so bored with K movies lately; even if some manage to be ok at the start, I lose interest very soon or at the best I can watch is till almost the end, but not the last 3-4 episodes. This movie captivated me from the get-go till the last minute! I loved everything about this movie! The acting is SUPERB! I love both main actors so much. Man, do these two know how to express emotions (and without overdoing it) ?! Looking forward to seeing their future work. I will watch every movie with these 2! The storyline and how it develops is great as well; as I said, I NEVER got bored or guessed out the ending. Though many will disagree, I think the ending was perfect. Though I will so much like a continuation :)

Very extracurricular! Not your usual school story
This is great drama brilliantly crafted all parts of the plot came together and worked out with surprise outcomes to the end〜 I binge watched last 3 episodes　〜but do not expect the usual school story of romance, bullying social and domestic problems、 this is tough unforgiving bloody and violent and shows the sordid underside of society with these not- yet -adult school students plunged into the adult storm of reality。 Some characaters〜 not the main leads〜 I found difficult to have any empathy with - these were just childish and caused all the trouble because they were the most confident they knew it all but actually least able to handle the dangerous world they trod into but I accept the actors played the part well to create those feelings in me. I do not think there was a single person not playing their part well. Knowing the plot I will not rewatch 〜only need one watch for message to hit through but highly recommend if you have strong stomach and strong mind to deal with this drama.

I was recommended this drama from a few friends and I decided to watch it with kind of high expectations and was completely blown away. I never leave reviews but I had to leave one for this because of how good it was. I couldn't stop watching, every single episode kept me at the edge of my seat and I could barely breathe. It was almost like I was feeling the stress the characters felt.

The acting was incredible! I've seen Kim Donghee in A-Teen and SKY Castle but his acting here completely blew me away. His character is quite different from his other roles but he pulled it off so well; I could feel his emotion in some of the scenes. He definitely has a bright path ahead of him! Park Joo-hyun as Bae Gyuri played her role extremely well. Contrary to most, I loved her character and I definitely felt like she bright a spark to the show! Her character was super female-empowering and very intriguing, Gyuri is incredibly smart and playful and you never know what to expect from her or what she's going to do next.

Overall, if you enjoy a short drama/thriller (10 episodes) that is dark and revolves around crime, I highly suggest to watch it! The show also really reminded me of the WebToon, Lookism, so if you read/enjoy that webtoon I definitely recommend.

And all of a sudden is my favorite kdrama
NO ONE TALK TO ME! This was definitely the best kdrama i've ever watched!
Definitely NOT for everyone though! I love f*cked up stories, and usually only watch truly crazy stuff like this in western produtions, so to be able to see it in korean it's something i didn't see coming!
10/10! The acting, the characters development, the story, the plot twists... it's just chief's kiss, honestly!

Not used to these kind of endings from a korean production, though. I fully accept these type of endings from movies (mainly western ones) and so on, but it's legit the first time a kdrama leaves me like this... and i kind of like it. It's insane... honestly! Just wow... Kim Dong Hee has 4 kdramas on his CV so far... and on the list there's Sky Castle and Itaewon Class... HE IS INSANE! A main role at his age... wow. I CAN'T WAIT to watch what this kid will do next. I'll legit watch anything he's in! Super impressed! (good job JYP aha)

It's one of those dramas that leave you with an open mouth and tons of questions right at the end.
Extracurricular... what can I say about it? I feel like there should be more. And apparently there will be another season. Maybe after that season has ended I'll finally be able to describe the experience properly.
To put it simply, though, Extracurricular was a very intense very crazy and very very good kdrama. The main lead, Oh Ji Soo, was a bad guy who wasn't actually that bad. Bae Gyu Ri was similar in that sense but offered a completely different character than other dramas have shown before. Both main characters were exceptional, so much so that despite their wrong doings, I was on their side the entire time.
The season finale showed something that can only be resolved with another season. Personally, I think I'll set aside my entire review for that time when we have more answers.
For now, I just want to say from the bottom of my heart that this drama was great. Truly. I await the next season.
Enjoy watching.

This drama is absolutely out of this world. I wasn't really expecting much and only wanted to watch it for Kim Dong Hee, but it exceeded my expectations by a ton. The acting and the emotions conveyed were on point, the theme song is so catchy, and the plot line is intriguing and you just can't get enough. I bingewatched all 10 episodes in one day because I couldn't put it down and I kept wondering what would happen next. This isn't your typical high school drama; it's so much darker and tackles a larger topic and really pinpoints the struggles and risks some people will go through when they're desperate. The message of the story is big, and everything that happened was so unpredictable. Right when I thought things would get better, it just kept getting darker and darker and it left you with so many questions in the end. But overall, this was a amazing drama and if there's a season 2, I'll be right here waiting for it.

i delayed watching the last episode because i didn't want this to end! Seriously, Extracurricular was fantastic, excellent, gripping for all 10 episodes. I cannot put into words how absorbed i was in this drama, everything was brilliant.

We have the average setting of a high school, your typical social groups, exam struggles and all that. But this is far more than the school... we delve into the lives of the down right criminals and get taken on a perilous journey that all originates from a kids dream to live a normal life. I really found myself questioning who i should sympathise with, how such a spiral could occur. This was so much more than your casual high school drama.

I am so so happy for the cast! Woah! talk about acting!
Honestly i was a bit worried, even though i love Dong Hee, after his performance in Itaewon Class i wasnt sure if he would pull this off... damn was i wrong. He absolutely killed it, he's really come a long way in a short time, i cant wait to see his next drama
Yes the female lead was annoying to begin, but i get the feeling thats the vibe they were going for, so Joo Hyun obviously played her well. Further into the drama she develops and matures a lot.
The whole cast was just great, whoever chose them did a great job and i couldnt have asked for more!

I would definitely watch again, i wish it couldve been longer but with such a short, impactful story dragging it out longer probably wouldve been a mistake.
I wasnt too keen on the ending, its very open for interpretation. i get the feeling Netflix are setting up for a second season, which could be great, or could also be a problem. While Extracurricular worked so well in the 10 episode format, i feel possibly expanding to a second season could be stretching it too far. i would be intrigued to see where the plot could go next!

But apart from that i 100% recommend Extracurricular, only 10 hours of perfection!

This is just AMAZING!
WOW. WOW. WOW this is such a new genre and take on stereotypical high school teen drama. I watched it expecting to be quite romance and a little bit dark but it exceeded my expectations. The plot is just magnificent and smart. I love how I get similar feels from this drama and How to Bury a Friend which both I loved. An excellent student with a dream and a sad family background striving for a better future and a rich student that loves adventures and being independent. Both being from a reality based family, a duo that we never expected to be needed in this drama. I love how behind the excellent student mask lies an ambitious boy that will do anything it takes to achieve his dream. If you are into dark dramas with a traumatizing plots and twists as well as ending you should definitely check this out.

I watched it last year and I still think about it
I just wish I could watch this again for the first time and I am waiting for the second season holding my breath. Normally I forget about new seasons and I just watch them when they pop up somewhere but with Extracurricular I check at least once a month if there is any news.
The acting was amazing, the story had me absolutely hooked and I watched it in two days. The music and cinematography makes it even better, I've listened to two songs from the soundtrack ever since I first watched it. Such a good show for anyone who likes thrillers and antiheroes. It's perfect!

This character-driven drama creates a compelling world by combining stories about teenage school life and serious criminal activity. This drama has really outdid itself! It is the most darkest, realistic and ""Out of the box"" Kdrama I have ever seen! The series has one of the best twist and dialogues! The pacings was greatly done as well, it never drags and will keep you at the edge! The story was executed amazingly. And the acting was phenomenal! All of the main teen characters in the show have to cope with their own insecurities and growing pains as they enter into adulthood.

Extracurricular’s characters are unapologetic, and not particularly likable. But thats what makes it so intriguing because nobody's in the right or wrong spectrum. The relationships between them grow more interesting and complex, which makes them worth investing in. Meanwhile, as Ji-soo’s criminal enterprise expands, the stakes get higher, and create lots of entertaining suspense. The result is a binge-worthy series that is as thrilling as it is disturbing for those old enough to handle it! Warning ... Its gets very bloody!!!

Craving for Season 2~!
Made an account here just to make a review about Extracurricular. I usually read comments and reviews from dramalist before watching anything because reviewers here are so damn good in making me curious thus wanting me to watch the dramas being reviewed. This is my first time so bear with me. hehe!

I binge watched this over the weekend. The story is so good, some people said the ending was not satisfying but I like that kind of endings. It makes me use my vast and wide imagination. I have been working in a korean environment for over 4 years now and yesterday I discussed this drama with my manager and asked if this kind of bullying is really happening in korea. He said yes, it was really serious for the past few years but getting better now. I think the show is very helpful for the community to be aware that even young kids have their own struggles and even made decisions just to get thru it. Whether that decision is good or bad.

I loved the drama very much. 10 episodes is enough but I do want for more. I wonder if they really went to Sydney and picked some fruits and vegies. Hahaha!

Highly recommended! A must watch! This has become one of my favorite K-drama.
This drama is absolutely 대박~!!!

Am I the only one on the verge of crying when Oji accept Gyuri's help? It is like he gave in to something bad. And well, the whole situation became bad.

Honestly, this drama is really exciting and fun. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I marathoned this in 2 days. Lots of fun. But, around 75% of the time I felt annoyed.

Here, Netflix present a 10 hours long of violence, sex trafficking, and stress. Moral of the story is kids are kids, however clever they are. And adults, even though they tried the hardest, may not able to protect a child, at all. Also, always look at owns fault before blaming others.

First, all of the cast acted amazingly. Superb! As expected of Kim Dong Hee, I've been looking forward to his acting since Sky Castle and A-Teen. And the Female Lead who played Bae Gyuri is such an amazing actress. A new favorite.

The cinematography is good. There are some scenes that reminds me of a particular Japanese style technique, you'll know when you see it, the dream scenes. Some scenes reminded me of video game / vlog style. And some scenes really scream old-french-chill vibes. Overall, it was a delight watching this.

The music is okay. Befitting.

Story wise, the concept is fresh in drama format, but more common in K-movies as they tend to be darker. Also, beware of open ending. I personally like open ending better than bad unrealistic ending, the viewers are allowed to insert their own version of the ending.

Why did I feel annoyed most of the time? It is because most of the characters here didn't see what role they had in causing the bad circumstances. They were just blaming others and thus, don't feel any remorse of what they did. Also, so many characters here just think of nothing and made such a bad decision. AND, they didn't know when to stop and say enough. I know it is silly to complain about this, if they did those they wouldn't be a criminal.

Also, the kids will be kids. Jisoo is NO GENIUS, mind you. He just have a crooked mind and he is just a kid who makes so much bad decision with no good adult who he can consult and who can support him. He became the ace of the school because he studied hard and got tutoring. Rather, Gyuri is the smarter, albeit more heartless.

Everyone here is at fault, tbh. Well, except the bystander which are the police and the teacher. Everyone here have responsibilities to take.

I wouldn't really rewatch this because I generally don't rewatch things unless the story resonates with me or there is something so special about it. So, you can ignore my rewatch ratings.

ALSO just a note for some character.

Gyuri was a really annoying character from the start. But read this a comment from @Barbara: ""Everyone is constantly blaming her, including Ji Soo. Blaming/Demanding and so on.
Watch again and see how she hurts her skin near nails each time someone's blaming her and not seeing her effort...
Her mOtHeR talked about her suicide attempt as a youth rebellion!!!
Both of her parents see in her only an INVESTMENT for the future, which has to be flawless.
No one hears her silent scream like no one sees and cares about Ji Soo's situation.
Gyu Ri's help for Ji Soo was rejected multiple times because she has a perfect home, has two shitty parents, and is rich. Yeah, Ji Soo was blind too, in the beginning, but he's smarter than some of the viewers and saw that's she is hurting and she sees no reasons to live for. She treats it all like a game, yes. It's a mechanism to deal with emotions that are eating her from the inside and survive to the time when she can leave that hell home. That's probably why she needed that money for.
In my opinion, in the ending, she didn't leave Ji Soo. She has nowhere else to go. If you watch carefully you will notice how much she wanted to run away with him to Australia when she asked him... If Ji Soo didn't survive this, she could even kill herself.""

Kwak Gi Tae was a jerk from start to finish. There was a point where GiTae's character became concerned with MinHee. Here's a comment that may explain his behavior from @Halsyeon: ""he’s a bit possessive so if we look at it like Minhee was his thing (which he certainly used her) then I can see him acting like he did.""

P.S. Sorry for grammatical errors.

Extra-boring-ular
Story: Sex trafficking without sex and trafficking. That's the premise downfall right there.

Acting: Everyone was so unlikable I was rooting for all of them to die. I guess that means good performances cause their characters weren't supposed to be likeable. Yet I have hard time praising anyone cause no one was engaging. You can be a bad guy or a girl and be engaging, these actors and characters were just blandly dull.

Music: honestly can't remember.

Rewatch value: Zero. I awarded 1 star cause the system won't let you post a review without any star. I wouldn't recommend this even to insomniacs cause I honestly think that this drama is so dangerously boring it could put you in coma.

Overall: Talk about a massive bait and switch. What's advertised as an intriguing ""highschooler runs a sex trafficking ring"" is really, ""highschooler spends 10 overlong episodes fretting whether he'll get caught, trying to get his phone back"". You learn nothing about the world of sex trafficking and that's bad for a supposed cautionary tale that ends every episode with ""call 911 if you've heard about this happening in your school"". The real message of this drama is that losing your cell phone is the worst thing that can happen to you.

First of all, thanks to netflix for bringing us such greeat dramas lately.

I finished the whole series in 3 days (hello quarantine) and it was AMAZING. When I saw the trailer I knew I wanted to watched it because it looked very well done and the teaser is really appealing ! But those kind of thriller/psychological drama aren't really my thing so I though : yeah maybe one day. One night I decided to watch the first episode and here I am 3 days later wanting to watch it again.

First the main cast and characters: I only knew Kim Dong Hee from Iteawon Class. His role in this drama wasn't my favorite so I really didn't know what to expect : guys ! I really hope he is gonna have a long career cause I was amazed by his acting ! It's not easy to play ambiguous roles like that ! I could really feel how tortured the character was. The trailer is really misleading as you expect to see a ""bad guy"". Not gonna defend his business cause for me, he was a pimp, but you can understand his choice as the girls were totally ok with it. I just didn't like how he let so minhee like that in the last episode, I really hope they gonna explain that if we have a second season
The FL Park Joo Hyun was the perfect pair for him ! Like the teacher said : They are really similar even tho they have a complete different life. I know that she ruined the business but honestly it wasn't her intentions and once she is determined to help the hero, she goes all in. She made bad choices and was sometimes annoying when she wanted to solve everything alone, but she was smart and also trapped in her life. Jisoo was her escape and you can feel that when she comes spend so much time in his house, just to not stay with her family.
Their scenes in the last episode were incredible and showed how much they cared for each other, espacially her.
Loved their teacher !

The only character I didn't understand was so minhee. She was okay with everything and even begged to stay with them but still blamed FL and ML at the end.
The ost was so nice, not too present but perfect with the scenes and I never skipped the introduction

And this ending... just gonna say that they better give us a season 2 cause I really want to know what happened

Great drama and may watch it again if the season 2 is annonced soon !

I was interested in this drama earlier from 2020 because of its genre & also for Donghee. After watching a load of rom-com, lovey-dovey highschool dramas & not being able to hook on any drama, this drama was really a refreshment for me. The first episode hooked me up & I am impressed by its fast pace. It didn't drag the story unnecessarily. It's a plus point for this drama. And I really liked all the actors acting. The portrayed their characters so well! Overall if I could I would've given it 100/100!!

Unique and Not the Typical Kind of K-Drama
Overall, I recommend to watch this drama if you want to watch something that is not a typical kind of k-drama that you've seen. It gives a fresh look and shows the limitless possibilities in a k-drama where you won't be able to predict what will happen in it.

The casts were awesome, they depicted the emotions and characters very well. This drama describes the consequences when teenagers decided on something that is irreversible. You will see how the teenagers will react where they have a quite an unstable emotion which gives them an uniqueness for each of the casts. It can give you some insights about adolescent nowadays as well.

The plot has a great setup and developed very well through out the season but I felt that it can be further developed. There might be a season 2 to justify that. The cinematography of this drama is also amazing. The visualization of the story is spot on. Furthermore, the intro and the theme song really gives an earworm to its viewers.

Excellent
Reason for watching:
My friend convinced me to watch this with a brief description of the plot and I honestly couldn't have been more glad.

Reason for finishing:
If you like more gritty (and slightly unrealistic) stories about desperation, that also include an amazing cast, ost and BGM, then this is for you. It keeps you constantly thinking about it, and when you finish an episode you feel like you need to take a deep breath and think about everything that just happened.

Characters:
I can understand the general opinion that a lot of the characters in this show are not very likeable, and I would have to agree. However, despite this, they are still endearing to watch go through their struggles. As mostly morally grey characters, you're not sure if you want them to succeed or fail in their plans, which ultimately heightens up the tension.

Overall opinion:
This show is entertaining in every way you would want a gritty, dark, drama to be about and if you're into shows like that, then this is a short, aesthetically pleasing and all around amazing show for you.

Reason for rating:
The only reason this does not get a 9.5 or a 10 is because at parts, the show does feel either slightly repetitive or unnecessarily complex. That being said, it does not bring down the overall value that you can get out of this show.

Erin,
xx

made this account just so i can give this drama a review 10/10. the cinematic value of this show is crazy, and i kept clicking next episode because of this NEED to know what happens to the characters i fell in love with. there is no black and white here and even though the twists weren't THAT crazy, i was thoroughly entertained nonetheless. it felt really similar to how i felt watching Forgotten, a slow and permeating sense of dread building up as the episodes progressed with the added bonus of teen angst. the characters were GREAT, even the ones that were annoying or seemingly one dimensional. it felt real in the sense that these teens were making stupid mistakes or acting very selfishly, but they are KIDS and they haven't learned how to navigate the world yet. the ending was very ""interpret this how you want"" and i can't say it was satisfying, but it definitely left a lasting impression and i probably wouldn't be thinking about the show as much if it finished on a more solid note.

TL;DR - Watch this show, its really good

I want to preface this review by saying that I don't write reviews very often

Extracurricular has everything I would like in Korean Dramas. It's a bit of a slow burn which I tend to love in movies and television. It's not a soap opera. It's themes are heavy hitting and its tonally consistent in my opinion. Its not a drama about perfect characters nor does it portray an ideal society. Its not a typical teen drama and its very grounded in its portrayal of school life and crime.

The main characters in this drama are morally grey, grounded, and very human. Sometimes their actions are well intentioned but have negative repercussions. Ji Soo is a coward that keeps his head down but can weasel his way out of situations when truly pushed into a corner. Gyu Ri seems like an aspiring woman but is really suffocated by her parents and turns to delinquency as a means of acting out. Min Hee is truly one of the most tragic characters in the show. She bullies others and sells herself as an escort but is lonely and longing for true companionship. In a sort of Leon the Professional/Taxi Driver way she befriends the man that acts as the muscle for her escort service

The ending is a real clincher and kept me thinking long after the show finished. It's open ended, but its important to remember is that its not about whether Ji Soo and Gyu Ri are caught by the police. What's important is that they began to love each other despite the hardships they faced. Despite the pressure of being caught, Gyu Ri stays with Ji Soo and is prepared to follow him no matter the circumstance.

Overall this show is just really well written with nuanced characters and a plot that is unconventional and keeps you interested.

I’ll say it from the very start: Extracurricular is a gem.

Suffering and thriving seem to be the opposite sides of the same coin; you may think that all is well. However, behind the scenes, something frightful is always in action. Extracurricular is a show that depicts the nature of survival within the younger -generation and it does a brilliant job to relay the message and the reminder that the world can be a harsh place and that every single being around us is capable of having a seriously complex psyche.

This is the first drama in which I couldn’t afford to fast forward any scenes because each second of it kept me on edge. At a glance, the story doesn’t feel like anything you’d think hard to come up with; you could call it simple and describe it as students doing fishy business since they’re unsatisfied by the way their lives are. And yes, the story line is indeed simple, yet it isn’t that simple at all. As you proceed with the episodes, you are faced with unexpectedness and there’s times when you have to pause and process everything that is revolving around the main plot line. There’s numerous details and metaphoric symbolism that when it merges in with the story, you end up with the most delicious meal you’ve ever had. And thus, you keep yearning to get a taste of it once again.

What spices up the whole meal is the phenomenal acting. It seems natural and does justice to the personalities and way of thinking of the characters. Similarly, the music too manages to outdo itself. It doesn’t feel awkward and the opening theme (which also often plays at the ending credits) strangely tends to hype you up.

It’s a frightening yet, beautiful way of executing a series, in my opinion.

All in all, big chef’s kiss.

I loved it!
the trailer got me kinda excited to watch this drama but I had no time and I finally found time to watch it.the reason I actually started watching it was because dong-hee acted in it but while I was watching it, I liked it. I did ship gyuri and jisoo while I was watching but at the beginning, she got my blood boiling so much. maybe I was just overreacting.. also i loved the toxic relationship between minhee and kitae. overall the acting was really good and if I were to be bored and had nothing to watch, I'd probably rewatch this drama

Don't sleep on this show, a must-watch!
First off, the rating I gave for rewatching value is low because the storyline is so intense that once you know what happens next then it's not something you want to see again. The appeal is gone? If you know what I mean. Also, I don't notice much about the OST.

Overall, the plot and acting makes up for everything.

Each episode got me so anxious and like everyone else here I binge watched this in one day. Seriously, could not stop.

Definitely the characters and his or her motives will have you debating on how far is too far between morality and societal expectations.

Give this a go, you won't regret it!

•Personally it was so good the acting.
•Especially one character of the main protagonist i wanted to punch their faces every time when i saw them:)
•I loved ost.
•Its not a typical action plot.
•The production was very good.
But :
•I don't know if i liked/or not the character who play the girl protagonist. I was confused by her action .

Anyway,
Well done ?

Not your typical High school drama.
This is not your typical High school drama. The drama started off slow at first but then picked up very quickly. I like this drama because it talked about real life struggles and dreams are indeed expensive. The male lead's actions are not justifiable but you would find yourself rooting for him. He was just really pitiful. I almost stopped watching at episode two, the amount of stress and frustration I felt watching that episode can't be explained. Not one single character was likeable, the female lead has to be one of most annoying characters in all of kdrama history. Her nosy self literally caused everything to go downhill. I would never understand why she was so eager to get involved in the business. I didn't think it was because of the money, I rather thought she took Ji soo's life as a joke.

I hated the fact that Min hee tried to pin everything down on Ji soo. They made her actions look justifiable because she was a minor but no at her age she should know right from wrong and take responsibilities. Matters escalated quickly resulting to a lot happening towards the end. I was engaged in the drama because it had me on the edge of my seat and always had me shocked. The acting was great. Overall I found this drama to be pointless in the sense that it was irrelevant. I liked that it had an open ending and I am not looking forward to a second season. Rewatch value would be 0 if I could. This drama is definitely not for everyone amongst everything it was really gruesome.

The darkest teen k-drama that I've ever watched
To be honest, I had interest to watch this series because of Kim Dong Hee. After I watched his performance at SKY Castle and Itaewon Class, I think I should appreciate more about his work. Therefore, I decided to watch Extracurricular.

In my opinion, Extracurricular is the darkest teen k-drama that I've ever watched. I never thought that the crime that involved the main character is about underage prostitution.

From the first episode, I was a little bit shocked because of the topic of this drama is very dark. I am aware that some student could involved in some crime to pay their tuition fee. But, I never thought about the underage prostitution. I believe that this topic is very sensitive, especially at Korea itself. So, it's very interesting to know more about this drama.

Well, to be fair, it's not only about the underage prostitution that has been unveiled through this drama. You can also see about the bullying issue at school. Even though we always try to against bullying, in the real world, those act still happening.

My dreams are expensive - Oh Ji Soo
This was an amazing drama, I binged it over 2 nights and at only 10 episodes which are not even 1 hour long it was easy to do. I recommend it if you like crime shows & Stranger Things (not that I've seen it). This is also by Netflix and like most Netflix crime shows it's not for kids despite being set in a high school. So it's great but it's not for the fainthearted. The first 2 episodes were (in my opinion) the most suspenseful because I was not expecting that but there were a few later scenes that were definitely not for kids either. As a benchmark for age limits I would compare it to the movie Parasite.

I started watching this because although the trailer looked interesting (I love school dramas) it also looked too dark and like it would have 0 romance. But someone online called it underrated and I saw a picture with the female other main character (ie. maybe not 0% romance) so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did, I'm tossing up whether to put this at the top of my favourite crime dramas or not. The best parts were the characters and there was no wasted time. It was neither as intense and suspenseful as Memorist nor did it drag on a bit like Signal. It was a great crime drama with a lot of commentary. Crime kdramas always have their commentary but this one has that added spin because the main characters are just kids and how much can you punish a kid? How much does a kid deserve punishment compared to the definite punishment an adult should have? Are the crimes kids commit a factor of circumstance or are they bad kids?

This was a hard watch because I loved Oh Ji Soo and it's impossible not to sympathise with him and root for him but at the same time I'm not someone who can root for anyone who commits crimes, even petty theft. I sympathise too much with the victim. This was not a drama about something as small as petty theft.

I also really loved Bae Gyu ri and her entire set up and characterisation. In saying that I'm sure us as the audience aren't meant to be rooting for her completely, she has her flaws as well as her redeemable qualities. Which has it's own pros and cons. She's a realistically imperfect character. But regardless I love this transition into strong female leads the Kdrama world is having.

Kwak Ki Tae was a surprise, he's another character I usually wouldn't be into but I liked him more and more as the episodes went by. Nam Yoon Soo's dimples and cheeky grin were a big factor I'm sure. Surprisingly I also really liked the teacher character. He could've played a bigger role.

All the actors were on point. I'm surprised at how new and young they are. They are amazing. I didn't watch much of Itaewon Class so I don't remember Kim Dong Hee but I just finished A Piece of Your Mind and Park Joo Hyun is not like your typical Korean actress, her voice is so distinctive, I recognised her by her voice straight away. I'm looking forward to all their future works.

I'm contemplating if I would want a season 2 or not. I want more but I also think it was a good ending. The best combination between the commentary & wanting to root for the characters.

A nice school thriller drama
I think the first two episodes were boring. The story failed to impress me. The most successful thing in the story was the finale. I usually get bored watching this drama. The character of the Guri was successful. but it was a little bit annoying.The male character doesn't really look like a criminal.It should not look like a criminal.but still couldn't believe me.I think it could be a 5-part series or a movie. It was a boring drama, except for some climax. If you liked the dark side of this series, try watching Tinker Ticker movie!

Kim Dong Hee's performance = greatness. The rest of the cast as well as Choi Min Soo, Jung Da Bin, Nam Yoon Soo, and Park Joo Hyun gave outstanding performances in the drama series. I can't wait to see what else they have in store this year!

Extracurricular is based on the life of a student Oh Jisoo and his drive to live a normal life with less privilege than others without parents or a family he results to provide security to young women involved in sex trafficking. One thing I applaud the screenwriter for is character insight as I watched their stories it made me wonder what I would do in their situations and I think that is the essence of good work. When your audience is being translated into the storyline as if it was theirs and completely immersed by everything taking place almost making it three dimensional.
The storyline is very comprehensive and it deals with the real issues of sex workers in South Korea deviating a lot from traditional dramas. There is a lot of dark humor in this and it translates to how the characters are feeling at any given time of the story. I believe the main characters where the thought of very precisely and the actors and actresses knew how to use such a good story and make it better. I couldn't find any moment that was lacking in this series and what shocked me the most wasn't the epic plot twists but the reactions they would approach a problem, it was like I knew their characters but I really didn't know a thing. I would love to get into it but that would be spoiling the whole thing.

The cinematography was on point, they really hit the mark on what angles to shot certain scenes at, and the music, as well as the scores, were dramatic to the places they needed to be, wrapping the whole thing nicely in a big red bow. Can't wait for season 2. If you like good content, sorry, great content then definitely WATCH THIS, like WATCH IT NOW!

good drama but many episodes were bland
this drama is really good, the synopsis is incredible and it could have been a better drama in my opinion. the first episodes were electrifying and made me want to continue, but in the middle of the drama I started to get tired because the story was not holding me as much as at the beginning. In the final episodes, there was a lot of information and painful events, I sympathized with the secondary characters, but their end was not what I expected. I hated the protagonist, he had an explosive and cold personality and was quite selfish as a gyuri. I hope that in the second season he will pay for the damage he caused physically and psychologically to some characters, I liked the drama, but the ""ending"" did not please me.

Power, Ethic and Dream Struggle of an 'Ordinary' Student
Truth to be told, I don't have a glimpse of any ideas about this drama at first. So watching the first episode brings the premise very well to me. The story sets simple, somehow it brings me no idea where it could go wrong.

Turns out, everything goes very wrong.

First of all, though, I want to address the violence in this drama is quite massive. I will list trigger warnings as followed: blood, suicide attempt, mental illness, rape, panic attack, and what triggered me the most is bullying.

Second, let's talk at how the production team executes this drama exquisitely. The characters successfully bring their emotional pain enough for me to sympathize and sit in frustration watching their actions. I would love to address my salute to the main character Oh Jisoo. His double personality comes from such an innocent face is hmm...just unpredictable. I like a lot of characters here. Main or secondary, they bring such an interesting component to spice up the scene.

Third, this drama may sound like a tragedy at first but after pondering about it, their message is quite critical. The struggle of living and being expected as a student is huge. Both of the main characters are living differently but they share the same pain and vagueness about their future. I think, as a student, this story hits differently for them who are living in the culture. The pressure of doing well economically and academically is just insane. This drama also tells about teenagers problem mentally, like friends, and romance struggle.

I don't have a say about prostitution as the main theme since I don't know enough to comment about it. I think it stays put in the grey area. This drama can be a lesson for the officials to be aware of how their society become. The world becomes fair only to the one who has the money is a cruel reality we should try to help and be aware of.

P.S. I love that they put the message on ask for help in the credit scene.

Watched the entire show and regretted the waste of my time. Why? was the question I left at the end of the show. Why for everything. Very poor story. I don't pay Netflix to watch stories like this. The conclusion is so important for any story. For 1st few episodes, I expected an interesting conclusion for the series and some message hidden in it. But the series has disappointed me big time. The direction of Korean dramas makes me think if it is losing its interesting storylines. This series just confirms the issue with latest korean dramas.

Extracurricular
This drama was on my watchlist for too long, and when I finally decided to watch it i didn't expect it to be that good. The story was interesting and refreshing. This is unlike any high-school dramas I've seen. Extracurricular also gave me the vibes of ""how to buy a friend"" and ""parasite"".
Unlike most dramas, extracurricular had a very dark plot. Its well written, there were no plot holes in this drama. The acting was amazing, Kim dong hee as oh ji soo, the quiet and invisible kid at school but also the villain in his story. Park joo Hyun did a great job as well, her being bae gyu ri, another lunatic. Both of them had similar problems, 2 teenagers surrounded by no one but still wanting to lead a decent life. Once you start this drama, you wouldn't be able to stop.
I have no regrets or complaints about this drama, even though the ending left us with a cliffhanger but I still enjoyed it. I would be even more excited if there was a second season coming.

loved it
I must admit that at first, I had absolutely no idea what was going on in the drama, while I did know what it was about I could never predict how the season was going to end. How one small detail could change everything although everything seemed to be perfectly under control. I thought I could predict what was going to happen next, but I couldn't. I found the ending very hard to predict, although it perfectly made sense. Very well thought.

One thing I also liked was what the characters were like. None of them were the good guys. Ji Soo was a kid who chose to follow a dark, immoral and illegal path in order to deal with his financial problems, and Gyu Ri was selfish and manipulative, while in most dramas the main characters are the good guys who have to defeat the bad guys, this isn't the case here and it was something I really enjoyed to watch.

Waste potential
It has a nice idea for a start, but the execution is lacking. Zero character development. The male lead is just pathetic person who somehow became the main focus. They pictured him as intelegent yet somehow his action tends to be stupid. None of the main is likeable, all of them just a selfish prick. If you like a story about a loser who remains loser till the end yet somehow became succesful with no logical reason then watch this drama. A pity since since the cast was quite interesting yet the story is meh

I'm going to be really honest with this review: I gave this show a 9,5 because there are some things I'd have liked to get an explanation to. Nevertheless, it really overcame my expectations. I had high ones because people were talking really good about this drama and I can tell you already that it's one of the best of the year, people are not lying.

I have to say, though, I'd have liked it better if the OST were more varied. I didn't really pay that much attention to it since the storyline really had me inmersed and hooked, though, so I'd say this isn't that big of a deal.

Overall the acting was amazing, the facial expressions were on point and the way it was filmed gave it a really different vibe from what we're used to, driving way more attention to body language and letting us discover ourselves what the character is feeling and/or thinking.

For me it has always been difficult to finish a lot of dramas after episode 8 more or less, I start to get easily bored and I just don't feel like watching anymore. I don't know if it's because this one is only 10 episodes, but it was so easy to watch... I was always wanting more at the end of the episodes and even now that I've finished the drama I'm still wanting more, so I really hope there will be a second season.

Last, but not least, this is a dark drama. I don't usually watch this genre but I did and I ABSOLUTELY loved it. I don't regret anything. 'Extracurricular' is not the typical crime drama we're used to. Netflix is a whole different story, they just care about getting the audience hooked and interested and I can assure you they do! The fact that our lead is directly involved with the crimes makes it a whole different experience, at least for me. I do have to say there's a lot of bloody scenes, so keep that in mind.

I absolutely love this drama so much. It made me furious about some of the characters, but that's what I love about it. I HATE THE ENDING SM BRUH. Why did it have to end like that :(:( Overall, I really like the storyline and the acting is phenomenal. PERIOD. If you like thrillers like this one, let me recommend a few. I enjoyed watching Class of Lies, 365 Days Repeat the Year, Sky Castle (I luv this one), Save Me, and Penthouse. ANYWAYS, I am going to rewatch it today bc it's THAT good. I normally never rewatch series, but I will for this one :D

I never once thought 'They could have done that better.'
Wow. Whatever you'd expect from a TV series about teens committing crimes, you can scrap it. This was intense and stressful and filled with drama and danger but also not far fetched or cliche in some eye-rolling way. There are no masters of their trades here, just regular people who are doing regular crimes and trying to keep their heads above water. Except for Mr. Lee, he's a BAMF, no contest. From start to finish it's a fantastic show, from feelings of wanting to strangle Gyuri and Oji's dad, to wanting to strangle Kwakkie, Minhee and that cop lady, and to wanting to strangle and comfort Oji in equal turns. Then wanting them all to just calm TF down and have a snickers bar. But also not, because stuff gets crazy and when it all sets off, it's awesome. It was entertaining all the way!

And the acting was so fantastic! Great casting all around. The show also had some nicely executed humor, which is always good, every show, no matter how dark, needs some humor.

Over all, I wouldn't change a thing, I never once thought 'Eh, they could have done that better', because everything was written, directed, acted and produced so well. If there is no second season, I won't even be mad, it has a solidly satisfying ending as far as I'm concerned.

Great show!

Story- This is a purely western type of plot so to see the more conservative East Asian (S.K.) market diving into this subject matter surprised me and also pleased me (not everything needs to be a ridiculous rom/com or a frustrating cop procedural). Having characters all with questionable morals so you can't root really for anyone, I like that because that's how real life is. No one is perfect and these characters portrayed that. I can't stress this enough when I say that the tags will tell you if you can handle this kind of story. So watching strictly for your oppa/ noona... I honestly don't recommend that.

Acting/ Cast- Speaking of portrayals O_O OMG EVERYONE did an amazing job: Donghee and Joohyun SLAYED their roles- SLAYED!! They are the main characters but they sure made it hard to like them at times. The casting director did an outstanding job choosing these young stars and I can't wait to see more of them.

Music- It did what it was suppose to and set the mood. With certain scenes I would become more anxious and I realized it was because of the music showcasing that particular scene. The opening/ closing credits were the same song and it fit well.

Would I rewatch this? Not to say this is a bad drama, because it isn't, but I tend to not watch dramas again esp one that had me on the edge of my seat- the original thrill is gone.

A true crime masterpiece.
THINGS I LIKED
(+) Unique story with non-cliche scenes or tropes
(+) Great acting
(+) Dark and true crime concept (this may be a negative for some people)
(+) Complex characters and development
(+) One of the few dramas I would compliment on a great ending

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE
(-) It felt a bit slow during 1-2 intermediate episodes (this is very minor)

REVIEW
Where do we begin? This series takes you on a journey. If you are a fan of true crime and don't mind a darker concept, Extracurricular is one to watch out for. The main characters we follow in this drama are designed beautifully complex and believable - particularly our mini Bonnie and Clyde leads, that is, Oh Jisoo and Bae Gyu Ri.

The synopsis kicks off with a slightly confusing first episode. For a long while, I wasn't clear of the illegal activity being engaged as well as understanding GyuRi's character and motivations. However, once you reach the third episode, the plot really starts to pick up and you can just sense some major storm foreshadowing your way. This story is written and executed really well with minimum downtime or fillers. Expect to feel more and more tense after each episode as this plot takes our characters down the rabbit hole further and deeper.

This is a story about two high schoolers whose background and life experiences had driven them to enact illegal crimes. They are not the people we should root for in reality but we somehow want them to succeed in this drama so very badly. In terms of romance, it's quite subtle for a kdrama but in this case, I find this approach to be very fitting. This story fundamentally shows how far a person can go to achieve their own dreams despite the action may appear to be out-of-character or the potential harm it may cause to others. This is very noticeable in the later half of the show especially in the ending. I won't say anything more about the second half other than it is just a diamond in the rough. One of the best endings I have seen in a kdrama where most tend to fall short on.

VERY RAW STORYLINE AND CHARACTERS, BUT WEAK LEAD CHARACTERS.
It was an okay show with a very different storyline then other Kdramas. It didnt hold back at all and it was very raw and real. The storyline was interesting and the side characters were really good but the two main characters were just not it. I couldnt really like any of the characters, they were pretty annoying most of the time (all exept than Mr Lee). The best thing in this drama is the relationship between Mr Lee and Min Hee, i believe he was like a father to her and they both felt it even if he never admit it. The male lead wasnt so bad or annoying, but the female lead ruined everything for me, i was about to stop it because she was just so annoying but the side characters just kept me.
Not your average kdrama.
Hope it has second season cause the ending was just not an ending and i hate it.

Unconventional K-Drama
'Extracurricular' is a whole rollercoaster. It took me 2 days to finally decide to write this review because this drama is a lot to sink in and process.

It starts with what looks like a simple high school story with your regular poor main lead who struggles to make friends and live a normal life after his parents abandoned him, and then turns to be a dramatic and crazy story with bits of Tarantino.

As a film lover, I must say 'Extracurricular' exceeded my expectations considering this is a K-Drama. I've watched all genres of K-Dramas but never have I ever seen one dealing with such deep topics from the perspective of high schoolers. If you've watched many dramas too, you'll know that Koreans are very reserved about how they portray high schoolers, since they're still children, and you'll mostly only see criminal/taboo behaviors from high schoolers in K-Movies. So, to see the characters of this amazing show deal with topics like prostitution, explicitly about minors, or sex trafficking was pretty much a shock. I know this didn't air in public or cable TV, hence why it was much more detailed and censorless, but still kind of shocking.

One thing that annoys me a bit from TV dramas is that whenever there's a smoking scene, there's always someone who takes the cigarette out of the hands of the person that was supposed to smoke it and turns it off, or they just show the back of the person smoking it. However, we saw high schoolers with cigarettes turned on and actually smoking it, teenagers talking sexually about body parts, being fully aware of sexual stuff, being criminals... The unconventional nature of the show really surprised me and left a great feeling on me.

I love the way they developed the story. I hadn't been as annoyed and frustrated about every character in a show in so long, and 'Extracurricular' made it possible for me to hate each and every single character on the show, except from Mr. Lee and the teacher. Every other character was absolutely stupid and frustrating, and oddly that's one of my favorite things about this story; that the characters are completely unlikable and annoying and there's little to no personal development on their personalities at all and I see this from the POV of someone who values personal development the most in a show. The fact that this story didn't take them anywhere good gives you a bittersweet feeling and you start wondering, ""was it really necessary?"" about almost everything that happens. You question the logic of these characters and wonder why can't they simply use their brains wisely. And to me, this created a really remarkable story.

Oh Ji Soo is the most stupid male character I can think of from a K-Drama, but since his personality is somewhere in the middle of a genius and a dumbass, I can only say he's actually a genius. Bae Gyu Ri is a nosy girl that ends up uncovering a pimp business that offers security to prostitutes and ends up ruining the whole thing for O-ji. I can't say I didn't hate her 90% of the drama and wanted to get in the screen and slap her face so bad. She's pretentious and selfish, but I liked the way she cared for O-ji. They both made a dangerous, yet great couple.

Overall I don't want to get into details as I don't want to mark this with spoiler, but I'll just say I loved the unconventional and unique ending that they gave us. My review is only positive, but there still were some things I would've improved about the casting and role of certain characters so I'll give it 9/10.

PS. I loved the nightmare scenes, especially the one about Seo Minhee. All the nightmares are among my favorite representation of a dream in a show.

!!Korean Bonnie and Clyde!!
Okay, I've actually never seen Bonnie and Clyde but from what I heard they were riding or dies and that's how I describe the two main characters. This shows my GODD this show I need a season two. From the start, you are at the edge of your seat. It starts with a ""WHAT THE HELL"" and ends with a ""THAT'S IT!"" From the characters to the plot to the over vibe this show is a MUST WATCH! This show set me off loving all the thriller dramas and I have not looked back. Every little thing is important so pay attention.

Should be watched by everyone
A thriller that is dark and unpredictable. Slow burn but this really kept me hooked on till the end. It pulled me to the edge of my seat, made me anxious at every turning point. The characters were crazy but every actor put their soul into it to bring the character into life. It just makes you keep on wondering who is right and wrong? what is good and evil?. Some secrets tend to keep as it is but what will happen if it gets revealed?... To find out watch this series.
Tip: This series picks up the pace from ep 3-4, Hence have some patience.

Masterpiece
I really liked this show.
It was really exciting and had the binge-factor.
The ending was really open, i do not know till this day if Jisoo is dead or not. But I especially liked the actor of Jisoo, he portrayed the emotions really well.
Gyuri was a cool character, many people disliked her but I think she was a very important role and was special for Jisoo. Even if she brought him a lot of trouble, they were into this together.
I recommend this show to people who like action, because there were scenes that could trigger people, like a lood of blood.
The OST‘s were sooo good, I liked them a lot and still listen to them like to normal music.
I would‘ve wished for a second season but it doesn‘t look like there will ever be one.

Usual Netflix stuff
This drama took a weird thought very seriously and conceptualized it into a drama. As much as interesting and bizarre the idea of a high schooler being a pimp, some things didn't quite add up. But it's all fictional so okay. It did keep me on edge of my seat, with all its violence especially the climax violence scene was just for the hype and chills. The first half was very interesting with discovering each character and the second half went high voltage with its brutalities. The ending pretty much was usual Netflix style. One time binge but I didn't binge it so the effect wasn't rewarding. FL's character was quite complex and I liked how she was portrayed. As for actors, it was nice to see the actress in this type of role. I liked the music and intro title track of this drama. I won't be rewatching this one.

Good drama but lacks characterisation!!
I freaking love this drama, but i have quite a few criticisms.

The actors were great and the storyline was engaging. There was a lot of tension and high intensity scenes, and even episodes.

The characterisation fell flat, however. There should have been more of a background story for the characters. It would have been interesting to know how the ML started the whole job and why exactly he did it. In a way, it sort of doesn't make sense; he explains that he wants to lead a normal life without drawing too much attention to himself but his ""job"" is the opposite and can get him into a lot of trouble. If he wanted money, he could just get a job that regular kids his age got like at a convenience store.

The FL was the same; she wanted to make money but had no motive. They tried to give the storyline that her parents wanted her to pursue the same thing as them and she didn't want to, but how exactly is doing what she was going to help her get out of her parents' desired plan for her? Also, why is she willing to risk getting in trouble for managing a sex work business just to not be a ceo - it's not equivalent.

Another thing about the fl was that she was annoying. She clearly hadn't set her priorities straight, as evident in the previous paragraph. But, from the first episode we see that she's a pretty shit person. She went out of her way to take the ML's phone so she could go through it. When she didn't know the passcode, she watched him enter the passcode for his other phone and used that to get into his phone. The invasion of privacy is not cool and I'm pretty sure she doesn't apologise. I don't like how the writers chose that as a catalyst for how the FL had to find out about everything. Other than that, she's purely fucking annoying. She is constantly putting everyone in danger and she feels no remorse. As soon as she is introduced, she fucks everything up. And luckily for her, she has the money to buy herself out of trouble because her parents are rich, whereas the ML has to suffer more.

Mr Lee was such a g bro. I love him. I also liked the homeroom teacher.

Did the second leads even genuinely like each other? He was pretty shitty towards her and relied on her for her money. But, he was able to get his homeboys to trash the karaoke bar for his GF. The scene was pretty iconic though.

With most of these characters, there was no clear motive for most of their decisions *cue motive by Ari and Doja* which i think is the biggest flaw in this drama.

But I did genuinely enjoy my time watching it. I'm really into high school dramas that are dark like 'Class of Lies'. Both of these dramas, along with 'How to Buy a Friend' have all been compared. Personally, my favourite would be 'Class of Lies'. Because there were only 10 episodes in extracurricular, they might have not been able to develop the characters as well.

I know some people want a second season after the last episode but i don't really think it would be as good. I'm not sure how they would add another 10 episodes without dragging out and ruining it. I think people need to start being okay with dramas where the ending is unclear.

(^^lol the title is a joke with my brother's friend) I started watching this because my friend already saw this and recommended it, so I tried it. Y'all the plot is one of the most addicting plots I've ever seen. I really want a season 2 because the ending was really vague, but I feel like a lot of things would change throughout season 2, and therefore would ruin the original plot. Maybe they should have a movie sequel to further explain the ending.

Oh Ji Soo, if someone told me that he was the most innocent person in the class without telling me he ran something illegal, I'd believe you. At such a young age, he was forced to learn how to survive, and he was really good at surviving on his own. Bae Gyu Ri was the worst female lead I've ever seen. Like I understand she's not happy with her life, but that doesn't mean you practically shove yourself into someone's life just because you want a thrill in your life. He was right when he said something like ""You think my life is a game to you"", she's done nothing but interrupt everything Ji Soo's worked hard for. Seo Min Hee was pretty unlikable, but in the end she's just a girl who just wants to please her boyfriend through money, which she gets through Ji Soo's business. I kind of wish she had a better ending, but it's whatever I guess. Kwak Ki Tae was a pretty unnecessary character, considering Min Hee could've have had another person in mind to make money for. Lee Wang Cheol was a good character, why did they do him dirty like they did. They also should've added a backstory as to how he was found by Ji Soo and how he became the ""shadow boss"" as I refer him as. Choi Jin Woo reminds me of my teachers that I was close with; they were caring, and were willing to listen and cover for me. He's the kind of teacher we all need if we want school to be a happy place. Officer Lee Hae Gyung was like the older version of Gyu Ri; she was annoying. She always thought she was entitled to look into everything, and was even willing to break the standards of what an officer was supposed to do. Like ahjumma, leave the main cast alone.

Not a typical high school kdrama!
I was looking forward in watching a psychological/thriller. I must say Extracurricular delivered! It was very eccentric and intriguing. I absolutely loved the character's development.
Actor Dong-Hee Kim did an amazing job; portraying his character's 2 sided personality, every time he turned evil I always got goosebumps. As well as him, Park Ju-hyun's acting skills really payed off, her playing as Bae Gyu-ri really stood out, her desperation to escape her parents and the pressure she was under was presented fantasitcally!
The cliffhanger ending fitted well, as it leaves you questioned with what may happen next. Apparently there will be a season 2 coming out in 2023, my hopes are high!

Darker School Drama
An interesting drama which includes discussions on illegal businesses, underage escorts, s*x trafficking, the rights of workers & the need for security. This drama really had me hooked.

▹ Jisoo's character
He was presented as a straight A, quiet, shy school boy at the start. Later, it's revealed he runs an illegal security business in the backdrop of his perfect school life. He is different when he is ""Uncle"" and then when he is Jisoo in school.

▹ Illegal Business
Depending on individual views on escorts, the business Jisoo runs provides security for escorts. The business is illegal and he also allows underage Minhee to use the service. If one is being ""equal"", ""protective"" they wouldn't allow underage girls to do this.

▹ Dark but real
It was interesting to see how dark but real the show was. It’s common to see something like this in Asian cities, the motels/compensated dating etc. This drama feels raw and different. Not the typical school drama

▹ Gyuri's impact
People have moaned and said that ""it's gyuri's fault"". Yes, it is. She took Jisoo's phone but how else did you expect the drama to even start. Something had to go wrong, since they're all high school kids. They don't know any better.

▹ Minhee & PTSD
Her character was always shown to be smart-mouthed and stubborn. Yes, she should have listened to others to not go to the motel that day but she experienced something brutal. She was left traumatised and couldn't work.

▹ Police officer
For some reason, the show wrote the police officer in such an annoying way. Perhaps this was intentional. We are seeing the officer, the way the high school kids are. She did the right things but she was doing them in the wrong ways possible.

▹ Ending
The last 2 episodes were basically game changers like American tv shows and movies. The good turn bad and the bad turn good. I do wonder why they chose to pursue this root instead of sticking with what they had. But, I understand. The shock factor outweighs consistency in this situation.

OVERALL
Really good kdrama, it's not the typical school drama. It's dark and real. It opens up discussions about the dark side of Korea. The underage escorts, the money problems and the need for good parental figures. The last two episodes could have been a bit better in terms of the story and I find that the episodes stand out/ are different in terms of consistency with the rest of the series.

For some reason this took me a while to finish. It's dark, mysterious, and gloomy. The characters are not morally correct all the time so sometimes its hard to like them. But the acting is fantastic and it has this gritty feel to it that you just want to hold onto and find out what will happen next.

What I liked about this is you're always waiting for what might happen next. Some scenes were a shocker. The grittiness makes it feel different from your usual kdrama.

What made it weird was how some decisions the characters make doesn't sit right with you. For example, I didn't really like the FL at first. But I slowly got accustomed to her and some things made me like her more. (She be really pretty though). Currently waiting for season 2 cause the ending was wow.

love this one!
first of all, i find it cool and interesting cause a high school student is the person who’s behind all the crimes and just from this, we all know its not gonna be a typical problematic student life drama.

i love every bit of this drama, ok maybe minus the slow emotional scenes but everything else was good! its only 10 episodes and you can just finish this in one sitting (well at least i can hahah) its just that in my opinion, i think the ending is like an open one. the kind that you yourself has to decide whatever the ending will be according to you. also, the drama did left me a lot of questioning like what happen to the other girl who fell off the stair and also what happen to the police woman like did they ever found out or not

but overall i like how this drama just keeps me on my feet although i gave this quite a high rating despite the open ending just means that i really enjoy it hahah

The price of being normal..
Being normal or ordinary might be a bore to most of us but for somebody who has no one and has nothing it’s quite a challenge.
The ML had a very simply dream to be normal and be like everyone else but given the circumstances it was hard for him. Making ends meet is difficult and it becomes doubly hard when your alone that is probably why others tend to take an easy way out doing something illegal or immoral to make easy money. But there is no such thing as easy money it requires hard work, sacrifice, persistence, and probably a little luck.
Sooner or later you just become unlucky.
This is a sad drama.

-> The story a.k.a the strongest point of this serie from my opinion.

The story evolves around ""poverty"", ""psychology"", ""money"", ""teenagers/minors"", ""trafficking, sextrafficking, gangs"".
At first, it sounds old and common but, the way the story is told makes this drama unique in its genre. The story telling of this drama is a work of art. I am not exagerrating, it is brilliant. The episode 1 is echoing the last episode (ep 10). The first episode set the atmostphere since the first scene and that scene is directly connected to the last scene of the last episode which resumes everything. The introduction is also the conclusion. It is very brilliant. Also the sentences that the professor told him are all so important to understand the psychology of the main characters especially Jinsoo. For example in the first episode, he told him if he endure everything now he will face the consequences all at once at the end. The professor is such an important character. Also there are many details which are very important as well, they seems like ""nothing"" but they are crucial like the animal that Jinsoo take care of and the cap Minhee has brought.
I truly appreciate how unique this drama is, how uncommon it is, how unpredictable and predictable it is at the same time, how it makes sense but doesn't makes sense at the same as well.

The four main characters were to blame, they were not saint and not evil either, they have taken the wrong path to achieve their goals and the consequences were tragic (Even MrLee is to blame). The two main characters especially are to blame, they are anti heroes. The story tellins is great because the way it is told will makes you want to support them even if they are wrong.

In addition, I also like a lot the fact that they truly portrays two kind of trafficking : the ""old"" kind of making money through illegal trafficking and the ""modern"" way to make money through illegal trafficking with modern technologies (smartphones, by distance). With mordern techologies, a lot more people with different backgrounds can dive into this illegal world ""more easily"".

If you like the movie ""Parasite"" you will love this drama. ""Extracurricular"" truly follows the same ""concept"", the same unique, new genre. I was really not into ""Parasite"" but with ""Extracurricular"" it is different. So if you haven't enjoyed ""Parasite"", this drama ""Extracurriclar"" can reconcile you with the concept.

-> The cast
The cast is very good, the acting very great. I'll not say I was complety amazed by their acting to be very honest but they are very good especially the main actor who is portraying Jinsoo.

-> The music a.k.a the only weak point
From my opinion, my personal tastes, the choice of the osts were not always good but that's my personal tastes who is speaking because I am aware the choice of some songs for some scenes were intentional to makes this drama ""unique"". But imo it is was unecessary ""unique"". The osts are good to listen, but they doesn't fit with this drama particularly. I only like a lot the ""opening theme"", it was the only ost that fit the drama. The others musics doesn't fit.

-> The rewatch value
I found myself wanting to rewatch again this drama because the story telling once again is brilliant.

A VERY addicting drama that'll make you finish it the same day.
I was bored scrolling looking for some kdramas the other day and I stumbled upon this one. It was in twitter where literally everyone was recommending it. The tweet was something like, ""What are some really good kdramas to watch?"" So I just looked in the comments under it. To my surprise, the name of this drama was said in multiple people's comments. The story is really good, but at the same time very ANNOYING.

I loved the whole drama except for Gyu-Ri literally annoying the heck out of me. It was really interesting but also infuriating. LOL. Anyways definitely recommend watching. 9.47/10!!

I'm not gonna lie about the title either, I myself really DID finish it the same day. ㅋㅋㅋ I still have a lot of time these days. Anyways if you still haven't watched it, what are you doing? Goooo!! ;)

INTENSE
Before you even start to watch this, be in the right state of mind, and know what to expect. What not to expect…any kind if romance, comedy or love. What to expect…frustration, betrayal, blood, death, very heavy plot, murder, suspense, revenge, remorse, excellent acting, and an excellent plot that was well written, produced and directed. With all that in mind, this drama does not leave you feeling good. It is the kind of drama that will be with you a while, if you know what I mean. If you are up to feeling total frustration as you watch a drama, this is the one for you. I’m not trying to talk anyone out of watching this, just be prepared for the wild ride.

Unlike every other drama coming out of Korea with same repeat stories this drama was totally different, both leads of the drama were worst ever criminal possible. Leads were pimps who sold men and women of all ages including minors for sexual favors. They didn't stop even when things got complicated like attempted murder, police getting involved later on murder. Worst part both the leads were minors.
This drama is depiction of how extreme circumstances bring out worst in humans even worse when persons are genius and are very difficult to be suspected. They manipulate every circumstance in their favor but you can't even blame them because they had no other choice.
Best part of Drama
Acting by male lead- I have watched all 3-4 of his drama and this guy took me buy surpsrise he acted so well that he desreve daesang for the drama. If he can conti nue this acting he will end up as one of the best actors ever produced by South Korea.

A Nothing Burger
There are many good things about this drama: the actors are quite talented, the cinematography is stunning, the dialogues are written well, and the characters are very believable. There is only one drawback and it is so huge that it makes this drama definitely not worth your time. Can you guess what that drawback is?

Let's talk about something else for a moment: what to expect. Please notice that the review is marked for spoilers. The whole drama is about sex trafficking, killings, gangsters, bullying, and other lovely sides of school life. The title of this drama should be ""The Nth room just got a lot darker."" If you live in a provincial town, you will never get to experience this kind of violence in any shape or form except for in a Korean drama.

Now if you like this sort of thing, let me ask you this: WHY? or rather WAE? WAE do you like this? What is wrong with you? Is it an unresolved childhood drama? Not enough adrenaline? Again, if you need to spice up your life just go to the medical university and then become a doctor or a nurse and start fighting coronavirus. Be a hero, my friend. And if you are not ready to be a real-life hero and would rather watch young kids being raped, killed, and dissected on the screen from the comfort of your home, then - go ahead and do just that. This drama is for you. I just hope you feel a little bit guilty at some point.

Just so you know: ALL DRAMAS ARE DESIGNED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FEEL. Do you want to feel happy? Watch a rom-com. Sad? Here is a melodrama for you. Excited, with adrenaline pumping through your veins? Watch action or thriller. Sexually aroused? Watch porn. Actually, no, don't watch porn. It's very bad for you and it rewires your brain.

I am appealing to all intelligent human beings out there: do you understand that by watching dramas your buttons are being pushed and your hormonal levels are being manipulated? This drama is DESIGNED to reset your dopamine levels.

If you don't want to watch rom-coms, don't - they will lower your testosterone levels and inject you with a healthy dose of oxytocin. But watching Extracurricular is literally bad for your brain.

When we assess the quality of this drama the most important thing to remember is that the intent was to ENTERTAIN YOU. Let me provide this as an example. Can a prostitute be good? Sure, s/he can be good at what she is doing, popular, has lots of clients but s/he is still a prostitute and all the damage that comes with that. So if you are judging the quality of a dark drama but what effect it had on you personally, shouldn't you still remember it is a dark DRAMA?

As for the acting: most (about 90% by my estimation) of all Korean actors are really good. Better than Hollywood. It's hard to find an actor that is not that great. Maybe Uee, IU, Krystal, Yoona, and the rest of the kpop girls and boys are not that spectacular, but the rest of them are pretty decent. They train them somehow (I guess they use the method) so all the actors are doing a great job, no matter what drama you are watching. So if you like this drama because of the acting, it sounds like a lame excuse.

Now for the biggest drawback of this drama: the plot. The plot is quite interesting at the beginning, but then things escalate pretty quickly, the climax makes no sense and the ending leaves you completely empty. Many things in the plot are not well-thought-out and just do not make any sense. For example, a kid cannot intervene during the counseling process. I know that for a fact, trust me. Or the ""smart"" guy who devised a very complicated scheme took home the evidence (the phone) covered in blood? Hello?

I have no problem with open-endings, but only if it makes sense. If feels as if the ending in this drama has been cut off. I believe the viewers were left hanging so the producers can make more money off the thrill-seekers who drove up the ratings. The ending leaves you hollow on the inside.

I regret the time I spent on this drama. As Donald Trump would word it, it's a nothing burger. Your life is precious. Spend it on something more valuable.

Unique Premise Fumbled by Mediocre Writing
I expected a lot more out of this show considering its high reviews, and after finishing I have to wonder if I even watched the same show others did.

While I did mark my review as having spoilers, again, please do not read if you strongly plan on watching the show and care about spoiling of any degree.

The premise of the story is good (or could have been), the acting is as good as most other decent kdramas, and the direction is good. However, most of the characters are terribly unlikable and inconsistent in role, and the biggest, gleaming issue is that the story is full of nonsensical plot holes which ruin its delivery. That said, I did not hate it, it just felt painfully average when it could have fared far better and I would not have bothered had I known.

Jisoo is smart enough to start a secret business and run it for nearly 2 years, but simultaneously is an insufferable coward and idiot at nearly every encounter that would test his intelligence (are we to believe there were no issues ever leading up to this point that would require high IQ to resolve?). His phone is openly marked with his business logo, he leaves sound-based notifications on that are tied to said business/logo, he's nonchalant with how he treats his second phone (not even caring enough to keep it on his person, the entire reason why he got himself into this situation), and he didn't even bother to give his phone a decent password (or have a second password on his security app) even though it's somehow his only connection to the business [despite it being implied that he made the security app, and would therefore have full backdoor rights].

For those unfamiliar, with a decent password it could take the FBI or similar agencies weeks to months to unlock the phone if you/the manufacturer refused to do it for them; for an average person/solo person without extensive IT background it would take far longer, if possible at all. Certainly nobody is going to casually guess their way in unless the password is on a post-it note pasted on the fridge like in your grandmother's house. Furthermore, had he encrypted the app/messages, as any person that's capable of operating as he did prior to the start of the show would know how to do, then it could take years of efforts to get in, and that's assuming he didn't also select for disappearing logs or other security backups preventing forced entry. Hell, he couldn't even manage to find the power off button on a telephone he took that had self-compromising information regarding his illegality activities, not to mention willingly letting a bully into his home that would capitalize on this. It's as if even if he messed up early on he had ZERO learning-curve capability. Based on how he's written by the end of the show, it's difficult to believe that he manages to tie his own laces or wipe his own arse in the correct direction, let alone do anything he built up in the prelude.

Not going to bother addressing the other characters since the lead was frustrating enough, but the pure negligence of how technology is treated, such as everyone's phone being immediately, magically accessible and apps usable by people without use privileges is a significant oversight (as well as the aforementioned in the above). I would accept the argument that some people are dumb enough to not use passwords, or to use something like '1234', but when the average IQ in S Korea is 105+ and the entire premise is based on the main character being intelligent/top of his class while still working (so theoretically 130+) it comes off as lazy, amateurish writing that took a chance at too few people noticing/caring about the flaws--based on average reviews being very different from my own, looks like it paid off.

WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK
I was stuck in quarantine and started watching this out of boredom. Would've appreciated it if the producers added a trigger warning at the beginning of the drama T_T I had 2 mental breakdowns in the span of watching this lmao.

Overall plot is super f'd up and no one's a good guy in this drama. Every character frustrates you in their own charming way. Obviously am not satisfied with the ending and looking forward to season 2 if there even is one *sigh* Honestly if you're mentally unstable and is planning to watch this then good luck haha. yes it's good , no doubt it is, but it is rather triggering.

New k drama style
This show is the epitome of redifining Kdrama usual style. The story line is very original. The cinematography are perfection. The lighting are all great. The artistic setting are great. The misé en scene are honestly perfect: it helps deliver the messages, the emotions, and the tension nicely. The acting is really great, the actors are really great but i bet its from the marvelous work of the director. A good director is really makes a show different. I would give this a 10 point, but the ending really makes a lot of people confuse.

Not Your Average Drama
The minute I began watching this drama I knew this would not be like any of the others I'd watched so far. Similar in tone to Parasite and many other Korean movies, this drama portrays a very realistic and gritty take on life and what it takes to survive.

The strongest point of this drama is its plot. Void of stereotypical cliches, it leaves you on the edge of your seat guessing what will happen next. Although high schoolers running a prostitution business seems extremely out-there and unrealistic, the genius-level writing of this drama has made me realize that this may very well be reality for people living not only in Korea, but other developed countries too. I'm glad that this drama is a Netflix Original, because it would not have been as dark nor as great had it been picked up by Korean networks that have to abide to the KCC's laws. I have never felt the way I've felt over the course of this drama, from developing a strong attachment to Oh Jisoo in the first few episodes to being disgusted with myself & his actions in the last one. The characters are all extremely well written and I enjoyed watching them struggle to conform to the rapidly changing circumstances. The actions & motivations of the four leads are such that you can never truly root for any of them despite either having begun as a favorable character, or become one through their character development. While there are some questions that remain unanswered, the open ending of this drama has me believing that the story is not complete and we will get a 2nd season in which those questions will be answered. In all, the plot will have your brain running a mile a minute, thinking of theories and motivations for days after completing it.

I have never been good at telling good & bad acting apart, but judging by the way the lead four, especially Gyuri & Jisoo made me feel, I think their acting is nothing short of amazing, especially Kim Dong-hees's. He portrayed such strong emotion, especially anxiety, that I felt my stomach bunch up into knots while watching him.

The only reason I have given a less than stellar rating to the soundtrack is because, while it was good, it wasn't all that memorable. I watched this drama a few months ago and yet when listening to the soundtrack I fail to place what scenes the songs were used for. On top of that, I felt like the theme song was kind of cliche. To me it felt like the stereotypical theme song for a dark, crime drama rather than being one that really mirrored this story. To be honest though, this drama was so good that even a less than perfect soundtrack did not detract from it. Like I said before, the plot is so entrancing that you will barely register the soundtrack. Perhaps that's what happened with me.

Rewatch value-wise, I gave it a lower score not because I would not enjoy rewatching, but because this is the type of drama you can only truly experience once. It is riddled with plot-twists that leave you gasping for air, akin to Parasite, and I just do not feel like you can re-experience the same feelings while rewatching it because you know what will happen next which is absolutely essential for this drama. With that being said, if there was ever a device invented that let you wipe shows from your memory, I would be first in line so that I could watch this for the first time again. I am planning to rewatch it with my friend soon, so who knows, I might feel different about it then.

TL;DR: Absolutely amazing drama, will have your emotions running high. Must Watch.

From the trailer I assumed it would be a typical drama about genius main protagonist who develops an amazing app and together with his friends he is trying to make money from it. It was so much more different from my expectations. The first episode left in shocked and I have binged watched the whole series in about 2 days. This drama follows four high school students and their struggles. Our main protagonist who seems to be a goody-shoe from the beginning turns out to have a complex personality. Despite receiving a large amount of hate due to his acting in Itaewon class when his character turned to be a ""villain"" Kim Donghee has shown us, that he is a very capable of playing a villain.
Throughout the drama I have loved and hated every character. From the beginning I truly rooted for Oh Jisoo despite the fact that he was actually a ""pimp"". Through his background I could see where he was coming from and why he chose to be involved in such unethical business. However as I continued watching, I found it more difficult to understand his choices and couldn't of his actions.
Bae Gyuri's struggles come from her parents who hold high expectations therefore they pressure her into being an ideal daughter. Her stress and unwillingness to live is invisible to her parents. She joined hands with Oh Jisoo thinking that she could escape for her life. In my opinion those two are very toxic for each other, but at the same time they both rely on each other to make it through another day.
The remaining two characters who were a couple - Seo Minhee and Kwak Kitae I found the most annoying and least relatable. With Seo Minhee I found her at certain point a pitiful character. Despite being surrounded by her friends and having a boyfriend, she is very lonely. No one actually cares about her. This is why she was so attached to Mr. Lee, because in her mind he was the only one who actually cared about her. However I found it very ridiculous that she sold herself to buy her boyfriend expensive gifts. Her boyfriend was even bigger trash for playing dumb even though he knew about it. I felt very frustrated to see her and her boyfriend being angry at Oh Jisoo after finding out that he was the ""pimp"". The business was all consensual and it wasn't like he forced her to do anything, so why getting angry. The boyfriend knew about it but he chose to stay silent and enjoy the expensive gifts from his girlfriend. Obviously in the end Jisoo's behavior when Minhee found out was unnecessary and at that point I didn't root for anyone anymore.

The drama is very dark and not suitable for those who are looking for lighthearted school drama with romance. It shows the dark side of the students and their shady businesses. This drama makes it very hard for you to root for a certain character because each character has flaws. A lot of people are expecting a season 2 for Extracurricular, but honestly I don't want it. I am content with such open ending and I don't think it is necessary to have another season. However if there is a second season I will definitely watch it.

ps: I'm deducting one point from the ost because it doesn't have an official release. I love the opening song and I wish the production team would release it.

Worth watching
Ok so first of all I have to begin by saying that 'Extracurricular' is actually one of the 2 kdramas I've finished watching. Yeah that's true I've only watched 2 kdramas this one and 'Are You Human?'. I'm that kind of person that starts watching or doing something and the next 5-10 minutes gets bored and moves on to the next interesting thing to do. I think I began watching at least 40 kdramas (and cdramas too) to put it mildly. I mean, it's not like all of them are boring or something, some of them are the most popular ones, some of them are the genres I'm looking for like mystery or crime or supernatural or sci-fi and again it's not like all of them have bad plot or bad actors or some cliche storyline. It's just me that gets easily bored. Like you have no idea how easily bored I can get at doing almost anything. OK maybe some of them I've watched only like 1-2 episodes or just a half of the first episode but a big part of them I've watched a substantial amount of episodes like 5-6 maybe even 8-9 (lmao) and a few of them I can say proudly that I've almost finished them almost (lmao) like I've got only 1-2 episodes left to watch, but the big majority yes I didn't even start them properly like only 1 episode or something.
There are so many reasons for all this kdramas dropping of mine like I didn't really like the female lead or the male lead or both of them or sometimes one of the support roles yes I know they don't appear that much that's why they are called support roles but if I don't like someone it means I don't like that person (lmao) or maybe the storyline was too boring or too cliche or maybe it was meant to be a supernatural drama but the supernatural part was only 1-2% of the whole thing or I didn't like the acting of someone or they were talking too much yes it could happen lmao so to sum up I rarely rarely extremely rarely find a good drama that could satisfy my short attention span and believe me my short attention span is like really short. If nothing interesting happens or at least if it would give me a sign that something unexpected is going to happen in the next 30 minutes or at least in the next episode that's a big no no for me. I'm just going to stop and move on to the next kdrama.
So in other words if that kdrama doesn't have at least one moment that could catch my attention per episode and to make me want to go on with the series watch the next episode and see what happens then that's just a no no. I don't know about you guys but if that drama ain't good enough for me to watch if I already know how it's going to end because again cliche storylines are everywhere even if the actors are some big names then it just ain't worth my time. And believe me I wasted a looot of time trying to figure out if that drama is going to be a good one or just a flop. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to say that if someone says that kdrama is bad don't waste your time on watching it it doesn't necessarily mean that if that person didn't like it you are not going to like either. You don't have to take someone's opinion so seriously like you can read other viewers' opinions but you don't have to listen to them. Like believe me I've read people's opinions that were saying that some kdrama was sooo good but after I've watched a few episodes it was just a flop or some other kdrama is really bad and ain't worth watching it but after I've watched a few episodes I realized that it was pretty good and I might actually finish it (yes I've got some good kdramas in mind that I would really like to finish them besides the 2 I've mentioned above lmao).
So what I want to say is you don't have to care so much about other people's opinions if you want to watch a kdrama and you read some bad reviews about it or you see that it got a low score don't get discouraged just try watching it and maybe you like it and the same for the popular dramas. Even if it's really popular it got a lot of reviews and everyone's saying that it's really good and they really enjoyed it it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to like it too of course you can try watching it but believe me I've tried some of the 'popular' kdramas and in my opinion they ain't worth their popularity but again that's only my opinion.
OK so enough with my blabbering and back to the review I just wanted to let you know guys that I'm very very picky when it comes to kdramas so if you see me writing a review about a drama that I've actually finished well that's not something very common I could actually say that's pretty unusual lmao
So to finish this review all I want to say that this kdrama is worth your time and you should give it a try.
OK I just realized that maybe I've used to many 'so' LMAO
So just watch 'Extracurricular' cause it's good. Believe me, I've dropped a looot of kdramas.
OK maybe you wander why I'm telling you guys that this kdrama is so good that I didn't drop it but I gave the re-watch value a 1... Well that's because I don't re-watch like never ever. I mean I barely watch 2-3 episodes of a kdrama how could I re-watch it? Lmao
So just watch this one. It's gooood

made an account just to write a review on this drama. initially started it because i heard pretty good things about it, but the show is just frustrating and poorly written. the characters are portrayed a certain way, then act in a way that contradicts themselves. no one is likable, and everything is extremely annoying and unnatural. i don’t even know how to describe something as bad as this, i literally wanted to transport myself into the drama just so i could beat everyone up (especially that rich girl that decides that messing with serious matters is a game, like literally why. for what reason was that necessary). anyways, just don’t bother with this show and watch something else.

So I put the spoiler tag. To make it short: The series is well done. From the very beginning it's obvious that this is really good. Good actors, good script, good dialogues, good production. Still it took me 2 episodes to get hooked, but then I was REALLY hooked. It got better and better - until the last two episodes which I didn't like at all. So my issues with the series: The character were not likable and the plot became strange at the end. Gyu-Ri was so sassy and cool, wasn't she? The girl messed up everything. If you think about it, the moment she got her hands on the Ji-soo's phone sh*t happened. All the blood that was shed was because of a new client she scouted. She didn't do it on purpose and it really looked like she was in love with Ji-soo and she later proved how far she was willing to go to save him, but still. The girl messed up EVERYTHING. I was constantly thinking *Just let the man do his business*. But the man became a wimp later on. The only character I was rooting for was Mr. Lee. And then he died. And then he didn't. And I'm not a fan of that kind of plot where a characters comes back just to die again. I liked Min Hee mostly because she was friends with Mr. Lee. But otherwise she was not very likable either. The main character had a very questionable personality to begin with. I mean, if you do that kind of business you sure are shady! But he proved that he was willing to risk his life to save Min Hee (he tried to hold back the bad guys so she and Mr. Lee could escape), just to let her die an episode later. It just made no sense. I don't know if you can call that ""character development"" or bad writing. The end felt strange to me. Like it was the end of a season and not the end of a series. I enjoy an open end if it's well done, but here it makes no sense. We don't know if Min Hee will live, die or survive with brain damage, we don't know if Ji-soo survived or not, we don't even know if Mr. Lee survived. The police officer never said clearly that he was dead. Everything was resolved more or less, but we don't know what happened to the characters. That was left completely open. So yeah, objectively speaking this series was very well done, very suspenseful (I had to hold my breath several times and binge-watched it in 2 days), but subjectively speaking I don't like the end, I don't like the characters, and I was in general very disappointed. So I'm conflicted about the rating. It's too good to rate it lower than 9, but I wished for a different end. I wished for the main character to die, honestly. I didn't hate him, but I thought his death would have been a better closure. I saw rumors about a season 2, so the end would make more sense considering there will be a continuation. Still I wonder how this season will look like. Ji-soo and Gyu-Ri have to flee, leave the country maybe, will we see new characters and a completely new story? Nothing is confirmed at this point, so well, whatever.

Didn't expect much - Got near perfection
I didn't expect much from Extracurricular, but my oh my did it deliver way way way more than I ever imagined. I think what made me take to this drama was how relatable the ML was to myself. Of course I'm not a criminal, but from the personality/character it was like I was looking into a mirror. A unique and well thought out story was a great thing to see too, with all characters being truly developed throughout.

I also love how it implied the romance without really having much romance. I would also love a second season, but to be fair, I always say this. Maybe I need to be less greedy.

Haha. All in all though, a must watch!

Uninteresting at first, intense at the end
What's in each episode:
1. At first, the drama is not so interesting. It shows some women working as ""entertaining"" women. They smoke and drink beer, a job that is considered illegal in South Korea. Nothing really interesting in episode 1. You gotta hang on to it.
2. You start to understand what is this drama about: A student running a secret-modern-remote security service where he is unknown to his employees and clients.
3. Romance stuff kicks in, but it's not overloaded.
4. Conflicts intensify.
5-8. You really enjoy the drama because of how stupid the characters are to solve their problems.
9. You start to think about how this drama ends.
10. The conflicts are still on fire that you now look for the ending. Some are somewhat satisfied (like me) and some are unsatisfied.

i wrote this review at 2 am because everything is fucked up
Wow... okay.... i feel so whoozy rn.. not gonna lie the main reason why im watching this was because of jung dabin. i love her character on live on so i decided to give it a try. shes sooo amazing!!!! what i liked most about this drama is the characters. i love that the direction of the plot depended on the characters decision its a whole characters driven drama !! the butterfly effect got me so fucked up in my bed screaming IF YOU DIDNT DO THAT THEN ALL OF THIS WOULDNT HAPPEN its frustrating but i enjoyed it. jisoo... gyuri.. minhee.. kitae and the adults too... i enjoyed them. i enjoyed the fact that everyone is so fucked up in the head. the actors also did a good job. kim donghee did so well that i was able to sympathize with jisoo (man..he just wanted enough money to live a normal life). the drama carries around a very heavy topic and its 2 am i dont have energy to think about it so im just gonna say stuff about the characters. i still dont know how i overally feel with this drama tbh i dont think it got me extremely moved. esp the ending got me doubtful... gonna have to see for the next few days. if it still haunts me i have no choice but to say its super good and i have to recommend it to any of you who likes a drama full of fucked up characters because for real bruh (p.s just a heads up if youre planning to watch and are wondering how much violent it is; on the end of ep 6 and 9 and maybe also 10 ? theres extreme violence going on w a lot of stabbing and bashing and blood so if you cant handle it you can just skip)

I loved the actors and actresses and everything but i hated few things :

-the open ending! I hate open endings so much .. Like SO MUCH!

- why did the gang let go of the first boy they wanted to kill but then couldnt let the main acter go and they wanted to kill him !

- why didnt they consider getting a regular job like a cashier or coffee maker or something, the writer should show some strugglings first to get our empathy towards the main actors, like if the main actors tried several jobs but they were bullied at or rejected or anything .

- nothing made the detective investigate more rather than "" feeling something is wrong"" , which is very fragil to me .

From what I saw, and read, I understood that this is a drama that you either love, or you hate. No in between.
I do understand why: characters are messed up, there is no silver lining and the episodes get so tense that is hard to actually pinpoint the moment you fall for this scheme.
For all those who hate it, but watched it until the end: congrats, you just wasted your time! For everyone who actually, even without enjoying it, liked the drama: hi, I'm one of you.
I was really excited to see this drama, and I've watched it fairly quickly, because I couldn't look away from my laptop.
The plotline, I admit was not of my favourites: everything was fine, until Gyuri just pushes her way in Jisoo's life and chaos ensues. The drama probably would haven't had that push to it, without Bae Gyuri : thank you for being the actual plotholder, the bad guy and the saviour all in one!
It's not hard to dislike Gyuri, let's be honest, but at the same time I related to her on so many levels: her internalized hatred for everyone and everything, her sociopathic side being full on display, and her just being a badass in a noir way. What changed Gyuri, and made her less obsessed with her own personal dilemmas was Jisoo. I think these two dysfunctional characters work so well with and for each other that it's hard to separate them. I loved the scene in which Jisoo and his father are drinking and just insulting each other while laughing. It was intensely sad, but also sarcastic.
I think all about this drama was doublefaced: Mr. Lee being a veteran with wars in his head, trying to fight them while protecting someone, Minhee who found a parental figure in Mr. Lee and just went berserk because she was lost, and Kitae, who hid his feelings that deep they came out too late and ended up being just a burden, for both him and Minhee. These characters are real, they are scarred, pitiful and rotten on the inside. But not everything is gone: the homeroom teacher, the detective (which paradoxically are adults, and instead try to fight for their gone kids, instead of kids trying to fight the rotten adult world) still believe there is something in them that it's worth looking at, fighting for.
If you don't see it this way, I'm sorry for you because you lost the biggest lesson of this drama: it's hard to keep a dream, and life does not help, so don't take short ways to achieve it, because it's probably gonna end bad. This drama is a massive warning about the bad sides of things and how quickly we are to judge everything around us.

Extracurricular was my second kdrama, after Crash Landing on You. Very different, I know! Lol! I wanted something less romantic and found this as one of the recommendations given so watched it without giving much thought. Finished in 3 days and wow... I am reeling in from the show. Definitely does not have the 'feel-good' ending that I get from other k-dramas i've subsequently watched. And that is clearly what will set you thinking.
The characters are believable, though not very relatable (esp the ML). But you end up rooting for them even though they are clearly not doing lawful things. You just keep finding excuses for their wrongdoings, and just feel horribly sorry for them that things just spiral downwards exponentially after a few episodes.
What kept me going I guess was hope that the ML will find a way out of his abyss. I had hopes for FL to be the guiding light but she is anything but. Also, circumstances had forced ML to be in that sticky situation that he had delved in so deep, he does not know the way out anymore.
Pretty dark and twisted show, but I enjoyed it. Though I needed something lighter after that to lighten me up.
Side note, I watched Itaewon class after this kdrama and surprisingly found the ML as a supporting role.

Watch it! There is also a bit of gore... I don't think I can stomach anything more than this after this kdrama!

So I don’t actually get why a lot of people dislike this show, like yes this ending was a bit bad I agree. They could have added a proper ending and showed us what happened but I think they’ll be making a season 2. This drama had my feelings all over the place. It was heart racing and the drama had so many mixed emotions. I would definitely recommend this drama, I even recommended this drama to a friend who doesn’t watch Korean dramas but really enjoyed it and asked for more dramas like this one. It really depends on what you like, I normally don’t watch dramas like this but it was so good it had me on the edge of seat every time I watched it. I just suggest, not eating while you’re watching the last two episodes.

Review of ""Extracurricular""
- When I first watched the trailer I had already knew what I was getting into but was I sooooo not ready for it!! This series took me on a wild ride of shit that I can't even begin to produce words for. This is one of those series where you have to experience it yourself to even understand it.
- The acting was so powerful and impactful to the point where i was genuinely worried about the actors well-being after it was all done and said. I was thinking that a role like that would have to take some type of toll on the mind.
- Honestly, I believe that this show should come with a disclaimer since some of the things that go on in this show aren't exactly teen friendly and can beat at you psychologically.
Definitely a MUST WATCH!!

It could have been better but it's okay.

I did not like the main characters that much. I did like Wang Cheol because his fights skills is really amazing. I did not Jisoo for being too wimpy, whiny, and scare. Jisoo is running a pimp/security service. Jisoo is good at making people angry and is bad at fighting. He did throw one good punch but can act brave sometimes. Gyuri is so annoying for a rich girl because she is too noisy. She never took anything serious which is annoying. Jisoo could have finish collecting the money and end things after that. Gyuri was bad luck for him because she responsible for Jisoo's dad stealing his money. I did not like how Gyuri joke around about a serious matter? I felt bad that Wang Cheol died. I only continue to watch because of the first episode. I thought it would be interesting. I felt like it became boring at some scenes. I had to skip some to get to the action parts. If you make it to episode 10, she basically wanted to continue the service. Jisoo understood that everything was over for that. Gyuri has a future in family business even if she did not like it. Jisoo basically had nothing left which you can feel sorry for him about it. I did felt bad for Jisoo because money struggle does happen to all of us.

A very refreshing take on high school
First of all,the actors have done an awesome job in this drama! Not one bad actor?? The story is well written, dialogues too but like they swear way too much I was lowkey annoyed. All characters were in grey and I loved that! All new kinds of characters and stories never told before, was refreshing. The concept itself was pretty good. It was a whole new dark take on school, interesting.
The reason why points reduce is because of my personal opinions, I personally do not enjoy high school dramas especially dark high school dramas. So watching this sometimes made me want to stop,like it didn't keep me on my toes for some reason and wasn't super hooked or anything,it was interesting but not interesting enough, I sometimes had to force myself to watch it.
Also it made me sad that all characters were anti and I couldn't relate or cheer for. Still i loved the way each character played out and all thier crazy behaviours! This drama was extremely refreshing and very unique ☺️

I don't really know what exactly to say about this drama. First of all, the easy stuff, realistic school life, they actually study. The hard stuff now, I don't know how easy someone can speak about these things like underage sex trafficking, and mental health issues. In a enviroment that can remind a Steven King story (young people, school as a small community etc), this drama speaks about that with realistic enough way. About the trauma and the reasons behind it. And how to some people the hardships of others is something far away and a ""game"".
That was the main point, but as the story went by I think it became a little too much complicated with this gang stuff. And I think it wasn't needed. The story as a whole had more potential, always I had a feeling that it was good but with something missing. The story and the end had some similarities with Parasite, someone with nothing using illegal methods to climb the social ladder and the way the story is solved. I think it is just a Korean dark thing the end. I have watched crime dark series and movies from differents countries and korean ones are some of the darkest.
Also, really great acting, especially Kim Dong Hee (I loved him from Itaewon Class but in Extracarricular he is amazing) and Choi Min Soo. And congratulations to Park Joo Hyun for creating a really annoying and completely fitting character as Bae Gyu Ri.

(English isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes)

Nobody is really likable. I guess I feel bad for the main character but he's doing some messed up stuff too and is a wimp. Normal people do not act like this either but I guess that is why this is supposed to be dark? I'm sort of curious how things go from here but it's hard to motivate myself since every character has been incredibly annoying in different ways. I don't even think i can forgive the female lead after this episode no matter what happens later. Seriously, who acts like that? Hard to continue when it's difficult to cheer for anyone in this show.

The guy was supposed to be so smart but not so smart to take caution on his illegal phone. Like wtf, it's too easy. I was hooked on the pilot episode and everything was doing great. Then it was ruined by nonsense plot, it's rather stupid. I'm so furious for watching it only to waste my time. Damn, if only i could take back that lost time.

I don't understand how they can write a compelling story only to make a conflict that was rather petty. It was just not convincing. Now you might think I'm nitpicking or anything but I'm not. The guy had literally planned a very sophisticated way to run his illegal activity and for some reason his downfall was his phone.

Don't waste your time. Just awful.
I've watched 3 episodes and this is the darkest, ugliest kdrama story I've ever watched. One of the reason I like Korean productions is they are typically better written, but also are without all the smut we have on TV in the United States..
Leave it to Netflix to produce a kdrama story this wicked. Teen prostitution, teen pimping, violence, theft, gambling,... I could probably go on. Don't waste you time. Why in heck does MyDramaList require reviews be over 500 characters? //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

It's not the destination, but the journey.
The show had alot potential. Unfortunately, the fatal flaw of the show is it on the end of story rather than beginning. So, we missed out on all challenges dealing with setting up escort service network and the journey of him becoming rich. For example, how did first appoarch and meet the girls? Why did he choose them? How did he get intial funds? What inspired him to setup the service? All of this content was lost. Instead, we get forced romance couple drama of girl doing ridiculous actions ruining his life just for sake of drama. Imagine if they did Breaking bad the same way and just start him at end. The show would been terrible.

- First thing first... the Bonnie and Clyde vibe got me entirely hooked up. PERFECT...
- The theme song became my ringtone and alarm too. <3
+ + +
- Episode 1 & 2 was perfect according to me, to build up the adrenaline rush among the viewers. These two episodes made me realize that I am way too punctual and responsible to live a life like them but thb Oh Jisoo inspired me a lot to............ study... :-)
- Episode 3 through 7-8 ... it was meeehhh for me.
- Episode 9 gave me all the gore that I wanted and expected (I expected a lot more thought). And also gave me a good laugh and fair share of pain too.
- Episode 10 ... the BEST. In short, perfectly satisfied with the ending.
+ + +
- I adored the 'Grandfather'. He was my fave. Both in action and mystery department.
- Loathed Minhee. She was too weak, cute and annoying for her own good.
- Wanted to beautifully punch the 'smiling b*tch'
+ + +
I think that's all... But trust me YOU MUST WATCH THIS DRAMA.
And in the future I wish to get a partner like either Oh Jisoo or Bae Gyuri.

Thank you,
Maaya

The webdrama A-TEEN was Kim Donghee's first acting project and I've adored him ever since I saw the second season of it. When I saw the announcement of him starring in this Netflix drama a year ago, I got really excited and told myself I'd wait for it. And so I did, and it took so long for it to come out. But it did!!

This drama is far away from being perfect, but it was absolutely worth the wait and watch. It's cleverly written with a lot of detail and has relatively believable characters and teens, at least in relation to the situations in the drama. I liked the leads together, they had chemistry and helped each other out, even if it was for the business.

! HEAVY SPOILERS COMING UP !

I very much enjoyed the theme itself - sex trafficking, prostitution of minors - even if it wasn't portrayed in the heaviest manner ever, which some people complained about. I coulnd't have seen that coming by seeing the trailer and the plot summary.
It's clear that it's a heavy, difficult subject, even without the leads or anyone saying it explicitly. It's obvious when you see the drama. The plot revolving around that business kept me on the edge of my seat and was just entertaining and new.

Practically every decision and character arc led up to the climax and the ending. This is where I get most critical of the drama though, because by focusing on the whole Psycho man drama, the Police woman and Seo Minhee as well as Mr. Lee, there was little room for our leads to work and decide together and their relationship and the characters together couldn't evolve properly. That's why Jisoo's final breakdown over Seo Minhee having recorded that Bae Gyuri was involved didn't feel entirely logical to me, even if I get it for the most part. In general, not everything this drama and the writers decided to do was smart, I don't find Kitae stabbing Jisoo too convincing or justified, some things were also predictable, like when Minhee fell down the stairs.

For me, the ending isn't disappointing - it would be actually insane if they really left it that. Just like THAT. It really made me think, and the last shots of the drama were creepy as hell. Everything left me speechless. I wouldn't mind a second season, I just don't know what it should revolve around.

! SPOILERS OVER !

Even if it has some flaws, I still love the drama for what it is,: a pretty dark rollercoaster story with eery symbolism and quirks thrown in. ( ?SPOILER? I really enjoyed Jisoos horrifying dreams, I don't get the thing with the hermit crab though)

Recommending this one big time, if you want to see a heavy, fresh teen drama that isn't.. perfect.

[Non-spoilery part now]

Wooooooow. This left me so shocked, what the hell.

All I have to say is that Minhee deserved better. Kitae sucks. Jisoo and Gyuri suck. All in a different but beautiful way. Just by watching this show you realize how trashy school students can be.

I need a second season. Watch it if you like your dramas with a bit of violence, blood, and sensitive topics. You'll like it.

[Spoilers now, stop reading if you haven't watched it yet..]

Uhm, I'm kinda happy that things went bad for Jisoo, after all he was doing things that are not OK. He deserves a bad ending, however I can't help but feel sorry for him. I kinda started liking his character after the first half of the drama.
I just didn't like that Kitae came in to be the 'justiceman'.. he's so unlikable.

Aside from that I think that the ending was very open, what happened to Jisoo and Gyuri? Did he die? Did they escpae together? What's up with the Uncle, though. He seems secretly alive, but they didn't explain much after that. And will Minhee be able to find peace? Poor girl, she went through a lot. Didn't like her character at first but now she's grown on me a lot :(

Have you ever started a drama with great potential, only for it to fizzle out and come crashing midway? Have you ever started a drama with great potential, only for it to be ruined by cringe acting? Well, find a blanket and a comfortable place because Forest of Secrets is neither of those.

I originally decided to start this drama because I was captivated by the promotional poster - I knew nothing in particular of Jo Seung Woo or Bae Doo Na, but the poster drew me in immediately: dark, exciting, and striking - a great representation of this drama. I was sold after the first episode.

While I truly love K-Dramas, I think we can all agree that a lot of them are dumbed down to a point where you don't have to truly pay attention or think about what is happening in them - everything is explained plainly, no questions asked. Even crime and mystery dramas often times overdo it with the explanations so the viewer won't have to ask themselves 'huh? what happened? why'. You won't find this here. This is a drama that will require your attention all throughout, as missing a dialogue or a glance will confuse you later, without much explanation. This is a drama that asks for your full attention, and a drama that keeps its momentum until its last minute. There is no fizzling out, no unnecessary showdowns and car chases and fist fights, no rushed endings - no, everything progresses at a smooth pace that by the end you don't even notice that it's over because you're so used to its steady progression and flow. It feels strange and sad that in the coming weeks, I won't see Pros. Hwang Si Mok and Det. Han Yeo Jin running around and taking down corruption.

While Jo Seung Woo and Bae Doo Na are not what you might call top Hallyu stars (I'd argue about BDN but anyway), as say Park Bo Gum or Jun Ji Hyun, both are top-notch well-known experienced actors that infuse their characters with life all throughout. Not only them - the whole cast is stellar and even if I try to think of one loose performance, I can't. I could hardly believe that Jo Seung Woo is the same guy who played the main in God's Gift and that Yoo Jae Myung (Pros. Lee Chang Jun) is the same person who played Do Bong Soon's father.

And, of course, I cannot fail to mention the writer, Lee Soo Yeon, who has developed two of the most unique female protagonists in K-dramas for me. One determined to stand by justice no matter what and one determined to clear her father's name no matter the price - both executed perfectly until the end with no unnecessary fluff and delving into annoying, and quite frankly degrading, romances. Not only those two but all the pivotal characters went through such believable character development, that you will find yourself attached even to the most despicable of them - not because they're handsome and an oppa but because they're human, not innocent not evil but somewhere in between, just like all of us.

I really can't think of a reason why you wouldn't want to see this drama - it's what all crime and legal dramas should aim to be, and I'm looking forward to the day I watch something that will outdo it. While some people may think it seems boring, I urge you to challenge yourself and watch the first two episodes; your brain will thank you. To me, this was a heart-racing drama that made me laugh, cry, feel disgust, and so many more emotions.

I am so excited to see what this rookie writer will bring us in the future because if it's anything like Forest of Secrets, then we'll know we have another great drama upon us.

2021 edit: Yeah, I still have not found another drama to replace Stranger as my favorite - go watch season 2 if you have not!

This is quite simply one of the best dramas ever made. It hits the trifecta of great writing, great acting and great directing with astonishing aplomb.

If you want to watch a show that manages to take a single case and from that moment on weave through a web of tangled relationships and complicated motivations without dropping the thread once, watch this drama.

If you want to watch a show where two people have instant chemistry that isn't romantic but still sparks because they just get each other and are better for it, watch this show. The two main characters have such a satisfying rapport that doesn't need to be romantic.

That doesn't mean that other characters fall short mind you, and it's so amazing to see the arcs of the other characters, the fact that they even get them elevates this drama to the upper echelon of dramas alone.

The fact that this is this writer's first drama is astounding and I can't wait for their next project, although this one set the bar insanely high. The fact that the tension through out this drama didn't waver once and that everything concluded so satisfyingly is an amazing feat unto itself.

I might add more later, but for now this is easily one of the easiest recommendations to make. If you like a insanely well made drama about crime and mystery, drop everything and watch this. And even if those are not your jam, give this a go, I'm sure you won't regret this.

When I was younger, there were these cartoons that I used to watch known as ‘Dora The explorer’. In these cartoons Dora used to go around on her kiddy-sized expeditions (mainly in her backyard or the neighborhood park) and discover new things.

However, despite being known as an excellent kid explorer, Dora wasn’t the brightest bulb in the closet. Every episode went something quite like this; Dora would stand in front of, say, an apple tree and the treasure that she sought after would be an apple. So in order to find that apple, Dora would first cluelessly look to one side then the other, then she’d look all over all the while conveniently missing the tree located right behind her. After a good ten minutes of looking, when Dora still wouldn’t find the darned apple, the creators of the show would decide to give her a hint.

The hint went something like this: “Dora, if you look exactly behind yourself, you’ll find something. Now, we are not telling what it is, since this is only a hint but I think you should look behind you and see what you find.” For further help, a huge green arrow would point towards the apple on the tree. That was when Dora would finally have a light bulb moment and discover the goal of her expedition. Feeling mighty proud of her feat, she would then ask the viewers whether they too were able to find the apple or not.

Even as a child, I was about ready to combust at this point, for I had found the mighty apple the moment the tree came into the view. However, despite all its flaws it was still one of my favorite cartoons because it made me feel so clever. I was smarter than Dora. The world was a good place. What could possibly go wrong?

Except, when the same Dora-style execution is done in Contemporary Crime Shows, things do actually go wrong. This is exactly one of the reasons why people love “Stranger” so much. Stranger doesn’t come with the usual BS. It doesn’t assume that its viewers are mentally impaired baboons who can’t put two and two together. It actually respects the audience by considering them smart enough to follow the plot. There is no spoon feeding here, nor does a big ass green arrow point towards every idiotic discovery ever made. Instead, it’s a drama with an intelligent script that demands your full attention.

Every scene and every character has a reason for existing. With brilliant direction and almost no plot-holes the drama not only succeeds in captivating the audience, rather it also gives them space to really think about all that is happening.

For a lot of actors a “cold and emotionless” role is the gateway for slacking. They leave all their acting skills in the backseat and decide that posing like a cringey af model throughout the show is the way to go. Jo Seung Woo with his “Prosecutor Hwang Shi Mwok” explains that kids, it is indeed not the way to go.

For a character that is supposed to be expressionless and indifferent to everything and anything, Seung Woo sure did put out the acting of the century. While his face remains carefully blank at all times, there are slight nuances in his expression that highlight the emotional development Shi Mwok experiences throughout the episodes. A slight twitch of the brow to show frustration, relaxation of the facial muscles to show ease and the gorgeous, beautiful and rare smile to show happiness. Simply put, Shi Mwok is a delight to watch. Without showing, he still shows so much that by the first half of the drama, the viewers have already formed a deep connection with him.

A lot of people thought that the whole “brain surgery” plot-line was unnecessary, however, I think it was wholly essential in order for Shi Mwok to become who he was. He was a prosecutor who was able to observe every crime scene with a cold detachment that is unachievable for a normal person. And the show facilitated the fact by backing it up with a genuine reason instead of feeding the viewers some bogus and over-dramatic crap.For all those people who have seen God’s Gift, I know that Seung Woo shocked your pants off. The utter versatility of the actor cannot be described in words. He was a completely different person in this show, simply unrecognizable and for that, he has all of my respect.

I think one of the most endearing characters in the show was our female lead Han Yeo Jin. Bae Do Na held her own in terms of acting and the amount of chill that her character had was unlimited. She was such a genuinely cool person. Relentless, strong and quirky. Even though she won against bad people numerous of times, there was never any pomposity in her, for to her, even the wins felt like failures because they were against her own people. You can see how her heart hurt at the name of injustice and how fully determined she was to stand against it. No matter the consequences. She was the kind of fearless cop that is every ordinary citizen’s dream and every corrupt person in power’s nightmare.

So considering how exquisite these two were individually, it’s no surprise that they were unbeatable together. Lieutenant Han and Prosecutor Hwang: The ultimate dynamic duo that made the baddies shiver in their boots. The chemistry between them was excellent; easily topping many romances. They were the kind of comrades that can lean on each other in time of need, rely on the other in time of action and above all, understand each other all the time. As weird Shi Mwok was, Lieutenant Han just seemed to get him and he in turn respected and shared his secrets with her.
With best friends like these, who needs romance?

All of the other side characters came with their own quirks. They had their own story, their own motives behind actions that appeared to be ruthless and their own flaws and weaknesses. Nobody was completely good or completely bad; rather they were all wholly mortal.

Like other crime shows, the show did not make use of convenient plot-lines or shock value. There weren’t any WTF moments or nerve-wracking cliff hangers, rather there was a constant under-current of gravity that kept the viewers rooted to their spot.

This is the kind of drama that will warm your heart, fill you with sadness at the world’s corruption and leave you with the sweet hope that not all people are wicked, that there is still some good left and that little bit of goodness might just be able to overcome the evil.

I know that I should just end this review here but I need to be completely honest. As as you can clearly see, I have nothing but good things to say about this show. However, it doesn't mean that I am going to give it a perfect rating like many others because despite all of its beauty there were times where I wanted something more. I wanted to know why Mwok Shi was so relentless on eradicating all corruption. If he couldn't feel anything, where did all his righteousness sprout from? I wanted to know more about Lieutenant Han's background. Why was she always so alone?

Even though the whole drama came with a certain amount of simplicity and subtle intelligence, the last few episodes did at moments take on a fairy-tale touch. The conclusion was everything that you could've wanted, it was the perfect ending. However, considering the somber tone of the show, personally I expected something more gritty and raw.

So while this was one of the more amazing shows I have watched, I will not claim that ""This was the best Korean drama ever made"".

That being said, with some of the best dialogues and a spot-less execution, this drama is definitely not one to be missed. Which is why I wholeheartedly recommend it to every crime/thriller fan out there.Enjoy!

I don’t like serial killer dramas. I also don’t like shows that pair cold male geniuses with spunky heroines so he can give her a brain and she can give him a heart. Plus, prosecutors and cops up against institutional corruption? Been there, done that. And yet, despite its clichéd premise, Forest of Secrets works. It works because it has Jo Seung Woo and Bae Doo Na as the leads and they act their asses off, refusing to be reduced to stereotypes. It works because it’s as much about human relationships as it is about crime, exploring how the social networks we build can both sustain and corrupt us, about how easy it is to excuse the misdeeds of a friend, a colleague, or a family member. It also shows how an outsider can take those networks down, but it never lets you forget the gut-wrenching loneliness of such isolation. And finally, it works because the writer and the director pay attention to details. Without gushing tears, blaring pop songs, or graphic violence they present smart professionals methodically uncovering the truth.

The show does drag out the denouement, with more moralizing speeches than I’d prefer. It’s also not a ringing endorsement of the idea that people can change. It is however, a lovely example of how good writing, acting and directing can bring an old genre to vibrant, urgent life.

It is an extremely tough task to write a review about this show, since there is almost no end to all the things I would want to say about it. Simply put, out of all the dramas that I have watched, this one is on another level, all by itself. But, of course, that is far too little to even begin describing the love I have for this show.

Forest of Secrets has a quite typical “Who did it?” story, but it is marvelously told. Just like our main character, it starts off emotionless. However, somewhere along the path, it gains some small rays of light that, slowly but surely, pierce the darkness that overwhelms the show. It has no elements of romance or comedy to make some moments more enjoyable and it certainly doesn’t need them. The drama, from the beginning, until the very end, screams “crime” and “corruption”. At times it might seem slow, but it has this steady pace that gives a unique feel to it. It is packed with details, which are easy to omit, but if you look back at it you will see that there is much more to this show than it initially meets the eye. The attention that was given to all the small things makes you not lose focus of the story, but also the way it is composed makes you look at all the elements of the show, so that you don’t miss a single thing. It is not just a regular crime/investigation drama where you just can’t wait until the last episode for the killer to be caught. Quite the opposite, this show keeps you occupied throughout its entirety, so that you can clearly understand everything that is happening.

One of the things that I especially enjoyed is the fact that this show is unusually realistic. All the characters, both the heroes and the villains act as people would act in the real world. There is no superhero-type of behavior where someone does something that would never be done in reality, or a character who can easily outsmart everybody else. It is very down to earth, the solving of the cases is systematic, carefully planned, there are no sudden jumps made by long shot conclusions that are just there to speed up the story.

Now for the characters. They are, undoubtedly, the true gems of this drama. Everybody fits his or her role perfectly, there is not a single miscast. It makes you see only the character, and not the actor. All the characters are given a very human touch, the heroes as well as the villains. Even though our main protagonist is, for the most part, emotionless, he is not robot-like, and steadily develops throughout the story. The villains are given a lot of depth as well, which makes us even sympathize with them at moments. However, the most important aspect of all, that truly makes them all human, were their mistakes. Every single character made a mistake at some point in the show, which made this drama feel that much more real. And to top it all off, the interactions and dialogues between the two leads were simply amazing. It is what made this show produce some truly heart-warming moments, in all of its coldness. Lieutenant Han gave Prosecutor Hwang, our “emotionless” hero, a bit of heart.

The setting of the show was ideal. The dark scenes, in a usually crowded, but in the show mostly empty city, kept the thrill and the mystery present at every moment. The gloomy atmosphere gave a special chill that made everything even more dramatic. The closed, office scenes perfectly portrayed the cage which the heroes were trying to break through while searching for the culprit. Places such as the homes of the characters spoke for themselves, as they gave a huge insight into who they were, and what they were like, producing superb results. Even though it is a thriller/crime drama, it is very aesthetically pleasing, and enjoyable to watch. The cinematography is beautiful, like a fine piece of art, everything is where it should be.

I could go on and on for days talking about this show, but to sum it all up… this show was poetic. All other dramas I have seen cannot even compare to it. Through its complex characters, and sometimes painful to watch scenes, this seemingly emotionless drama, takes you on a wild roller coaster, which in the end leaves you speechless and puts a small smile on your face, just like it did to our beloved Hwang Shi Mok.

I never give any drama a perfect 10 but this drama 100% deserved it.

This drama is seriously amazing. I have watch like gazillion of Kdramas for the past 15 years and I can safely said that the writing for this drama is the best that ever comes out from Korea. It is intelligent, excellently written and the clever details is just mind blowing. The writer is great at constructing plot without leaving any minor details. The script is tight, solid, complicated without plot holes and full of characters with great depth and personalities without including any questionable or dumb plot in its storyline. I have high expectation before watching the show but this drama truly exceeded my already high expectations. The writers made everyone, including the main character as the possible suspects and yet, she is still able to surprise us with the ending.

I feel like no other investigation dramas can hold a candle to this other than Signal. Other law or investigation dramas always bother me with the inaccurate technical practices and details but this drama have none of those and it didn't insult you intelligent either. It's simply a brilliant cat & mouse chase drama where both the good and the bad guys are clever.

SECRET FOREST IS PERFECT IN QUALITY SENSE -- I dont even know it is possible until I watch this drama. There's nothing to complain about the script, plot, directing and acting as it is that good.

Wow what a drama. Up to date I think this is probably one of the best dramas that I've ever watched. This drama had a little bit of everything. A little bit of suspense. Some sprinkles of romance along with a dab of murder. Stranger otherwise known as Forest of Secrets is a crime-thriller drama about corruption within the judicial system. A prosecutor named Hwang Shi Mok goes on a quest to wipe out this corruption as he attempts to solve several murder cases.

Story: [10/10] Personally I'm a very big fan of this story. The plot is very well written and a lot of the characters are well-drawn out. A lot of the characters has their own motive as to why they do what they do. As you get further into the story the characters begin to reveal themselves more and more. This provided for a very complex web of characters as you find out how their lives intertwine. Heck, by the end of the drama, I even fell in love with two of the villains. You get to learn how these villains went from your every day Joe to murderers. Other shows usually don't give their villains a very good backstory. Other villains are murderers because they like killing... Wow... what a boring reason right?

Do you like to be placed on the edge of your seat dying to know what happens next? One of the other reason I really like this drama is that it's also very suspenseful. You never know what is going to happen next. There are a good amount of red herrings, but just enough so that the show is not too ridiculous or too boring. Every episode ends with tiny twists that leaves you wondering what will happen in the next episode. Boy am I glad that I binge-watched this show. Or else I'd be dying to know what happens each week.

There is also a little bit of romance in this drama as well. Not much, but it does add a little flavor to the story. This drama makes you wish for more. Even better so, my favorite type of romance are tragic romances that don't work out. This drama has just that. You'll just have to watch the series to see what I mean though.

Acting/Cast: [10/10] I was a very big fan of cast in this drama. Both the male and female leads aren't exactly big-name stars, but they did their job very well. Oh I also forgot to mention that the main male lead had part of his brain taken out as a child? I thought the male lead did a decently good job acting like he had very little emotions. You do get to see some smiles here and there though. Although I was more so interested in the supporting casts. There where a lot of very big name supporting characters in the drama that really added some extra flair to the show. I'm a big fan of Lee Kyung Young, Yoon Se Ah, Yoo Jae Myung, Lee Ho Jae, and Uhm Hyo Sub in other roles. You know a show is legit when you have a great supporting cast such as this one.

Music: [9/10] The music on this show wasn't that bad. I generally don't give shows a 10 unless they're a ""music-focused"" show or if they have a VERY memorable OST.

Rewatch Value: [10/10] I mean it when I give this show a 10 out of 10. I made the mistake of multi-tasking while watching this drama. Unfortunately this show is very complex and is not like your typical K-drama. You'll miss out on certain connections if you aren't paying attention. This show is on the top of my rewatch list when I get through my backlog. I'm going to rewatch it again for the plot as well as to pick up any tidbits that I may have missed.

One of my biggest gripe about this drama is the whole brains surgery and emotionless male lead. I didn't feel like it really added much to the story. It felt like it was just there to distinguish this show from other murder mystery/prosecutor drama. Honestly this doesn't really take away from much while you're watching the drama though. I only brought this up because I usually try to bring up at least one thing I didn't like in a show or one weakness. Overall I'm a HUGE fan of the story and the supporting cast. This show is a must watch! It's currently the 3rd ranked drama on MDL for a reason! Can we make it the top ranked show?

This well-written crime thriller with great performances is almost-universally considered the best kdrama of 2017 and possibly one of the best ever made. Underpinned by a strong friendship and with no romance plotline, all the episodes are devoted to plot and the pacing is perfect.

Bae Do Na and Jo Seung Woo are exceptional in their roles as a rare non-romantic buddy-cop partnership. While this show deals with familiar themes of corruption that kdrama viewers will find familiar, it is an interesting and gripping examination of the issue with a verisimilitude that borders at times on depressing.

Intelligent, fierce, uncompromising and stark, this is television at its finest.

Unpopular opinion but honest...
Ok, here is my unpopular opinion. After years of people recommending this drama, and so many perfect reviews, and a brand new season, and a pandemic, I decided to finally watch Stranger, and honestly, I was bored. I kept waiting to get sucked into the story and it never happened. I kept wanting to root for the blank-faced Hwang Shi Mok, but I was as indifferent to him as he looked. Bae Doo Na as Han Yeo Jin was the only character I really liked a lot, and I did think the Lieutenant and Prosecutor duo had some great moments together, but as for the story - mostly I was very VERY bored.

I admit that I don't have much interest in political crime dramas. I prefer thrillers, and this is definitely more crime drama than thriller. It starts off with a thriller vibe, but the pace was very slow and even tedious to me at times. There are several characters who are duplicitous, which is the main focus of this story, but not as much actual action and suspense. Most of this drama is conversations, arguments, eavesdropping, thinking aloud... LOTS of thinking aloud... I consider myself to be pretty analytical, but the plot didn't grab me enough to justify dwelling on the details. There are twists, but nothing truly surprising. There was nothing that made me excited to tune in to the next episode besides mild curiosity.

This is the kind of drama where you really have to love the characters to like it, and I found most of them to be pretty forgettable. The main character, who should have been the most interesting considering his back story, was too flat. I can't necessarily blame any performance, the acting isn't the issue, it's just that I had a hard time caring about any of them based on the plot. One character, Shin Hye Sun as Young Eun Soo, seemed completely unreasonable to me and I just couldn't sympathize. Other characters started to feel one-note, with lots of corrupt, greedy, and ambitious tropes.

Would I watch this again? Clearly not. I was tempted to watch this mostly in preparation for the 2nd Stranger season, but I will most likely pass on that one too. Well, maybe I'll give episode one a chance... but just out of more mild curiosity.

Overall, if you are not excited by the story early on don't expect it to be more exciting later. Most of the action is in the very beginning and the very end. I did become more interested around episode 14 and that's a long time to watch and wait for some excitement. To be honest, I should have dropped this and left it at that but with so many amazing reviews I was tempted to see if it would all be worth it in the end. The end is well done in some ways, and everything does come together, but for me, it wasn't worth completing. I wanted to add my opinion just in case anyone has a similar feeling while watching and is on the fence. The payoff wasn't big enough for me to justify recommending this. The most disappointing part is how they barely go into the main character's backstory, which would have been far more interesting than just watching him be slightly smarter than everyone with a mostly emotionless face, and maybe would have made him less boring to me. I won't say it's overrated, but it's certainly not for everyone. If corruption dramas are what you love you will probably like this way more than I did. If you find yourself wondering if there's romance... you probably want to skip this one. The political thriller shows I like are more like ""House of Cards"", but If watching someone solve a jumbo puzzle for 16 hrs sounds like a good time, you're in luck, because that's what watching this felt like to me.
Part of me wonders if high expectations made me dislike it more, but that's also what kept me from dropping it for good.

This isn't my first time not liking a beloved drama, so I'm fine being one of the less impressed few.

I'm writing this review in contrast to those who have given this show perfect marks. I believe it's a bit overrated, and tbh, it fell short in a number of aspects. It's also far-fetched to say that this was ""one of the best dramas ever created."" I'd say the rating should be just around 8-8.5, in my honest opinion.

WHAT DIDN'T WORK:
It had quite a number of flaws, many of them being on character development. There were a ton of flat and boring characters, who lacked clear motivations, and realistic boundaries in the series.

Starting of with the male lead, Hwang si Mok. He is known to have a personality disorder due to a brain surgery that removes his capability of feeling human emotions, most specifically empathy. There were a lot of scenes and minutes proving this. But those scenes I believe are meaningless, and just made the show draggy because it didn't in any way move the plot. There was no clear connection on how this disorder affects Hwang Si Mok's judgement or how he would have solved the mystery and why he was so determined to stop the corruption in the prosecution.

If he had been a normal person, or without having this disorder, would he have acted differently? Given how the series built his character, I believe he would have done the same thing. So why include this meaningless angle at all?

Han Yeo Jin, the female lead was also a dull character. She's a character that the series would just force everyone to accept that she's good just because she is. There are no developments on why she is acting the way she is, or why she's helping Hwang Si Mok. Also, come to think of it, there was no other background given in the series towards her identity, aside from that of her being a police officer.

Kim Jeong Bon, Hwang Si Mok's supposed middle school friend/classmate. There's no information at all given to their supposed ""friendship"" that should motivate him to help Hwang Si Mok in his endeavors. I found it a bit weird that he suddenly was so determined into helping Hwang Si Mok, who is barely an acquaintance, and who he just randomly met after 20 years.

I could say more flaws like these for many other characters. I think the only characters who had real depth in the series were probably Dong Jae Seo, and Chang Jun- Lee, but then their character development also came a bit late.

Aside from poor character development, the pace was unusually slow for the genre. I wouldn't say that 16 episodes were too much for the series' content, but some of the episodes could have been used to again, better character development, rather than just watching the leads stumble to dead end after dead end of the mystery they're solving. A lot of the scenes involving solving the mystery could be compressed further to give way to better content.

WHAT WORKED:
I think what's good about this drama is the fact that it had a clear focus, and never bent away from the plot. This is probably the main reason why the audience stayed with it until the end. (despite its many flaws) It developed a desire among the audience to know the end, and how the culprits would be caught.

The script was also something praise-worthy. Dialogues were very realistic and is based on actual spoken language, and not cheesy/heroic type of lines, especially those said by the leads. A lot of thrillers/action dramas or any drama for that matter fall into the pit of trying to make the leads act like superheroes or super cool characters by making them say unrealistic cheesy speeches as they capture the culprits, whilst heroic music plays in the background. Pretty sure we've all encountered this in one drama or another.

The acting, I'd say was good, in the sense it was realistic, and not overly done.

OVERALL:
The series could have been much better if it had paid more attention into creating more tangible and deeper figures amongst its leads. By doing this, it could have bettered its connection with its viewers. Only then would the audience have a deeper reason as to why to watch this series, other than just having the desire to know the show's end.

""Stranger"" was pretty much perfect. It might ruin other crime dramas for me in the future because it was so good. I'm giving it a 10 which I hardly ever do. Lots of crime dramas rely on shock, sordid details or graphic violence to thrill and create interest. Stranger tells a story about complicated characters with passions, motives, and morals that collide, corrupt, and sometimes bolster and strengthen each another. Though this is a crime investigation story and definitely contains some gruesome scenes, most of the thrills come from the characters playing off each other.

The script is so tightly written. The story is a cleverly laid out labyrinth with compelling, intelligent characters at each turn. There are no throw away characters who behave stupidly, frustrating plot details, cutesy comic relief or romance just for the sake of adding romance. Every line could have a potential effect on the outcome. If you let your mind drift for a moment you might just miss out on some new clue or development. While watching, I often had the unsettling feeling that everyone is not who they seem and everyone is up to no good. Then a moment later I would often come to the exact opposite conclusion and think maybe this character is exactly who he appears to be after all. It had me on the edge of my seat and guessing up through the last episode. The writing is so impressive.

""Stranger"" is really well-acted. The 2 main leads do such a great job. Jo Seung Wo is excellent as Prosecutor Hwang. Playing a cold, emotionless, and calculating character with limited facial expressions, he somehow manages to shine with goodness and integrity, gain our sympathy and win our hearts. Bae Doo Na is excellent as Lieutenant Han who is the more stereotypical good cop character, but she brings her character to life with warmth, passion and toughness. I also particularly enjoyed Lee Joon Hyuk as Seo Dong Jae. He portrays his smarmy despicable character with a lot of emotional range. He's the guy you love to hate and sometimes feel sorry for. All the characters have great chemistry together - both the heroes and villains - though you never really know for sure who is who until the very end when all the pieces fall together perfectly. It's a thrilling and compulsively watchable drama that builds in intensity as the story progresses. I am sorry to be done. I even re-watched the last episode immediately so I didn't have to say goodbye just yet.

This drama brings up ideas about what makes a person who they are. Does a person ever fundamentally change? What make us human? What makes us good or bad? Is it our emotions, our ideals or intentions? Our actions? Morals? A sense of justice? If you are into crime stories you have to watch this. But I also highly recommend this to people who appreciate an intelligent well told story that makes you think.

This review may contain spoilers
I don't have time to go into details, but also I cannot give spoilers anyhow. I can give this drama the best endorsement I am capable of as a person who has seen A LOT of Kdramas:

I have completed 244 dramas (nearly all Korean, a couple Chinese). I had but 1 that I rated a 10 - Signal....until I finished this one. I now have two dramas ranked 10. Yes, it's that good. There are no flaws. This drama is as good as Kdramas get: writing, directing, acting are all superb. There is never a facepalm moment. The lead male is perfection. The lead female is also, for a rare change, perfection! A truly competent and not in the least annoying female lead in a Kdrama, what a rare thing indeed! I had high expectations for this drama given the lead actors. I was not disappointed!

Wow. Secret Forest is amazing. I felt connections with the actors. The interlaced plot with all of these twists and turns. Secret allies, conspiracies and of course hidden enemies. Misplaced loyalty's, justice, attempts of murder.

A different look at a done topic. I love how this is slightly like A Beautiful Mind. Both have a female lead in the police profession. Only difference that our main lead is a prosecutor.

This drama is so well done. The pace is not slow its like a steady current aiming to break down a rock. Steady but with power. It will crush the rock at the finale. Each episode builds on what we know and adds more to our knowledge of the story. When we think we have it all down and its done. We get a curve ball out of nowhere.

I love stories that develop like this. A puzzle in a puzzle hidden by an equation with additional variables and aspects that make you really think.

Its also slightly cute at points with interactions by certain characters.

Betrayals, friendships, sudden changes in alliances, great story, amazing actors. I'm so pleased overall with this drama. Even at the half way mark I was overjoyed to get to see more of the story unfold. I can already sense this hole in my chest hurting when I don't get to watch new episodes.

Its also a very good, solid choice of drama to marathon.

“In each of us, two natures are at war – the good and the evil. All our lives the fight goes on between them, and one of them must conquer. But in our own hands lies the power to choose – what we want most to be we are.”
- Robert Louis Stevenson

“You take people, you put them on a journey, you give them peril, you find out who they really are.”
- Joss Whedon

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I were to describe this drama with one word, it would be:

Misleading - complex - secretive - slowly seething - engraving

Yeah, okay. Those were not only one word but five. But as difficult as it is to categorize each character in this story, it's also impossible to find only one word or one saying that would cover every beautiful aspect about this whole show.

Hwang Shi Mok, a prosecutor who lacks the ability to feel any emotion since a surgery in his childhood, and Han Yeo Jin, a police lieutenant, team up to fight corruption in the prosecutor's office. That pretty much describes it all and the summary above is also very accurate about the key points.

-- Misleading --
I admit that I was a little skeptical and hesitant before I started this drama. Prosecutors and corruption. Not again... But my worries were groundless. Even though this drama is indeed about those things, the whole set-up differs alot from your usual k-drama structure. Sometimes and especially in the beginning you might think that many things are predictable. But you will soon be disabused. You'll learn that every scene, every move and every obvious incident has always two maybe even three faces to them. You can never be sure about what you see right in front of you.

-- Complex --
The characters in this story are as cunning and sly as the story around them. There is not one person you can be certain about and only the finale will reveal everyone's true nature. Only at the far end you'll see the whole picture. So, be aware of the fact that you have to pay a lot of attention.

-- Secretive --
Imagine each one of these people as trees with many branches - long and short ones, thick and thin ones which symbolize their every wish, desire, greed, ambition and so much more. Everyone hides in the shadows. Some of them stand in a light grey, others in far darker places. But it doesn't automatically make them bad people. And I loved that the drama conveyed that as well.

-- Slowly seething --
The story flow might seem a little dragging here and there but you shouldn't forget that this a drama that focuses much on the corruption in the prosecutor's office and never loses its way. It's ""slowly seething"", as I was describing it in the beginning.

-- Engraving --
The music is subtle and so well set that you are left with deep impressions every time an episode ends - even though the narrative flow might seem slow-paced. And let me tell you that this drama has one of the most captivating final episodes I've seen so far.

-- Forest of Secrets --
Never was drama title more accurate.

Okay it's been a hot second since I've written a review!

So I actually have some backstory when it comes to this drama. Bae Doo Na is actually my first KDrama girl crush, and I didn't even watch her in a Korean TV show. I love the roles she selects (badass queens, no weak female leads here), I love her acting style, just everything. So going into this, and knowing her, I have high expectations. And they were met, but maybe not surpassed.

Additionally, I used this drama to try to get my friend who is into KPop but not KDrama to watch this with me (social distance Netflix party!). She's not into romance focused shows, so I thought this could be a great start since it has so many raving reviews. Long story short, we never followed up after the first episode, but that was due to dragging internet and overall kind of a shitty streaming experience. I'm glad I gave it a second shot. Every episode pretty much ends on a cliffhanger, so if that's not your thing, beware.

In conclusion, I typically watch crime/thrillers with a romance angle, so this is probably the first drama for me where there really wasn't that aspect. For not having my favorite genre, I still really liked it, so that's really saying something for a RomCom fan. If I was more of a crime drama girl this drama would probably be a 10, but I'm not so I'm just going to rate it being true to how I felt about it based on my personal preferences (yes, people have those).

TLDR; Stan Bae Doo Na, everyone should at least give this drama a good ol' try.

I started watching this missing some good non romantic Korean Show and I definitely got what I wanted.

For those who expect a good thriller full of plot twists I totally recommend this show.

Hwang Shi-mok is a prosecutor with an unusual past. After undergoing a rare surgery he lacks apathy that besides painful side effects makes his 5 senses more evolved than most people.

When he sees himself having to solve a murder case that might involve his superiors he puts his career on the line to  dig on to powerful man.

The plot itself looks super interesting right? In this whole season we will meet different characters that we will hate and love all over again.

If your looking for romance you will only find sympathy and human knowledge. How does the mind of powerful people work? What do we get from being apathetic and controled? Can we really trust people who surround us?

*Story
I can only give it a 7 cause in the middle it gets a bit boring. When you have a suspenseful kind of plot for a 16 episode show you have to be careful not go all aboard and in the middle give 2 pointless episodes just to say that the show is long. Besides that I can say I like the beginning a lot and only kept going cause I got attached to some characters. The ending is average but considering there might be a 2nd season I kinda am excited for it.

*Acting/Cast
I give it a 9 for sure, the actors are so good and the characters they portrait are unique  and addicting.

*Music
There isn't much of a music component here so it gets a 6 for the awesome intro.

*Rewatch value
If I would re-watch the show? Obviously. I would even repeat in a few years when I forget who is who, lucky enough my memory sucks.

Forest of Secrets (aka Stranger) to me was no less than a turning point in my journey of K-Drama watching, maybe even Asian dramas in general.
It is simply a drama which has compelled me to reevaluate my standards, to reconsider a lot of the 9 and 10 ratings that I have been so easily giving to other dramas.
Some may consider my review a bit exaggerated or over-the-top, but to me this sensational drama, was a huge surprise on many levels. It’s a drama that has sucked me in and left a very deep impression on me just after watching the first episode, I was determined to watch the whole thing and confident I would love every second of it. And so it was.

On paper this drama may seem like it does not differ from many other detective and law dramas, but with a mystery woven with utmost precision, a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and a highly engaging battle for justice, all aided by a perfect cast and direction, this drama was anything but usual.


The drama's title was perfectly fitting to its premise, it delivers an intricate web of mystery and doubts, that just as advertised, anyone can be guilty. Watching this drama, you will constantly find yourself doubting a certain character, then trusting it, only to later harbor even stronger doubts toward him/her. The story was so smartly written, that it can so easily trick the smartest of viewers, sending fake signals; seemingly flags pointing to a certain character, only to later turn out to be a complete red-herring.


But one of the main strong points of this drama was, the perfectly executed characterization aided by the cast’s very strong and solid performance. Most of the characters, particularly the main ones, were multi-layered, with complicated backgrounds, some even deeply messed up. You could hardly label anyone “Protagonist” or “antagonist”, you find yourself liking and at the same time harboring doubts towards the same character. The characters are so believable and realistic, that however much their actions may seem unethical or outrageous, you still mysteriously relate to them, feel for them, and even sometimes love them.

But what really made such beautifully written story, script and characterization shine was the acting. There was not a single easy character to portray here, all thanks to the concept of the detective mystery; where you never know who’s not to trust and who’s to trust. The story also relied on a highly sophisticated script, which made use of a lot of blank sequences of silence with minimum or no monologues, but which still served to convey a ton of information and emotions.
All such aspects, required high acting techniques, where even the slightest look, change of expression or even lack of one, can make all the difference.
This is a drama that have time and again surprised me. Not because of all the obvious strong points that I mentioned above, but because it redefined even the small things, like what defines two characters’ chemistry, or what counts as a strong cliffhanger. Does chemistry have to be of a romantic type, involving gestures, confessions and skin-ship? Or is there another type of chemistry; a mental and emotional one, where two minds and souls so mysteriously and effortlessly relate, and share feelings of deep trust and respect. Such are the chemistries that do not require a major progress on a romantic level to attract and excite a viewer, but where a small gesture of courtesy, or an expression of high-regard, can leave you more satisfied than any other stomach butterflies.
With a very unique story, and an even more unique set of characters and events, this drama to me felt like I was rediscovering just how much perfect K-Dramas can be. Watching it, I felt so impressed, I sometimes thought how blessed I am to have been a K-Drama fan. I kept saying to myself, Hollywood should really learn one thing or two from Korean thrillers and detective dramas, feelings which made me all the more delighted to hear that it was actually airing on Netflix! It also posed as a reassurance, that this drama is receiving the attention and recognition it is worthy of.
I normally do not ship for sequels however much I love a drama (like Signal or Misaeng), but I found myself strongly wishing they’d consider producing a sequel for Stranger, preferably with the same cast. Keeping my fingers crossed that news circulating of an intention for a sequel is not a hoax.
Normally, I’d give different recommendations to different genre fans, like for instance if a certain drama lacks romance or comedy aspects, I’d advice a Rom-Com fan to approach with caution. But in this drama’s case, I send my strongest recommendations to every one! Including newcomers to K-Drama land. By all means, give the first episode I try and you won’t regret what happens afterwards.

BEST DRAMA EVER
Somewhere in 2017, I started a Korean drama called ""Stranger"" or also known as ""Forest of secrets"". The poster and title were so different and I just randomly clicked on episode one and just fell in love. The whole drama is so different, when I say different I mean it's rollercoaster of a nostalgic feeling. It made me feel like I was inside that drama. Episode one opens with Hwang Shi Mok (Jo Seung Woo) a character having some kind of brain surgery and he lacks emotion. He has zero emotions. Hwang Shi Mok starts working as a prosecutor and then the story begins with several cases being solved. This drama is so simple and well-directed. Later on, Han Yeo Jin (Bae Doo Na) joins him in several cases and their chemistry is good. There is no romance or sparks but their chemistry is everything to root for one. Each and every character in this drama have their own stories to tell and it all syncs up with the cases happening. I just love how deep every episode is. This drama is one of the best crime written dramas ever. No words can describe how good this drama is.

I remember listening to the OST's non-stop during my hard time, I love song by Richard Park ""Without end"". Sometimes I just randomly play ""dust"", ""Shower"" and ""Like a monster"", just lie down or while working. It lifts my mood. It makes me feel like I am inside Hwang Shi Mok's head.

I low-key tear up watching it sometimes, I cannot explain how beautiful and precious Han Yeo Jin is to me. If you closely analyze the whole drama you will be able to see how Han Yeo Jin slowly changes Hwang Shi Mok. There is one scene where he smiles. That smile is still stuck in my head, it's inescapable. I also love how she doodles randomly and gives it to Hwang Shi Mok.

I want to confess that I ship Hwang Shi Mok and Han Yeo Jin. I want them to fall in love, I want them to kiss, sex like monsters, and have babies. I love this drama so much. I am crying with happiness that season will air today. I am going to watch it now and hope for the best.

Ok, this is my first review on MyDramaList, as I had a sudden urge to write one after finishing Secret Forest.

Hands down to one of the best shows I've ever seen, not just within the Korean Drama category. You might get discouraged around 30 minutes into the first episode because nothing would make sense, but I assure you this show is not something you should drop.

The script is excellently written, there is not a single plot hole. Every dialogue, scene and line is very important and prepared way beforehand, watch out, and don't miss anything. The show contains absolutely no filler scenes. What's great about this show, is that it focuses on one huge complicated case from the get go (as I said, no fillers). Editing, cinematography and music are top notch! especially the soundtrack!

It's my first time watching Jo Seung Woo and Bae Doo Na. Now they've made it to the list of my favorite actors. Jo Seung Woo did a phenomenal job portraying the character with no emotions, more like without the ability of emotional expression. As episodes go by, you'll become very attached to Jo Seung Woo's character, Hwang Shi Mok, the character development he goes through is very heartwarming! And I absolutely enjoyed the fact that they did not make the lead a super genius!

A lot of people compared this show to Beautiful Mind (including myself) because of the lack of emotion part. But I have to say that Lee Young Oh (BM) and Hwang Shi Mok (SF) have different conditions, I cannot explain how as I would be giving away the stories of both, and Jo Seung Woo did a better job portraying his character than Jang Hyuk did. The shows aren't that similar btw! The closest I've seen to the Secret Forest is Pride and Prejudice.

The cast is chosen very well, and each character whom you'd think is secondary or insignificant is nothing but the opposite.

If you're looking for something to keep you on edge, expecting anything at any moment, this show is perfect for you.

And if you are shying away from the show because it lacks the romance tag, well you are missing out on the cutest OTP with the greatest chemistry, Hwang Shi Mok and Han Yeo Jin.

P.S. even if it's not what you're looking for, give it a shot, I promise you won't regret it.

Definitely deserves a second season!

NON Spoiler review :

I've watched now 50+ dramas .
Reviewed most of them .

I am a vivid watcher .
I pay attention to everything with precise detail .

If you're into K dramas , you must be familiar with how they are .
If it's a typical crime drama or anything , it will end how you're familiar with .

But
'STRANGER'
is just out of this world . Mind boggling .
I didn't expected it to be this exceptional .

The synopsis might not seem that great but the drama is .

This drama had the highest quality of acting so far .
Each and every character played as just smoked their everything .
You can't even flinch something at someone in terms of acting .

The plot has it ups and downs .
It's just awestrucking till episode 7 or 8 but then it slows down a bit .

Near the ending you'll feel a bit uninterested but hold you beer right there .

The ending episode takes your breathe away .

If you're human . If you're interested in reality . Then this is for you .
Stranger has the most sensible and harsh ending .
But still it tells you not to lose yourself , your hope , your righteousness .

PS : Jo seung woo , I've seen his only earlier drama God gift's 15 days .
And I knew he's an acting GOD .
I can easily say he's the best actor male of the K-drama industry .

This drama simply played with my head for sixteen episodes straight. From the very first episode, which was one of most impressive pilot I’ve seen in a while. Everything was top notch. Good action, constant tension, interesting characters and amazing pace, I was basically at the edge of the seat, not even completely knowing what’s going on.

Because viewer is very slowly eased into what’s going on. For most of the time, we’re not entirely sure what’s about to happen. And it’s because of two things. First of all, characters are absolutely unpredictable. We don’t really know much about them aside of what’s happening. There’s very little voiceovers and close to none exposition, so we don’t know what they’re thinking and what they’re planning next. For most of the time, they’re wild cards, especially main character. We don’t really know who’s on who’s side, are they ally or and enemy. Even when Si Mok assembles task team, we hope that he’ll finally find someone to trust, but soon we figure out that the team is mostly made up of his enemies or people who work for them.The other reason is that events are not really explained. Once again we know exactly the same as our characters and sometimes even less than that. For like 90% of the time we don’t really know what the characters are up to. This all adds up to very interesting murder mystery/ thriller story. But you need to follow is carefully not to get lost.

Let’s talk about main character, because Hwang Si Mok (in this role absolutely fantastic Cho Seung Woo) is a type of the guy who is hard to like, but you’ll absolutely learn to love.
Again, we don’t know much about him, some random facts, some glimpse about his private life, mostly rumours circling around. His biggest trait: he lacks emotions, completely. And because of that for most of the time we have no idea what goes through his head. Is he honest or is he just bluffing? Plus, he really doesn’t have anyone on his side, which he openly admits. He’s not liked in his work environment and gossips that surround him just pour more fuel on the fire. This drama is the reason I have trust issues because at one point I has questioning everything and I even starting suspect Si Mok of committing murder.

We have main plot line that revolves around murder of a person, who as it turns out had a history of bribing highly situated people, including some prosecutors. Obviously a lot of people wouldn’t mind his death, so there’s a lot of suspects and very few proofs. And the thing is that no character is really black or white. No-one is completely good or absolutely bad. All characters are somewhere is between moving closer towards one of the sides. And then there’s Si Mok, without emotions operating in absolutes. You did something bad, you’re not a good person, you need to be punished. His judgement is absolutely objective, there’s no place for personal input.
And because everyone seem to be guilty of something, finding out about another crimes stops being a surprise, really. More often it’s a question of what rather than if.

Characters are absolutely fascinating here and I’m not only talking about the main ones. It seems that everyone has a unique story or some secret that we don’t know about.

About the plot, there’s obviously main murder theme that is somewhere in the middle of the action, but what we really focus on is politic play that surrounds main characters. So before we get to the solution of the main case we get though so many issues that sometimes this murder seems almost secondary. Especially that we cannot be sure of anything. Even if the case looks like it’s solved there’s always possibility of something happening. Even when somebody admits to committing the crime we still cannot be sure that he really did it.

The pace of the show is rather steady. It’s a suspenseful thriller, not action packed drama.

I have to admit, I’ve started watching is for Cho Seung Woo, after his performance in Sisyphus, but I’ve absolutely stayed for how amazing this drama is. All characters are masterfully played (kudos to Bae Doo Na and Yoo Jae Myung among many others) but let’s be honest, from this cast we could only expect the all the best.

Plus there’s one good thing about this drama, it has a second season!

Stranger is one of the best action / crime / legal dramas I have ever watched, including those from western companies. It weaves an intelligent, gripping and memorable story-line that unfolds at a perfect pace throughout the entire 16 episodes. Nothing is rushed and there is no scene that does not advance either the plot or deepens the character development. If you wish to fully invest in the story it demands your attention 100% of the time because every detail is crucial, every character line is essential, every frame or pane of the camera reveals something.

This is a series that speaks volumes on what quality action drama should be, at least according to my taste. The stakes are high and the tension escalates from the story itself, which although fictitious it can easily be a portrayal of real life cases...which is what makes it both terrifying and satisfying to watch it unfold.

This is not a show for those that need action packed, explosions, car chases or overly dramatic sequences to be entertained. This show is for those that want to be challenged, that want to solve a mystery together with the protagonists, someone that values intelligent writing over dramatic writing. I loved every second of it and you can be sure that I will watch it again soon. Looking forward to Season 2 soon!

Give it a chance and you'll be surprised!

Personally, I found this drama very similar to other crime K-dramas but lacking in the charm present in the others I loved.

The storyline definitely dragged, and I often wished each episode was focused on a different case instead of just this corruption of the prosecutor's office. So slow.

I was left disappointed because I love Bae Doona in Sense8 and was expecting something of that caliber in this drama. She didn't get to showcase her acting abilities in this drama unfortunately (as far as I watched).

With an unoriginal plot and dull main character, this drama failed to excite me and I dropped after ten episodes. While I do not recommend this at all, you should definitely give it a try and form your own thoughts on it.

This review may contain spoilers
There’s this saying that a lot of Korean dramas start out good then become bad after the first eight episodes. The exact opposite happens in Stranger/Forest of the Dead/Forest of Secrets (why so many titles? I’m going with Stranger for now -.-); and I’m a bit disappointed. I think I should have managed my expectations but the problem is that this one got compared to Signal a lot. I wasn’t necessarily looking for something similar to Signal in terms of plot, but I wanted something with at least the same level of suspense and excitement. I think Stranger didn’t know what it wanted to be. It wanted to be a thrilling murder mystery but it was more of a commentary on corruption in law offices. If they had managed to blend all these genres into an intriguing, compelling story then that would have been great but what you have after a mildly interesting first episode are eight more episodes of false alarms and red herrings. During this time, there is a bit of a whodunnit going on. I normally love whodunnits, but the execution in the first eight episodes is at best eye rolling or at worst, boring.

The focus for the first eight episodes was guessing the identity of a murderer. So viewers were made to follow the stoic lead character as suspicion was transferred from one character around him to another. That in itself was not so bad, if it weren’t for how slow paced and ridiculous the basis for suspicion was at times. In one episode, the police arrested someone simply for being in the same area as another victim. This person who was arrested was not even in the same building as the victim. The only basis for arresting this suspect was that he knew the said victim. The police in Asian dramas are usually not depicted as the smartest (how else would the Sherlockian main character get to shine and dazzle us with his/her wits?) but even for dramaland, this was way beyond my personal level of tolerance. The fact that the plot treated this arrest as justified (one corrupt prosecutor sees this as an opportunity to blame an innocent suspect) instead of berating the police for how dumb they were was unacceptable. Usually, when an innocent is framed, there is at least some basis for it, such as you know- actually being in the scene of the crime? -.-

In another scene, a comatose victim is given a bodyguard by the police to protect her because she was supposedly the only one who saw the murderer. The problem? The bodyguard is only there to protect her sleeping arse by the day because you know, we all know that there is absolutely NO WAY the murderer would attack her by night. Because killers need their rest as well. -.- There’s dumb and there’s unforgivably dumb.

In other episodes, the main lead transfers his suspicions to other supporting characters but there’s no excitement for viewers because it is made obvious that the latest suspect cannot possibly be the murderer. They are either too sleazy, too incompetent or too emotional. There’s this sleaze bag Dong Jae who doesn’t do anything but lick the head honcho’s butt. When he’s not being a sycophant he’s peering at other people from behind hallway corners with frightened-I’ve-definitely-got-something-to-hide eyes. He gives you that same disgusted feeling as watching an evil minion/side kick because you are simultaneously annoyed and entertained by watching him even if you know he’s not the big bad of the story. I guess that counts as a positive because the actor playing him definitely did a good job in portraying a scum bag who wasn’t particularly evil.

I liked the main lead, Hwang Shi Mok, a lot. I thought he would be one of those cold-hearted geniuses who weren’t particularly nice but placed on a pedestal by the writers but he turned out to be very likable. He is exactly the kind of person you wouldn’t mind having as a friend, as a boss or as a mentor, even if he isn’t communicative. The guy had determination and a quiet intensity that made him interesting and more importantly he was a really nice person anyone would have wanted on their side. The only problem is that he had a condition that made it hard for him to express emotions and this was either used against him, or caused others to misunderstand his intentions.

Police Lieutenant Yeo Jin is another likable character (the actress Bae Doo Na has a gruff no nonsense personality that fit this role so much) but to be honest, she didn’t really do much. She had her best bad ass moments in the latter half of the series (tracking a suspect using video cams, chasing another suspect down, having a little fist fight here and there if she needed to) but in terms of figuring things out, solving clues and making connections, she hardly had any contribution which was disappointing. The only thing is that viewers were made to think that Yeo Jin and Shi Mok were equal co-stars but the truth is that he is the main character…and she is just supporting. If these expectations were set from the beginning, then her lack of contributions in the field of detection, along with her lack of screen time in the first eight episodes, wouldn’t have been so noticeable.

I think the supporting female lead Eun Soo did a lot more sleuthing than Yeo Jin. I really liked Eun Soo because she had her own personal goal and was very relentless about it. She was the type of character you expected to be naive and to not stand out much, but she turned out to be just as determined and single minded as Shi Mok.

I think Stranger’s success lies in its characters. They were interesting and you really cared about them. The only thing is that they seemed to be caught up in an inferior plot.

The plot finally picks up again after eight boring episodes because it finally focuses on what the drama is about- corruption in law offices and the police force where murder just happens to be a symptom of a bigger disease. I think Stranger would have been better if it had ten episodes instead of sixteen because then they could have removed all the unnecessary, pointless plot lines and gotten straight into the most exciting, relevant parts. I would not say the latter half was as exciting as Signal or other suspense thrillers. Stranger wasn’t really a thriller, it lacked the suspense and edge of your seat excitement to be called that. But it worked on some level as a drama that had an occasional interesting moment thrown in.

This series is a bit of a mix for me. While I did appreciate the story development and how it wraps up well, there wasn't enough explanation of the emotional growth of the main character. This I thought should have been much more focused on, which is what I had hoped for when choosing the series to watch. In addition, the crime aspect of the series also had noticeable fails. One example would be the disregard to the crime scenes such as picking up a false nail by hand, then taking a photograph of it after dropping it back on the ground. It could have maybe been shortened by a few episodes with a slightly less rushed ending.

However, if you can ignore the above as I did and just go with the story, it is still an enjoyable watch.

I actually wasn't sure if I would watch this one or not when I first read the description. I really like Shin Hye Sun and was disappointed that this didn't sound like a show I'd want to watch. But as the good reviews started pouring in, I thought maybe it might be worth a shot. I hesitantly watched the first episode and was surprised to find that I enjoyed it. I usually hate anything with much political overtones, so I had low expectations even though I do enjoy investigation thrillers.This show exceeded any hopes I had for it so much. My only real complaint is that from the build up we had, I was just expecting an ending that would be like a bomb. While, that isn't what I got, I was still very pleased with what they offered. This show is very dialogue heavy, though, so be prepared to keep a close eye on it for details and possibly to have to back up and rewatch a scene here and there. I though the show was very smartly written and fairly riveting.

The cast was excellent. This was the first time I've ever watched Jo Seung Woo, Bae Doo Na, and (the first time I've noticed) Lee Joon Hyuk. They all impressed me a lot. They all had a subtlety and charm about them. Yoon Se Ah as Lee Yeon Jae did a fantastic job - totally bought her being on the edge.

If you enjoy these genres, this drama should be on your short list!

I must say from the very beginning it didn't take me long to be hooked by this drama. The story was absolutely amazing and had me guessing to the very end. The cast of characters was top notch to say the least. This is one of those dramas that when it ends you wonder how you can anyone top that.

Let's start with the story:

The writing is exceptional, I didn't feel any episode fell flat or didn't add to the story overall. With each episode puzzle pieces fell into place. I kind of had a feeling what was going to happen but it definitely wasn't obvious and really I was skeptical if what I thought might happen would actually happen. I was pleasantly surprised how it all turned out. The main crime drama part of the story line really got me hooked and surprised us through most of the story. What really held it together was the amazing cast though.

Characters:

I won't go through all of the characters just a few of my favorites.

Hwang Shi Mok played by Jo Seung Woo was such an amazing character and to me felt like a superhero. I know, a man with hardly any emotion being a superhero you say, well I had a hard time seeing him any other way. Someone who was incorruptible in a nation full of the corrupt, battling these people when all odds were stacked against him. I mean you can't get any more superhero than that. I also loved the fact that he wasn't capable of feeling emotions like other people so when he did show the smallest sign of emotion it was very powerful.

Han Yeo Jin played by Bae Doo Na. Wow I really loved her character. She was simply amazing in the role. Not only was she a badass to me she seemed very vulnerable and human as well which was the perfect mix to add to Shi Mok's character. I loved how towards the end Shi Mok would call her when he had something on his mind, they definitely had a special bond.

Yeong Eun Soo played by Shin Hye Sun. What a touching character who I loved throughout the series. She was that tragic part of the story that just made you feel pain. I think she really was a pivotal character in showing that Shi Mok wasn't emotionless. In fact seeing his pain was very revealing.

Those were my 3 favorites but I could definitely go on but I would be here all day writing. The characters really were the shining star of this drama, no doubt.

I could gush all day over this drama and would recommend it wholeheartedly. I am so stoked about season 2, I totally can't wait!

I believe this has to be one of the best Kdramas I have watched. This was actually my second try on Kdramas on Netflix (after watching Man x Man I was not satisfied with the story but loved the OSTs). I believe Cho Seung Woo is a fine actor and A list actor for me from Korea. I loved how everything tied up together at the end and how ChaJung Lee's father in law kind of predicted the killer's death (He always wanted the killer to get cornered and jump to his death-which ChaJung Lee ends up doing). I believe I watched smart writing after a long time-I've seen too much of American tv shows which go on for too long and lose their initial story. I am proud to be a Kdrama follower and hope to see another season of this show and can't wait for Life!

I strongly recommend this show and its OSTs.

The first episode alone is the greatest first episode not only in K-Drama but in television as a whole, after you watch the first episode you are guaranteed to be hooked. Thankfully, the amazing episodes didn't stop there, it continued to be amazing and more amazing.

Biggest plot twist I think I have ever seen, I honestly which English television shows could think of something so great! Acting is phenomenal and each and every character you will gain a strong opinion on. I was familiar with a few actors/actresses before watching Stranger and some I haven't been so familiar on, but they all work so great together I have to admit this is perhaps the greatest cast ensemble too!

I may be living under a rock but I believe the second series has been confirmed? If not then make another season!! I could name so many events that could happen in the next one it legitimately makes me so excited. Stranger is a must watch show!

A so very relevant drama, no matter what country you live in.
Every story can become a 10/10 drama when it's produced, directed and casted right. But not frequently do we stumble upon a 10/10 story. In this drama, all of the above were 10/10.
1. Story. If you're a sucker for police thriller like me, you probably think you have seen it all already. ""If they suspect this person now, he's not the culprit"". ""Clearly the culprit is someone who seems innocent"". I know because this is what I thought while watching it. But I've never been so wrong. The story keeps on surprising while making perfect sense, no plot holes are found, every question is answered. No open ending and no cliche like ""5 years later"". The characters (and us) are never distracted by pointless romantic relationships that tend to ruin every non-romance based series out there.
2. Characters. All characters are fascinating. Shi-mok is an (seemingly) emotionless prosecutor who follows his moral code strictly. He is ready to fight for justice and doesn't care about being liked by other people. He is a badass at court but is cutely awkward when it comes to social interactions. Yeo-jin is an energetic police officer who enjoys her job: chasing (and catching!) bad guys. She's confident and comfortable with the other characters, even the socially awkward Shi-mok. She also has a strong sense of justice but also very high EQ, making her a very lovable character. Dong-jae is another prosecutor and a very complex character. You can never tell what exactly he thinks or feels and are his motives. He keeps on switching sides which makes him seem like an unloyal jerk who only cares about himself, but he also has his own moral code. He's introduced to us as a not very smart person, but actually he's quite wise and skillful. Eun-soo seems at first like the uptight newbie who is nervous and makes mistakes, but actually she's a strong-willed smart prosecutor. She has a goal and she put her life on the line more than once to get what she wants. Lee Chand-joon is the best character in my opinion. You keep on suspecting him while thinking there's no way he'd do it. He's strong, smart, scary, lovable, evil and kind at the same time. He always knows what's the right thing to say or do, so even when it seems like he failed, he probably wanted to fail.
3. Cast. The cast is mind-blowing. The acting was on point for every single character. They portrayed a whole rainbow of emotions in the most convincing way, making me forget I already saw some of them acting in different dramas before. I also liked the fact that Jo Seung-woo, playing Shi-mok, is not your typical k-drama male lead. He is handsome but not in the typical korean standarts. He's even pretty short, would you believe it? Jo Seung-woo is a super talented actor and the fact that he got the main role in this drama despite the fact that he's not as much of an ""eye-candy"" as some people say, makes me love the drama 10 times more.
4. Rewatch value. I put 8 because honestly, when you already know who the culprit is, I'm not sure how amazing it can be. But just for the amazing cast and characters, I would definitely consider coming back.
5. Summary. This is the first review I ever wrote. I felt like I have to write down my feelings about this masterpiece. It's one of the best k-dramas I have ever watched and I did watch a lot. I wish I could give it a 11/10, too bad... Thank you for reading!

This is one of the best if not the best political drama mixed with thriller and criminal investigation.

A definitely must watch series if you like thriller, crime drama and political drama. All of those aspects are perfectly blended in this show. Nothing is cliche and nothing is black and white. A really well made series with wonderful casts.

The story is so well paced that there’s not a time the viewer would feel bored. All the episodes would keep you at the edge of your seat, bitting your nail from the suspense. There are so many twists and turns that is unexpected along the way, it feels like a roller coaster ride. A lot of scheming and back stabbing. It’s so hard to guest what will happen and who are actually the bad guys and who is the good guys.

The cinematography is well done, I like the color palate of the show. There are some scene that annoys me because they seem to use a handheld camera because the whole scene seem to sway a lot that it makes me quite dizzy just by looking at it. I don’t mind if they do it on purpose to show conflicting emotion, or feeling unstable, but some of this scene don’t seem to have any meaning, it’s just them talking. But it’s only a minor flaw compare to all the greatness of this show.

You will be very invested in each character. None of them are perfect, they all have their good side and bad side. Everyone could be the bad guys.

What I like the most is that Hwang Si Mok as the main protagonist is not perfect and know how to play the game. You would not survive in the real world if you just want everything to go your way, there are something that you would need to let go or turn a blind eye on if you want to achieve something bigger.

Han Yeo Jin as the female lead gives a really strong performance as a no nonsense police officer. She does her investigation throughly but without she still care and warm to the victims.

The other prosecutors and police officers are really great and unique character, each with their own story which are developed well through out the show. It keeps you guessing until the last moment on who is the real bad guy behind all of this. Just remember, nobody is perfect.

The music is nothing special, but it matched the show really well. There’s no ost that I remember from this show.

I think this show deserves so rewatch, because I’m sure you would be able to pick up a lot of different things during the rewatching that you may miss the first time around. There are a lot of subtle hints and nuances given through out the show that would probably make you think ‘ah... so that’s what happen’. I’m definitely going to be rewatching this show to see all the things that I may have miss the first time around.

Listen, I really liked this series, but the pacing was WACK. This should not have taken 16 episodes. I think 12 would have been far more efficient, and the pacing is the main reason it does not at the very least reach a 9. Stranger is not bad by any means, but I found myself bored and waiting for the plot to move forward more often than I really should have.

The biggest strength of Stranger is the characters and cast. This is a very talented group of people; they brought so much life to every scene. Jo Seung Woo, Bae Doo Na, and Lee Joon Hyuk were by far my favorites, and I am so glad that they are all returning for a second season of the show. They are the redeeming quality of the show. Without their fabulous performances, I likely would have dropped the series. Props as well to the screenwriter and their excellent use of characterization. The writer allowed the audience to understand these characters in-depth, so when act out of the ordinary (like when Si Mok smiles), it isn't just meaningful to the characters. It's meaningful to the audience, too, since we feel like we KNOW the characters.

The music was alright. Not too impressive, but there were some songs that I liked well enough.

I am not likely to rewatch this series, considering the terrible pacing issues.

Complaints aside, I definitely recommend this series. The characters and their interactions are more than worth it.

m a s t e r p i e c e
Actually there is a short story behind my watching the stranger series. During the summer break, I forced my mother to watch a TV series and she chose the Stranger. I used to only watch romantic and comedy dramas at the time, so I definitely thought I wouldn't like Stranger, but because it was a Korean drama, I decided to watch it with my mom. We watched the first episode together and I just LOVE it. I continued 7-8 episodes with my mother, then I started to continue myself because she had a lot of work. And it became one of my favorite series.

Let me talk about the drama now. First of all I have to congratulate Jo Seungwoo for playing the hwang simok character which seems so difficult. You can see how much effort is put by watching behind the scenes. I also congratulate bae donna because it must be difficult to play with someone who shows no emotion. I really liked the chemistry of the two main leads, it was really good. Also, shin hye sun is another reason I love this drama because I think she is both a beautiful and a very talented actress. Before I forget, the chemistry of all the characters was very good, I can say that they have the best chemistry among the series I have watched. I think I need to talk about the story now, then let me start. The first episodes of Stranger were a bit boring unlike the other series (of course it was very exciting), but the following episodes were excellent. When I watched the connection between the two murders, I was really surprised because I definitely did not expect it. The good behaviour of the police and prosecutors also made me happy. If you are reading this review, you will understand how bad I wrote because I am not very good at telling the story. But I'm still writing my best.

The only thing I didn't like about Stranger is that some of the characters in the main role died, they really added a different atmosphere to the series. All in all, Stranger is really one of the best series, the actors fit, the story is very good. Certainly, I think everyone should watch it, you should not forget such a magnificent series.

Initially when i had seen the overview, i was hesitant as the main lead was an emotionless character.
But man, as i progressed with the first episode, just after a few minutes i was hooked. The background music worked well for me. Jo seung woo did an excellent job portraying the role of a cold prosecutor. Even though he did not have any emotions, he was full of feel. Bae Doona was awesome as the lady detective. All the cast did an excellent job. Hope to see a second season with Bae Doona and Jo seung woo as the leads

Hands down one of my favorite dramas.  Bae Doona first came on my radar  while watching Sense8 (an amazing show, highly, highly recommend). She definitely didn't disappoint in this role either. The cast is amazing, and Cho  Seungwoo and Bae Doona have an amazing chemistry together.  
Multiple  plot twists, most of them completely unexpected. kept me on the edge of  my seat. Probably one of the dramas I've watched quickest, just because  every episode made me want to watch more.  Wasn't my usual cup of tea,  as I'm very much a romantic comedy, happy-go-lucky, cliché drama kinda person. However, wasn't cliché at all, and was very well written, and acted.

I just started rewatching it for the fourth time(rewatch value right there) and noticed I hadn't written a review.
For me Stranger holds special meaning since it's the first ever kdrama for me(not taking movies into account) and it was such a high quality one from every aspect(story, cast, overall production) that immediately set the highest standard for me. After that it was difficult to find equally good productions, though I have found some.

The story has good twists and keeps you guessing and even when it's not, it still has a good execution that it's still as interesting. The cast is amazing. Solid performances from everyone. It starts off a bit slow but after the 6th episode it's addictive. And as far as I remember, there weren't any of the classic mechanics in writing that make it seem contrived. The characters and their actions have consistency.

I really don't want to say more and rather have you watch it. Even if it's not your favorite I think you'll still find it a very good one.

This is my first time writing a review. I am not going to make it long at all, but I felt I needed people to know how well made this drama was. I felt like I was on a roller coaster. Just when you think you have things figured out they throw you a curve ball. There were so many twists and turns I got dizzy. This is a MUST SEE. The acting was top notch. By the end of the drama everything connected. Well written and executed. PLEASE SEE!!!

Its showing in England. To say I have been obsessed is putting it mildly. I very much like the Scandinavian noir crime dramas and(totally different) having watched Okja thought I would try Stranger. Its very very good totally gripping. I also very much liked the food scenes and how people live and relate with each other. Corruption, intrigue and the fight for human survival, integrity and respect. I hope there's another series. It was excellent!

Corruption, Mystery, Intrigue...""Stranger"" Has it All!
There is nothing so beautiful as an intricate plot so deftly woven that it is literally a work of art. And there is nothing that compliments a masterful plot like deep and intelligent characters.

""Stranger"" is one of the best series I've ever seen. And I've been watching shows for over 45 years. When I began Season 1, I was instantly hooked, and I found myself binge-watching the series.

The story has so many plot twists and turns that I doubt that even the most savy viewer will be able to figure it all out. It centers around what seems to be, a fairly standard murder. Hwang Shi Mok is, what would be our equivalent of an assistand district attorney, knows the victim, and takes it upon himself to investigate.

Shi Mok is like watching a master detective at work. He's like a Korean Sherlock Holmes. He is not only able to piece together events, but he does so in a way that makes you think of a master jigsaw puzzler who is able to put the 3000 pieces together within a short span of time. Shi Mok is smart, intelligent, and also calm and cool under fire. Why? Because he has a unique characteristic: he lacks empathy. Due to violent outbursts as a child, he had a surgical procedure done that literally prevents him from having such outbursts anymore. Therefore, to most of his colleagues and even strangers, he appears cold and aloof.

Shi Mok's sole partner in his investigation is Lieutenant Han Yeo Jin (Bae Doona). Bae Doona quickly became one of my favorite Korean actresses. She also successfully brings us a very intelligent and driven detective who is as determined to get to the truth as Shi Mok is. Of course, she has trouble figuring out why Shi Mok comes across as such a quirky fellow, but she soon develops tremendous respect for him and his ability to speak his mind (which he always does!).

It isn't often that I bring up the theme music for a show, but this one reminds me of Hans Zimmer's Batman score a bit! It's catchy, and it seems to sum up all of the excitement and intrigue that this series provides!

The plot is expertly crafted and multi-layered. Much like an onion, once one layer is exposed, there is another. This forces Shi mok and Yeo Jin to wonder just how far and how deep the conspiracy goes.

The British series ""Line of Duty"" is a show about police corruption. This show not only takes it much farther, but this story is far more taut and exciting! I cannot emphasize enough just how much credit the writers should be given. It's not easy to put something like this together. ""Stranger"" is nothing short of a being an absolute masterpiece! Master mystery writers like Agatha Christie would be proud! Literally from start to finish, ""Stranger"" keeps up the intrigue and never pauses even for a moment!

**I was so excited when Season 2 came out, and even more excited to find out that there is a Season 3 on its way!**

I live for suspense/thriller/mystery/crime/law dramas. I felt like the writers brought something new to the table with regards to the lead character and his motivations. Honestly, I liked that there wasn't a lot of romance in this and it helped the show keep its focus. I liked that this wasn't a predictable show and that most of the actors/actresses I hadn't seen in previous dramas, so it kept me glued to the screen. The only disadvantage is that after watching the ending of a mystery, it tends to stick with you, so if you go and rewatch it, it doesn't feel as fresh or novel as it was when you see it the first time. I think the emotions portrayed by the characters has kept me coming back, to the point where I'll be sweating because of the suspense, that's how immersed I get.

After many romantic kdrama, i finally decided to watch this crimeshow. I really don't know why i hestitated so long to begin with this one!!
If you are looking just for a romantic cliche show, this is NOT your show. But are you looking for a good story, with great plottwists and fenomenal actors. BAM...than this is it!
I was completely hooked on the tvscreen for days. The writers were throwing plottwists after plottwists and it was never boring.
I'm looking forward to season 2, not many korean shows get more seasons, but this one deserves it!!

a bit slow but okay
before watching this, i guess i had higher expectations from this drama since a lot of people love it. it was good, the case is interesting but its just its very slow sometimes. but i was still curious to know what happen, so that’s okay. the case was rather simple actually, but its not too bad. there were still a few twists here and there but a lot of predictable scenes too. but all in all, it was okay and i liked it. i’m gonna watch the second one after this and hoping it would be better than this one!

Review of ""Stranger 1st season""
- First of all, can I just point out how fucking unique the plot line is!!!!! Honestly I was interested on how the director would play out the whole ""no emotions"" thing because while it was an intriguing idea it could have been a home run or a hit or miss and honestly I personally think they hit a home run with it!! They managed to create a character who was able to be apatheic in certain situations which was good because he was able to rationalize and reasons in ways that you can't when your being overwhelmed by emotion, but you could also tell he cared.
- While his face barley ever changed (props to the actor btw) he body language told us all we need to know. From the way he stand to even how he placed his hands, I think they did a great job portraying this type of character.
- Now what I was impressed with was the most was the OST. Both the intro and the outro had me bopping, so much so that i would watch the credits just to hear the music. It also was very impactful with the storyline too.
- Now I'm just saying this to let you know, but this series contains but the smallest bit of romance. its not a big part of the story and it can't even really be called small either because while it does further the relationship between the characters it doesn't turn into anything big.
- Overall , this series is a must watch if your into crime/mystery with politics, corruption, and betrayal thrown into the mix. This show is definitely binge-worthy!!!

Stranger
My first review on this site was about my best friend who had passed last year from a drug overdose. How 'Hi Bye, Mama!' explored the permanent effects of a sudden loved one's death had on them, and how unfair life is that you can never give them a proper send-off, was something that resonated deeply with me - especially having watched it so soon after my friend's passing.

A year has gone by, and I came across Stranger one day and finally got around to watching it amidst a lacklustre summer of productivity (or lack thereof). While it was genuinely a solid drama backed by an intriguing plot and excellent acting (as expected when you have Bae Doo-na in the line-up), there was a scene in particular that brought back the same sorrow I experienced while watching HBM.

It was revealed that Yoon had murdered Park due to his involvement in a traffic accident that led to the death of Yoon's 6-year-old son, along with thirteen (fourteen?) other kindergarten kids, through a web of corruption and cover-ups. He had murdered Park as he lost all belief in the justice system, and how the people responsible for such an atrocity were walking around as free men and growing more and more powerful every passing second - while he had to deal with the pain of suddenly losing his son as a result of the people he worked under.

I was confused as to whether or not I should despise Yoon.

He mentioned that he had a wish. Before the coach carrying the children exploded into flames, it had flipped over. Yoon's wish was that he hoped his son died on the impact of the crash - rather than the slow painful sensation of burning to death, one rarely fit for anyone let alone a child. He refused to participate in his son's autopsy, as he didn't want to risk knowing that his child died from inhaling the flames that would soon turn his lifeless body into nothing but a slab of charcoal.

It dawned on me that I had expressed similar hope for my best friend when I heard about his death. While dying from a drug overdose is considerably different from dying through impact or fire, I had wished that, for someone who suffered through such a troubled upbringing, yet was so unimaginably filled with love, his final moments were that of such utter bliss that he had simply forgotten to breathe to the point that he peacefully left... rather than have the thoughts that had torn his life apart up to that point ultimately overtake him.

The idea that my best friend died in a state of nirvana was the only thing that kept me going at the time. And in a way, I empathised with Yoon with what he had done; not because I agreed with his self-righteous action of killing another human being, but because I could understand his pain of losing a loved one -- and the self-inflicted compromises that naturally come with the cycle of grief.

If my best friend did die in a euphoric state, I hope that stayed with him on his journey to Paradise.

a MASTERPIECE. enough said.
I’ve watched several titles of prosecutors, police officers, lawyers, but this drama, would be the most memorable for me. The male lead, who was the prosecutor, wasn’t “perfect” like what several other dramas often characterized. He had a super painful past, and he’s not always correct in every of his predictions. He failed several times, but got back up again and finally succeeded.

Although we didn’t see much of Hwang Si-Mok celebrating his success with the team, I’m super duper satisfied just seeing him smile at Han Yeo-Jin, it totally warms my heart. I hope, on the S2, we can see more of Hwang Si-Mok and Han Yeo-Jin scenes together! Great drama, super great storyline (although it’s somehow complicated with so much character names), excellent casts, and lastly, an OST that really matched.

Totally recommended, a 10/10 ⭐️ Can’t wait for the 5th season, Si-Mok-ah! See you there! ;)

Guessing till the End
Overall

This show is one of the few mystery shows that managed to take me by surprise with the culprit and made it believable still. I continually guessed at it throughout the show, but in the mass of morally gray characters, it was difficult to know who was the true and ultimate evil at the end. I loved that. The characters didn't have unique ideas to them, but the actors played them with such personality that they really seemed unique and each developed in their own way. The Plot was born out of the characters actions, so that I never knew where it was going to go next, or who was going to be evil or get exposed or get arrested. This is really everything a mystery should be: I never knew, until they revealed it, who was guilty and who was good.



Spoilers below in the rest of my review!! (BIG spoilers in the characters.)




Characters



A strength of this show is that it had so many characters (which allowed us to be surprised by the mystery and the culprit) but it introduced them in a steady way that wasn't confusing.

I loved that I could never tell who was really evil, just a bit morally gray, and who would betray who. This show kept me on my toes guessing at all the characters, which might have been a problem if we didn't have Si Mok as our center of moral gravity. It was just so well written and acted.

Hwang Si Mok: I really liked him. I liked the slow development of his emotions and how his ""sad past"" of his surgery wasn't made a big deal of, and wasn't even really exposed until the later half of the series. It was refreshing from other Kdramas.

Lieutenant Han: I loved her. She was so believable, and her struggle with morality in her own team and work place was so well done.

Yoo Eun Soo: I miss her. The beginning had me doubting her and I really liked how her truth was simpler than what Si Mok and the audience was expecting.

Seo Dong Jae: Same as with a lot of the other in between characters, to me he was realistic in that he never committed to one side. He wanted survival, and to get that, he backstabbed whoever he needed to in order to stay on top;. I hated him in the beginning, and by the end if I didn't like him I at least understood him.

Lee Chang Jun: Evil. Eviiil. Even though he did something right in the end by working to expose the corruption, he still participated in it, orchestrated murders, and was overall really, really terrible. What a good villain though. I doubted that he was the ultimate bad guy sometimes; sometimes I thought he might really be good, and other times I was convinced he was satan. His story was so well done (I know I'm repeating it, but I'm really in awe of this show).



Plot


The plot was created by the characters, which is a basic element of storytelling that is so often ignored by TV shows in general. It was so well crafted in Stranger: the plot revolved around the audience being kept guessing at who is behind everything, who is going to backstab who else, who is going to die. At no point did I feel like it slowed down, or got boring, and unlike a lot of other Kdramas, I really liked the pacing towards the end.

My one problem with this show might be that there were too many flashbacks. Kdramas love to show flashbacks, and sometimes it is helpful, but mostly it just takes away trust that the audience will connect the dots themselves, and drags dramatic moments out.


Soundtrack was amazing. This is the first time I've had an instrumental stuck in my head and I didn't mind at all. I want to watch season 2, but I'm also scared that it won't hold up to season 1.

Stranger is one of the best mystery drama of Korean, American, Japanese, or Chinese origin. Admittedly, I am only on Episode 9. The twists are of many varieties, subtle, obvious, significant, and incremental. Ok, I'm slow in catching on, but at the end of Episode 8, I realized that I need to re-watch Episode 1 et al. Why? because there are no gratuitous scenes, wasted monologue, or fluff. Some things, all things, most things, are clues or clues leading to clues. I literally get tired watching because the required focus is draining. LOL.

I do NOT want to skip to the end. The journey is clearly entertaining, and each twist is an ending in and of itself.

I stopped guessing. The clues will take me to where I should be headed. It is a wonder filled path. Enjoy.

Amazing acting! Amazing Story!
Should you? Would you? Could you?

You should watch this one (YES! )
You would recommend this to others. (YES!)
You could watch this again. (NOT REALLY)

Ending: Justice served for the moment

I must commend the writers of this show. They have taken the story to another level with their in-depth analysis of politics within the judicial framework.
While the cast is simply brilliant, it’s the story with its twists and turns that keeps you on your toes.
The start is slow and then it gradually climbs to a height that seems unattainable.
The cast is excellent each in their respective roles. I can’t think of anyone who hasn’t done a great job. So so impressive. What I also liked are the subtle undercurrents of a possible romance that keep you hooked in anticipation of one and yet doesn’t take us away from the severity of the main plot. And yes l loved the background score. In a drama that is steeped in mystery, the background score adds a lot to the entire effect. The perfect beat, a good rhythm & haunting tunes are needed which is in sync in this drama.
Watch it with patience ( because there will be times that you will be tempted to fast forward just to know who the mastermind is behind all the mystery.... I know I was tempted....but just don’t succumb to it)

Enjoy it. About to start season 2 and hoping it will be equally good ( I think it will).

Found this drama on Netflix and was intrigued by the cast and having seen the poster on here a few times when I was searching for a drama to watch. So glad I took my time in watching this drama and really soaking in the pure genius craft of it. What is a beautifully constructed drama, many might miss because it is not of the romantic genre, however, those who are willing to give law and crime dramas a chance, this, THIS is the one to begin with. I read one of the reviews and was shocked to learn that this was the writer's first drama?! Having watched more than 40 dramas in the past 3 years, this drama has nailed on the head of what is a perfectly written and fast pacing drama. It is hardly ever stagnant and the complex nature of the dialogue and script is what kept me, as the audience, attentive and hanging onto every word. Because if you missed a line, you probably missed an important line that would lead you to the next conclusion. What is so amazing about this drama is that it initiates you to think and draw conclusions on your own while providing their own. However, even when you think you've gotten it right, the writer manages to evade this and completely twist the story in a remarkable way. The cast themselves have outdone themselves; the portrayal of good and evil sometimes were blurred and led me to contemplate on what is truly good and evil in this world. This has gotten rather long, but I hope those who are contemplating on watching this drama, don't. Just watch it and immerse yourself into the world of corruption but also hopeful justice.

I was about to drop Korean shows, this pulled me back.
A little note beforehand: This show is perfect if you've never seen a Korean show before and aren't accustomed to their cinematography! It's very accessible.

I study Korean, I'd honestly say I'm quite bad at it so for the past two years I've been manically watching Korean shows and films in order to keep my skill up to date and to get drawn to the language and culture.
There's an abundance of poor, rushed and just plain terrible Korean shows out there, this is definitely not one of them.

I won't make this review too lengthy but I liked almost every minute of the two seasons. The long political-talk scenes were perfect for grabbing some snacks, the action scenes truly thrilling.

This show has your typical 'hurt main character', done RIGHT!

Lastly: can I marry Bae Doona?

Best Crime/Political Thriller Drama!
Nail-biting. Captivating. Mesmerizing. Words can't begin to describe how much I enjoyed this drama. Plot that was woven like silk, creating a world full of characters with strong but relevant personalities, endless cliffhangers and unexpected twists that left most of us on the edge of our seats through the 16 episodes. The drama started strongly, diving head-on into a suspected murder case in episode 1. The insane pace was kept throughout the drama, with the writer tossing our bits and pieces of clues, each more alarming then the next, leading us to our 'suspect'. But wait, there's more! Absolutely loved how the hints were so balanced, never allowing us to pinpoint which was the real culprit till the finale.

In terms of the cast, most would have had their focus on HSM or HSJ, but for me, the winner has to be LCJ. God, seldom do you see a protagonist so charismatic, so smart, with ideals that you could understand. Yoo Jae Myung really hit the ball out of the park with his performance of the character here. Especially with his accent and speech mannerism. Of course Bae Doona and Cho Seung Woo had stellar performances as well. I also loved how each and every side character was developed and was part of the story as well.

Music was stellar as well, capturing and adding on to the mood of every hair raising scene.

Overall, I absolutely adored this drama, almost couldn't bear to finish it as I raced through the first 15 episodes in a flash. I highly recommend this to whoever enjoys crime drama with some sherlock-esque analysis and brainwork.

Well worth watching! Actors giving it their all!
Wanting to see more mature actors in the limelight? This baby has it all! The first episode eases you into things by partially explaining the main character's, Hwang Shi/Si-mok's (Jo Seung Woo), condition and then the we meet a man framed and his acting is so convincing, that if I was there & it were real, I'd immediately say he's not the killer - a semi-reformed thief who made the wrong choice, but not the killer. I was moved to tears by his performance and the victim's mother too. Compelling and worth watching. I love how strong, grounded & caring Bae Doo Na's character Han Yeo Jin. She's the perfect compliment to Hwang, especially the easy & beautiful smiles she draws out of him. I appreciate how Seo Dong Won's character Kim Jeong Bon was honest enough about his feelings to share his concern & how he still cared about Yoon Se Won (played by Lee Kyu Hyung). The moment voiced this near the end of the first season, it matched my own thoughts. Yoon was easily lovable, and I feel he could've not ended up like that if someone didn't use him. I just wish he got to keep his glasses... he look really hot in them <3

I also sort of expected more painful headaches because of the level of emotional turmoil around Si-Mok as well as what he directly experienced. But he's very strong, seeing him get emotional just stops everything around him, it's just that compelling. He's very human & tangible, really really love this character <3

This 1st season ended well. So well that if there wasn't a season 2, I'd be okay with it. Again well worth the watch <3

Amazing performance by lead actor!
This k-drama has a non-typical lead actor. He's not unrealistically attractive, he's sort of short, and he's awfully understated in his movements/speech. I absolutely fell in love with the weird little dude after watching this drama. There's a presence and force that he has when acting that is really fascinating to watch and this character really played to those strengths. His character in this drama is almost mousey; he's shy, reserved, bowing, almost like background noise. But hiding behind his unassuming presence is a masterful powerhouse of skilled orchestration. It was utterly compelling to watch this character navigate the events and complications throughout this drama.

The female lead is similar, she's not your typical k-drama female lead; she doesn't look like a fashion doll came to life to spit lines out on the screen. She is perfectly paired with the male lead, they have such an understated but powerful chemistry together. Her impetuous forcefulness plays so well against his composed reservation. Her character's idiosyncrasies and lone wolf tendencies really fit well with the male character's personality, they feel like they are different representations of the same person, like they just GET each other, like soul mates. Whoever cast this show is a genius.

Apart from the characters/acting, this show actually did a really great job intertwining the various mysteries, bleeding discoveries out slowly and tying everything together at the end in a way that made every single part of the story suddenly even more relevant than you'd previously realized. It was all super masterfully done.

I'd for sure watch this show again because I feel like in all of the various plot threads there were probably little things here and there that I missed or that would play out differently if I watched them with knowledge of the ending in mind.

First off, I do find this drama a bit overhyped. The first two episodes were good hook when Hwang Shi Mok stumbled across a dead body in the house, and he went on to investigate that murder case. But I found the sequential episodes that follow from episode 2 a bit flat and boring, and the show only started to pick up its pace again at the end of episode 7 upwards. The show was written cleverly in a way that makes literally everyone around Hwang Shi Mok suspectable, and that's admirably its biggest strength. However, I would argue that despite the writer's best efforts to mask the identity of the real mastermind of the murder, from the start it was quite obvious who seemed to have been the most corrupted among them all, so I do find the conclusion of the story wasn't that thrilling and suspenseful. The anti-climax, however, is the mastermind's motive at the end explained in full which was a great twist. Therefore my favourable rating for its story is more of an appreciation for its complexity, rather than a lasting impression it could have left me.

There are two main characters listed on the show, but I do find that only Hwang Shi Mok has enough enigma to keep me genuinely invested in the show. Even when I say so, I do find that the main lead very capable, but not charismatic enough. Psychologically speaking, charisma is perhaps a trait that is a privilege for people who are able to masterfully control their emotion, and Hwang Shi Mok is hardly a person able to exercise that. Thus, as much as he is a very rational character who only thinks logically and pursues justice objectively and therefore would come across charming to other people, it becomes the very reason I find it difficult to connect to his character. There's a comparable emotionally muted character in kdramaland portrayed by Jang Hyuk in A Beautiful Mind, which was given enough emotional background and development for viewers to sympathize with him (even though the show was cut short by two episodes due to fierce rating competition during airing time). In that sense, I do respect whenever a writer decided to create a male lead character that has a medical condition of suppressed emotions. However, there should also be enough background materials to properly explain the male lead's behaviour and motives from past to present, which I found this drama has not done very successfully.

Han Yeo Jin as the female cop was quite uninteresting to me. Yes, she's a competent police officer who pursues justice relentlessly and there's a powerful scene where she confronted Hwang Shi Mok about corruption in the police force, but just like Hwang Shi Mok, she wasn't given enough depth beyond her role as a police officer (in fact, hardly any if at all). Young Eun Soo was definitely the most irritable character in the drama to me. Although I admit she comes across very tenacious about her mission, oftentimes she was so reckless and single-minded that it was unbearably difficult for me to like or understand her. I really wished her character to be a lot more sophisticated and cunning, but graceful. Seo Dong Jae is the character whom you literally want to punch on the face because he's so good at being shady/bad, which adds the interesting colours that the show is lacking from its main leads. The only character that was given the most depth and inner motive in this drama is definitely Lee Chang Joon, and the actor delivered it flawlessly.

There's not really a memorable BGM anywhere and I also find this drama not very re-watchable.

If you are looking for really clever screenwriting that tops this, I'd recommend Hello Monster, WATCHER, Confession (2019) and The Crowned Clown instead.

I know that everyone says ""best tv series ever"" on almost every Korean show review, so here's what I'll say, because most KOREAN series are too freaking awesome and exceptionally executed, I'll say this is the best political psychological thriller I've seen thus far.

All the actors are great. No wasted meaningless scenes. The main character is quite intriguing. Cho Seung-Wood does a fine job at portraying prosecutor Hwang Shi-Mok.

The way Lee Joon-Hyuk plays Seo Dong Jae makes him my top two fav characters, right next to the protagonist. Didn't know he was so good. I had only seen him in ""Are You Human"".

This show is so unpredictable. Many scenarios throws you off when new speculations, questions and events are raised.

I especially love how the story depicts Hwang. He is unable to feel emotion, because of this, he is able to carry out his investigations without any bias which makes him a fair prosecutor, but we also get to see the flaws of his condition as the story progresses.

Many of these characters are multi-dimensional, and we don't really know everyone's true intentions, which keeps you on the edge of your seat every step of the way.

Screenwriter Lee Soo Yeon deserves props for this. The writing of Korean tv-series is remarkable.

one of the best prosecution based dramas i've ever watched! so maturely and interestingly handled, the script writers did an amazing job!!! the plot is definitely the best part of it, but the actors deserve an enormous amount of credits, they carried such an intense plot without faltering a bit. the actor playing hwang shi mok was TOOOOO good, and bae doona is a legit CRUSH right now! i was also in love with the way eun soo's character was portrayed, she was shown as fragile and emotional but also extremely impulsive and courageous, i absolutely LOVED HER!
to the antagonists, y'all were too good! especially dong jae, absolute favourite lmfao.

i can see that there is going to be a season 2 as well, truly hope it happens soon, as i can't wait to watch what happens next! anyways, this was one the best dramas i've ever watched, you should definitely give it a try if you are a thriller / suspense / political drama's fan like me <3

This review may contain spoilers
WOW, This drama is one of the best drama I've ever watched. I want to give an applause to the writer of this drama because well usually it'll be boring if the there's only one case to solve but this one is not boring at all.
Let's say it is a well developed story because the key point of this story is one case, everything was started from the park-moo sung dead, and then things getting more intense and interesting, the plot twist is here and there. I was also intrigued by how the actors/actresses portraying their each character, especially the main characters.
The actor that played prosecutor hwang is seriously good on portraying his emotionless character, there was one time, i mean the first time he smile to the Ms. Police and omg i'm falling for him. how he handle situations where it require him to show what he feels about something when he's character is emotionless is daebak. He delivered his emotions through his eyes and how he developed his character is excellent.
The main actress which it's Bae Doo Na, she's nailed it too. Her character is not like any main female characters in any kdrama, She looks like a real person who went through some things that makes her become strong yet not forgettable.
The plot-twist was shocking because i thought the villain is the lawyer but it turns out it's not him.
I'd like to write some more but it's gonna be too many spoiler lol, but seriously this a highly recommended drama.
I heard that they're gonna make it to season 2, can't wait for it!!

I need season 2
I loved this drama so so so much! Like
this one got the place in my
favourites from episode 1! From the
beginning till the end the drama
doesn’t disappoint a little. It is so
intruiging and intresting. The one
thing I liked most about the drama is
how it unfolded every element and
character of the story little by little.

Like the pace of the drama was so
perfect! Another thing is that they made
me suspiocious of every little
character! Like literally any character
can be the killer! Everyone has a
motive and the power to kill our victim
and that factor played with my mind so
much. Like first a character is
introduced to us and then after 20 or

30 minutes it is told to us that ""oh
he/she can be the killer!"" But then
after a while “ no maybe not” is told to
us but then again they become the
suspect like god after watching this
drama I surely got some trust issues
lol. Every new episode changes the
possible suspect lol. Another thing I
liked about this drama is its characters.

Normally dramas are either plot-driven
or character driven, this one was both.
Maybe plot-driven more but the way
they showed every character’s flaws
and problems is something I really
liked. No character was innocent and I
love things like that hihi. I know I’m
weird but whatever.

The acting is again so so good. I
literally felt that all the characters
existed in real life like it was so real. I
have to applaud for all the cast.
Especially the actor who played hwang
shi mok cuz its not at all easy to play
a character who is emotionless and
yet show his emotions in way that the

audience knows what he is feeling but
without spoiling the fact that he is
emotionless and the way he did it was
incredibly good. Other actors were of
course amazing but I have to give him
a special mention cuz god I think he
deserves award for his acting.

The drama is not at all for the people
who like light dramas cuz I don’t think
there is anything light about this
drama. There 0.01% romance in it lol.
But if you are looking for a mystery/
thriller drama that plays with your
mind and makes it nearly impossible

to guess who is the killer then this
one is surely for you. Now let me tell
you a fun fact that made my respect
for this drama even bigger- me, a
person who MOSTLY guesses the
killer before perfectly right, failed to
guess him/her in this one.

Honestly till the end, my guess was
that “ anyone can be the killer” lol like
god it was hard to even fix on
someone and say “ yes he/she is a
killer!” that drama tricked ME! That
insanely good it is! Lol I am really sad
and fascinated by the fact that I
couldn’t guess lol.

Also even though the drama is a
mystery I loved the way they showed
us about korea’s corruption. The
message of the drama was to literally
inform and tell the people to stop
doing this even though we know no
one’s gonna stop but like its not gonna
hurt to try, right? I love dramas that
give a kind of social message.

Even though the drama is a mystery
and a very brilliantly done one it made
ME cry two times! And honestly that’s
a lot for me! Korean dramas often fail
to make me cry but this was an
exception. Overall this drama is one of
the best. If you like mystery/thrillers
then please do watch this one!

It is insanely good! Every episode and
every second is important like
honestly I didn’t even blink for a
second cuz I was afraid that would
miss something haha. Everything
from was perfect. The story was
brilliantly written and done/shown by
the director and the actors. I love this
drama so much!

This was a very well written series with an amazing cast.
The story went how I predicted with the exception of one surprise. Stranger doesn't have a bunch of twists and turns but that doesn't stop it from being thrilling to watch.
The creators did such a good job at making it so every episode was interesting. I never lost interest while watching even though I had an idea of what would happen. There is also some awesome character development and you really get to see it in the last episode.
The last episode was definitely my favorite and made me excited for Stranger 2. The ending was so well done! They made it so you can decide if you want to watch the second season or not. There is enough closure if you decide not to watch Stranger 2. I'll definitely be watching the second season though!
Also, poor Si Mok never gets to eat. Something always happens as he's about to eat in the cafeteria.

Set my standards very high for future dramas
I stumbled onto this show by accident and didn't expect much, being my second k-drama. I binge this through 3 days of constant watching and came out of this having super high standards for any future shows I watch :)) I hear s2 is airing right now. I guess I'm lucky!

Story 10/10
I liked the synopsis, and the idea of an emotionless main character (mostly bc there wouldn't be a romance subplot lol), and the story turned out perfectly! The episodes were the perfect length and were very gripping. Everything was very cleverly planned out, and there was a lot of foreshadowing. However, it was easy to miss some details, so if you're not a native English speaker, you might have difficulties with keeping up. The characters were also fantastic and had development throughout the plot. They all had flaws and strengths, and none of them were two dimensional at all.

Acting/Cast 10/10
I loved the casting for this so much!! Each character's actor suited them perfectly. Cho Seung Woo (?) is such a good fit for Hwang Shi Mok and portrayed him wonderfully. The acting was so good, and I felt that the actors immersed themselves in the characters. Idk what else to say here lol

Music 10/10
After episode 2, I HAD to download the soundtrack because I loved it so much. It kicked in at the right times and fit every scene well.

Rewatch Value 10/10
I haven't rewatched yet (I just finished like 3 hours ago), but I would rewatch this because of the foreshadowing. I think I'd rewatch this with some friends as it'd be fun to see who they suspect and what their thoughts are.

I loved this show and I appreciated that there was ZERO romance in it. That was very refreshing. I love Prosecutor Hwang and Seo, they're super complex characters :)) I'm excited to watch season 2!

Never know what's coming, so thrilling!
This drama has one of the most interesting stories I have ever seen, while watching there wasn't one second where I forgot about it or got bored. It kept me interested all the time! I kept thinking and making theories about it, I had so much fun watching this drama.
The unexpected twists and turns that this drama has are so enjoyable to watch. There have been times where I have paused just to process what I just witnessed! It made me speechless.
The characters are so well written! Every character has depth and are properly depicted. Not one dull character! Loved the whole cast! Especially character development of the main lead.
The message given through the story was so well thought out and somehow gave me hope for the society. I guess that was the goal and they executed it so well.
The acting was also top notch! Literally no complaints. I became a fan of everyone on the cast! Especially lee kyu hyung who I already loved and appreciated in prison playbook and doctor John such an incredible actor :)
I literally cant wait for the second season (I heard there is one coming)! I urge everyone to watch this as it is a hidden gem, SO GOOD.

Cho Seung Woo especially is amazing. His acting was so good and Bae Doona did a wonderful job too. I am so glad the ratings for this drama are so high because they deserve it.

Riveting is the word for this drama. You get a satisfactory game of cat and mouse or equivalent thereof amongst multiple characters..... Satisfying to watch this game of chess played out in a investigation/ cop/ prosecutors kdrama world and rightfully named forest of secrets.

Great acting for both main leads and other characters. A great deal is conveyed just by the characters faces and eyes (accompanied by the right amount of talking by characters) which is a reflection of the actors astounding abilities. The plot is not dumbed down and the the way the plot is weaved into action is perfect.

It's the first K-Drama I finished and I'm not disappointed.While the plot may not be new the cast did a great job with the acting so it did not get boring. And even though it is quite a common plot you could not predict how it will end up so if that is something that is putting you off, give this one a chance.It did get a bit dragging at some point but that is not the shows fault in itself, but rather something that I have found that many, if not all K-Drama have a problem with. I personally think that K-Dramas are a bit to long, both in episode count and in episode length. American shows can have long running seasons because the way they are built, but for K-Drama, and J-Drama that has a lot of information in its episodes, seasons with more than 12 episodes tends to get a bit dragging. Same with the length of the episode which in my opinion should not be over 45-50 minutes unless it's a special episode or something similar. And even though I felt it in this drama I still managed to finish it without problems, so good job for that.The music is great, some soundtracks have but stuck in my head for days and that should say something.As for rewatch value it does go down quite a bit because this is a show that thrives with that you don't know who did what and what is going to happen.I would still recommend this one with all of my heart because this a really good show and I would definitely watch a second season if it would happen.

Fundamentally a legal thriller driven by deductive reasoning style of investigation and well placed surprising plot twists with sporadic emotions.


The show starts off in a little convoluted manner where you find it difficult to establish the relationships between characters and their motives. But as it progresses the thrill of investigation keeps the viewer hooked in and demands your attention to decipher the aforementioned problem.

It deals with backstabs and betrayals throughout the first half of the show so that you are unable to trust most of the characters. Then it settles down and moves towards revealing all the mysteries.

Even though it has a social message in the end, it doesnt preach you but rather warns (this is especially relevant for the local South Korean audience) about the danger.

The acting of the whole cast is top notch. It actually elevates the writing.
Music does its job creating the environment for a thriller.

The drawback is that it remains subtle in its revelation of twists and answers to some questions throughout the show which may warrant a second time viewing and it probably will irk some of the viewers.
It does pursue a line story among many which felt unnecessary in retrospection at the end.


It keeps you hooked in primarily due to the pacy writing and complex plot. If you are one for simple dramas, this is not your cup of tea. Otherwise, this is a must watch.

Friendly neighbour
This is a K-drama done right, at his best.
Everything, from the script, the cast, and the way the show was directed was bordeline perfect. I can't say this show will please everyone - well it probably won't since it's mostly a suspense/detective investigation of sort - but as for what the show was aiming for, this drama close the deal and provides the viewers with a brillant, modern filming and scenario, (mostly) avoiding the useless and the usual fancy stuff. Which is already brillant in its own way (and I don't care if I'm repeating myself).
Well, here you have it : I'm not going to explain myself why this is a very good drama, since I'm quite confident that watching it will give you a lot to think about it, and besides, people here with a much better prose than your servitor have already work to give you enough reasons to jump on the show and appreciate it with your own open mind, so you can stop reading this review now, and enjoy watching ""Stranger"" right now.
ASAP. Lucky you.

Solid all the way.

After hitting a ratings slump post Goblin, tvN put all their eggs in the basket for Secret Forest. It's a well-planned drama from start to finish and executed to near perfection. The episodes never got boring despite it focusing almost solely on its special investigation. The highlight is definitely the acting. Secret Forest put together heavyweight players Bae Doona and Jo Seung-woo as headliners and a breathtaking performance by Yoo Jae-myung, with the rest of the supporting cast keeping up to pace. The use of interesting composition, efficient editing, and instrumental heavy soundtrack gave the drama a cinematic feel. The ending was tight, though a bit too perfect for all the trouble the team got themselves into throughout the drama. Nonetheless, it was satisfying and retained a grayness that the drama kept during its course.

For sure not everyone's cup of tea.
This is one of those shows that you would find tons of conversation scene. Lots of talking but intensely fun. I believe not all people can savour a crime show without many actions.
Few things that i think can be improved.
1. I believe they can tell more about hwang si mok surgery. The backstory behind this fact is too shallow i think. Not enough information.
2. Kinda dragging a lot for a case to be solved. Sometimes too much airtime taken to debunked a mystery. But somehow this show manage to pull it through without me having to drop it off.
Few things that i really really liked.
1. The acting is superb. We have bae doona who is my fave. The main protagonist also carried it out really well. And also the villains really getting me on my nerves.
2. Not too much romantic scenes. Ive been longing to watch a kdrama without those romantic scenes as i prefer it that way and this show legit one of it. Subtle love scene makes this show feels tight and compact.

Conclusion: As i have stated, this show may not be everyone favourite. And i can see why. Lack action, lack romance you name it. But to me this show is awesome.

First off, let me admit that I struggled with this show. Not because it wasn't good or anything, but because it's rather slow at times and it's VERY tense. It took me probably at least 3 months to finish it. I'd watch a bit, and then need to set it down for a while and come back later. That being said, the acting is great and the story is interesting. There are lots of plot twists and things to keep you guessing.

I'm glad I watched it and I really enjoyed some of the characters. I did miss the romance aspect that you often find in dramas. This literally didn't have one and that was unfortunate because there was the slight possibility of one that I really wanted to see happen. Maybe in season 2?

Overall though, a solid drama and if your thing is mysteries...this is absolutely for you!

Best Whodunit Crime Drama Ever!
Best acting! The subtlety of romance is just so good that it got us hooked although it didn't deter us from the stellar storytelling and tight dialogue among the actors. Definitely worth a watch for those who like whodunit shows and those who like to think! Love the twist!

The show that got me to respect Korean dramas because of how it respects even the bad guys and that bad guys too have their story to tell. It's up to you to give your heart to it or not.

The attention to detail at every corner of the show and how while it seems disparate was linked beautifully and in the end you realised why things happen the way it did.

Justice for Corruption
STRANGER. (Forest of Secrets/Secret Forest/Bimileui Sup) This k-drama is definitely one of the best crime shows I've watched. It seamlessly blends the genres of Procedural Crime, Mystery, Thriller, and Drama perfectly. It was a highly addictive watch, an unforgettable experience.

Let me first start by saying, the cast is simply fantastic, especially our two main leads, the apathetic and stoic Prosecutor, Hwang Si-mok (played by Cho Seung-woo) and the feisty, quirky Lieutenant Han Yeo-Jin (played by Bae Doona)-who both have one thing is common-the desire for justice and to purge their departments of corruption, no matter the cost. Since there begins to look like there is corruption everywhere, the two end up forming an unspoken alliance. Their on-screen chemistry is undeniable and interesting.

While the entire cast and characters are great, even side characters and antagonists are interesting and relatable. My only complaint, and it is a pretty minor one, is that I often wished for more character backstory and depth, especially in side characters. However, I grew to love and care for many of the characters regardless, even without extensive character details and history. Not many series are able to pull that off.

Cho Seung-woo (Prosecutor, Hwang Si-mok) brilliantly plays an apathetic character type, and somehow manages to give him so much depth, heart and expression, again almost all in subtext and subtlety. He really stands out among all the ""cold genius"" archetypes and by Season 2, has become one of my all time favorites. He is such an odd mixture of apathy, cunning, and bluntness all the while being polite, passive and quiet. While he is certainly brilliant it never seems that his work is ever easy for him. It is always difficult and challenging-he is just stubborn and driven enough to find the truth and seek justice.

On the other hand, actress Bae Doona (Lieutenant Han Yeo-Jin) manages to portray an equally interesting character. She is quirky and eccentric, lively and outgoing, that you can't help but love her. Her strong and yet compassionate persona make her the perfect counterbalance to Hwang Si-mok. The two leads really propel the series along. They are almost complete opposites but for their shared sense of justice and duty, and together make a brilliant team.

I think what I really loved about this series is the realistic character portrayals. No one felt or looked like a fashion icon or typical drama idol. They were all flawed and unique and make the series highly believable.

This series storyline is incredibly complex and well thought out, with a very tight, intelligent plot. There's a lot of suspense. Often, I find a common issue with procedural crime shows, in that they tend to be slower paced and drag along. Not so with this series. The pacing is quick and sharp. Also, I love how it never tries to dumb things down. You really have to follow along with it, because it wastes no time trying spelling things out for viewers and there can be quite a bit of subtext going on. This all proves the great writing and direction. I highly recommend this series if you are looking for a fast paced crime thriller. A MUST SEE.

[NOTE: This Review is for Season 1 & 2]

i usually enjoy crime dramas, and same goes to stranger, i kinda enjoy it but it doesn't fully satisfy my expectation due to the many good reviews. the first and early episodes definitely hooked me, as it was such a thrill and i was curious on what will happen. but the middle towards the end kinda get bored and slow paced, maybe due to the focus was only for one case throughout the series making it feels a little bit draggy. what i enjoyed the most was the process of solving the case and collecting evidence, it was smart moves rather than coincidence. the acting was okay, hwang si mok suits the role of emotionless very well. well the case wasn't as amazing, it was common and predictable with some twists. i kinda enjoy this season and looking forward to the next season which I'll be watching next.

i really expected a lot from this drama seeing how many people are recommending it and praising it. however, it didn't really live up to my expectation.

for a plot-driven drama, i find it average. there's really nothing so extravagant to it that makes it shine among the rest. the cases are good, makes me wonder who the killer is, but that's just it. there are also some glaring loopholes, tho not so many. i think they managed to execute the plot well in the end.

second, i couldn't really connect to the drama. i was expecting that it would, like hypnotize and totally pull me in for a mystery drama. but it didn't. one reason that i could think of is that it's lacking with the character aspect. si-mok and yeo jin are amazing characters, no doubt. and the acting was good too. however, their backstory, personality, goal, drive, fear, you know, it was lacking in that aspect. there are a lot of things going on but i don't know why it matters to these characters, and why would it matter to me too. i was waiting for that moment where i would see why they cares for these cases so much, except the fact of course that it's their job and responsibility. there's just nothing connecting the plot, the cases to the characters that would make the drama even stronger in my opinion. si-mok character is already interesting, and i was expecting that they would try to delve deeper into his past and his conflicts as someone who can't perceive emotions. but there's just nothing. and yeo jin, i really like her character, strong and bold. but her character literally has nothing in it. she has no family background, internal conflict, fear, goals (prior to her meeting the old woman) there's just nothing but Yeo Jin being Yeo Jin. i want to know more about her but the writer didn't give me the opportunity to know her.

on the contrary, i find the antagonist (if you can call them one) more interesting than those two. especially the one who jumped (if you know, you know haha) his back story, his drive, motivation and his goal. it's really great. and the one who-dunnit his motivations too, goals, reasons, fears, conflicts and suffering, so so great. i hope that the writer applied the same thing to the main leads so that as a viewer, i could connect to the story more.

that being said. i think it's a decent watch. not that much but i still like it. and thank goodness there's a hidden chemistry between Yeo Jin and Si-Mok because without it, i don't think i'd manage to finish this one.

This is a show you won't be disappointment to watch. It has elements from all genres, amazing script and brilliant acting by all, especially the lead male actor. It was a treat to watch, how someone who isnt able to feel anything or process emotions, how they struggle and everything gets bottled up inside. Really looking forward to the second season of this awesome show and the leads returning. What surprised me is how this show gripped me to the very end, not a dull moment in the entire show. A show one will remember for a long time for sure, at least i would!

all the characters here portrayed their role in an excellent way. skipping episode is not necessary because every  seconds of the story will bring you to a bumpy road that will make you wish to go further to reach the end of it.  season 2 is a must. this is one of those stories which consists of twist and turn. addicting to up the extent that you are asking for more ; just finished Ep 16. Great exchanging of dialogue. script is well written!! And compelling acting and character portrayal by the lead and secondary actors. one of the best series this year

Good Script, Great Cast
A great drama. The actors are perfect, they have shown the images of prosecutors, policemen, and chaebols in a very realistic and skillful way. I've watched a number of Yoo Jae Myung's dramas, this is the one I'm most impressed with. Also, when I watched Shin Hye Sun's small roles in many dramas, I couldn't imagine what an excellent actress she is, I'm glad that her talent shines in recent years. she has a very graceful, cute and natural way of acting. Also she is very beautiful. Bae Doo Na is really cool, I kept rewinding the scenes to see her facial expression. This drama has a good plot, the motives and psychology of the characters are reasonable, the details of the case are shared fairly with the audience. Plot twists here is built meticulously, slowly. I like how the writer never throws a twist indiscriminately like many other dramas. Overall, it is suitable for viewers who like the genre and have enough patience.

Simply Brilliant
One of the best shows have watched. In case of very famous shows your expectations sometimes are too much and then you get disappointed, but this meets all the expectations. It is brilliantly crafted and made in such a way that you just cannot stop watching it. And Brilliant performance from all the cast. Really kept me guessing and intrigued to the end.
The world building is amazing in this too, as you keep watching it you get to know about how corrupt everyone is, and anyone can be the bad guy because they are all bad guys in some ways.
The lead had a big task to act without emotions and his acting is phenomenal, as the shows progresses you just fall in love with him more. The female lead is impeccable too, it was my first drama of hers’s and I really loved her in it. Will watch more if her work.

Story 9.5
If you like murder mysterious and twists and turns that you necessary wouldn’t be able to predict, this is the drama for you! Though I have some things that I didn’t like, about the plot, mostly that at times, it seemed they added one or two things that were slightly irrelevant or didn’t tie up as nicely as I would have wanted, that doesn't mean I didn’t enjoy the ride. It is well worth a watch.

Acting/Cast 10.0
Everyone in this drama was perfectly casted for me. I wouldn’t change anything when it came to casting choices. If you want to see a drama that is very well acted, you should definitely check this drama out. I don’t think people quite understand how changeling and hard it is, to play someone like Si-mok, and have others interact around that type of character. As someone who understands the field and challenges of acting, I thought it was very well done, and if you had gone for someone else, odds are you they wouldn't have been able to pull it off.

It was really nice for me to see Bae Doona in a roll that wasn’t as serious or at least she smiled and had acted goofy in this more than what I have seen her do. Her ability to change between the two is, really wonderful and very well executed in this role.

Music 10.0
The music for this show was very well placed and very well chosen. There wasn’t any over dramatic song choices that didn’t fit the concept as far as the OST goes. The music was subtle at points that it needed to be. I have no problems with the music, in fact, ti made some moments even more intense for me.

Rewatch Value: 2.0
I found the story topic and the overall surprises, wouldn’t be good for a rewatch to me. Because I know all the twist and turns once watching it, I don’t believe there series would be as exciting the second time. Acting wise, the drama would be enjoyable to watch an episode every once in awhile. But if the sequel does happen, you better be sure I will be watching it.

Overall Episode Average Score: 9.28

Intriguing and good suspense.
Intriguing and good suspense.

OMG... I never thought I'd one day like a non romcom drama. This is the one of the best SERIES I ever watched. The suits are very realistic and beautiful. I didn't like True Detective or the American version of Infernal Affairs or most Crime Thriller. The ending kinda crumbles a bit but it's still good. The OST is just OK. The main character is very psychopathic. Their were some few minor bad plots and it seems that from time to time the directors changed his mind on the storyline.

The story is very complex. This is definitely a good watch.

""I guess that's just his fate. What can I do?""

This quote from Mr. Lee comes to mind as I end this drama. For me, it was such a powerful line, because it's an outline of most of the things that goes on in this wild ride of a drama. It's so easy for one with power just to cut off someone they were associated with as soon as the skeletons in their closets get found out, yet the events just show that justice can prevail in the end, no matter what.

I admit this show gave me such a bright insight on how people's determination and belief in the power of justice can bring the shadiest things to light, so much so that I felt a little personal to it, because of how jealous I am of how rightful the characters are. I certainly wish that people like them existed in the fucked up government of my country!

Anyway, this was just amazing. I was blown away by how much I enjoyed this, and again by how determined both the swayed and unswayed characters were. I was very emotional about what became of certain characters, and the build up of drama was just excellent. The only thing I probably did not like about it was certain things that made me really sad, but at the same time thay pumped up the drama to the max.

Jack of all trades...
If anything this drama has taught me is that the good is the bad, and the bad is the good.

There was this quotes in this movie where a lawyer wished people has tag for good and evil. Then the Police Officer replied to him, how would you know if you are good enough to be tagged as good. Being Human is about chances and to give a shot of becoming kinder each day. Forgiving bitter memories. Accepting flaws. And has that 1 percent heroism which triggers the soul to be brave.

Huge fan for Hwang Si Mok. Dashing and brave yet vulnerable with certain suppression. Then again, I’m always amazed by Jo Seung Woo since God’s Gift. He is a brilliant actor. And genuine in every roles he acted. He’s hinted smile is like a brief of warmth Sunshine

I’ve rewatched season 1, three times and stil find it interesting to watch. You gets to learn characters and to me personally, it’s stress-freeing.

Sometimes Hwang and Han relationship reminds me of Patrick Jane and Teresa Lisbon from Mentalist. Less bantering, but the same level of intense. Both understand each other like a puzzle cube. You can mixed the colors anyway you like but the write twist you’ll matched all colors.

The storylines are epic, brilliant and genius. That’s all my spill

I just finished watching this and I've gotta say I didn't expect to love this drama so much.
So, the first episodes are kind of slow and I thought of actually dropping this drama but thank god I didn't because it gets so good, the pace of the story gets faster with each episode and it will get you hooked.
And that end tho! I loved it, this is a totally worth watching drama.
I cannot write this review and not mention the expectacular job the cast did, the chemistry between the main characters was amazing.
Can't wait for Stranger 2

This is my first review ever so, sorry for it being kind of crappy.

This is probably my first crime/murder drama (without romance) and I really liked it! I’ll admit that some of the more political economy stuff went over my head — surprising, because I’ve loved that in Western shows — but overall I still had a really good time following the mystery and getting betrayed over and over again.

One thing that I kept hoping for though, was some backstory for the main female lead, which we never really got, and it felt like she was such an amazing, badass character without any hints as to how she got there.

Stranger is strange, that is certain.
The show is heavily, who am I kidding, MASSIVELY driven by the story. It's actors are good and surve the purpose, the characters are there and exist yada yada yada. But without the geniusly written story and complex development it experiences this show would not work.

That said, I personally am someone that needs strong characters, character development and good acting. Was it missing here? Not at all. The actors were all so good, that they delivered the story elements perfectly and every character had a very deep and complex story him-/herself. So why did I give this show not a 10/10 or something close to that but instead ""only"" a 8,5? That's because they kind of wasted their potential here a bit in terms of even further, deeper and overall better character development. They only scratched the surface on what could have been the right path to a masterpiece. All of the set up there is for Shi Mok and also his relationship with Yeo Jin just blatantly gets thrown out of the window for story purposes. I'm glad I watched this show when I already knew, that there will be a second season. Because this makes me hope, that all this set up wasn't for nothing and they actually focus on it more in season 2. I strongly believe that at least the two main characters will actually experience this severe development I strive for, because Shi-Mok showed signs of his development he made in the last scene of season 1. His smile told me, that in his 10 months he has been doing SOMETHING to express some emotions, sort out his thoughts and stuff like that. I just hope, that the showrunners will not ignore the huge potential the relationship between Shi Mok and Yeo Jin has in season 2 once again. Even though the story will probably be genius again and I will fully enjoy myself because of that, I will most likely not forgive the writers and directors for not making this small step to complete the masterpiece Stranger should be.

The drama that I truly called "" Thriller ""
I don’t usually write a review for any dramas that I’ve watched but this one is a must!!! If you’re hesitate to watch it bcuz you’re not sure if it’s going to be worth the time, well lemme tell u;
I have watched many so-called thrilling dramas and I usually don’t feel that thrilled. However, Stranger is the first kdrama that literally made me go 😳😧😮 for EVERY episodes.
The drama is very well-written and it flows soo smoothly. You wouldn’t believe how good the drama is unless you watch it. The twist was very UNEXPECTED and it’s very worth the time. One of the best drama ever. I strongly suggest u watching it and assure that you’ll have trust issues. And btw, the drama has no romance...but friendship. Hence, the actors/actresses are 💎💎💎

More of this, please!
Loved absolutely everything about this one. In no particular order:
1. Superb acting -- could have expected nothing else from the leads, but the supporting cast were so stupendously wonderful that one can sense the depth in them -- it really does feel like they have lives outside of the show.
2. Wonderful music -- suspenseful yet not intrusive (and main theme is very catchy!).
3. Loved, loved, loved the character interactions -- It felt like the characters had real relationships (acting definitely contributed to it, but so did the writing, editing, and direction). And thank you, thank you, thank you for not forcing a romance in there.
4. Focus on the work setting -- I know this is a crime drama and the mental puzzle is what is meant to keep it going, but to me, the little interactions between colleagues is what truly makes the show outstanding. It feels like the writers may have actually worked in real life, know what work is like, and have managed to make those real-world experiences entertaining. Never having worked for the police or prosecution I cannot comment about how accurate the actual work responsibilities are (and have a feeling that many of the male lead's activities would be highly inappropriate or at least unlikely for a prosecutor), but at least the situations feel organic.
5. The story -- although there are some minor plot holes and not all deductions are completely justified, the story nonetheless makes sense, and it is clear on rewatching (which, yes, I have done a few times) that the story had been meticulously planned.
Not only one of the best Korean shows that I have watched, but one of the best on Netflix right now, IMHO.
Can't wait for the next season!

Kim Jun-seok better win all the awards for the OST
The opening credits and the accompanying music drew me in immediately. To watch an intelligent, sensitive legal/crime thriller after what seemed forever was such a delight.

Bae Doona, Cho Seung-Woo, Yoo Jae-myung and Shin Hye-sun were brilliant on screen. The OST weaves in and out of Stranger effectively, so much so, that you're still lingering on a certain scene when it has long gone by. There aren't any gratuitous misogyny or violence...it's all integral to building the story and the cast, director and DOP navigate through it all smoothly.

Lee Soo-yeon's written a complex, woven story that is skilfully abstract in places and glaringly clear in the rest.

Such a respite and antidote to the run-of-the-mill saccharine dramas on offer.

Must Watch!!

""Stranger"" stands out for the investigative story and simple complexity of the narrative, one of the best investigative thriller-style dramas I've ever seen. Cinematography in turn is the only negative point, we have a precariousness there in terms of scenarios, defects, errors of continuation of scene, as well as positioning of the cameras. The soundtrack is incredible, timing is perfect with the feigned interlocution that the environment does not help ... For those looking for a thriller with good story, seriousness and comical and romantic moments, ""Stranger"" is a choice.

Well written and believable
I really like it!
In this days I prefer watching romantic dramas with happy endings.
This isn't one of them... The lobotomy that ML did make romance impossible and that is ok, we know that. But even with that brain, we feel something in the air...

PLOT - well balanced and very well well written.

ACTING - amazing job of almost everyone!

MUSIC - didn't pay much attention because of the environment where I saw the drama. Can't really have a strong opinion.

REWATCH - knowing the plot is important for not thinking rewatch this drama. But the reason is more because there are so many dramas to see!

OVERALL - If you like a little mystery, great plot and production and a drama that maintains the quality this is a good watch.

A mild thriller - Not an on-the-edge-of-your-seat/nail-biting drama
Why I Started this drama?
→ Interested in Crime/Mystery/Thriller
→ This drama is highly rated across sites, and on lists of must-watch series

My humble Opinion: Expectations Unmet
→ Usually crime dramas, have a sense of urgency - mystery of who-did-it?
→ It is more preachy rather than something like stories of Sherlock/or gripping like Signal (2016)

What Works: The Acting
→ Jo Seung Woo - as an apathetic prosecutor is the first role I am seeing him in, and after this series and a little wiki info on him, I know I will see all his work soon.
→ Lee Joon Hyuk - probably the best, showing signs of a corrupt official, trying to come on the right track - but till the end we don't know whether he is actually good/bad? He is in my opinion, a survivor trying to be on the winning side to live.
→ Yoon Se Ah - she played a small support character, but delivered her twisted personality well (and her arc of mystery probably kept audiences guessing - whether she murdered someone or no?)

What Does Not Work: The Story (and pace)
→ The story was average, nothing unseen/unexpected and like a web was slowly revealed to us but we know from the get-go who is the final culprit.
→ This drama is slow paced, building out the characters and storyline but without any cliffhangers, unexpected reveals that would make you stay up all night to watch just one more episode to know what is the end.

Summary:
Forest of Secrets in an apt title - as this drama slowly showcases how deeply rooted the corruption becomes - instigated by people in power and when justice system turn a blind out to it, making the common folks suffer. Like a seed of injustice once laid, becomes a forest overtime, and ultimately harsh measures are needed to cut it down - but then again, can it be fully uprooted?

It is more suited for regular seasons, where the team tries to solve different cases than the usual single-season-wonder. (Maybe that's why there is a season 2 which I will watch).

Also in case you're wondering how I rate dramas since this is an unpopular opinion - please see my profile: https://mydramalist.com/profile/omo-omo-omo (am always up for a healthy discussion on dramas as well!)

At the beginning of this drama, my favorite characters were Hwang Shi Mok and Han Yeo Jin, the leads. At the end of the drama? It was Lee Chang Joon, hands down. Why? Because even though I admired Prosecutor Hwang's and Lt. Han's integrity and adherence to the law under any circumstances, their holier than thou attitude in the last few eps rankled a bit.

I'm not saying they should've admired the ones who concocted the whole plan that involved a murder (among other things), not at all, but considering that except for a few small fish who ended up in jail everyone else got away with their freedom at the very least intact (if not with their money, too), considering that pretty much everything went back to how it was before, considering that until the murder nobody had done anything, not the cops and not the prosecution? I honestly don't blame the conspirators for doing what they did. And I didn't feel one bit sorry for the murdered guy, not after what he did. He had a mother and a son? Yeah? And? So? But then, I'm a callous person, I admit that.

And Lee Chang Joon! Gosh, as the story unfolded and I started suspecting where it was going, holy smokes! He was so awesome and so smart and conniving and... wow. This part made me fall for the actor, Yoo Jae Myung, so hard. Goodness he was good!

One of the best Thrillers ever made.
Stranger is an amazing show because it works very well as an entertaining TV show about an unusual genius solving crime and taking down institutions. If you pay some attention it's much more than that. In the movie Seven, we see our main character lose faith in humanity as he sees the actions of the killer. In Stranger, we get to suffer instead as we lose our faith in the system as Hwang Shi Mok faces problem after problem that would make any sensible person completely lose their mind where you can't trust anyone or anything but he doesn't because he can't express or feel emotion the same way we do, there is something comforting and scary about it. We get to learn a horrible truth about our world through Stranger the only way to be a hero in the real world is by being an emotionless robot who is highly functioning and doesn't get affected by all the things that put him down. The moment you become a person you have already lost against the system. Even after all the lengths, he goes does he really get anything done. Stranger is quite bleak for people who scratch beneath its surface and so I love it. I hope more folks get to watch it since I feel it would get appreciated even more outside of this circle.

- The acting was sublime, Jo Seung Woo nailed it as the ‘emotionless’ prosecutor. Bae Doo Na was an excellent detective partner in their journey to investigate corruption.
- It was refreshing for once to witness a protagonist with strong morality, and to see him journey with emotions he once thought were lost.
- The plot could’ve easily been another political corruption plot with bad people doing horrible things, but it subverts all expectations. It’s a well-thought our plot that doesn’t keep you guessing endlessly- it has great shot-term and long-term payoffs.
- I can’t fault the supporting cast either, the acting was brilliant and you get a real understanding of their depth, secrets and motivations.
- I loved the ‘Sherlock’-esque ‘mind palace’ scenes of unravelling crime scenes. That was a great addition, although I’d quite like a deeper look into Hwang Si Mok, especially his past.
- As we journeyed with Si Mok’s own journey of emotions and connecting with people, in the end it felt like solving crimes with a genuine family. I loved seeing his growth and I’m excited to see more of this in the next season,
- My only qualm, is occasionally the dialogue-heavy parts rolled on a bit, but the saving grace is that the fast-paced nature meant the plot kept moving forward. It didn’t stop for the more emotionally heavy scenes, which I appreciated because it was great getting to know what shaped the characters.
- The finale was brilliant, there was a lot of twists and turns heading towards it, but the pay off was brilliantly done.

O V E R A L L : Aside from a couple of teething pacing problems here and there, the story flowed well. This is the one to go for if you’re looking for sharp acting, a stimulating plot and tense crime action. Oh and throw in a brilliant production values, and interesting characters- I’m ready for a second season!

This show does not disappoint.
Ok, i'll put it out there --- this is my first CSW starrer. I had the show on my Netflix list for the longest time after watching the great BD in Kingdom. Boy, this show is a winner! Let me count the ways why it is:

Hwang-Han tandem - Both characters did not get enough acknowledgment from their own peers, esp Hwang, but they got loads of it from each other. I thought between the 2 of them they could close cases and punish culprits with just their sharp minds and sheer perseverance.

Money, politics, influence - Whether at the police bureau or in the justice system, money corrupts even the best of them leaders. But what i liked here is that they are all tied together in a way that unites 1ep to the next, 1 character to another, 1case to another. It itself is the plot.

The writing -Ah, as a crime show fanatic , i can definitely say that the writer kept the plot tight, the characters relevant and the dialogues meaningful. I'm a big fan of this writer from now on!

All in all, such a gem of a crime drama that was blessed with both good writing and excellent actors.

Masterpiece
If you are looking for a good crime series without any cheesy romance, this is for you. I wasn’t expecting much when I first watched this but I must say it was beautifully made. The casting is superb. I love every minute of the series. There is literally no time to get bored. Every twist and turns are beautifully made. The main character Si Mok is a complete pleasure to watch and no one nailed it like Cho Seung Woo. I’m in love with this drama even in my second watch. The drama was amazing from the beginning till end with the right pacing and progression. Having watched many Korean drama without a closure makes me appreciate this drama more. Highly recommended to watch more than once.

Forced myself to watch this!
Going to make a honest and short review..

Boring show..dragged 1 case all the way to the end and i forced myself to watch it just because it was so overrated.Ive seen tons of thrillers,crime,investigations dramas but this one is one of the worst for me..Im trying to understand what people find exciting about the 2 main protagonist in this show.They are so blank and boring.For people that wanna try this show just try 2-3 episodes..If at that point you feel not connected or bored just stop it immediately or just skip trough it.Its not a slow start and get better..Its actually boring all the way trough if you dont like it.One or 2-3 parts have a nice music and thats litterly the only thing for me.The show probably misses allot of action and epic thrilling moments that take you back.Its way to much talkin and blabla.

Give the show a shot! and if its bad just stop it and dont force yourself! peace out.

I like this show all the way until the near-end. The plot sort of fell out for me by then. I was expecting something more concrete of a revelation but towards the end I'd figured out what was what. It annoyed me that such a great show was a given the run-around when it had potential to end on such better note. They're coming up with a second season and I'll probably watch it just to see if it gets any better. Writers need to do better here. I like this show and I'd like to see its second season top what I just saw.

I'm so late in the game. Sorry, I know I should write a review when I'm done watching, But this drama is worth to get high rating even for just for the six episode I've watched. What make this drama is feels refreshing experience for me compare to any other show with similar premise. Heck, (I even rate this drama better than signal) for the fact this drama is meliticulously detail. I'm in awe of how structurally sound it's . What make it interesting each case is kind of related and can't be identified by face value. , the process of uncovering the truth is brutally realistic compare  to any regular korean drama procedural I've seen, that's why it take really long to get to the point. THe protagonist is a genius, IMO, but it doesn't give you the lisence to easily can judge human demeanor to commit a crime that easily, even with all clues pointing out to certain person, your judgement can be misleading. It's also interesting there is a possible alternative you also can become one of the culprit with all the evidence pointing out at you, can yourself also can be trust? Who is your friend? who is your enemy? Who is lying and who is telling the truth?   This kind of issue keep me glued to the screen. It's also allow us the viewers know more about our suspect and witness by digging them deeper.  The show is treat us as watchers  an intellegent viewers so they let us judge if what they are showing is what we get. And It's a plus in my book.

This drama is hands down SUPERIOR to anything out of 2017. The acting, direction, script were brilliant.
Story: Corruption, legal maneuvers with murder. Not a new tale, just well told modern re-enactment.
Acting: The male&female lead set the bar for the younger generations for quality acting - what it looks and feels like. All characters were well thought through and delivered. Excellent
Music: well done -
RW: When drama landscape has too much bubble-gum drama possibly. Too many more to view.

This is adult drama. If looking for riveting, just enough eps, thought-provoking, quality acting, no rom, and pure edge of seat, this must be on your list.

Just finished this AWESOME drama!! The feelings are still here. I can;t even count how much tears was produced due to this drama. This is definitely a must watch drama. Although some parts of the case may be pretty graphic (according to me) it was still good. This drama definitely wouldn't be how it is without those scenes.

Story: This is by the best story line I have ever seen. All the actors are perfect. I felt their pain, their happiness, their frustrations, everything. This drama made me smile, laugh, and cry. Nothing can explain the feelings I had while waiting every week for new episodes.
The writer did such a good job at keeping the suspense always there. The fact that the story has many questions left to answer and is kept for the audience to decipher on what they want to happen is so breathtakingly beautiful. Its just so amazing that the writer and director was able to mesh all that and bring this wonderful work. This drama is definitely by far one of the best detective dramas, or drama overall.

Actors: I love the actors. Every one of them meshed into their character so well, I couldn't even tell they were acting. The child actors just hit my heart so so bad, especially the famous omelet scene. Gotta give it to the boy, I cried so much watching that scene. After this drama, I am definitely having an ahjussi-crush on Jo Jin Woong. The mains of this drama was just the best ones the directors could have gotten. I can't even imagine any one else playing their characters. Kim Hye-soo was also superb. Her acting during the shock scene was just...no words possible. Last but not least, Le Je Hoon was not just eye candy. The emotions he showed touched my heart soo much. I fell for him even more after this drama. Overall, the actors and actresses were TERRIFIC. I wished this drama never ends.

Music: Love the OST. Been jamming with it every day. It's definitely going to be on repeat to relinquish my withdrawals from this drama.

So many questions are left after I finished this drama... Despite that fact, this is still a must watch drama!

Signal was an amazing drama from start to finish. At first, I thought that this was simply going to be another crime-solving drama where the main character goes around solving mysteries. Boy was I wrong! This drama is so much more than that. Signal was a crime thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout most of the show. I kept checking back to see when the next episode was available because I wanted to see what was going to happen next! The time-traveling walkie-talkie definitely added some extra spice to the show. Does the walkie-talkie actually time travel? No it doesn't. Are you curious as to what I'm talking about? Well let's just say you'll just have to watch the show to find out! Trust me it's definitely worth it. Or else the drama wouldn't have a score of 9.2 at the time of me writing this review. Continue reading if you're unsure still unsure about whether you want to watch this show or not.

Story: [9.5/10] One thing that this drama does well is it takes very common story elements and turn it into something special. Have you ever seen a crime-solving drama? I have seen many myself. None has impressed me as much as this one. This show stands out from other crime-solving shows because it involves two people from different times attempting to work together to solve the same crime. There where a lot of flashbacks and events from the past that were used to help the characters in the present solve the different crimes. I must admit that initially I thought that this was not something that would have worked well with this type of show. However, in the end, the director and writers manage to mesh all of these elements together to create a great show such as Signal.

Although there were several things that kept me from giving the show a 10. One of the reasons that I didn't give the show a 10 has to do with the walkie-talkie. I wanted to know more about the walkie-talkie. I was a little disappointed by the end because I had some questions about the walkie-talkie that were never answered. I don't want to bring up the actual question because it may spoil a little of the show for you if you haven't already seen it. Just know that the walkie-talkie plays a very big part in the show and that I'm annoyed because they didn't answer my question haha.

Perhaps another weakness of the show is that it can be confusing at times. As I mentioned, there are a lot of flashbacks, and moments where we see events from the past. It often got confusing because the show would sometimes jump back and forth between past and present. On the flip side of all this, the show also had its' own strengths when jumping back and forth between the past and present. The writers of Signal did a very good job in setting up the different time jumps. As I would often find myself only confused for about 5-10 seconds before saying oh this is what is going on and I see why there was this flashback/time jump etc. In a way, I was never really confused at all because my confusion went away since the show itself answered most if not all of the questions I may have had about what was going on. This is a good thing because most shows don't do this. Other shows will often just leave you to wonder what the heck is going on the whole time.

Overall this show also kept a very good pace. It never felt like it went to fast or that it was dragging on.for too long. I applaud the director and writers for coming up with such a great story. They did a very great job in turning simple plot elements into a very sophisticated story. They didn't exactly invent a new genre or anything (or did they?). One thing is for sure though. They sure know how to tell a darn good story!

Acting: [10/10] All of the actors and actresses did a very commendable job during this whole drama. There were times where I was completely drawn in by the acting. In fact I cried at least two times during this whole drama. Let me just tell you now. I don't cry very often when watching shows. I rarely ever cry while watching sad dramas, let alone a crime thriller! This can mean one of several things. The first possible meaning is that the actors did a very good job acting. The second is that the story was very well told and that we were meant to cry at that part. I'm inclined to believe that it was a mixture of both. There where also several child actors and actresses in this show as well. Although they were all mostly pretty young, their acting only helped to improve this drama.

Music: [9/10] The music was very well made. If there was a suspenseful moment, suspenseful music that fit the scene came with at the right moment. All in all, the music helped enhance certain moments of the show depending on where it was needed. The OST to this show was nothing to scoff at either. Was it a ground-breaking OST that I will listen to for years to come? No, not really. However, it's definitely something that I will put into my playlist in the future.

Overall I definitely suggest you watch the show if you already haven't. You won't regret it! Objectively I can't give this show all 10s because it definitely wasn't completely perfect. However, subjectively it was one of the most well written Korean drama that I've ever seen.

Thank you for reading my first ever review on MDL! I hope you enjoyed it!

I was pondering whether to write a review to this wonderful drama or not. But in the end I don't think I could find closure if I don't write something about it.

There is this thing with a 10 point rating. Some give it very easily, some almost never give 10 points. As for me, it's like this: If a drama is successfully absorbing me into its universe and everything just seems to be perfect to me, then it reached a point where it's worth receiving my whole dedication. It doesn't matter if others say, there are flaws in it, whether it's true or not. I just don't see them anymore as I am part of that new world where there are no 'story-faults' and such things.

Signal was successful in every matter.

Story.
First episode and it just pushes you right in the middle of the event. You get immediately drawn to the characters, the suspense and the story. You don't have time to take a deep breath, instead you completely hold it. And when you think it's over and you can take some minutes to rest, the next incident is already starting and you just get sucked in again. If you're lucky, you get some minutes to reminisce about and take in what just happened. But as the story continues, the suspense intensifies and breaks loose in a shocking finale.

Characters.
They like to play with your emotions. Ups and downs, but most of all excitement and anxiousness. Plenty of. The acting was on point, it captivates you. There is this female cop you're dealing with. And there's the present version and a past version of her. They are completely different as the older version has matured and became stronger. You just see the growth. And there's this guy. You see him and you want to help him. You see his conviction and his struggle. You just want to be by his side, so he won't be the lonely hunter in a forest full of wolves. And then there's this boy. He's so full of himself and full of hate for others and the world. But he gets a chance and a view from another angle. And he takes it. And don't forget this villian. You don't know about him right away but you soon grow to hate him like no other. Extremely. Wholeheartedly.

Music.
Every minute, every scene, every moment. It just fits. It just gives you this special feeling about the story and its meaning. And then there's this nostalgic feeling to it. You can't even discribe it. It just takes you back in time and like you're reminiscing about your own past, it carries this wistful desire to actually go back, live again and maybe change something.

Background.
To get to know that many cases are real-time cases makes the drama even heavier and impacting. Sometimes you think writers create scary non-realistic monsters. But truth be told, our world, our reality creates the most fearsome monsters you just wouldn't believe them to exist among us.

Message.
Whether there is one or not. Everyone has to decide that for themselves. But the drama depicts some really interesting and worth thinking about questions. Most of all: What would you do if you could change the past?

Deserved 10 points.

I thought the first episode of Signal was solid. I thought the second episode was fantastic. And then . . . well, then the show decided to go full throttle for “big emotional moments”. There were a lot of explosions, a lot of lurid cases, mostly involving ghastly things done to women, and a whole lot of crying. Despite excellent acting by Kim Hye Soo and Jo Jin Woong and stylish directing, I found myself becoming less and less engaged. Thrillers, especially those that dare to mess with the space-time continuum, demand top-notch writing, and while the script was serviceable, it never fully worked out the logistics of its crisscrossed universes. The actual detective work was also slighted, with its crack team instantly solving crimes that had baffled cops for years. Pinning all the blame for cases turning cold on “corruption” may be satisfying wish-fulfillment, but it felt lazy, especially in a show gunning for gritty realism.

On the plus side, the show's fast pacing tends to paper over the plot holes, but it shortchanges the development of most of the secondary characters. They become “innocent victims” or “evil elites” we’re supposed to mourn or hate simply because of the suffering they endure or inflict on others. Occasionally there are glimpses of greater depth before the show bustles viewers off to the next crime scene, but I would have appreciated fewer set ups and more follow through. The concept is intriguing, but once you unwrap the layers of snazzy time warp packaging you’re left with a pretty ordinary procedural. The present may be able to change the past and vice versa, but the conventions of the crime drama survive unscathed.

This review may contain spoilers
Don't put high expectations.
Alright so I had extremely high hopes for this one because the sypnosis sounded so cool. Seriously, two detectives try to solve cold cases with a detective from the past using walkie-talkies. And knowing it's not one case but mutliple cases, it sounded promising, it won'thet noring they won't drag the subplots we get to see different criminals the way Hanyeong would profile them and use his 'skills' the whole new way of solving the case but the way it was underwhelming. So disappointed. It's not a bad show, sure it's interesting you want to know what would happen but the way the main idea was used very badly as, more of something at the side rather than the whole point of the show. First off, they didn't solve any cases together. Whenever someone discovered something and they tell it to the other, the other already knows about it. One of the two detectives in the future doesn't even know about the walkietalkie-future-past-communication until the 14th episode which takes away from how well it could've been. The only time she used the walkie-talkie was basically her crying the whole convo and getting sentimental.
The way each time they were on a case they each detective solved it on their own, they could do without each other. The potential this plotline could've had and it just missed it. Another thing was the characters' writing they were written very badly. I'm a person who cares more about the characters than the plot, I would watch a show with an okay plot if it had great characters and would drop a show of a good plot with bad characters. This show didn't have well-written characters or a good plot as I've previously mentioned. The characters are very one dimesional, it seems like they have no life outside of the cases they solve, no other acquaintances, nothing. Which made them seem very dull and unlikable in my opinion I couldn't stand them and the way some lines sounded so forced. Like all three detectives are made up of one personality. Righteous, wants to know the truth,have no sense of humour, no quirks absolutely zero personality besides that. Each time I watched an episode I was not very hooked or interested with what was going on and then it ends at an intense part so I go for the next episode only to be underwhelmed with the events as they unfold. The ending of the show didn't feel satisfying at all??? I know they tried to pull an open ending but it just seemed like everything is starting all over again with the whole confusion and repetitiveness of the whole plot all over again. Was not a fan.
I'd give it a 6.5 stars because it could be enjoyable to a lot of people I just feel it could've been done way better.

Just finished the last episode of this drama and I immediately had to make a blog post. This drama is ineffable. It is the pinnacle of everything I expect from a drama, and it blew my expectations to tell you the truth. The genres coalesce in this drama, and I went through a literal catharsis watching episode 15 in particular. Now, I'm going to dissect this drama...

Crime: The 3-4 cases this series is based on are REAL COLD CASES. These kidnappers, murderers, and rapists are on the loose to this day. It sickens me but I really like how they did those cases justice. There is so much commentary on current society about police and corruption. Our society, despite its progress, is still muddled with corruption and Lee Jae Han was definitely a shining beacon in this drama, demonstrating how our justice system should really be. Anyway, the writing for these cases was spot on.

Mystery: I find the cases well paced; they were timed with enough suspense but weren't stretched out. I initially thought this series would only focus on one case but I really appreciated that it was a mix of cases that in reality were all connected. This series was really unpredictable in how the cases would be solved & who would survive or die (as the past can change and those who died could still live and vice versa). I was on my toes dying to know what would happen til the very last minute of this drama.

Time-Travel: THIS WAS EXECUTED SO WELL. I love the complexity of the time-travel and how a subtle change in the past can amplify in the future; it was realistic for an unrealistic concept. The writers handled the shifts in the past and present so well & I couldn't even follow at points (which I think is a very good quality, if a drama can outsmart me haha). Definitely made this drama stand out! One thing I'd say is that if I was Hae Young on the walkie-talkie, I'd cram so much info in that minute they talked haha. The time-travel (if you can really call it that) was also perfect because you got a balance of present day and 80's dramas (which people desire like in Reply 1984. Reply 1988, etc.). You get very two very different vibes in the same drama which really caters to different interests.

Romance: This is so subtle. Don't go into this drama expecting a romance because you really won't get anything. It's just a little heartwarming seeing scenes where the main female lead pines over Jae Han. You get to see the care they have for each other. This definitely made the drama a little lighter from its heavy subject matter but I still respect how the romance was put on the side. This drama really needed to focus on the cases and the justice needed to be served which it did!

Characters/Acting: I honestly have nothing but praise for the actors. Cha Soo Hyun in particular. This character was stunning; the complexity of the character arc and the contrast of her past self and present self were acted perfectly by Kim Hye Soo. Her acting as a victim was great as well. The main lead, Park Hae Young, I also really enjoyed. He's relatable and real, and he can act! I really appreciate how this drama wasn't about having a flower boy lead; I could really focus on the character! And Lee Jae Han stole my heart really. He's such a strong spirit with bright morals; he definitely shone in the drama and had really great, passionate monologues. Awesome acting from the main leads! And Kim Bum Joo... what a despicable character. Well done, I guess. And there's another character, Ahn Chi Soo, who has a really complex character arc throughout the series... I just appreciate the depth each character has... amazing job writers!

Plot/Writing: As I've alluded to before, this series is well paced. I find everything unpredictable and nothing dragged. Nothing was too confusing and the series had an appropriate amount of flashbacks. This drama didn't have any typical kdrama plot devices and the writers definitely aren't scared to wring your heartstrings a little... I cried 6 times in an episode! Everything in the story is so intricately woven, I can't help but wonder if they planned all of this since episode 1. No episode was subpar compared to the rest; each episode got better and better which is truly rare. I just can't get enough.

OST: Very subtle OST that fits the theme of this drama. It's very heartwarming and like one of a ""family"" drama I guess. It sounds like home to me.

Overall, I am so in love with this drama. The ending definitely was open-ended so I am desperate for a season 2. My only fear is that it might not live up to season 1. Give this drama a go, I promise it won't disappoint!

Pros - Great acting, Past main character ( will butcher the names so ) was the best part of the show.

Cons - Main character is not that smart. He does not use the transmissions to it's full potential. Could have changed a lot things but he chooses not to and the show does not provide any good explanations on why he would not do anything worthwhile in the whole show ( don't wanna spoil). The cases were very predictable and the only reason criminals didn't get caught is because every other cop other than the main characters are either corrupt or incompetent. The criminals themselves do things that don't make sense. They are smart enough to avoid getting caught for many years but get caught in the end because of something very stupid that nobody would ever do. One thing that pulled me out of the show was that the criminals or victims in the cold cases don't look any different or their lives changed in any way. At the very least, characters who were 30 in the past should have some white hair or their careers or others part of their lives changed in 20 years. Everybody seems to have just been doing the same thing for over 15 years. Nobody moves on or do anything else(ex. photographer).

conclusion - I went in to the show expecting good storytelling, exciting cases and changes with time. I was expecting the characters to use the transmissions more effectively and do something that changes the time or character development. They used the transmission like around 6 times during the whole show. I am not seeing what everybody loves about this show. The only thing I got from this show is great acting, good cinematography, great scenes and bad plot.

But  I would re-watch this drama 100 times  only for  Jo Jin Woon  as detective Lee Jae Han.  He brought this character to life.


What ruined it for me (and I cannot tolerated it anymore)  is the fact that when they have proof that someone is a criminal (videos, photos, testimony etc)  it's all deemed as circumstantial evidence and on the ""he said/she said"" basis.  The criminals walk away happy. When they want to arrest the heroes  than they use the most idiotic formula ever, frustrating the audience to no end because that's what they do.  Then the ""I said/he said"" works in sfavour for the heroes. ""becuase someone saw you so you are the criminal"". Case close. Other the rules work the same for everyone  and the screenwriters stop writing as if the audience is stupid, or they don't work at all.  I remember ""I hear your voice"" had the same nonsense thrown into the drama at one point. It's not entertaining anymore when you question your intelligence at watching something that has become ridiculous.  Other things that are annoying. For example: a girl is raped by more than 10 boys, but the semen found is discarded as evidence.  A detective asks a cleaning lady when the rubbish bins have been emptied, but she looks at him very concerned and asks why. He then goes on explaining that he is a detective and he is looking for something...see my budge. The same detective is now looking erratically  for this item in  a rubbish plant.  Someone that works there tries to stop him because frankly the detective is making a mess within the mess. But the detective doesn't show  him his budge nor does he tells him  he is a detective looking for something  important. Like a child he keeps saying ""one more minute one more minute."" whilst trying to get away from the attendant.
The profiler is arrested. You would think a profiler would come up with something smart and witty to say about ""I'm not the killer, why would I want to someone"" etc. But no! Like a poor beaten peasant he keeps saying""I didn't do it. I didn't do it"" over and over again. And the way he gets arrested is like witch-hunting material.
You know who the villains  are from the very beginning. And the main villain has not a real background story. Why did he decide from the very beginning that he had to act like a loyal dog for the people with power  it's never explained.
All police officers a part from the 3 main characters and their 2 sidekicks are either corrupted, stupid or immoral. Can that even be possible???? Everyone is shouting. Your boss will ask you to solve a case and then he will get angry at your for solving it.  They are all angry and unprofessional.

Please someone explain the end to me. The end is a mess. But you all got it???

Simply brilliant.

Never have I ever watched a Korean drama that left me speechless and at loss for words the way Signal did. The drama never conformed on the cliches and the archetypes ever since the beginning. At first, I was wary. Yes, I was. Because those drama cliches we've grown to love and hate always brings a feeling of familiarity, often times, just mixed with different elements and spices; but still familiar. I've grown to accept that it's always going to be like that in the world of dramas. So, Signal put me off-guard, got me out of my comfort zone, and let me explore a wonderful drama that I don't know if I will ever experience again. If there's ever one thing that I did right, it would be that night I stumbled upon Signal's 1st episode. I don't need to execute superlative adjectives that would describe Signal because the opinions of absolutely everyone is going to be the same. Whatever good thing you hear about it, I will always agree to it.

Whenever I finished watching an amazing drama, I would feel empty and yearning for more. However, for Signal, it left me feeling proud; holding my head high, just how Lee Jae-han would want.

To put it simply, Signal set the bar higher than it could ever be. A game changer, that's what Signal is.

To be honest, I had no intention of watching this drama. I just had no interest in it when it first started. I started it because of the amazing reaction it got after the premiere.

And it was one of the best decisions I’ve made.

It starts tugging at your heart within the first five minutes of episode one. I was hooked. It had a really nice, strong start, and it just kept getting stronger.

The whole drama was like a movie.

The feelings it gave. I was on the edge of my seat in literally every episode, and every episode messes with your emotions. Seriously, this drama likes to give you pain.

It’s kind of episodic. Police dramas usually are because of all the different cases being investigated. I don’t have a problem with it because I find cases interesting, but I know some people have a problem when dramas are episodic. Please don’t let it turn you off, it’s necessary to the story. The different cases are all so important to building the main plot.

Honestly, the whole drama is just genius. The story itself, how everything connected, and how well plotted the cases were (really the entire drama was well plotted out) just blew me away. Oh my God there was so much attention to detail. And the characters were all so smart, it was a relief to not be screaming at the characters for missing the blatantly obvious. The writing was fantastic There were times I actually got chills. For those who know what I’m talking about: the ending of episode 9. Chills.

What made it even better was that it wasn’t all serious and shocking and heartbreaking, but there was a lot of comedy too.

The acting was amazing. I know some people had a problem with Lee Je Hoon, but I thought he was fine. The cast portrayed their expressions and emotions really well. I was really impressed with Kim Hye Soo for being able to switch from the timid Cha Soo Hyun in the past to the strong Cha Soo Hyun in the present.

I also need to take a moment to applaud the stylists for doing a good job of making Lee Je Hoon look like a high schooler.

Overall, I am just so impressed with the drama. The cinematography, the writing, the acting, everything was just incredible. I was really attached to the characters and the story. The feeling I got when the story started to come full circle, I can’t even describe it. I am in awe.

And God I hate open endings but this one was just so well put-together and beautiful, I can’t dislike it.

They’re totally leading up to a season two. There has to be a season two.

The fact that I consider myself a crime series hater, and not only I watched this but I gave it a 10, certainly says tons about how good this is before I write anything else. Signal is a flawless piece of work, it is magical, it is exquisite, wonderful, brilliant, and majestic, it is arguably a masterpiece. It is foolproof written, flawlessly executed, heavenly acted, and not I am not even exaggerating…

STORY
The show revolves around a cold case police team. One of the members finds an old school walkie talkie and somehow, through it, he contacts the detective that was originally involved with them, but failed to solve. However (plot twist), this detective lives in the past, in a different timeline thus the show’s main premise is the what-is-know-as-the Butterfly Effect (= when you change the past, the future changes as a result). I know it sounds messy, and fake, and possibly stupid for people not fan of this genre, but trust me when I say, it is flawlessly executed! Together the two of them start solving several cold cases.

Every 2-3 episodes we get a new case to solve, but, this isn’t your average police procedural show. All the cases were somehow connected to the 3 main characters, and all of them were somehow linked to each other. All the cases are amazing and shocking, and they will keep you at the edge of your seat! There really wasn't a dull moment throughout all the (quite huge) episodes, while the suspence levels were always kept to high rate, making you grind your teeth about what's next and also giving you an ominus feelings about whats to happen.

The main message this show wanted to express, apparently, is the corruption of the task police force, and generally the corruption of people in high places. The drama constantly talks about corrupted cops, and what people would do to climb that society ladder as fast as possible. It generally felt like a huge *Screw You* to every person using unethical means to achieve a goal,and passes the message that they need to be punished. At the same time, it gives wonderful and meaningful life advice, about the significance of being a decent and lawful person and also the notion that you will achieve whatever goal you have set if you try hard enough!

Romance is present here, but it is kept in a minor level, don't come in this expecting to watch romance. Still I thoroughly enjoyed the vague chemistry between the characters.

ACTING
The acting was unbealievably good, possibly the most well-deserved 10/10 i have never given to a kdrama.

Lee Je Hoon. An amazing an emotional performance by this wonderful actor. His acting was tip-top by the first moment of the first episode and stays up there throughout the show! He expressed a diverse range of feelings perfectly, he was strong, he was emotional, he was interesting, he was smart, he was everything you need your main lead to be without being unrealistic or fake.

Jo Jin Woong. Words aren't enough, luscious and exquisite performance. A very strong character, kinda rough on the edges, but with a wonderful, lawful soul, a true, true hero, you will love! The actor did total justice to the character expressing every single emotion of frustration, anger, hope and everything that came along with them!

Kim Hye Soo. As someone who loves female actresses, i love shows that have a lot of them. KHS, in a show about the police which obviously was filled with males, managed to have the strongest character i have ever seen, i never felt the need to watch another actress perform. She was more than exquisite, she enhanced the drama with her acting, she was sensuous, she was sweet when she needed to, she was tough when she had to, she was emotional, and great doing everything! She exceeded my expectations. I loved the way she portrayed her younger and older self, very realistic!

At this point, i do feel the need to applaud every supporting and guest actor that appeared on this, because everyone was amazing and kept up the excitement of the show, and lived up to the main cast's brilliant acting. Congratulations!

RECOMMEND/REWATCH
Signal is one of those shows that HAS to be watched by everyone. It is a show that has no real flaws, it is a show that can be enjoyed by everyone no matter their preferences. In my list of the must watch kdramas this is #1. Even if you don't like this genre, or the fantasy concept sets you off, don't turn a blind eye to this drama, no, this is a VERY well spent 16 hours. Signal is one of the most memorable tv shows i have ever watched! Definately recommended to everyone!
Even if i am not a fan of rewatching tv series, signal definately earns the rewatch ticket for me. It is my personal belief that a 2nd rewatch would help understanding and digesting what it depicted even better. Definately worth watching!

Hello,
I'll do my best to be as unbiased as possible in this review. I'll explain what might put you off as well as why you should still keep watching. This is now, after all, my all-time favourite drama, at least for the crime genre.

STORY :
If you have watched the US movie Frequency, you'll find a lot of similarities as they use the same trick to communicate through time. As for the rest of the story, it's something else altogether. There is roughly one case every two episodes but it's not an episodic drama. All cases share a deep link together, even more so the later ones. There are two/three points which have raised a bit of criticism but keep in mind that very few people minded about that, so please, don't drop it just yet.
First : some complained that there was too much yelling. It calms down a lot after the team gets to know each other better. Personally, I didn't even pay attention to that. It seemed very naturally done to me.
Second : the fact that some cases are real ones (at least one, the Hwaseong murders case) might anger you for different reasons. You might think of the victims family still alive, watching this drama, and feel bad for them. Or think of the police which might have done a great job back then and still didn't find the culprit despite its efforts. But take this drama for what it is : a fiction. Just like any movie about Jack the Ripper, it's a FICTION based on real life cases.
Third : The big question, is there any romance in this drama ? There is but it's very, very slight. It's not at the center of the drama at all.
NB : The first episode is kind of slow-paced, unlike others. So don't let this keep you from watching.

ACTING / CAST :
Overall, they were all very good actors. Even the tiniest role was well-played. Still, Kim Hye Soo (aka Cha Soo Hyun) really was the best to me. She's present in both timelines. Although it's the same role, her character has evolved a lot in 15 years. She's a bit introverted in the past but became a strong and independent woman in the present. It's very interesting to see how this character developped so much and Kim Hye Soo portrayed that very well. As she has the most blatant personnality change, it's easier to see how much of great actress she is in Signal.

MUSIC :
Fantastic! At least, if you like that style ^^ I loved it, the ending song particularly. But the OST as a whole was great as well. It emphasizes the story really well.

REWATCH VALUE :
I highly recommend at least one rewatch, even more so if you marathon it. Why ? Because as they change the past each time, a few important details change as well. Still, you won't feel lost even if you watch it only once so rest assured. There are enough flashback to understand everything quite well.

It's such a waste to marathon this drama. Try watching 1 or 2 episodes at a time. Savour it. Ask yourself why and how things happened that way. You'll definitely enjoy it more.

And here it comes: Me critisizing this overly hyped drama.

Don't get me wrong: This is still a very good drama worth watching and it is totally outstanding in some aspects... but not so much in other.

I will start with what bothered me and why I cannot give it the perfect marks everyone else is throwing at it. Later, I will list the totally awesome things about this, so stay with me.

What there is to critisize:
The black-and-white-setting. If there was ever a story about how incompetent cops are, here it is. It is the pinnacle of unworthy police work, because this exactly is the basis for the entire plot. All police-men (but three), are depicted as either corrupt, lazy, incompetent or plain evil. None but the main characters do their work properly. Of course, there ARE bad cops out there and corruption and everything, but man, this drama just divides them plainly into good cop and the rest. Thus, from the beginning, I got unnerved by unrealistic behavior and ""Oh no, who in their right mind would act this way?"". It kept me rolling my eyes.
The script was written like an inverted fairy-tale about a very bad and dark world where the good people are a minority and most is awful.
Because the drama shows very openly and very early who thevillains for the main plot are, and after a couple of episodes of solving several distinct cases this becomes the main focus, any surprise about this goes down the drain. After episode 8 or so everything became predictable for me (but one point, listing below with the positives).
Then there is the thing with the walkie-talkie. It will be mentioned in the positive-section below, but it still has a flaw: As many plots which play with time, this too, makes some mistakes. People who are into logical plot development and know the problems of changing-things-in-time-stories will know, what I mean after watching it. It just could not have happened the way they showed, but this is a minor flaw.

Here comes the positive:
The directing and cinematography are INGENIOUS. Whilst everyone gets hyped on the (for me unperfect) plot, the real masterwork lies in everything else! It is marvelously shot, the colours, the cuts, the directing - they are flawless and on the level of high-grossing Hollywood productions. Absolutely superb! In this aspect alone it is better than any drama I have ever seen. It delivers the tense and dark athmosphere absolutely believable. And the acting is topnodge, too.
Whilst the plot about most cops being junk falls short and later on becomes predictable, what kept me going was the mystery of the walkie-talkie. Yes, the thing with the time isn't quite perfect, but the question Why do these transmissions happen? puts you on edge.

Altogether a very good drama, for sure, but seeing the ratings a bit overhyped IMO.

But you ought to give it a try!

Hyper character driven , great pathos but not tight enough
This drama right here is packed with a really enduring story line that is hyper character driven. In fact - its the character driven nature of the show that makes its fantastic premise of a walkie talkie in different timelines feel like an entirely normal thing.

Although- I have one heads up for viewers . You cannot be a wuss (because I was) when watching this drama. The crimes are explicit , brutal and mostly against women . Plus , skeletons get a lot of camera time. Its gritty , brutal with vivid depiction that CSI has nothing on.

As for the story- gather around for some thrilling awesomeness. This has one of the best first episodes I have ever seen and was the best incentive to watch Signal.The first few episodes notified me of a great mystery coupled with impactful acting. The more I got into the story - I was very impressed that this show still managed to be emotionally resonant especially with all the crime happening in the background.Its also very well focused and the best example of flash backs and I am not a particular fan of flashbacks . I usually find flash backs wearisome but they were greatly employed in Signal.

The story was also pretty big on motifs which was really good in weaving in continuity and emotional connection with the viewer .'Omurice' being the particularly tear inducing one but there were so many one could find pathos in . I really like that about Signal.

Thematic cohesion was also intrinsically inserted . This is especially gauged with the main character Park Hae Young and his origin story. There’s also something so enduring about the character development . The way the stories all intertwine was expert script writing.

Acting -Jo Jin Woong blew this out the water . What a talented guy!His portrayal of practical but noble Lee Jae Han was absolutley brilliant that his character has become one of my fave fictional characters in K Drama land . Lee Je Hoon was such a great watch too . His pained depiction of Park Hae Young was really tragic and enduring . The supporting cast was really good too and special mention to Jang Hae Kyung who played the guy who got wrapped in circumstances . His portrayal was quite sympathetic.

However - Signal is not a perfect show. Perhaps the best of its genre but its not the best show. Why ? Over indulgent editing brought down this show. It could have been more succinct and tighter because this show started dragging around the halfway point. I have a problem with thrillers that lose their thrill down the road and Signal did that . I also found Kim Hye Soo who plays Detective Cha particularly banal to watch. Kim Hye Soo was definitely the ""something is not right"" aspect of the show. Always wide eyed in the thick of action did not inspire confidence at all. I can even go as far as to say that it is a tad bit overrated because it got basics of editing under developed .

OVERALL- I was quite impressed by the emotional depth of the show as it truly is its crowning aspect .

I'm going against the grain again *cracks knuckles* :) This one is a good story, with a very interesting premise and fantastic production values - but had more than its fair share of issues.

While I've not seen any official note or comment referencing it, there's definitely a close relationship between Signal and a US movie called Frequency released in 2000 where an NYPD detective in modern day is able to use an old radio set to communicate with - what transpires to be his father back in the 60's and he tries to prevent his fathers death by warning him of events to come. So - I come to Signal having watched both this and the TV series of the same name, both of which were absolutely fantastic, and with that premise and a really strong cast I had high hopes.

High Points:
Production quality is outstanding, the visuals are superb. The simple effect of styling and colour grading the scenes in the past and present differently was superb and enabled you to instantly tell what was going on as well as providing a dated feel to the visuals (imagine you're watching it on a VHS tape perhaps). The cast were superb and I really enjoyed their performances and the music was good too - though I have yet to listen to the OST properly.
The story does keep moving at a decent pace, there are numerous cases that are covered so it's not like you're in the mire on one case the entire time, which helps keeps things interesting too.

There is one section with Kim Hye Soo where she is involved in one of the cases that was one of the best performances i've seen, knowing a little about how actors prepare themselves for roles to be able to create their characters I hate to think what she put herself through to be able to capture the intense and raw emotions portrayed as this sequence comes to a close.

Low Points:
Fundamentally the core element of the show - the radio being used to communicate between past and present - is totally underused. Where in the ""normal"" run of events people clearly didn't solve cases, this time around they are figuring things out even without sharing that information on the radio. When the radio is used other than a small number of times where it IS used effectively, it's almost only used as if a couple of buddies catching up and then that's it, radio is off again, and meanwhile everyone carries on solving murders and figuring things out at the same time anyway.

There is one time where the bad side effects of tampering with the timeline are covered brilliantly and devastatingly and I thought that was one of the highlights of the whole story. It was crushingly saddening and definitely one of those rare moments in any show where you're sitting there open mouthed thinking ""what the heck are they going to do now?"", but at the same time it also then cripples the characters from taking certain actions and ultimately was the turning point for the story going down hill for me as the story largely turns into a fairly normal crime thriller and the radio becomes a bit-part.

I felt the ending to be extremely weak. On reflection I have to admit that they do wrap up a lot of the main elements of the story but they leave some key ones open and even suggest at some new elements, this has all the hallmarks of ""let's leave room for a season 2"", though I don't feel as cheated as say ""Vagabond"", enough was wrapped up to mostly conclude the main story elements it just wasn't a truly satisfying end for me. Yes, I do like things wrapped in a pretty bow darn it.

It's definitely not a 9 or a 10 for me, but it's definitely kept me entertained. I wouldn't see myself watching it again based on the poor ending however.

What to say about Signal besides the fact that the drama is perfect?

2016 and TvN started with the right foot, Signal is amazing, well written, acted, the developments even though some of them would break my heart sometimes, made complete sense. The mystery would leave me at the edge of my seat every time, but the feeling of wanting more was always there when they completed a case. I stopped watching on episode 6 and started again when the drama was complete, I cried my eyes out, but those were the best 10 hours of my life.
The 3 leads made my heart break so many times with how good they were, their desire for justice and the truth made me respect the characters so much more, those are the kind of people I would want working in law enforcement. If Jo Jin Woong's acting is always like this, he has a new fan, Lee Jae Han is unforgettable.

A special remark on Kang Cha Ni (Park Sun Woo), I already loved the actor for his work in &quot;Can you hear my heart?&quot;, but here he proved just how good he is, since the first time he appeared I cheered for him, but OMG, I cried so much for him, for his family, angry tears for those cops, those students, I never thought I would say this, but my heart actually hurt for everything that happened, he's one of those young actors that I have to keep an eye on.

I just didn't put 10 on the rewatch value, because I hardly go back to watch a 16 episodes drama, maybe one hour and a half movie, but not a drama, but that's me. Overall, Signal is perfect and a must watch kind of drama.

This is probably the best well done crime mystery Korean drama ever. From the beginning till the end. And probably one of the fewest dramas that actually gets better and better by each episode and not the other way around which is the case with more than 93% of dramas. Personally I loved it from the first episode and was invested by each week more and more until I didn't have what to invest no more cause drama just captured and took my whole heart and soul somewhere in the middle.
What is the most important thing about this drama and from my point of view are its characters and their development. Considering it was announced to be more like thriller, murders, real crimes and more in style of OCN, I honestly didn't expect that human and touching side. But that's the real thing and the biggest advantage of Signal. It managed to affect us, to emotionally put us on hardest tests, to break our hearts over and over again and leave us with so many life lessons and deepness that it'll take a while till we get back to normal. ;)
I loved the main story and plot yet it was nothing authentic or unique; I loved the settings, colours and atmosphere of this drama yet I've seen much darker and similar dramas from that aspect; I loved how they solved the cases and by each episode something new and unknown appears and yet I've seen something similar too. But all that which was good and well done with characters like these, that I still haven't seen and that comes from someone who watched over 700 dramas. :P

Three main characters were..I'm thinking which word to use to describe those characters and actors who portrayed them. I'd say PERFECT. LITERALLY. That word came to my mind cause nothing less simply can not tell how outstanding they were. First of all characters- I loved all three of them in a different way but equally. Little by little they crawled under my skin, engraved in my heart and soul and occupied my mind for a lifetime. Cha Soo Hyun with her past self- so heartwarming, clumsy, brave, naive and so cute and present self- so tortured, devastated, cold and never giving up in search for detective Lee; Park Hae Yeong who was till the end the same guy who wanted the truth, justice, solving murders and finding culprits and giving the bad guys what they deserve, I find him so pitiful cause he felt guilty for everything that happened and you could see how that guilt was tearing him apart, he tore me apart too, I felt every single one of his emotions, his anger, his grief, his disappointment, his determination to save those closed to him; and Detective Lee Jae Han- I think this teddy bear has captured so many women's heart all over the world. I mean it would be weird if he hasn't won cause man is the best and most admirable detective ever written in history of dramaland, the one who went till the end for the price of losing his own life, the one who never wanted to give up, the one who fought against the most powerful ones in the country, the one who believed in justice and truth, the one who never lost hope, even when he maybe looked that way, he still was moving forward. I could never describe him close enough cause his actions, his mind and heart have to be seen and experienced, Jae Han is simply a man with only virtues and with one big huge good heart. I loved his dorky side, his clumsiness in romantic development, his relationship and interactions with Soo Hyun, his ultimate bromance and powerful bond with Hae Yeong, I simply fell too much in love with those three people.

And the actors, how they portrayed their roles it was terrific and incredible. I truly didn't think that they'll bring so many tears to appear in my eyes, so many heart- wrenching emotions, so many strong feelings of sadness, laughing, grief, devastation, desire to just see them alive and fine in the end. Kim Hye Soo, a wonderful and beautiful actress who made her character to come to life, who gave fully enjoyable performance and who in last couple of episode killed me with her raw, honest deepest feelings; Lee Je Hoon, the one whom I loved from way before and here he only confirmed why I love him that much, his natural way of acting, his unique voice, his beautiful profile and nose (I had to mention that too :P), beside him Hae Yeong was a real person whom I could easily meet on the street, he did an amazing and fantastic job in portraying his character, he ripped my soul few times in drama for sure; And veteran brilliant actor Jo Jin Woong who previously won me as Moo Hyul in TWDR, well I can say with certainty that his performance definitely made me like this, that I won't be able to watch some new drama with same excitement as before, I cried, I yelled, I laughed, I wanted to kill those bastards who tried to hurt him and I died, all of these states and conditions I've passed and experienced only because of him and his portrayal of Detective Lee, magnificent and poignant portrayal indeed. ?

Music was the second best thing here alongside the actors. Actually music was one of those best things cause everything was actually so great about this drama. I'm a real music fan and music is very very important to me and truthfully Signal has the best OST ever. (beside ost's from some historical dramas), Kim Yuna's The Road climbed to my top songs and it captured me and imprinted in my soul like no other song, I find it very heartbreaking, emotional, full of pure feelings with such nostalgic and melancholic vibes, so beautiful.

There were some minor things that bothered me and stopped me from giving a 10 (like walkie-talkie, explanation about the very end and why detective Lee done what he's done in the end, too much of coincidences..) but really those weren't things that were huge and some big flaws, just something that came to my mind. The best thing is the script and how amazingly writers didn't mess up the story and they explained all so well, I didn't have any confusion or some big questions, so remarkable.

What else is there to say about Signal? I already told even more but just couldn't write less, that is how much this drama effected me and how much this drama means to me. Most certainly the best drama of 2016., the best Korean crime drama and one of the very best dramas from Asia. I won't ever forget this drama, its characters, actors who played them, music and I don't think in the near future some similar drama to this one will appear. Nor I want that. I want for this one to be unique, original and the one who will have that special place inside of my heart that no other drama could ever take it.
Just watch it. Watch it and see it for yourself, see why all of us think this is a wonderful drama despite how someone will rate it 8,9 or 10, the bottom line is that we all loved it. And it was worth it.

This review may contain spoilers
Firstly, this is not a show you can binge watch.   Each episode is over an hour long.  The pacing of the story is slow and draggy.  They filmed each episode like a movie which is great to look at but not good for binge watching. I actually felt exhausted after each episode partly due to the emotional heaviness of the content and the pacing of the show.  

Pros:  I can see why this drama is rated so high. The cinematography and directing of this drama is like a movie.   The story was very well plotted and executed.   The plot itself was not overly complex, (detective in the present time converses with another detective in the past and together they help each other solve Korea's notorious cold cases).  The intrigue really comes from how the director chose to tell the story.  Pieces of the plot is told in fragments leaving the viewer wondering, how in the world does this information relate to that information.  Only during the last episode do you start to see how EVERYTHING is tied together.   The main characters were all well cast and played their parts well.  Shout out to the actor that played Lee Jaehan.  

Cons:  The reason why I couldn't give this drama a higher rating was because I felt like the cons of the show over shadowed the pros.  One major con was the pacing of the show.  The show dragged...  It was not even draggy like how Chinese dramas tend to fill up the dead time with stupid side arcs that have nothing to do with the overall story.  It dragged because they spend whole minutes of the show on dead time. Such as, walking, opening a drawer, looking perplexed or sad...things that did not need to be filmed for that length of time. I have no idea how they managed to make solving murder mysteries draggy but they did.  I get it.  If they did not linger around a bit the entire show would end in 10 episodes. After all, the entire show focused on maybe 4 or 5 cases? It really tested my patience because I found myself screaming ""walk faster,"" and "" come on, get to the point..."" a lot in this show.

Rather than spend whole minutes on dead time, this drama would have benefited from more light- hearted scenes. There was some humor but seriously NOT ENOUGH. There were a lot of dark themes in this drama.  They could afford more scenes of So Hyun being a girly girl in a squad full of dudes.  I rejoiced watching So Hyun's pink bowed, pretty girl past. I wanted to watch more.

Another con was the plot holes.  SPOILERS AHEAD. So I get that our heroic duo could alter the past but keep things consistent.  Park Haeyoung remembered things that has changed in history.  At first, So hyun doesn't remember anything, but as soon as she gets in on the walkie talkie business, all of sudden, she remembers what changed too?  The heck?!  Also is every cop in this fictional world this incompetent or this corrupt?  Aside from Jaehan, do these ""cops"" even do any active police work?  Everyone just sits around and  it seems like Jaehan is the only one running around looking for evidence.  Which is frustrating and convenient because half of the drama is simply due to incompetence and over fuckery from people not doing anything. Where the hell is his ""team?""

Deaths also lose all relevance and actually become annoying when those same people come back the next episode. It's like, man, I actually felt bad the first time. Do it three times and it's annoying.

The last episode was great but the last 20 minutes made me want to punch a wall.  Don't give us an euphoric conclusion with well deserved closure and then take it all away with another random tangent plot point that NO ONE cared for... Can you sense the frustration from me? UGH. END SPOILER.

This was the longest review I've ever wrote but I guess I felt like I needed to justify why I gave a lowish review for such a highly rated show.

""Signal"" is an extremely ambitious drama. I watched without knowing anything at all about it (other than it involved cops), but it's hard to review it without giving parts of the story away. I'll spoil this review and say I am going to recommend you watch it, so you can stop reading now, and immediately start watching episode one the same way I did. If you want to know more about what you're possibly getting yourself into, keep reading.

This drama is primarily a crime thriller. It claims to be adapted from ""Memories of Murder"", but I saw that movie, and the two only seem to relate on a surface level. What this show really focuses on are unsolved cold cases, and it uses a mysterious partnership between an ambitious cop from the past and a cynical cop from the present to attempt to solve them. The idea of manipulating the past to change the future is not new in KDramaland, but it is hard to do well, and this show manages to do it very well.

Much of the show's appeal comes from the 3 main characters, and the actors who play them. Jo Jin Woong as Lee Jae Han is the ultimate everyman hero. His determination is inspiring, and frustrating to watch. He brought a humanity to the idea of what it takes to be an effective cop. Then there is Lee Je Hoon as Park Hae Yeong, another character with a lot of depth. I loved watching him go from being a cynical know-it-all to going above and beyond. I think his character was so well written, and liked that the more I learned about his backstory, the more I connected to his choices and actions. Then lastly there's Kim Hye Soo as Cha Soo Hyun. I love that she is a total bad@ss. I will admit that I was definitely more of a fan of her in present day, although I understand showing her transformation from how she started out. Watching their frustration, eagerness, regret, stubbornness, impetuousness, tears... made me have so much empathy for their characters, even though I didn't cry even once (and I am a cry baby).

The supporting cast is good, really good, even when their characters aren't the most likable. The cases themselves were also all interesting, which means I was never bored.

Although there are romantic aspects to the plot, it's the partnership chemistry that drives the show, so reviews that call this a ""romance"" aren't really accurate. I will admit that I was more into the chemistry between Cha Soo Hyun and Park Hae Yeong, than her chemistry with Lee Jae Han. Some of the scenes when she was a rookie made her seem a little like an emo-stalker, which didn't seem as cute to me as it was meant to seem. I think their past was the only weak part in the plot for me, and although I understand why it was written that way, it made it seem like she was always overreacting when it came to her senior. Meanwhile, I wonder if I was the only one who sensed some kind of unspoken attraction between her and Hae Yeong. Fine, Was it just me? Wishful thinking? lol. Either way, I thought they worked really well together.

I saw that some people complained about plot holes, which you will always find if you look hard enough. I thought this show did an excellent job of tying up loose ends, avoiding useless scenes, and answering questions. It may be confusing in the beginning, but it soon starts to make perfect sense. There are a few things that are left open ended, or without explanation, but I think keeping a little bit of mystery added to the story. The fact that the story is so cohesive is why I gave it such a high rewatch rating. I think it would be cool to see the whole thing again, now that I know whats's going on, and my guess is that I will see things differently than I did the first time, which is my favorite reason to rewatch anything.

It's also not all depressing, or gruesome. They actually manage to find places to add some comedy, without it being glaringly inappropriate (well, there are the obligatory fart jokes... )

I should mention too that the OST fit the show very well, complimenting the atmosphere, but it's not something I feel compelled to listen to on it's own.

Overall, this is a must see for any thriller fan, but still has enough appeal to convert fans of other genres. I don't agree that it's the greatest drama ever, or the most original ( I saw ""Frequency""), but the fact that it has so many fans makes complete sense. This is one of those shows that it's really difficult to find fault with. From the very first episode I was sucked in, and I had to keep watching 3 more episodes just to see what happened next. This is the kind of drama that can make you lose sleep, because once one thing is resolved, a new equally/more interesting scenario begins. It's that way up to the very last episode, so I understand people being excited about a possible season 2. I know I would watch!

I actually watched this drama because of Jo Jin Woong. Not expecting too much about the drama. I didnt know that this drama will be so awesome! This drama deserves an awards!

Story: Unique plot, the storyline is amazing. The writer and the director did a great job. Its hard to watch it every week waiting for new episodes. You cant predict what will happen next. They always surpassed my expectations every week. Mixed emotions. 10 out of 10 for the story.

Actors: How I loved the cast soooooooo much! They are awesome portraying the characters! Jo Jin Woong can make you fall in love with him!A very charismatic actor. He's amazing! Kim Hye Soo, its my first time watching her and oh gosh she's amazing! She did well on portraying her character from the past and present. Lee Jae Hoon, it is also my first time watching him on a drama. He did great also. I am actually fine on his acting. The other cast are also great! The villains are awesome, the Cold Case Squad Team and also Haeyoung's younger version. 10 out of 10 for the acting.

Music: The OST's are awesome. They are all suit to the drama. Its tempting to buy OST Album kkkk~

Finally...an excellent drama for 2016. The writing and directing is above par. I am not into detective dramas, but this is an entirely different level. It is one of the better time travel (although no one actually physically time traveled) dramas I have ever seen. The story flows at pace that is exciting and suspenseful. The characters are smart, courageous, and I was fully invested in the outcome of their lives. The directing is gritty and so real that everything seemed plausible. I enjoyed the journey of criminal investigation.

I watched this because of my love of Lee Je Hoon and he did not disappoint as Park Hae Yeong. I felt like he was emotionally involved in the life of Park Hae Yeong. That is the best kind of acting. Kim Hye Soo beautifully portrayed a woman who is strong and passionate as Cha Soo Hyun. Then there is Jo Jin Woong as Lee Jae Han...It s hard to know where to start when talking about this actor. I have seen him in a few other things and I thought he was good then. I fell in love with him in this drama. I was cheering for him from the beginning. Whatever emotion he presented flowed through me and I would find myself angry, crying, or smiling with him. It has been a while since I felt this way about a group of actors.

The music is excellent. It fits well with the story and the action taking place.

I will probably rewatch this at some point.

I recommend this drama to everyone no matter which genre you prefer.

One of the best K-drama's you will ever come across in the non-romantic genre!
And the sad part is that it is totally underrated!
Romantic, flowery K-dramas are what we mostly look for and would like to watch. But this is a MUST watch even if you think crime solving K-dramas are not something you will enjoy. The story is out of the world! there are soooo many twist and turns in the drama yet you will never find yourself confused or bored. Kudos to the writer for such a brilliant script that is totally one of a kind. Acting on point! Editing perfect!
And the high point of this drama was the ending...it is an open ending...but for the first time i loved that they kept the ending open cause once you watch the drama you will understand that it was a very smart thing to do by the writers....that way they kept the feel of the drama and also the viewers can eagerly wait for a sequel...and MAN there should be a sequel!!!
Special mention to the OST~~~~Its worth playing in loop!

Hardly any drama has the right combination of everything. This one has. From story, through casting to music - everything worked liked magic.  A very intelligently crafted story set up like a procedural  but works on so many more levels, creating  a comprehensive  arresting, emotional story with pitch perfect writing, flow and great characters. I am somewhat reminded of the movie ""Frequency""...except I think writing and story flow  in Signal are   a lot more meaningful, impactful and interesting, whereas Frequency tended to fall flat, down into  writing that left a lot to be desired.  This drama has been pure pleasure to watch because it's such a story-rich experience!  Not a single boring moment, always high tension or absorbing emotions,  characters I care for and root for... An exceptional k-drama that has all the right elements, combines them in the right way..... dramas like this are one in a million, really.

It's a procedural, and not only technically...there are investigations of murders going on...famous cases, fictionalised. The protagonists  belong to a unit  dealing with  cold cases, whose statue of limitations expired. So naturally, they have to dig into the past. ..and the story is presented both in the past and the present so we get two different stories but intextricably linked to one another,  influenced by one another.. ..the cases seem separate at first...but then certain  leads start pointing to the overarching story,  whose main character is Lee Jae Han. He's a detective who as of the present day,  has not been in service for some time. He binds past and present.  We follow his story in the past, unravel the nystery behind him.  and he definitely is the heart of the story, a link, a bridge that ties characters and events together. It's his story, in a sense. Thus, the story goes way beyond  any regular procedural.   There are investigations...investigations into the past...and then there is a character that is both a clue to that past and the main protagonist of his own story.   Together with him, the young detective played by Lee Je Hoon and his team leader,  we  consider the impact of meddling with  events and how our decisions cause other things to change... we see  impact of those things on characters' memories and emotions....the sense of desperation  that comes with wanting to change things and a sense of desperation that  comes about when you discover what is involved in change and sometimes how win and loss  strike each other out.  There are abandoned places, unsolved riddles, - the overall mood of this drama is pitch perfect too. And we travel together with the protagonists to unravel nysteries that  confuse and surprise them, that are of personal significance to them and thus emotional.   It's chilling and exciting - great experience.  But most dramas that are just ""thrilling"" get old very fast. For a drama to be a keeper, there needs to be more, some substance. This one has it.   I really don't like any regular procedural - i find  them too boring, too sentationalist and just too generic, they tend to lack the things i want from dramas.  But this drama takes some part of that genre and fuses it intelligently with other things and as a result we have something trully unique. TvN dramas have long been my favourites...and here they prove it again. This is a drama with a quality far surpassing other dramas.

 Then, there are rich personal backstories of the protagonists, who are all beautifully acted and whose stories are tightly related to one another....intertwined.   Great cast, I really want to see dramas with as talented  and well chosen cast as this one had..they made the characters very relatable, interesting and sympathetic.  Lee Jae Han stands out for several reasons...he is the link to the past and the  heart that binds other main protagonists to him and to one another in a meaningful way.. And he has quickly become one of my most beloved dramaland characters ever. He's very persevering, determined and has so much sympathy for people around him.  There are strong themes of loyalty, of friendship,  through the radio transmission and even a  strong devotion between lee jae han and his ""rookie"".
Lee Je hoon's character is a brilliant, curious  profiler and Kim Hye Soo a rookie-turned team leader.  Both have strong ties to Lee Jae Han.. Kim Hye Soon;s side adds a personal and emotional perspective on Lee Jae Han himself, whereas Park Hae Young has leads to past cases.. many events in the drama have a profund impact on him and he does go through a change of his own.  He and Lee Jae Han teach each other a lot and develop a unique friendship. The personal stories of all characters add emotional dimension to the cases. Unlike regular procedurals , this one weaves a strong  overarching story that is bound by  Lee Jae Han.

The writing quality is pitch perfect for me...there isn't anything crudely cartoonish, there is great flow that easily absorbed me, that characters are interesting and I care for them very much.  The thing is there is a coherent, emotional story that adds depth and dimension to everything else.. I really rather liked the antagonists too, particularly one of them who seemed conflicted and it showed in his expressions.  The characters are  written and acted out in a way that strongly resonated with me and made love then,

Although the ending is open-ended, i believe this drama does NOT need a sequel. A sequel could just ruin it with something really lame.  Future is uncertain...characters have a chance to make the most of that future - that's what the ending suggests. There is hope...as long as there is will....and as long as there is will, there is a way! Never give up  on things that matter and for characters in this dramas, what matters is  things set right and saving precious people, if possible...and not giving up on things.  I'm very satisdied on all counts with this drama. Very, incredibly satisfying story.

Music is just great too, very moody, with several very haunting instrumentals.  I love this! This drama is one rare case that I am happy to give a 10. Absolutely deserving. I am giving it a high rewatch value precisely because not the mystery counts as such but  characters, implications and connections between them and for that,   there are plenty moments to revisit for sure.

Summary: This is a must watch, every episode was like it was straight from a cinema. This show is hyped and rightfully so, I have yet to see another crime/investigation drama like this one. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and surprisingly the writers, producers, and actors kept that suspense throughout the whole show.

+/- Plot:
The plot went from thick and thin, and I mean that in a good way. They didn't leave you too confused from the get go, but they would subtly unfold different factors so that you could come up with your own theories not only on the investigations but the actual backstory too. I loved how each of the crimes were told in a different way, some cases from the start you knew who the culprit was, but others left you guessing. But it wasn't the investigations that left me satisfied with this drama's storyline and production, but the actual backstory that linked all the characters together. As we slowly started uncovering the corruption I couldn't even handle! I was actually bawling my eyes out from anger at one point and I couldn't even stop it.
I loved how they producers perfectly weaved the present with the past, at no point was ever confused.

+/- Acting/Cast:
All of the actors really did an amazing job at telling their characters' stories. I was deeply moved by all of them. I have to say though that Jo Jin Woong really stole the show. What made me love his character all the more was how dedicated he was as a detective, friend, etc. He was so upright and true to morals, no matter who was persuading him to do the wrong thing, and that's what I admired so much about him. He really was extraordinarily charming.
Lee Je Hoon portrayed his character fairly well too, I really felt the anguish with him during the times we found out the wrongs committed against him and his family. I will say that in the first episode or two I was a little annoyed with him, not sure if it was his uppity character or a little exaggeration on his part, but it took me a couple episodes to warm up to him. But once the fondness developed, I began to really enjoy his acting and portrayal of his character.
Kim Hye Soo's character was a little off putting to me for some reason. I think it was how much they contrasted her throughout the show, I was just a little unsure of her throughout the whole thing. In the present she's a complete badass, but then that's contrasted with her character of the past with the 'flashbacks'. And we see her in a completely different light, timid, innocent, and kind of dumb. I mean, I really liked her present portrayal which is probably why I was a little disappointed in how much her character differed. I guess it's just that I wanted her to be the strong woman character that's so rarely seen in dramas, but in the end I guess everyone has a weakness.

+/- Music:
I loved how they chose to remake some old 80's songs for their soundtrack, I thought it was a really nice addition and touch to the whole show. It exposed me to a lot of songs that I would have never otherwise known about. They also put in the suspense tracks at the right points, got my blood pressure up and left my palms sweating even!

Rewatch Value: I would definitely rewatch this drama, the storyline hands down is amazing and the cast worked really well together. I think it would still have the same suspense factor that it had the first time I watched it.

This is the best detective crime mystery drama I've ever seen and drama that forever will be engraved in my heart. Everything about it is a pure perfection. From beginning till the end. In fact, what fascinated me more is that this drama becomes only better with every single episode, not losing its way, just becoming more and more perfect. How much I love this drama comes from this: When I was marathoning it I wasn't watching previews because I wanted to be surprised by awesomess of every episode, believe it or not.
I was seriously invested right from the beginning to the point where it ruined me emotionally. Totally. ;)
However, even though this drama gives an amazing thrill, mystery and crime to me the most important part and essence of Signal are definitely characters and their development. I didn't expect to give us such a human and touching side. That side of Signal made our heart be broken over and over again, to emotionally ruin us, to affect us in every possible way and to learn us some life lessons and essence of everything: ""If we don't give up, there's still hope.""And that's the only truth of life. :P

-I loved the whole idea of a main story: going back and forth, traveling from present to past, using walkie-talkies to communicate, how does it affects to present when past changes, I loved how they solved cases, how something new always appear, their way of thinking and of course I liked how they based it on a true stories. The world can be so cruel...

And now the part when I'm most excited to write are three main characters, Park Hae Young, Cha Soo Hyun and Lee Jae Han. They're outstanding, enormously awesome, well simply perfect. If you ask me to chose which one of them I loved the most, I'd say all three. I'd have no heart to chose, because my love for all of them are equal. Seriously. And it will forever stay that way. Why? Well, Cha Soo Hyun- she's the woman I really respect and love. With her past she's clumsy, naive, cute and brave, but with her present self- cold, devastated, tortured, victimized, but yet again brave, very brave. I remember that scene which made me shout to her ""I love you so much, woman"". because what she did, I believe only rare number of woman would be prepared and able to do that. She's definitely one of the best rookies, team leaders and females I've ever seen. ;) Park Hae Young- Gosh, how much I adore him. He's so intelligent, cool, brave and of course sexy. I liked how his mind worked, his relationship to Jae Han, his care for him, his fight untill the end. Hae Young is a man I'd definitely would be glad to have in my life. And my dearest Jae Han: A fair detective, a man where a word ""give up"" doesn't exist in his dictionary, a man with an honour and strong sense of justice a man as big as mountain, yet with a pure and great heart. I loved him to the core and I was rooting for him all the way, whenever he has done a right thing I was always saying ""I adore you Jae Han."" Also, his interactions with Soo Hyun in the past were so interasting, pure and sweet to me, I enjoyed to the fullest. He should be a proof to all of us: To never give up, to just keep going, because answer will come to us sooner or later, but in a right place and time.
One more thing I loved about this drama is that three main characters are connected, they feel each other with a strong bond. Their characters grow every time they become entagled with each other, be it in a past or present. Jae Han with Soo Hyun in a past, and with Hae Young in a present and a past, Soo Hyun with Hae Young (I seriously loved how they become so strong together, Hae Young slowly changed her) in a present and Hae Young with Soo Hyun in the present and Jae Han in the past. It's simply fantastic.

The strong point of Signal is definitely the out-of-earth acting. It's outstanding. KHS is very talanted actresses and most of all the beautiful one, because not only she's 45, but because she has that charm that makes you adore her. She rocked this role, that's for sure. How she managed to act from the girl who knows nothing about the world to the strong, wounded, painful woman I can only say BRAVO. I know LJH from before and this drama only made me love him more and more. He's amazing. His very professional acting, his voice, hands and the most beautiful profile and nose I've ever seen (I'm fangirling right now hahaha). My Lord, he is PERFECT. And our veteran and awesome actor JJW. After this role, he has become one of my favorite actors. Only words of praise.

And the osts... Gosh, the best of the best. My fav, ones are definitely ""I will forget you""and ""The Road."" Though, every ost is memorable to me and I'm listening it everyday. Somehow, every ost is related to the specific character and scenes and listening them I keep remembering this drama over and over, so I can never forget it. :P

Would I rewatch it? YES. Definitely, without a thinking yes. I already have an urge to watch it again, I just want to erase my memories and watch it. Like I said it before to me it's the best detective drama EVER, a drama where it taught to me that no matter how hard and difficult it gets, what matters the most it to never lose hope and faith, because everything falls into place and that even though you can't change the past, you can be a reason for a good change in a future. So, if you ask me, I'd say go and watch it right now, you'll not regret it, for sure. ;)

I always thought of writing my first review on a 'worthy' drama. When I first looked into the MDL profile of this drama, only around 23 people watching it and the ratings were a bit shabby. As per its genre, the poster, the name of this drama, all gave me a mystical vibe, that's why I chose to watch right while it was airing.
The fateful first episode aired and I was like- BOOM!!! What did I just watch? What was that mysterious feeling I was having over this drama? This was the very thing I have been waiting for... I instantly forgot Sherlock, forgot True Detective, this is the ultimate MYSTERY DRAMA!!! The detectives here were simple people, nothing extraordinary like Sherlock Holmes but the level of sincerity they showed during solving each cases, made them fantastic and more realistic. A drama aimed at solving REAL cold cases was purely ingenious, that too by mixing a bit of a supernatural element. Forget the idea of it being a remake, it wasn't anything like Memories of Murder, it was purely THRILLS and SPILLS. When it was airing, I remember waiting anxiously each week for those blessed 2 episode, the wait seemed like forever.
When the drama ended, I was crying, not because it ended so quickly (being just 16 episodes) but because of having fortune of being able to experience such a drama- the acting, the plot, cinematography all were in SPOT and also fortunate enough to have the unique of waiting for new episodes to air (while it was still airing).
I know many fans won't be willing to have a second season fearing they might ruin the ""impression"" but I truly wish that if the directors can pull off such a great drama at first go, they won't be looking into dampening their hard work at the second season. So people, wait no longer and get into the experience of this spectacular drama. :)

DRAMA REVIEW: Signal

Was urged to watch this drama after seeing this as recommendation on almost every comment section of dramas I've watched.

The Story: 10
What I know before watching the drama is that the leads are detectives/police. So when I started watching the drama, I had no idea about the walkie talkie connection. It is a challenge to create a drama dealing with the time paradox as one of its main theme (I haven’t watched Nine yet and I am disappointed with Marry Him If You Dare so I am basing my comments on the time traveling theme on the good animes I’ve watched).

Park Hae-young of 2015 is the profiler who initially connected with Detective Lee Jae-han of 2000 while solving a case related to his childhood. He crossed paths with Detective Cha Soo-hyun and her team and after solving one case, they were brought together to form a team that solves cold cases. I love romantic comedies and all, but I have a separate appetite for dramas of this kind. I’m gripped and intrigued by the first hour of the drama and I was wondering whether how they will pull off a drama while playing the past and the future.

I have to commend the writer for stitching every detail of the plot to create this wonderful drama. For this to work, the rules of the connection between the past and the future must be logically established to be convincing and that there is a way to resolve the convoluted conflicts that our characters encountered. Having a different future for every changed past event is convincing enough for me though it sometimes break my heart to see that in some cases, the change was for the worst and not the better.

The Cast: 9.5
Lee Je-hoon did well with his role as a profiler who hates police officers. He became jarred because of the things that happened to him in the past but had remained innocent and hopeful that cold cases can be solved. Kim Hye-soo surely fits the role of the tough team lead for the cold case department but is much the same effective being the inexperienced maknae when she was starting. Cho Jin-woong is such an awesome guy for his character. I love his sincerity towards the cases he handles, his firmness in upholding what he believes in, and his awkwardness when dealing with first love and the like.
Even the villains here are so effective that I want to kick and punch them while watching.

Music: 8
I have nothing against the music, it’s just that I am really not much of a fan for the music used in this kind of dramas.

Rewatch Value:
I can rewatch this all the time until they give me a Season 2!

This show was a wild ride from start to finish. The writers did a great job in story telling for this amazing show which I'm sure was difficult with the back and forth between timelines and events changing, having to avoid obvious paradoxes along the way. I was riveted by this show. It was so intense the entire run. And while there were certain events I would have liked to have seen....well, it's a good thing I'm not the writer, because the scenes were perfect as written and more poignant than what I would have imagined. I also loved that the ending could possibly leave way for a sequel, and I would love it if they could bring back the three main actors to do it. But only if they could come up with another story as amazing as this one. It packed a lot of emotional punch.

The acting by our 3 main cast members was stellar. I thought that the boy that played a young Hae Young as well as the boy that played his hyung, Sun Woo have a bright future ahead of them. Little Hae Young was heartbreaking. The main villain was believably evil. One episode in particular had me yelling at him and on the edge of my seat in suspense.

I really liked the theme song and will be searching for that, as it just had a haunting quality about it that I enjoyed.

Even though some of the suspense may be gone now, I still think this show could be re-watched and still enjoyed nearly as thoroughly as the first time.

Be careful, if u watched signal, your expectation for other k-dramas will be higher! This is really a masterpiece, everything is so detailed, not boring at all, very emotional and full of suspense.. it requires your brain to keep thinking while watching it.. definitely a very very very well written drama, the cast, the writer and director deserve Oscar for this! Everything is just perfect.

Ugh.. i am ashamed that i have rated other k-drama with high points, but when i watch this drama, it just surpassed all my imagination. I Couldn't believe that a TV series could this damn good that i need to edit all my ratings for other k-dramas (i was too generous for ratings), now i have edited all other k-drama ratings after i watched this one coz this one is definitely an 11 out of 10!

i highly recommend this drama, of course, but again, be careful , the feeling while watching other drama will not be the same again.

From the beginning, the story is already strong, my emotion is like mixed together. I feel really sad without being manipulated, true from the bottom of my heart. When i feel angry, i also feel so angry, i cannot control my emotion when i watch this, there is no break at all, everything is so tense until my brain want to explode. My heart pain when i watch the story about detective park's brother. This is really a beautiful drama. :,)

This is one of those dramas that hooks you from the very first episode. Even the opening theme is different, almost reminiscent of True Blood in it's creepy, off sound. The actors were very well cast, and they delivered an excellent performance. The story kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. It was one of those dramas when I didn't want to watch the final episode because I didn't want it to end, and yet I couldn't help myself, I had to know what happened. I'm still scratching my head. I would love to see a sequel, although I'm sure that isn't in the plan.

I have gushed about this drama to everyone I know, and I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a romcom, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a melodrama, this isn't the place. If you are looking for suspense, mystery, a little bit of gore and realistic surrealism that keeps you saying, ""Oh my god!"" until the very last moment, this is the show for you!

I LOVED this drama. This is coming from a huge fan of suspense/crime/romance. Signal is one of those dramas that I would recommend to anyone who's a big fan of suspense and crime. At first, I was quite confused as to what was going on, but the more I watched it, the more I got into it. This drama was one of those dramas that you couldn't stop watching even if you wanted to.

Story: The story was amazing. It's about a special crimes unit solving past cases and how it affects the past and future. The cases are also very interesting to see as to how they solve it and how it actually affects the past. And also future.

Acting: The acting was AMAZING. I give props to Lee Je Hoon because of his acting skills. Oh my gosh his acting skills were ON POINT. Just by watching him, it gave me so many different emotions and feelings like they were everywhere as I watched the drama. Kim Hye Soo's acting was also very good because some of the scenes that she was in made me very annoyed but if they let the watcher get annoyed that means the acting was amazing. Jo Jin Woong's acting was also very good because of the way he showed the character's emotions and stuff. Like he developed the character so well.

Music: I didn't really pay attention much to the music because of how good the scenes were and all, but when I did hear it, they were very good. The music made the scenes look even realer and much more feel in the action parts of the drama.

I highly recommend this drama to anyone who LOVES suspenseful dramas, action dramas, crime dramas, or even just a little bit of romance in them too.

I actually marathoned this series in what I think was about.. Less than 3 days? It's very gripping and you just find yourself keep watching to find out what's happening next.

Its plot is unpredictable. As viewers we've seen enough dramas to try and predict what would happen after a certain development of an event. But the drama plays to none of the usual plot trappings. In a way, its storyline takes on a concept that is extremely unique to its own.

Granted the fantastical element of the story leaves you pondering about the logical conundrums of such a scenario. But the drama makes no apologies for it, in fact the characters themselves recognise the absurdity of the situation. What the drama does well is not overexplaining how it came to be, but putting out the premise for the viewer to accept it as it is, and then utilising the walkie talkie seamlessly as a plot device.

The drama draws you in with the storylines and all its characters. Acting was absolutely fantastic. Even Jang Hyeon Seong, the great dad in TROS, plays such a convincingly despicable character he was thoroughly repugnant. All in all, I would say this is an extremely well executed drama, ties up everything it's supposed to tie up without it feeling rushed. (I for one feel the ending was appropriate for a 16 episode series, though I also do entertain the possibility that they could have extended it to 20 episodes and truly conclude the entire story once and for all, but of course we don't know what the writers' intentions are). You can't really stop watching once you start, so brace yourself. Will really like to commend the scriptwriters and actors for such a great job done. It was very a enjoyable ride indeed.

This is probably the best K-drama I've seen so far. Best plot,cast,music,screenplay,direction and what not!!?? The chills it gives during each and every scene is so deep that the feeling is still lingering in my heart. Each and every time you expect one and what happens is completely out of your thinking. The bond between Lee Jae Han and Park Hae Young is so beautifully portrayed. Not too much into love, but still the scenes which depicts the bond between Lee Jae Han and Cha Soo Hyun is lovely! The way the director deals with the 4 cases taken for the support is also too good. Even though its a peak thriller, it makes you smile at times!! If you think you are the one who craves for a spine chilling thriller, Signal is for you!!

This review may contain spoilers
Started this review with reading through a few more negative ones with the intention of sharing my dissapoinment about this series ,while checking other's observation too. I was surprised by the numerous negative points I had previously missed. First of all I decided to watch this series not because the overly positive response that it got but because I was curious about how well the story will transfer to the screen and how it will end all its lines. The story was quite intriguing, hearing about it first from one of my friends who highly praised the series.
Coming with a huge expectation of course I was let down by the first few episodes, it was getting harder to continue but having been made a promise to myself to finish it first before any bashing I completed it. I felt like the story was all-over-the place and started to hate one of the main characters to the core. I love crime thrillers and stories about serial killers but the forced melo really ruined it for me. Detective Cha's character was simply to annoying to bare and without any real chemistry between her and Detective Lee, her obsession only made her seem like a complete nuisance. I would've been happier and the story would've been much more convincing if she had never been ressurected from her death. But enough about her. Other cons.: the depicting of the whole police force as overly stupid or corrupt, the backgrounds of the villains were never truly explained or even mentioned, the ressurected victims were not really used to their full potential, the ending was missing its climax, the crime aspect of the plot felt like it never got its chance to shine.
One of the pros defenitely would be the soundtrack, I loved all the bgm music and the songs truly matched the whole aura of the series. I liked the transmission-concept however it could have been more defined and perfected . The never-giving-up spirit conveyed by detective Lee was heartwarming. The introduction of serial killings was a good choice to gain more interest but that faded away really quickly because it was wrapped up hurriedly. However the killing scenes were topnotch. The cinematography was especially mesmerizing, how they altered the colours and the camera movements when they were in the past or returned to the future was particularly intriguing. The acting was on point but that was expected by seeing the cast list, still praiseworthy.
To sum up it was hard to continue at times but it was worth to watch. I cannot call it a masterpiece because of the reasons mentioned above however I would recommend it, just not get your expectations up to high.

What can I say to give this drama credit? There's nothing, nothing.
It was beautifully executed from the filming to the script to the attention to details. It never left you leaving an episode without wanting to come back.
The cast my god the entire cast was brilliant. The leads the good and the bad were exceptional in their roles.
The side characters were never just written in as fillers they made the story what is was.
It teaches us so many lessons the top two I learned were
- Never give up ever, you can change the future and that you can't change everyone's fate you can't save everyone.
It definitely had many other touching quotes like every handcuff is worth 2.5 liters of tears.
It showed that through corruption there are those to succumb and become dogs to the ones in power and there are those who fight back so that the innocent won't be hurt.
I highly recommend this drama for those of you who are in a drama slump or are into crime and mystery dramas.

I would like to apologize first for any mistakes I make during this review(it's my first)!!

First this is my 3-4 korean drama that I watched so I was blown away to say the least! The cases were real cases the script was made with the bereaved families in mind that is something that all the people that watch this drama should have present because this is what makes this drama great!

Acting- The acting was surreal for me. I could relate to the main characters meaning when they were angry,happy,sad I had the same feelings that in itself is something an actor should aspire to make the audience feel like a part of the story only then they will never forget that story! They did that and then some!

Script- The script as I said above was made on real cases of course that doesn't mean that the drama is real but that the scriptwriter wanted people not to forget the past and to learn something from that. I have no words in my vocabulary to describe the script for all of them will fall short!! I can only encourage you to watch the drama yourself!

Directing- The directing kept the scriptwriter's wishes to make the drama bearing in mind the families of those that died and it was an incredible ride of emotions! Again no words can describe it!

Music- I will be very honest I was so engrossed in the drama that I could barely hear any music at all only when the episode ended I could hear it! So I rated it 9,5 because of that!

Overall- UNBELIEVABLE!! But even that is not a good enough word!

I truly hope you watch this drama!!!

This is my first review but it felt like I needed to do one after finishing the last chapter.
Signal is a very good drama, the kind of drama you feel compelled to recommend to a non drama viewer. Not because it's seems American, but because its ""goodness"" it's beyond nationality or language.
In short:

What I liked:
-Most of the acting and their script is great, you feel the characters, and they feel like real human beings; with real human reactions.
-The plot; and how all the sub-plots connect into one big story which slowly unfolds.
-How the fantastic element is inserted, the ""rules"" they come up to (you'll understand this when you see it), but it doesn't feel ""cheap"" and it could've been.
-The direction and production is very good for a TV product.

What I didn't like:
-Sometimes the editor/director feels like he has to over-explain some things that are pretty clear, so you'll find yourself re-watching some scenes from time to time (it's not a big problem, but it's something to mention).
-The acting overall is very good but, OMG Kim Hye Soo ""surprised face"" is... well, very bad =P

If you're looking for romance, there's almost none, so this is not the drama for you. But, if you're looking for a good story, with good and unexpected twists, good characters and acting with high production values, this drama is for you.
Also, the violence is there, but it's not excessive, and for those who complain about the ending; let me tell you that it's consistent with the rest of series, you'll not feel disappointed.

This drama is absolutely engrossing. It is well made and the acting are solid from the main to the supporting actors. From start to finish I am amazed how the plot and storyline weave into one big picture seamlesssly and how it manage to tug at the emotions of the viewer. I am not a sentimental person, but. I cannot help myself being drawn into the emotional turmoil of the characters and ended up sort of feeling empty after I have finished the show. I hope there is a sequel, but, I am equally complacent with the ending if there is none.

I strongly recommend this series to all.

It's been a wonderful year for dramas. Especially Korean. There's been some ambitious shows that have truly broken barriers for the stereotypes of K-dramas and the stories they “usually” tell. K-dramas have been slowly advancing and doing unique concepts and actually (to me) trying more year by year. That's not to say there haven't been the usual stuff that makes me weep as it gains more popularity over better written works. (Examples being Doctors and Beautiful Gong Shim—which started out strong and then self destructed—to Cinderella and the Four Knights and Love in the Moonlight, there's more but these where kind of my big disappointments.) Signal quickly gained hype and popularity—normally a warning sign for me. Upon finally caving and watching it—especially after finding out it was inspired by one of my favorite movies Frequency—it quickly became apparent that this show was beyond worthy of all the hype. In fact, it was soooooo good that I feel unworthy.

No really. I savored this thing. I started watching May 19, 2016 and dragged it out until November 10, 2016. Yes, Signal was so good that I did find myself binge watching episodes numerous times, but it was so fabulously wonderful that I would gain control of myself control so that I could savor.

The writing. Oh, my gosh the writing! Never have I given (especially now that I've got my rating scale down) a first episode a 10. Ever. Not even my favorite shows like Healer, Faith, I Hear Your voice, and etcetera. They've always had to work to lead up to that 10 rating. Signal nailed it on the first episode and I still have no words to describe that absolute bliss that accompanied such heights of writing. I don't think I'll ever be able to explain it. Though here is what I titled my episode one review: ""One of the best first episodes I've ever seen.""

The writer perfectly balanced the small arcs of crime cases to the larger arcs. We're introduced to the concept of these walkie-talkies (aka radios) connecting two cops through time. Using a seemingly inconsequential kidnapping case to pull them together and start them working together. There are some real life events pulled in and given their own twists. Most known is the famous Hwaseong serial murders, which I had heard would be the focus way back when word of the initial concept had dropped. So I was a bit baffled as to where the show would go, and stay strong, without the case. The writer is so confidant and amazing that the arc of the Hwaseong serial murders is epic! Holly cow amazing, but the other cases and the bigger arcs never falter after. In fact, the big arcs—sorry guys I'm trying not to spoil a thing especially if you haven't seen Frequency—are never far away. They're constantly being hinted and developed. So by the time its the forefront and focus of the show I was practically foaming at the mouth.

Even better is that the actions of the characters have consequences. Big ones. Even if they're willing and strong enough to try and change the past, lives are altered in the present and past. People who lived before die, others who died lived. Would that have happened if they hadn't intervened? There are many scary moments when you don't know if things will actually be changed, and moments of hope when you pray that they will be.

The actors did a wonderful job. Hands down some of the best acting I have seen in a drama and the proof of their abilities is in how many dramas these actors have landed since Signal. Performances by the leads and supporting characters never faltered. Their interactions are so real. Even the guest roles to play the victims and criminals did flawless work. If you asked me about any of the characters I'd probably have nothing but praise for them, even if it was the old lady collecting card board and garbage in one scene. All three leads did such an amazing job that I don't have words for them. They're just awesome.

The set designer and wardrobe/makeup people hit it on point. You didn't need the years flashed across the screen to know whether you were in the present day or the past. It was so consistent that I hope Signal wins tons of awards for that alone.

The music is well done and I really love the opening OST for the drama—even if it smacks heavily of another shows OST from America. Hey, it fit Signal perfectly. I thought the OST was well done and fit the show well. A nice balance for a show that spanned two time periods.

Signal's biggest ambition is that addresses the corruption of not just cops, but society. Addressing that those with power and money do get away with things, but if the people stay true and never give up justice can be served. There's many other topic addressed here as well. The blaming of rape victims, the emotions of the criminal and the victim. The consequences of actions and many more ideas.

The emotional impact and cleverness of the Signal still astounds me looking back and I made sure before I even finished it that I owned it for future rewatching. Director Kim Won-Suk truly surprised me, and I look forward to future dramas. Writer Kim Eun-Hee is officially on my stalk list! Future dramas will be a must and I've already started looking into the older ones. Overall I would say that Signal is a drama everyone should see. Especially if you've been starved for something that isn't just another stereotypical K-drama. Even if you are one who only likes the stereotypical drama fodder, try this! Because Signal is not only one of the best dramas I've seen, it's one of the best TV shows I've seen.

My review/words will never be adequate enough to describe or praise Signal. But I had to try.

I rarely gave 10 in most areas as I did with Signal. Oh, Signal. Even the title is a bit of a plot giveaway. This crafty masterpiece is the meaning behind marathoning these episodes with endless cliffhangers. It is a well-executed series with actors that have not seen before in my eyes. These actors are pure talent and not only this, the series have excellent background music that gives you eerily feelings in between scenes.

You hardly see dramas that keep you going from episode to episode to the end before you know it. This drama does just that! I think this drama is a gem in the hidden mine, waiting for those to discover it, to know it's true beauty.

I rarely watch psychological and suspense crime dramas that are not top-rated. I am always afraid to be disappointed by the time the end episode is released. This is where I normally drop the dramas and cannot go back after a long period of time, if lucky. However, this series left me on a note wanting more. I have to tell you all, you will not be bored with any of these episodes and you will feel like each episode in this drama feeds your craving &quot;just right&quot;. Not the Got7 way.

If you find the first episode not intriguing, do not let go of this drama. I guarantee you that by the next try, you will be forever hooked and on-edge.

BEST KOREAN SUSPENSE CRIME DRAMA OF 2016!

Nothing more, nothing less.

This drama was a big surprise for me, for Korean dramas I have always watched romance dramas but because many people recommended this drama and talked so many good things about it I decided to give it a try. And I was pleasantly surprised with its story and characters.

Signal is a detective/suspense drama that focuses on a newly created police department “the cold cases unit” and how its profiler suddenly finds an old seeming less useless radio (walkie talkie) but starts getting these weird transmissions from that radio. Then he discovers the transmissions come from a detective of the past, who strangely has a connection to the cold cases the unit is investigating. The profiler keeps the transmissions of the radio a secret but uses them to solve the cold cases. But soon he’ll discover there is more than meets the eye. These transmissions are only the beginning of uncovering a big conspiracy and all the secrets involved in it.

It really is a well made suspense drama, the cases are well planned and they interconnect very well with the scenes form the past. Overall the stories from the past and the present are well connected, at first you get a little confused because they change from past to present from one scene to another. But all the old scenes are filmed with this sepia color that helps you identify which is which.

The main 3 actors of this drama are all new to me this is the first time I’ve seen them act. They did an amazing job, their characters were well developed and all the emotions portrayed were believable. I only had a little problem with the female detective’s acting on the past, she was the exact opposite of the strong and reliable detective from the present.

The only bad point for me is the paradox of changing the past and the repercussions it could have in the present, I was ok with the explanations and the way they handled it until the final episodes where I think they kind of contradict the premise they were using in the previous episodes.

As many others had done I’m also recommending this drama, watch it and write your own conclusions on the cases and the time paradox. And by watching you will also wonder how can a boy eating omurice can make you cry so much!

This is one of the best Kdramas of 2016. A good mix of reality and fantasy. Though the episodes seems interwoven, there a bits and pieces of stories within the whole story. Love how the writer was able to connect these to the main plot. The actors were all great especially Cho Jin Woong, a well deserved win of Daesang Award for this drama.... He was soooo great in the ""movie"" scene, he really made me cry. Highly recommended.

Being a mystery thriller genre fan, I went in with really high expectations seeing the 9+ ratings here and needless to say I am thoroughly disappointed! This drama had a great potential with an unique story line if it been had developed properly but somehow lost its way from the initial brilliant idea of communication from the past...

Actually there is no mystery or suspense for the viewers as from the 1st episode you are shown who the villains are and within first 2-3 episodes it only left me with frustration seeing how the characters are being so clueless even though people around them are so suspicious! It was a long wait till episode 16 for characters to actually figure out who was behind everything even though they knew how bad that particular person was! Seriously seriously frusrating, I must say!

This show is for the fans of drama that deals with social justice where everyone knows the villian, who is as usual highly powerful and corrupt individual but the hero who is a sincere underdog who preserves to fight against the evil and win the war the end. If you are a fan of this genre, then this drama is for you but if you are a mystery fan like me, then be prepared to be disappointed...
Even in the weekly cases there is no suspense as such, just police slowly, I mean really slowly trying to figure out the culprit who is again revealed to us right in the beginning of the episode! :(

Now coming to acting, everyone was ok ok even though I really didn't like the actor who played ML in the Past in certain scenes where I felt his acting was a bit odd even though I am not able to pinpoint the exact scenes...
His onscreen character too was not in sync like the character was fluctuating between moments of brilliance and moments of stupidity repeatedly. Because of this I skipped through many Past scenes and what I found was because the past had many filler scenes, I didn't miss anything even after skipping 20-30 mins at a time! Guess the show would have been better if it was for 10 episodes, then everything would have been more crisper.

The only thing I really liked about the whole show other than the overall idea of getting a radio transmission from the past that could change the present, was that the FL is realistically badass in the Present (2015 in the show) time. She may get hurt but she never failed to bounce back like a spring to kick some criminal's ass! It was totally commendable!
Also the fact the the Past ML encouraged her not be just a coffee serving girl to her seniors but to make her own stand against them like the actual detective she was, was a really good scene!

Overall a 5.5/10 for me.

This is one of the best crime dramas I've seen so far, the characters steadily grows and gets more likable each episode, except for the last few episodes where the main girl character got annoying, however her annoying-ness actually make sense in the story line and made the drama better. There were one or two plot holes I found however the plot hole made the ending to the drama better than the direction I thought it was going.

The music matched a drama very well, it created anticipation throughout the story and didn't overshadow the entire scene.

I think they couldn't cast better actors/actress to make the drama better.

I would totally re-watch the drama and would definitely recommend it to other people, but only to people who enjoy dramas with thriller and very little romance.

Just finished binge watching this drama! And oh my, what a ride it was!

Both writer and director did a wonderful job creating a suspenseful and brain-twisting drama! A story with multiple time lines isn't easy to portray without everything ending up being too paradoxical. This drama was deep and interesting on so many levels!

COMPLEX AND ENGAGING STORY: As a viewer you feel emotionally engaged and connected with the story. You wonder, think and feel together with the protagonists. Often I was left at the tip of my sofa/chair/bed anticipating what will happen next and how the detectives will solve a case. Clues are not given immediately and there are enough twists here and there to keep the story suspenseful and interesting. As a viewer we live and think together with the protagonists on screen. Heartbreaking scenes alert!

EYE FOR DETAIL: There are so many subtle clues and details given in every episode that it feels like I need to re-watch the whole series again in order to fully grasp what was actually going on at certain moments. There are also a lot of references to aspects of contemporary Korean society: such as the fascination with celebrities who are dating or not, (unsolved) rape cases, corruption related to hierarchical relationships, etc. which added to the level of realism of this drama. For people who understand Korean, some references are really subtle and make you giggle. (I particularly remember the scene when one of the protagonists asks scoffingly whether the other likes keobchang (pork intestines) or not, however the subtitles just translated it as 'grilled meat'. Some things do get lost in translation. ;))

SUPERB ACTING: Not once I had the feeling that a character wasn't believable. Still now I believe there is still a badass detective such as Soo-Hyun and a moral hero like Jae Han somewhere out there in the real world fighting for what's right! The protagonists can make you laugh, cry and feel utterly frustrated!

I would strongly recommend Signal to everyone who's looking for great story-telling with a high sense of realism embedded in a ever-so gripping and intense drama!!! Why are you still reading this?! Go, Go! ;)

I'm going to put out this disclaimer that I do not usually write reviews. I could not stop myself this time. Signal delivered. I always feel ambivalent about watching such a highly rated drama because either it delivers or its extremely overrated and I end up disappointed. Signal is definitely and exception. Its just a down right good story. It's not just for one age group. Signal drew me in from the get go. It was funny, suspenseful, and heart wrenching all at the same time. I've never felt so vested in dramaland characters before. Although signal is pure fiction it was every bit ""real."" The actors were outstanding in their portrayals of ""real"" people. Sometimes dramas are cliché or unrealistic or at times can't be taken seriously. I tend to lean toward romantic dramas but this piece was so much more fulfilling than most of the dramas I've watched.

Story wise an absolute 10. There were many unanswered questions but not in a frustrating lose ends way but a your imagination is the limit way. And there is a certain beauty in that.

The music moved me again and again. Rewatch value is the only thing I can't give this a 10 in. I feel I watch it to much and come to know every twist and turn it will lose some of its appeal , plus I'm not sure my heart could handle it. But every so often most definitely. I would and will recommended this to anyone. And I will watch this again.

Ah, Signal, how shall I describe thee? This is definitely my favourite Korean drama, though in all fairness, it's not much of a ""drama"" per se. The first thing I noticed was that the production value was through the roof; most of the episodes feel like watching an hour long movie, somewhat like the early episodes of Sherlock. The plot is very well structured, and the pacing is excellent, with not a dull moment or any overly long arcs in sight.

As far as the main cast is concerned, all the performances are above and beyond the level that one would usually expect from a Korean drama, especially the protagonist and deuteragonist (Lee Je Hoon and Kim Hye Soo). Cho Jin Woong also delivers a strong and memorable performance as old time detective Jae Han (you'll get it when you watch it). Many of songs that make up the OST are haunting and unique, with relatively deep lyrics. Honestly, it may seem like I am just biased at this point, but I am the type of person who reads the summary for most boring K-Drama episodes and fast forwards through them the moment a hint of something typical appears, and I watched, and relished, every moment of Signal.

The ending was somewhat ambiguous, even leaving open the possibility of a sequel, though I doubt any of us are going to be that fortunate in the near future...but here's hoping.

I normaly do not write reviews but I had to now. I Just finished the serie and I am angry I watched till the end for this.
I personally think of what is the point of having an transmission of past to the future If you still going to mess up everything and people die the same. What is the point !!!.
I like it because the corruption and injustice is realistic , but come on give me Some hope ! !!!
If the world we live in is like this give me at least Just a little hope. I am glad they caught one of the bad guys at the end, but what I was hoping for the whole show is that Detective Lee would finally live His love with Cha . Man this woman been waiting for freakin 15 years, is not 5 nor 10 but 15 years ! What hurt me the most was that Park's brother still died ! What is the point of the radio !
If the show wants to show what happens in real life that is good but dont put the radio transmissions in it because it is distracting and you hope that someone Will be saved , there was little saving and alot of mess up .
I could had taken everything If at least in the end scène Park , Cha and Lee would actually see Each other but noooooooo. I was waiting for that the whole serie but noooo.
Again I was frustrated . But now that My anger is gone I Really appreaciate the values it gaves
I wachted this because I thought it would be awesome like Tunnel who is btw the best serie I wachted love love love ! but not at all.
But overall i loved the acting of the main characters was great, the story and the concept confuses me.

Watch if you like unfinished ending
It's useless to watch all episodes to see ending like this. some of the k dramas have habits to not have proper ending. If you are 100 percent sure that you will make 2nd season then it's good otherwise don't give false hope to a fans. We didn't know either that minister got punished or not for his all the crimes. I remember another k drama named ' VAGABOND' that ended middle of the story. I don't know if they were short of money or never think of further story.
Anyway for signal I would like to say this is slow many scenes are repeated all the time. it feels like there is always more screenplay in k dramas for wrongdoing by bad guys and when it comes to their punishment it's difficult to find it.

Signal is not only the best Kdrama I've ever seen (out of 206). Signal is not just the best Kdrama of all time. Signal is a paradigm shift. Signal tells the world loud and clear: South Korea is making TV shows as good as the USA or the UK, as good as anyone. Period. The bar has been raised, South Korea. I expect more from you now. I expect more Signals.

I don't know what else I can add about this drama. It is a perfect 10 in all categories. Heck, even the soundtrack is the best I've ever heard - perfect atmospheric music for every scene.

This drama has no flaws. It is nearly as good as the best American TV I've seen. So, what else can I say?

I guess this. I'm about to take the 205 other Kdramas I've completed and change their ratings down 1/2 point so that Signal can stand alone at 10. No other drama, not even White Christmas, deserves to stand at 10 with Signal.

This drama is one of my most favourite ones but it's not for everyone. I can understand that some people might not like it because it's not a typical k-drama, however, it's totally worth of your time.

The story is very well written and the plot is very interesting. It had little bit of evrything but it is mainly crime and mystery but as a fan of crime series I really liked the story . The whole story kept me more and more curious as all the secrets were step by step revealed. After the end of each episode I wanted to know so badly what will happen next.

What also is amazing about this drama is the acting. The cast did such a great job in portraiting their characters and their emotions, especialy Lee Je Hoon. The cinematography was also well done and I could feel all their emotions through the screen. I'm sure that I'll watch Signal again in the future and I'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it when I watched it for the first time.

If you like crime and mystery you should for sure watch it right now.

I'd like to start off by saying that this drama changed my life. Not literally, but it's made me think a lot about equality and justice in the real world, and how f*cked up it is that people in power can make the world bend at their will. Anyway, that's why I think it's so damn good, because it forces you to reflect on that... and it's hard. It's really hard, but yeah. Anyway, off to the review!!

Story:
11/10 tbh. Actually, 99/10. This story was very well-written. What I loved most about it was how it unfolded. Everything wasn't revealed at the start, each episode gave you new clues into what the ""real"" story was and how the minor plots that you'd been exposed to thus far related to it. Also, it keeps you guessing. You never quite know what something is going to lead to, and I don't mean in the sense of not knowing who the criminal in a case is, but more so in the sense that you don't know how a certain case ties in with another. It's one of those series that you honestly can't draw out; you have no choice but to finish it in a few days (heck, I finished it in two) because you have to know what happens next. Also, I like how the writer tied in the fantasy aspect. I'm not a fan of the fantasy genre, but it was incorporated quite well into the story I think. There are definitely questions I still have that bother me about how it all worked, but I think it really added to the overall impact of the story. Also, this story is an emotional clusterf*ck. I have never felt so much pain in my heart lol. Less to do with characters dying and more to do with what I mentioned earlier, having to face the fact that life can be so unfair.

Cast:
I actually gave the cast a high score not because I loved the protagonists, but because I'd really like to commend the antagonists for playing their roles well. There are.... so many people in this drama that you will despise, lol. Be prepared. But I think the fact that their acting is so convincing that it makes you want to cry angry tears at the fact that such a character exists... I mean, that's good acting. So, yeah, the antagonists were WAY too good at their roles haha. But I didn't hate the protagonists, I thought they were okay. It's just that I feel like even if they were replaced by other actors and actresses, I'm not sure if there would be much change, if that makes sense? THAT being said, the one character I adored was Lee Jae Han, played by Jo Jin Woong. That man's performance was... perfect. The role was made for him. There are so many scenes that I still remember crystal clear because the acting was just so on point. Like, he embodied his character and gave a damn good performance. There is a reason he is on my favourite actors list now, because he was just that great.

Music:
I thought the music wasn't bad. They picked the right tracks for the appropriate moments, i.e., suspenseful music during scenes of suspense. I don't remember anything particularly outstanding, but it wasn't a bad job.

Overall:
I actually would rewatch this, but with someone else. I would watch it 5 more times if I could watch it with someone else. It's honestly such a great drama. It captivates you from the first episode, and it really will make you reflect on what present society is like. Please do watch this if you're putting it off, because you will 100% not regret it.

I've always loved murder mysteries and crime dramas but to date, I haven't been able to find an asian crime drama series exciting, which is ironic since I love many animated* detective series specifically those from Japan such as Detective Conan, Files of Kindaichi, etc. For live action, I tried watching The Snow White Murder Case movie (Japan), the Galileo series (Japan) and Talvar (India). Unfortunately, while they had some interesting parts here and there, they turned out to be boring overall, with disappointing characterizations, misplaced drama and dragging plotlines. Thankfully, Signal broke the trend and I now see an exciting new world of asian crime drama to explore :D



Signal may not be the best murder mystery series but it is certainly one of my favorites. What's more, it manages to add a supernatural element where characters from the past and present communicate to solve crimes, which gives things a unique twist. I undersand this sort of thing has been done before (see Hollywood movie ""Frequency"") but Signal ups the ante, makes the theme all its own and gives it a Korean flavor that I can't help but applaud the writer for putting it all together.



The experience is like watching a crime drama, with mystery after mystery being solved by veteran detective Cho So Yun (refreshingly strong but vulnerable- can't help but compare her with the inefficient female counterpart from Galileo) and profiler Park Hae Young, with the help of a character from the past - detective Lee Jae Han (who is now one of my favorite kdrama characters); the result is fun, exciting and a bit tragic.



The series does a good job of letting you know when the scenes are from modern time vs. past time and the scenes from the late 80's and early 90's looked genuine and authentic. I wouldn't say that Signal is a scary show, but it certainly had its fair share of atmospheric, eerie moments. All the characters had good chemistry and I liked every member working in the 'unresolved cases' crime unit. The main villain was despicable but I find that kdramas do a good job in making you hate the villains/antagonists. This one was no different in that I wanted to reach out and slap him in the face, repeatedly.



My only complaint was that there were times when both Park Hae Young and (to a lesser extent) Cho So Yun would take too long to react to a shocking piece of news when they'd hear it. It would usually happen at a suspensful moment when it was critical for them to react quickly, so it got on my nerves a bit since I was worried for their characters at those times! This wasn't a deal breaker for me, and I thing Signals advantages far outweigh whatever flaws it has. I think the difference between asian crime drama (using Signal here as the reference point) and the American/English ones I've seen is that the former tends to be overemotional. It works in context though, and I like the fact that I know I'm watching a korean melodrama* as well as a murder mystery.

I’ve taken a big break from dramas and started watching this recently on a whim. I had already watched a couple episodes in the past but dropped it because i felt the cold case plot in the first couple episodes was very simplistic and one dimensional. That Is the criticism I give of this drama. The smaller cold case sub plots are not great. The villains are very one dimensional and just frustratingly unbelievable. The police corruption moral plot line is very heavy handed. But if you get past this, the overarching time travel plot and relationships among the main characters is very strong. It keeps you guessing and emotionally invested. So it’s not perfect but an entertaining watch after things get moving.

OVERALL
I advise you to see this drama, because it is very strong in terms of the emotions it brings.
The drama has flaws that could have been easily corrected, unfortunately this was not the case.

STORY
The pitch promises a science fiction story, but in the end, it's more of a story about cops, murders, with a strong emotional impact.
I think it's better this way, because the SF mechanism quickly reaches its logical limit, and has some inconsistencies. If the SF mechanism had been used more, these flaws would have been much more visible.
I don't like detective stories, and yet this one, rather dark, I liked very much. There were some twists and turns that surprised me.
I spotted a few small inconsistencies that were not very bad, in fact I don't even remember them.

ACTING
There's no comedy in this drama. The actors play at the first degree in the dramatic register. The quality of their performance makes the story believable and moving.

CINEMATOGRAPHY
Beautiful. The close-ups are very well used to make the emotions more intense.
The direction would be a flawless one, if there wasn't a huge flaw, which is related to the editing.
Scenes from the past: the images are distorted and contracted. It's very ugly and makes the action unreadable. Worse, the actors' acting and their emotions are purely slaughtered. This flaw, however outrageously obvious, could easily have been corrected during editing, using another non-invasive process to signal a scene from the past. Unluckily, these scenes are very numerous, and are therefore a disaster for the drama.

MUSIC
Songs: I don't like OST songs, however they have a style that fits the story perfectly.
Background Music: The team of musicians is my favourite and has produced soundtracks of incredible quality on other dramas. So the music on Signal is very good.
First, this piano theme, composed by Jung Se Rin :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtel_ST7GGU
A list of some good (even excellent) background music I could find:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcGRr3VsvQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goU1o5MCHs0
I advise you to listen to the disc, because as youtube removes the contents, there are probably other good musics that I couldn't report here.

REWATCH
This drama can be revisited without any problem. Maybe I'll see it again, but I'll let a few years go by, so I can forget about it for a while.

This review may contain spoilers
Is ""Signal"" a masterpiece?
Hi. This is my first review. The reason I am writing it, is that I am greatly disappointed by this overrated drama.
I started it cause I read so many good reviews. Man, that was not true for me. I am still confused, why viewers praise it so much. I mean why? I really don't get it. Good acting ok, yes. By two out of the three leading actors. I hated the female lead, but I will come to that later. Good cinematography ok. But other than that? A messy plot, a messy scenario, too much illogical stuff going one, plus a stupid ending, with too little conclusion , too much suffering with inadequate retribution. Hell, why did this guy had to go through all these? What was this ending, really? I honestly ask you, did you all like it and were satisfied by it? Really? I am just shocked. Cause I felt betrayed and disappointed. Let me just write you a list with everything I didn't like in random order. Cause I let two months pass after watching it, to see if I will calm down. But no. I didn't.

1. The actress they chose, not a good choice. Bad casting, to start with. I didn't like her. The past tense of her, being naive, idiotic etc enraged me. Ok that was the part you say. They shouldn't picture her like this. I disagree. Why should she be like this? Why couldn't she be clever from the start. Inexperienced still but clever. And the actress, played this part, terribly. It didn't fit her. She couldn't convince me. Acting kind of sweet and innocent, didn't fit her. It felt just like she was trying too much, but with no result.
2. The radio element. Bad choice. So, although the two male leads were connected in the past, he finds the radio by a coincidence?? Ya, right.... This is a joke. And they could speak for only one minute??? And it was the same radio item that they both had? The same machine? And it was working at present without batteries??? Hahaa well that was the scifi element mentioned. Too many inconsistencies.
3. All these corrupt cops. Dang. There were too many.... My nerves....
4. Was justice served? Hell, no. I waited and waited, just for the plot to become more annoying, and then, Lee Jae Han has noone to rely on, he has to give up everything, how he did it, with no money beats me, I don't get it. How he survived, I don't get that either. And why did he hide in a hospital? Was he ill or not? Anyway, even she didn't help him in the past. Why? Cause he didn't ask for her help. And how come, the bad guys didn't find him, so many years? Were he pressumed dead? Did he stage his death? They don't tell us anything. This was never explained.... Noone thought to keep an eye on his dad, and see if he is meeting his son.
4. The first episodes were too confusing, and they didn't gave us enough clues, the cases seemed not connected and I was asking myself why I was watching all these. I must confess that I dropped it after episode 4 for quite a while. I just couldn't get hooked.
5. Why did the hero became a policeman afterall? Who would do such a thing, knowing how corrupt they were. He thought he could find the bad guys? But we wouldn't if there wasn't this radio, right?
6. After all these misfortunes, his brother isn't saved.... I wanted to break everything. Those episodes were so annoying. That was what I was expecting and the reason I kept watching.The poor boy gets coldboodly murdered, because LJH gets delayed by her, spraining her foot, omg what a silliness. And he couldn't sent another one, or call the boy, and tell him to leave the house...... Ok LJH gets rescued but only for a while.... What? The script was a disaster. Why everyone liked it, again?????
7. The main villains were roaming around and lived their lives until the last episode, doing whatever they liked. That was unbelievable. And the rapists were NEVER punished. So, what was the message, the scriptwriter wanted to convey? That you should never give up? I totally believe that she failed her goal.
8. So, so much illogical stuff going on. The note LJH wrote. How did he know that Park Hae Yeong, will find it for sure? And why didn't he write the main story, the main case, the most crucial, in the top of the list? And so many other crazy stuff. I will only mention this. In the past LJH gets murdered. And she, his partner,, his coworker, that was in love with him, never succeeded in solving this case. Why? Cause she was stupid , that's why. And the few first conversations that the two men, have through the radio, why were they messed chronologically? The timeline was not consistent. I wanted an explanation. I deserved one. First, he is in the abandoned hospital rooftop, gets knocked on the head etc then while talking to PHY from the future, he gets shot. Ok wow, and I am thinking is that it? Was he a guest role? No, no, no. Silly me. They talk again and then it's some years before that. Why? How? Did she write the script urgently? Was she in a hurry, or she was just pushing everything by the hair , just to be illogical, and hence intriguing, different, hence unique, well it was just pissing me off. Even in a series like this, I want you to convince me. I have seen Kairos recently. And it was written brilliantly. It didn't left me believing I am stupid. This one did. Or you are all jeniuses, that like it. I don't know anymore.
The two male leads were great. I respected them. And they were the only thing that kept me watching on and on. Also, the curiosity where all this was going ,and the need for justice. But I wanted that to happen in the past. I wanted so much that I didn't get. Justice for me would be, for his brother to live , the rapists to be punished, and Lee Jae Han's life not to be ruined. Maybe he would be safe, get a raise, and get married and have family with that idiotic police girl. In the past. Be happy. Ok that's too much, i know. Well just be alive and not hiding. That was one of the worst finales for me in a kdrama.

My Love-hate relationship
I really had mixed feelings about Signal.

It is a really popular show and the concept and cast are exceptional. I really can’t fault them.

But I didn’t like the pacing. A lot of people could get into the first episode but for me it was a real test of patience. It took me about three different attempts to g t past the first few episodes and when I did so I can say that my expectations were admittedly mixed.

The storyline had its triumphs and flaws. I mean every drama does I guess but Signal had me screaming at the screen at times and sobbing the next. Mixed.

Despite the rave reviews, I wasn't really sure whether this would be my cup of tea, as I tend to gravitate towards lighter Asian dramas, but once you hit the middle of episode one, you find yourself completely immersed in the world of Signal. This was so much more than your typical police/crime drama - despite the episodic formula, there was a bigger story to tell, and there was so much heart within it that it no longer felt you were just watching cold cases get solved.

Speaking of which - how much do I love that Signal used real cold cases and presented them to the viewer in a new light? So many cases go unsolved and you tend to forget the victims and their stories - despite the fact that it was heartbreaking at times seeing some of the cases unfold, it was a great reminder that we will never forget. The social commentary made in several of the cases was bold and refreshing - and I liked that even though it's not like the writers could solve the real cold cases, they could at least give the victims their turn at justice in a fictional world.

Story:
The writing in this was absolutely brilliant - it's so hard for police procedural dramas (especially one with a bit of a supernatural twist) to pull it off without significant flaws in logic, but I think Signal handled it very well. Not to say it was perfect - but all the cases were both compelling and still relevant to the main story. The director also played a huge role in telling the story - he emphasized the story telling side versus the crime solving, and because it added a very real, human element, it was beautiful to watch. Despite the lack of romance, the platonic relationships within the show were developed so well. Though the overall tone is heavy, there are still some great, warm moments that help to fuel you through the more depressing ones.

Characters/Acting/Cast:
Three cheers for the cast, who were absolutely phenomenal. The main three actors were given great characters as well, which is always the first step to success, but the performances were top notch. Yes, Lee Je Hoon did tend to overact in the beginning (and a little towards the end), but I still think he was fully able to show the conflicts within Park Hae Young. Jo Jin Woong was the star, and his bumbling but determined Jae Han was such a wonderful hero to have in a show where you weren't sure if justice could prevail. Kim Hye Soo deserves all the love in the world for essentially playing two characters, but still showing that they were the same person, just changed by time and circumstance.

Music.
There was never a moment where the music overwhelmed the scene - it was always a perfect match. And yes, a lot of the soundtrack was a little haunting, but it fit.

Signal is probably the most well done Asian police procedural show that I have seen, and I absolutely love that it has elevated the expectation of quality in this genre. I will say, though, that I rated it lower on rewatch value if only because I don't know if I can live through all the emotions again. If you haven't seen it yet, you need to!

This drama is pretty good for someone like me who loves criminal dramas. I watched the first 4 episodes while this was airing, but I don't know why I paused it for a while and only continued watching when I got bored. The cases and investigations are well thought of, probably one of the most brilliant cases in Korean Crime kdrama land (unlike Criminal Minds korean version lol) and the actors did well, oh wait... except for Lee Je Hoon. For a criminal profiler who supposedly understands how criminals' minds work, he's too panicky and it bothers me to watch him. In each case, he seems like he's going to have a heart attack. Especially he is acting next to Kim Hye Soo. The ending is somewhat hanging, but hey I heard there's going to be a season 2 anyway. So, I'll be waiting for that!:)

One of the best Korean crime drama I have ever seen
This drama is truly a gem. I cannot recall a time when I have experienced so many emotions watching anything. The crime solving was suspenseful, thrilling, and kept you on the edge of your seat. A lesson lied in each of the cold cases solved. Every decision made had a consequence. The acting of the cast was absolutely phenomenal. You will feel what each character felt. You will cry tears of sadness, guilt, anguish, despair, regret, and even relief. You just couldn't help rooting and hurting for characters like Detective Lee Jae Han. I must have cried in every episode because the acting and writing touched every corner of my heart. There were a good number of twists and turns to keep it refreshing and interesting too. And the ending was completely mind-blowing for me, I did not predict that. One of the best endings I have seen in Asian dramas. I don't know how I'll be able to get over this. This is a truly unforgettable experience. I highly recommend everyone to give this drama a try. You will not regret this!!!

As a big big biggest fan of thriller-detective genre who watched almost every investigation kdrama, i really can spot a good one. Signal left me speechless, I was soo into this drama. It's so thriling with good plots and nice plot-twists. Also the cases are based on real crimes and incidents i know, so it's more interesting. This show is a roller-coaster with lots of moments you'll be shocked and amazed. Not every investigation-detective movies or dramas can leave you this immersed. Truly great!

Mind-blowing crime thriller with a twist of time warp
This is one of the most outstanding crime, detective series I have watched. I love how there different stories told within the story itself. The cases actually has more depth than usual and actually stirs emotions. Unlike, most crime dramas, Signal didn't revolved around corruption only but more on the story of its characters so very good job on that.

Most of the times I find shows which has vintage feels to it confusing or boring but here I really appreciate how it takes us back to 1989 when I wasn't even born. The cinematography added that vintage feels that it won't be hard to tell which is the past and the present. The OST also complements the overall mood of the show. The song has 90's feel to it which I surprisingly get addicted into.

My mind is still blown on how the story went and I admit although the ending is a bit confusing for me, I really enjoyed the journey of watching each drama. All characters are really interesting and their chemistry on screen is superb. My time is definitely worth it. Thumbs up to the Kingdom screenwriter who wrote such an amazing story. The elements of the story like the time warp, the cases, the slight humor, the emotions, it was risky to be put together because it can end up a disaster but this one stayed consistent from start to finish.

I don't really re-watch heavy dramas and crime thriller because the excitement is no longer there 2nd time around as I know what happened already. But if there's one thing I can assure, the story is really worth it. If you're a crime thriller seeker and loves emotional dramas, this a very good recommendation. Heads up to those who doesn't like vague ending though as this drama has an open-ended finale.

I'm gonna be objective with this review

STORY: The story is about 2 different cops from different timeline, connected by a single walkie-talkie. Once they finally realized this is happening for real, they decided to stop multiple unresolved serial murder with present evidence/locations of the murder to stop it from ever happening.

in all honesty, this is actually a great concept of a story that you rarely sees in asian drama..The story progress was smooth and develops very well towards the end. They used a lot of flashbacks from what they've already shown you in previous episodes but these flashbacks actually hide tiny details that you tend not to catch on your first watch...So if you're worried that it might bore you with all the flashbacks, don't...it's rather good execution..

ACTING - Superb acting by the man who plays Lee Jae Han, you actually buy it that how anyone of his character would react...Also the female lead officer did superbly as well...

there's multiple times that I actually felt it was real thing that is happening, not an act--like the person is actually experiencing the traumatic events/heartbreaking events for real...

OST - I have them in my music collection and I play them regularly even after almost 2 years...that should tell you how it was

REWATCH VALUE - You don't get bored with the story, the acting, music, the humanity that this drama brought... even if you're not interested in crime drama, you should give this a try

I've watched this drama from start to end 3 times so far, first time alone, second time with my dad which we watched until 4am and third time, with my mum whom always gets emotional in some of the scenes..

The only issue I had was with the ending...I thought it could've done better way..For me, it had barely any closure on the characters...some might argue it warrant a sequel, which I doubt it happening

This drama is a fine proof that a complex and messy time travel drama can be done right, just once.

The premise is simple on the surface - what if you could change the past, including your sad past? This crime thriller - indirectly time travel drama definitely surpassed similar drama in terms of its storyline, directing and acting. The story has more than meets the eye; how the past has more intricate connections than I could ever imagine - like peeling layers of an onion. Cha Soo Hyun (Kim Hye Soo) portrayed her character seamlessly; going back and forth between her past and future character. Lee Jae Han (Jo Jin Woong) turned the drama into a quite emotional journey as the story progressed. Get ready for a box of tissue, you are going to cry and rooting for Detective Lee Jae Han. Park Hae Young (Lee Jae Hoon) can be over dramatic sometimes - but it's minor. The classical and nostalgic OSTs are gems - hard to forget. After all, can a Misaeng production team gone wrong?

Korean version of ""Frequency.""

A 100x times better than the CW-adaptation (girl and her father in the past communicated via radio).

A lot of people loved Kim Hye Soo in her role as the main female lead but I really did not enjoy her acting in this. Her eyes are expressive for sure but too much eye acting made it feel she was a creepier character than she really was. I enjoyed the main male leads' acting in this

The wrap-up was satisfying. A show I've been consistently recommending to my non-kdrama watching friends as a hope to get them into watching kdramas!

It's usually really hard for me to watch shows with little to no romance but this show succeeded by making me watch it all the way through.

Overall, a really solid show if you are into great writing, execution, and acting. One of the most recommendable shows of 2016 for sure.

Not bad but not the best
I watched this drama because a lot of people keep saying that this is really good. I am usually watching a lot of thriller&mystery drama so i had high expectation regarding this. Sadly i was a little disappointed. The story was good but could be a better development of cases and characters. This drama has some original parts that until now i didn't found in another dramas so let's say it worthy to watch. For those who are not a fan of thriller&mistery drama, Signal, can be amazing and catch your atention.

At first, i never thought i would love this drama. I don't know anyone from the cast. But the storyline was different. It was a great drama cause of it's twists and turns. Makes you want to watch the next episode immediately. I was quite disappointed when this drama didn't win the best drama for 2016. Most of the people who didn't vote for this are only into love stories or romcom series. Anyway, hope many would watch signal and make recommendations.

Disappointing if you have a high expectation
I started watching Signal because it was directed by the Kim Won-Seok, and won Baeksang Art Awards for Best Drama in 2016, the same as My Mister in 2018. To be honest, the first few episodes got me hooked, but later on it became painful to finish and I almost quit (twice) in Ep 7 and Ep 15.

The production is excellent, granted, acting isn't really bad, just average, OSTs are not memorable, but the story is ruined by too much ""grandfather paradox"" from time traveling. We can never really apply logic to any time travel novels and movies, because it's not logical from the start.

What I like most about this drama is its key messages: injustice that always favors the riches, and ""never give up."" What I hate most, perhaps as much as illogical time travel, is the stupidities of protagonists--all three of them. At one point, they seemed smart, but then made a series of same stupid decisions. Well, that may be our nature to do something stupid repeatedly, but for a drama, I don't think it's fun to watch our protagonists succumbed to their stupidities too many times.

ok
i had a littleeee bif of high expectations on this because everybody just seems to love it so much. but well i tried not to really hv high expectations cus i always reset my mind again whenever i start a drama but this one, it was great, the premise was convincing and i was really curious during the first few eps. but then i started getting less and less engaged to the cases and the whole story itself. i waited for more explanation on the whole walkie talkie thingy but sadly it wasn’t enough for me. i could also think of some other ways that this drama could have been better like they couldve used the walkie talkie thingy more or smtg. but instead it just gets repetitive at times, with all the emotional wreck scenes that i find very slow and which ofc did not help at all. but uhh idk i was really into most of the cases eventho its nothing really mindblowing, but it was still okay and i still wanna know how the detectives solve it. i also felt thrilled too at some points as theres still some twists. the detectives, well sometimes theyre smart but sometimes their actions were very questionable for me. there were also a lott of flashbacks, like unnecessary ones. overall, dia tak best tapi tak teruk sangat but i feel like if i watch this a bit earlier, i couldve liked this more.

Don't mind me, I'm just adding Lee Je Hoon to my list of favorite actors, heehee.

Story: Kept me on my freaking toes, that's for sure. It would be a 10/10 for me if it didn't end on a cliffhanger (with no season 2 in sight, sigh). Otherwise, I don't want to say too much, as to not give it away. This drama is rated highly for a reason! If you like Crime/Investigation this should be at the top of your PTW. There were definitely some plot holes, but overall, for entertainment purposes, this drama hit the ball out of the park.

Acting/Cast: 10/10 hands down. Y'all had me crying and literally jumping out of my skin. It was fun to see some familiar actors in guest roles, such as Seo Ji Hoon and Lee Sang Yeob. This was my first Lee Je Hoon drama, but I've already added When Stars Land and Tomorrow With You to my PTW. He's also been indoctrinated into my massively accumulating cult of children from KDramaland. I will protecc with my life.

Music: So good! ahhhhh. My favorite OSTs were 나는 너를 (literally, I ... you) by Jeong Cha Sik, The Road by Kim Yuna and The One Who Will Leave by Inkey. The instrumentals were also great. Check out the album here: https://open.spotify.com/album/3XWPudsfSroRADDvNdWFei?si=JyyDCZN-QaK6ZKNx9D3lLw

Rewatch Value: Medium? Having just finished, I'm not in the mood to rewatch, but I can see myself rewatching in the future.

TLDR; bangers all around, found some new fave actors, if you like crime then add this to your PTW right now!

Finally I finished watching this drama after like 2 years procrastinating. I started watching the Japanese adaptation first before watching the original. Since the Japanese remake tend to be shorter in length than the Korean one, the pace for the former tend to be faster and some parts from the original may not be included in the remake. While at first, the slow speed at how the plot on the original may feel a bit draggy when compared to the remake, the plot later gradually pick up and revealed to be as engaging as the remake.

Having watched the remake first, I couldn't help noticing that some of the scenes was a bit more cleaned up in the remake. Regardless, it didn't mean the the original production wasn’t as good. Loved the casting, and Jo jinwong and Lee Jehoon made a very good pair for partners separated by 20 years between them. It was an unlikely partnership yet you can tell that they really can work together well as a team despite the barrier between them.

At first, I wasn't really taken to Jehoon as Park Haeyoung. Probably because he was in a period drama prior to Signal, the accent that he used to speak in the drama seemed jarring to me. But gradually that awkwardness in the way he spoke throughout the drama started to fade away and I was able to continue watching his scenes comfortably. Jehoon's acting started to grow on me due to his more recent works so it was really interesting to see his older works and him taking a role of a soft-spoken profiler. That aside, I was much more familiar with Jo Jinwoong's works so it was pretty enjoyable watching him play a righteous detective who tried his best to solve crimes.

Overall, I like how the entire plot had been written. Considering a lot of the cases shown in the drama was based on actual cold cases that happened in South Korea, it was an interesting story on how things like a transmission from the future may affect the outcomes of the past and change the future.

Heart-stopping from start to finish
I often have doubts about crime dramas due to alot of the unoriginal developments in storylines, but Signal could never. This was a drama that did NOT disappoint from start to finish - in fact, the heart-stopping end to every episode had me wanting more. The artistic camerawork, captivating nonlinear narrative, sophisticated direction, unique plot twists, compelling performance, highly-constructed alternate timelines, and last but not least, the suspense and anticipation was what made a drama like Signal worth watching. The drama was extremely unique and satisfying to watch in that it hinged on one specific object, and that object's ability to dictate the fates of the main characters, including every decision bound by it. Finally, the series also received widespread acclaim from audience and critics alike so what more can I say?

However, there were some things which I felt could've been better explained at the end. For example, I couldn't quite grasp how that walkie-talkie ended up sending radio transmissions in the first place, and felt disappointed that those mere last 3 minutes didn't allow the audience to really get a taste of satisfaction (despite the great outcome being deduced). Extending to include just some couple more scenes to see everything tie in such as having Park Hae-young and Cha Soo-hyun appear at Lee Jae-han's hospital door (so I could finally exclaim with joy and satisfaction the words: ""FINALLY/YES"" would have really been the cherry on top.

Storyline -- original screenplay, highly engaging, well-developed script;

Cast (supporting included) -- remarkable performance by each actor's ability to convey emotions and thoughts through eyes and body language effortlessly;

OST -- adapted from old school melodies (ie. pre-2010 Korean OSTs) was an unconventional move, but at the same time, so fitting as it only gave the drama way more character and depth.

I feel like I'm still very attached to this drama, the feels are still there. I love crime and detective stories and wow everything about this drama was great. It touched upon injustice and the hunger for power, I felt like it talked about stuff that I've never seen on a crime show such stuff going on within the police force. I love the plot and story behind it! They connected the past to the present so well and it flowed smoothly. The acting was amazing!

A good drama to watch, I enjoyed it. The storyline is good, I really love the beginning of the drama it was so thrilling and it makes me so intrigue especially the the first case thats just damn, having that timerI at the bottom really just heightened the thrill-ness. The cases are all good, it shows the team smart brain but there are still time that their actions were questionable but it was okay, i was dumb to think about that anyways. The pace was good but sadly towards the end it gets slower imo, there are too many flashbacks and because of that the last episode feels rushed :( the acting are amazingg no doubt. anyways, like it a lot!!

This is Justice 101 and if I was professor of the class everyone gets an A+, from the screenwriter to all the runners and behind the scene peeps. This drama is brilliant, thought-provoking, emotion-filled and all around entertaining.

The plot was simple but the storyline was unique. How the writer intertwined one criminal case after the other was flawless. Lead actors were all so fluid but that’s not to say that the supportive cast weren’t. I hated the chief police so much, every time he smirks my blood just boils over and the sweet dad conveyed all his emotions in his eyes and eyebrows, not too many words were needed to know he was in agony.

What’s not to like is more the question for me. The ending perhaps but, there really is no good ending for time travel stories so it’s not a deal breaker for me. Oh, maybe the teeny bit of the love story, felt a bit forced at the end however it was so minor I could overlook it :). In any case, I think it’s safe to say that this drama has littlest number of cliches usually imbedded in kdramas. Justice is served in this one so watch on fellow justice leagu-ers!

First and foremost, I must say that I am a romance drama fan so I was quite hesitated to watch this drama. And also I didn't know any of the casts to prompt me to watch it. I didn't quite remember why I watched this drama seriously..... But I never regret it:)

For the story...
1.) Amazing story line that hooks me up every episode. I literally lost sleep over this drama cause I was so so so curious about the story and those cliffhangers definitely left me crazy. The idea of the time-mismatching walkie-talkie is really interesting and is well used in this drama, although I hoped for a more detailed backstory of the walkie talkie to make it more completed.

2.) I also had some moments where I lost the story and couldn't follow the logic, then I rewind back so that I can get back on track. It happens for me so often but kinda feel that my IQ is increased after the drama hahaha...

3.) The ending was left half-open but definitely did not leave us hanging (maybe a teeny weeny bit). Probably for a sequel which I think is highly possible due to the nature of this drama. A pre-sequel is also possible to talk about the detailed backstory of characters as well as the walkie-talkie. Looking forward to it:)

For the cast/acting...
Casts is so goooood. Like I said earlier, I didn't know any of them when I started watching it but they totally impressed me so much. Totally. I was also very impressed by the acting of the minor characters and the sub story leads.

For the music...
I don't know the title to the opening track but it's really suitable for the drama, feels like the characters are walking back in time. Generally enjoyed the music as it was able to build up the intense at every climax.

Definitely a re-watchable drama or SEASON 2 pls. Binge watch it or lose your sleep haha..

Tunnel is similar and better - but this is good
7.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2016 South Korean crime drama with 16, 60 minute, episodes. Lee Je-hoon Kim Hye-soo and Cho Jin-woong. The story is inspired by the Hwaseong serial murders in Korea as well as other true crimes.

A newbie detective/profiler, Park Hae Young (Lee Je Hoon), finds a walkie talkie that is broadcasting through time from Hae Young's time of 2015 from 2000. Hae Young has been assigned to a cold case unit who is tasked with solving crimes where the trail of evidence has gone cold. It is more of a political move than any real attempt to solve the crimes in terms of the ""higher ups."" On the other end of the line is Lee Jae Han (Jo Jin Woong) who is able to get clues from Hae Young about crimes that ""occurred"" and change or prevent the events. Cha Soo Hyun (Kim Hye Soo) is a female detective who leads the cold case team. She knows Jae Han well as she was once a rookie on his team.

Spoiler 🚨 I liked this but what slightly ruined it for me was it ended very nebulously. Some like it when it ""leaves you to wonder"" - I am not one of them. I understand there MAY be a second season but without that being a certainty the ending just didn't do it for me. I liked all the characters, the suspense and cases, but the ending is what really determined how I felt about this overall. Many really liked this - it rates very high. A lot of folks rate this higher than Tunnel. I preferred Tunnel. That had similar intrigue and was based on some of the same real murder cases. However, that story for me was more logically flowing and the ending felt complete. Worth the watch but be aware the ending is not neatly tied up.

I loved this drama so much! It was very addicting so I watched 16 episodes in only 2 days, crazy! They cast very good actors and the plot had me on edge the whole time. The sudden plot twists are very smart in the drama as it changes the crimes. The emotional interaction between the past and present detectives were great although sometimes the time frames were quite confusing.

Overall, I'm so sad that this drama ended at Episode 16. It deserved to be a 20 episode drama. Now I can see why everyone demanded a 2nd season. I'm usually not a person who cries a lot but I cried 3 times! For those who don't like watching scary crime dramas this one is for you! There's very little scenes with gruel, dead bodies and killing. There's only little blood scenes overall.

The lead character's curiosity was amazing!

This is the only drama I've ever given a 10/10 to so I highly recommend this drama. I too, would watch it again.

Obviously what I'm about to say is going to piggy-back off of all the other reviews raving about this drama, but I felt like I'd be remiss to not write a review for literally the best drama I've ever seen (to date at least; I'm writing this in March 2016). Normally I'm a person who gravitates to the romantic dramas; my general thought was that any drama I watched needed that element in order to get me 'obsessed' or at least entertained. That notion was blown completely out of the water by this drama--I became completely and utterly fascinated, entertained, and obsessed by the plot and characters alone. Not that there wasn't a slight strain of romance thrown into this drama (it's slightly there); but it's not the driving force of this drama.

The general premises of this show is: ""What would you do if you received a transmission from the past?"" Would it change things for the better or the worse? What if by saving someone...you would ruin everything? .....Is it worth it? These questions are constantly asked and each time they're brought up it's suspenseful, poignant, and touching. The characters come to life so vividly and clearly in this drama; all three of the main actors impressed me with their roles. The acting in this drama is excellent, it felt like they were real and complex people.

Our first main character is Park Hae Yeong: He's a profiler and lieutenant and discovers this old radio (think walkie-talkie esque) in which he can receive and send transmissions to and from the past. He hates police officers in general; he sees the corruption within an organization that can be bought by people with money and power. He finds himself connected to a detective in the past through these transmissions--why each other? And how are they connected?

That brings me to my absolute favorite character: Lee Jae Han. He first gets a transmission from Park Hae Yeong in 1989. Throughout the years he relies on him in trying to solve his cases and attempting to make the future a better place. No character can pull at my heartstrings like he can. He embodies everything good and heartwarming: like a reluctant and endearing, walking teddy-bear.

Our other main character is Cha Soo Hyun. She's in both time-periods and has been searching for Lee Jae Han ever since he went missing in 2000. She's the team-leader and a very strong and capable female character. The drama shows her roots and how Lee Jae Han influenced her to where she is within the Cold Case Squad team today.

There was never ever a dull moment in this drama. Normally I'm mostly watching with like a computer card game going on in the background. Nope....all of my attention and energy was focused into this drama. It captivated me from beginning to end. I don't regret the time I spent watching this beautiful and poignant masterpiece. It brought tears to my eyes, gasps to my breath, and laughter--it was a roller-coaster of a ride. And I'm sad that it ended. I'll definitely be re-watching this one (and I never re-watch anything)!

This drama could be split into four cases: Gyeonggi Nambu murders, 1995 Larceny case, 1997 Hongwong-dong murders and the final, most important case - Injoo (poor Sun Woo - my heart broke for him.)

It actually kickstarts with the kidnapping of a young girl, and the thriller starts.

In the first two cases, they did a slow reveal of who the killer was, which was pointless in my POV, because I figured out who was the killer and burglar respectively, in like, 2 seconds. In the first one, the second the bus driver said, ""No-one got on at that stop"" it was bloody obvious who it could be (hint: it's not the bus driver.) In the second one, there was no witnesses except the rich boy...and lo be'hold - it doesn't take a genius to figure out who it could be. I felt like my intelligence was being mildly insulted, but the walkie-talkie side-drama, kept my score around 7/10. You know - that awesome thing that can communicate with Lee Jae Han in the past :)

In the last two cases, they revealed who the culprits were straightaway, so I just settled in to watching the net closing in on them! It was actually kinda fun. My fav bits were the flashbacks on how the crimes were committed, and the human emotion it wrought. We really were spoiled! Also any scene with Lee Jae Han in it. The time looping was very impressive.

Questions that I still want to know the answers too:

1) Park Hae Young's phone kept ringing at 11:22, just before the 11:23 transmissions, 2 or 3 times. Who was it? Why was it never mentioned again? (That bugged me the most, surprisingly)

2) Does this have a second season? :)

Extra mention to Cha Soo Hyun, she was brilliantly acted by Kim Hye Soo. That woman!

Also strangely - my most favourite character besides, LJH, was Ahn Chi Soo. He wasn't quite a good guy, nor was he a full out blown bad guy (I love how he supported the Cold case team sometimes, at odds with his jerkface boss, Kim Bum Joo) and the reveal with his character in ep 11 (was it 11?) was my fav cliffhanger of the show. I like people who straddle both light and dark, in the murky grey area.

The soundtrack was great. Really elevated the show throughout. I didn't even realise the last episode was 1 hour and 1/2, I was so amazed that a show, could still remain exciting to the end, raising questions, instead of solving them! Kudos Signal team. You outdid yourselves!

This is truly a special Korean drama - one of those that have the perfect combination of great writing, great acting, and great directing.

At first instance, it gave me a True Detective vibe, which shows the ambition of the show from the get-go.

For once, there were no overwhelming loveline in the story. Just a overwhelming sense of tragedy and injustice, which is precisely what the audience SHOULD be feeling, because those are exactly what drive our main characters forward throughout the show. Police corruption and injustice seem to be popular topics to cover in Korean dramas, but if there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that wrongs must be made right.

The writing was not simplistic at all; the storylines are tightly woven together and the stories are carefully told and not laid out all at once to force-feed the viewer with information. The writer gives it to us bit by bit and allows the story to unfold naturally, so the viewers can come to a gradual realization of the real horrors of the injustices. I was totally hooked to the show to the very end; it genuinely kept me coming back for more after each episode.

The 3 leads are not actors you see often on TV so it was a real bonus to have them join this project. Each one of them did a great job, especially Jo Jin Woong, truly the star of the show. It was also great to have, for once, a strong female character who was placed front and centre of the show, NOT for the sake of having a lead female character. She was a capable detective who HAPPENED to be a woman. Isn’t that fab?

Clearly from the above, I highly highly recommend this show for a gripping and rewarding watch.

Must watch it for the story and screenplay. Plot is well executed and neat portrayal of past vs future. Suspense & twists continued at the END. After 16 hours of watching, I had great satisfaction of watching an unique drama. My unwinding time was well spent. I hope yours will also be !!

This drama is really good to the extend, I wonder how come the writer could write it up and the casts could act very well.

Must watch. Everything is 10/10. I also rewatch it thrice. Even if the casts are not very handsome or super pretty, there should be no problem. The storyline is already good enough to make for everything.

One of the Best time travel and crime drama ever!
I watched this drama very recently and oh
god I loved it. I was a little scared that I
would not like this drama but I freaking
loved it so much. I thought at first that it
would be another drama where we have
to find a serial killer and all and well it
was kinda same but we had to find two
serial killers and a lot more than that.

The thing I loved the most about it that
unlike some detective dramas it showed
the corruption of the police department
and how rich people get away even though
they commit a big crime. It was like an
eye-opener. The time-travel element was
very well written and executed it had its
own rules and they never were broken.

The actors did their jobing like so perfectly.
I specially liked the old detective like
whenever he cried it felt totally real. The
most thing I liked was how the characters
and the story both was so well balanced.
It was just amazing of a drama. Another
thing I liked that the criminals weren’t
labeled as “human trash” just because they
did a crime.

It showed how victim’s family and
criminal’s family was effected to. And just
it was a fabulous drama and I am eagerly
waiting or the season 2. The ending left
me speechless and it needs to have a
season 2! It needs to!

After a year on my plan to watch list I finally got the time/vibe to watch this drama, and didn't sleeping well for two days was really worthing! Signal is not the kind of drama that everyone will like it, but at the same time is the kind one that grabs and take over your heart and mind. The way that they develop the story and how the things start to make sense is totally amazing! The most crazy thing about this plot is how you start to find out the link between the characters and the cases that they investigate.. The writers did an amazing job here, after one/two episodes you're already hooked to this crazy/amazing drama!
One of the strongest point of this drama is the cast: Lee Je Hoon as Park Hae Yeong is perfect, his expressions, his big lips, the crazy look he has when he's profiling someone, his tears.. are really on point! I dunno another works from him, but after this drama I'll definitively stalker him around. Jo Jin Woong as Lee Jae Han is really good too, I really like the development and how the actor portrait this specific character.. Cha Soo Heyon is not my favorite kind of female character, just for the fact that I feel like almost all her judgements are kind of based on her feelings for Lee Jae Han. But, on the other side, is really cool to watch this strong and amazing woman that doesn't seem afraid of fighting for the right thing. Kim Hye Soo was really cool on the acting scenes and I really think that she has a crazy chemistry with Lee Je Hoon; I shipped Detective Cha with Park Hae Yeong all time long!
Overall I really enjoyed watching this drama and I couldn't stop until I had finished it.. Everything was done pretty well and it's impossible to not like it.

SUPER ADDICTIVE !
~One of the best detective dramas with fantasy mix
~Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time
~Two cops from two different timelines attempt to solve crimes with noticeable repercussions
~Time-travel aspect is executed so well
~Solid acting by leads and their chemistry is very endearing
~Some of the cases are based on real events and can be disturbing at times but handled very sensitively
~Can be tear-jerking if you get too attached to the characters/stories
~The open ending left too many questions and I am still waiting for SEASON 2 GODDAMITT!

Such a cool idea for a show and one so well-executed. I am a little disappointed that they left us on a cliffhanger since usually the story is wrapped up within one season, so I'm hoping they'll eventually do a second season. I must say this show could have gone in a lot of different directions and I'm glad that it didn't have a predictable plot. This is definitely in my top 5 for a good suspense/thriller/mystery drama and one that I would recommend to those who are new to watching kdramas, although don't be surprised if other shows don't measure up.

This review may contain spoilers
This drama was absolutely thrilling, every minute of it! The cast, the plot, each cold case. So worth it to watch, however

SPOILER
for the last 2 episodes or so, the flashbacks were a bit long and annoying because they were already shown several times in earlier episodes. And the Jae Han was too heroic, he became an idiot... For some parts it was unclear why did he do things the way he did, but no drama is perfect so it is acceptable I guess. The ending though, I liked and disliked it at the same time, I mean why did he have to hide in a hospital for 15 years, he didnt seem to be disabled or anything like that. Would have bee perfect if they explained everything at the end.

A MUST WATCH
I’ve heard so much about this drama that I thought I’d give it a try. It’s a good thing I did!

I felt so moved by the cases and the characters in this drama. I did cry at several points but it’s a drama that left me feeling good after completing it.

The cast did a wonderful job with the acting and the story was very well written.

Shoutout to Choi Jin-Woong who made me fall in love with Lee Jae Han. His character very well written and the actor did an amazing job portraying the passion for justice.

As I watched the drama this year (2021), I was satisfied with the ending. Even though it’s a cliffhanger, I am satisfied.

I 100% recommend this drama as you will not regret it!

Trying to let you know
Sign 을 보내 signal 보내
I must let you know 
Sign 을 보내 signal 보내

I think Signal did a lot of things really well. To start with, Kim Hye Soo is a queen. I'm really excited to do a deep dive into the rest of her dramas and films. Soo Hyun was a brilliantly written character to me. I love that she was this tough policewoman who wasn't always, that she began as a green rookie who couldn't even drive. She was vulnerable, unsure in love for her superior. Such an incredible performance. 

Speaking of hot older people, Jo Jin Woong was another standout. I love Jae Han, his fierce determination to always do good, his belief that no one should be shielded from punishment just because of their wealth and power. Corruption always figures so prominently in these Korean police stories. I think they're inspired by the real life abuses of power, but I can't be sure. Jae Han being a bumbling idiot at his big age who couldn't even talk to the woman he loved was also very endearing. I'm just mad there wasn't a satisfying conclusion to his & Soo Hyun's relationship. I was cheated of a romance. And oh my land, that incredible scene in episode 13 (I think) where Jae Han grabs his fellow officer's head, howling in grief and rage, just the intimacy of that scene will be on my mind for a long time. 

Lee Je Hoon was sometimes the weakest guy here. He has these quirks that I found distracting. Subtlety is a good thing sometimes. 

As far as time travel mysteries directly inspired by Bong Joon Ho's Memories of Murder go, I think Signal is a solid entry.

My ranking:

1. Life on Mars
2. Signal
3. Tunnel

Shout out to that soundtrack too, especially the '70s detective show instrumental.

SIGNAL: Intense & Mysterious
SIGNAL (Sigeuneol) was such an interesting premise. I really enjoyed this crime series. I'm not sure how to best describe it though. It was such a unique experience. While it was a investigative crime drama series there were also definite amounts of science fiction or possibly even paranormal elements which makes it a very unusual watch for me. I really enjoyed that aspect however, especially blended with criminal investigation aspects. Although a strange mix of genres, it really worked here.

I loved Lee Jehoon (as Park Hae-Young). At first I really didn't think I would like him but he ended up being phenomenal in this. He is far from being a stereotypical lead character. I love the emotional connection he gets with cases. Given his background it really endears viewers to him. I love Kim Hye-su (as Detective Cha Soon-hyeon) and Cho Jin-woong (as Detective Lee Jae-han). They are both great actors and their characters are really cool and likable.

I also really enjoyed the two timelines. I think they did a great job portraying two different eras and overlapping story and cases. The concept is fascinating. Visually and aesthetically it was appealing and very original series. The acting was great, the story was great, the music was great, I loved the three main characters. Everything was really well done.

The main reason I hesitate giving this 10 stars is for a few small reasons. Mainly because of the way it ended. Without giving away any spoilers I will only say the ending felt very open-ended, and hopefully it is open-ended intentionally for the purpose of sequel seasons. Until then, I hesitate in rating it too highly because it felt incomplete and needed so much more. Secondly, while I loved the three main characters so much, many of the other side characters felt a bit flat to me. (I did enjoy the characters of the Cold Case Division) I felt there could have been more depth and character building otherwise. This show was so unique and worthwhile.

While Signal is very intriguing and full of heart, it also has a very dark and dreary feeling, with a lot of very sad themes (i.e. murder, corruption, suicide, rape, etc.) and not a lot of happy moments to balance it. The overall mood of the show is very heavy. A lot of the story revolves around some very depressing, tragic themes and is quite hard to handle at times. It can be heart-wrenching. Even still, this is one of my all time favorites.

[EDIT: There are rumors there will be a season 2!]

Based on the Hwangseong serial killer real-life story, this melodrama offers a whole investigation journey with suspense and thrill. Many people compare Signal with Tunnel since it based on the same incident. However, Signal is not only based on the Hwaseong case. It has some reference of other SK cold cases. I must say both dramas are a masterpiece with something different to offer. Signal offers you to be inside together with the main character, Lieutenant Park Hae Yong step by step in through the investigation.  It has a more realistic approach and serious tone.

To be honest, this drama makes me miserable so many times. I find the police here were corrupt and uncooperative at all, which make investigation harder and annoying.  There are times where I want to pull my hair because of the chief.  In addition, the drama has a kind of slow pace of the investigation ( which make sense, they investigate cold cases and was given many hurdles by other police too).

Overall it is an amazing crime drama. The main character is logical and has a high analytic skill.

A sci-fi crime drama from the past
From the writer of Kingdom, Kim Eun-hee, it starts slowly but pulls you in with tight writing, weaving small cases together into a larger picture. The story spans across timelines, changing the past and the present with ease and coherence. Very rarely do you see timetravel shows which have a coherent storyline. Christopher Nolan should watch this show, how to build a story from the middle to the start and the end without confusing the viewer.
The crimes are compassionately portrayed, making it a chilling watch. Especially so because three of the four big cases the trio solve are based on true crimes, aaand the fictional fourth one was the least gruesome.

One of the best K-drama's you will ever come across in the non-romantic genre!
And the sad part is that it is totally underrated!
Romantic, flowery K-dramas are what we mostly look for and would like to watch. But this is a MUST watch even if you think crime solving K-dramas are not something you will enjoy. The story is out of the world! there are soooo many twist and turns in the drama yet you will never find yourself confused or bored. Kudos to the writer for such a brilliant script that is totally one of a kind. Acting on point! Editing perfect!

ADD TO MY FAVORITES RIGHT AWAY!
Such were the thoughts I had while I was still not even finished with Signal.
I consider myself lucky to have come to read numerous good reviews of Signal (especially on Drama Beans), because otherwise I might have skipped one of my all time favorites as of now.
Even more glad that it was Signal that I decided to watch after being away from drama watching for a little while and only recently coming back.
Signal is simply everything it promises to be, and it is almost everything any fantasy-thriller drama should be.

Perfect casting! Literally ALL the cast was more than spectacular. Very strong and solid performances by the main trio, especially Jo Jin Woong who more than just charismatic, he was magical! You cannot help falling in love with Lee Jea Han, with all his righteousness, devotedness, and also sometimes his awkwardness and goofiness. Kim Hye Soo was magnificent as Detective Cha Soo Hyun, whether as the naive rookie cop or as the bad-ass and tough Team leader. It was my first time ever watching something for Lee Jea Hoon, but boy was I impressed! He can be overly dramatic at times with his facial expressions, but it all served in shaping the emotional and a bit impulsive character that is Park Hae Young.

Effortlessly flawless writing & Directing!
What else would you expect from this duo! With such a tricky premise that is time-bending, the writing can easily fall prey to plot holes and inconsistencies, but in Signal's case there were simply NONE. the more one watches, the more you rest assured that you are in safe hands, and that any question or slightly unclear point you may come upon, you are sure will be properly answered in due time.
The story was sure a unique and complicated, what with two different timelines simultaneously progressing on screen (constant swapping from past to present) to the idea behind time-warp; were one action brings on a string of consequences that reverberate to affect not just the people directly involved but also other innocent people’s lives on a larger scale. But as much as the premise was difficult and complicated, as much as I never felt confused or had to pause and speculate, that was not just thanks to the genius writer-nim that is Kim Eun Hee, but also the direction played an important role, with the effortless manner he utilized to help differentiate between different timelines (changing the aspect ratio) to showing the right flashbacks at exactly the right moment. Sometimes I felt like I would have appreciated a date and time to show on the scene, only to find the time eventually revealed in a realistic and effortless manner.
This drama opened my eyes more and more to the power that lies in directing. It was the astonishing direction that aided such a marvelous and unique story to properly come to live. From the camera angles, lighting, down to paying the utmost care to details in order to distinguish the past scenes; everything from clothing, accessories, gadgets, cars, down to paper ads in the background. Kudos to PD Kim Won Suk (I doubt it is a coincidence that now two of my most favorite KDramas are his)

Marvelous characterization
Each character was distinctly unique yet all shared the same righteousness and sincerity. I especially loved the transition of maturing as a cop that Cha Soo Hyun showed, both on an emotional level and a professional level, but still harboring the same earnest and deep feelings of love to Det. Lee Jae Han. How everybody bonded on the cold case team, while sometimes harboring mixed feelings of suspicion and doubt (mostly towards Park Hae Young) they all trusted and respected each other.
I could relate to and empathize with nearly all the characters maybe not so much the villains but not all dramas succeed in making its viewers invested in the life and cause of a villain, right?
The music
Mostly background instrumental tracks, with just a few vocals, but the opening and closing theme songs sure leave a strong impression.
I read there were rumors there are plan for a sequel, but as much as I loved this drama to pieces, and as much as I had wished for more in the end, I really hope they don’t come around to producing a sequel even featuring the same cast. This was a masterpiece that I doubt any sequel can keep to its par, worse, might even do it damage.

Interesting story but inconsistent acting and dialog
The story here is captivating, it is interesting and sure to keep you both on your toes as well as wanting to watch more...

However some parts, especially parts where people act a younger version of themselves the acting is just cringe, annoying and at times really, really bad! Is it due to bad directing, bad writing of just lack of range in the actors I do not know but it was at times so bad I felt bad for the actors... Such a shame because I do know these actors actually do have talent...

The amount of annoying characters is kept to a minimum (except as younger versions) and even though it is a bit of a one case an episode kind of deal there is still a common thread and interesting plot both as a whole and in the details, no detail is insignificant and it is sown together both beautifully and slightly disappointing in the end..

But again the story, the twists and the issues that the drama doues tackle still makes it worth watching, I just can not score it higher.

LOVED THIS DRAMA SO MUCH!
The storyline was so well written, you hardly find gems like Signal in the drama world. Everything happened for a reason, and even though it seemed like they were dragging it a bit towards the end, the final result was really good. It was such an enjoyable and interesting experience, it took me a little bit to be completely invested into the characters and the plot, but once that happened there was no turning back.
I kinda binge watched this drama, something I hardly do with any tv serie, so that's already significative lol.
I have to mention that the best thing of Signal was the performance of the actors: everyone did so well, they all handled their characters with such maturity and carefulness, you really don't see such mature and experienced actors anymore.
The music was nice and with a vintage touch, really appreciated it.

So, if you like thriller, crime, corruption, serial killers and dramatic suspense, with bare minimum and well-handled romance, this is definitely the drama you were looking for. If you still don't like all that, you should still give it a try because there really isn't anything bad about it!
imo SIGNAL IS A MUST WATCH!!!

Crime Thriller Combining Fantasy
Crime thriller is one of my favorite genre and this one is very good. I would say this shows keep me engaged for the ideas of time travel. It’s not new about the walkie talkie conversation to the past time, like a movie Ditto in 2000, but combining it to the crime is quite fresh for me.

About the acting, thumbs up to the casts. They delivered it great, because they are so professional and consider at experience.

I would give more score, but I think there are certain parts that is too exessive in putting emotional scene, especially when they need to talk in walkie talkie. Also the walkie talkie background is not explained well. More episode perhaps will give explanation, And regarding all the cases, it’s perhaps only give one message, that only the one who has power and money can get over the rule? Also I’m not a fan of opem ending and left a lot of things unexplained.

Maybe I will rewarch it to understand more? I’m not sure.

But overall it is a good show, and you must give it a try!

DISCLAIMER: I recommend you watch this series without any knowledge or expectation about it. Having high expectations can ruin the experience.

I binged this series in 3 days, and that says a lot. I usually don't watch continuous episodes unless they intrigue me to my core, so this series was definitely one of those. The main take away here is that this show has more emotional value to its storytelling than focusing on the basics and the logic. I'll discuss what I mean through this review.

PLOT
I came into this series without any expectations. All I know is that it was highly rated in this site, and the plot is intriguing, so I decided to give it a try. And I don't regret it. First episode became fourth, next thing I knew I finished it in three days. Since I went without any expectations nor knowledge on what it's all about, I was able to enjoy the series to its extent. They did a great job at putting cliffhangers that will make you want to watch the next episode. I found myself getting hooked and excited to click ""next episode"" because I really want to find out what happens next. The mystery and suspense were decent and well executed, but there will be plot holes and minor details that will bother you along the way.
While the cinematography and production was fantastic and almost perfect with its color grading, smooth transitions, and clear narration, they kind of messed up in terms of the characters aging. Most of them (usually the bg characters, suspects, and victims) did not look any different 15 years ago! (especially you, yeah I'm talking to you, Mr. Convenience store guy. What's your secret to such young perfect skin??) It felt disorienting and unorganized. It completely ruined the flow. Also, major spoiler ahead, when one of the main characters died, they literally brought her back to life. That was one of the worst things they could use a plot device! It negates every and all emotional warrant the scene deserves. I know it's a time travelling concept and the main character still needs shit to do for the main story, but they could've not killed this person and nothing big would really change! The action of reviving a character will make lives lose all value and substance, telling the viewers that there are no actual consequences to these people in the present. (which btw is completely contradictory of what they were trying to convey in the first place! That changing the past can be dangerous!) And you don't have to cry for them cause don't worry, they'll come back. This was the most bothersome and frustrating thing in the whole series for me. I hated it so much.
Lastly, The walkie talkie aspect was underutilized as a handful of reviewers said, I agree, but I didn't mind at all. I think the story and focus still worked despite it not being exhausted to its full potential. It was satisfactory enough.


CHARACTERS
The character writing was questionable at best. My biggest concern about the characters is the way this world was written. It is very clear cut in telling you who the protagonists are. They are the GOOD GUYS, and holy shit are they the only ones. Everyone else is lazy, useless, incompetent, greedy, passive, and submissive. You will see there are three main categories: The protagonists are the only honest and just ones, the antagonists are cartoonish-ly evil and obnoxious, and then there's the rest, the background characters, the stale and one dimensional support casts, the static cardboard cut-outs of the police force. Yes, you can say some of them are ""gray"" characters like the captain, but I believe none of their traits were written properly. You can kind of tell they were having dilemmas, but you won't learn to sympathize with any of them because they feel too forced and seemed like they were caricatures shaped to fit the puzzle.
The only saving grace in terms of characters was the acting. The characters themselves lacked depth, but the actors/actresses did a fabulous job at making their viewers empathize nonetheless because of their performance. I never thought that could happen but they literally did carried this whole series in their backs. Kudos to the skillful cast.

MUSIC
I think the music choices were good and it fits the scenes they're supposed to be in, but personally none of them stuck to me. I wasn't too hyped on any of it and it wouldn't be memorable in the long run. Nothing much to say about it except it worked.

OVERALL
The series I watched/binged before this was Welcome2Life, which I couldn't stop comparing it to. W2L had a draggy and (personally uninteresting) political side plot that the main plot had to follow through, but everything else was marvelous and sensational. Despite both series having the two parallel world concept, W2L will teach you that reality is harsh, and that your actions have consequences, and you will really feel the depth of its characters to your core.
What Signal has to offer was the mystery and suspense of the plot, but used the most basic and superficial character writing to make it work. I learned to enjoy every bit because I was excited to know what happens next. But maybe deep inside, I just wanted it all to be over with.

A classic
This had such a great plot with so many details and turns that it was a thrilling ride all the way!
This was one of the first Kdramas I watched and it blew me away how great it was. Its refreshing how it can be dark without being cynical that the characters are passionate and always trying their best even though they are flawed.
Kim Hye Soo and Lee Je Hoon were amazing, I loved their dynamic as the story progresses.

This drama has stood the test of time and is still amazing. There are often whispers of a second season but I am so satisfied with the one season that I don't mind where there is one. The openish ending was perfect for me, as time doesn't end in a full stop it keeps going.

This is one of the best detective / SciFi / Thrillers I have ever seen

Suspense-filled drama that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you guessing

Story:
Something I frequently found myself saying was ""WOW this is crazy!"" because the plot is so unpredictable and there are so many cliffhangers and plot twists that you just want to keep watching. Throughout the series, you wonder what is going to happen to Lee Jae Han, and things take a major turn in the last few episodes and things really get C R A Z Y. The ending is kind of ambiguous but I think it just sets the stage for a second season, which HAS to happen. Otherwise it's super unsatisfying.

It's a crime drama, but at the same time all the cases are connected and lend themselves to the bigger picture of the plot. It was really interesting to think about how the past/present changed because of the walkie talkie and the actions of the main characters. The writing is good and it moves along fairly quickly, although this is definitely a heavier drama since it covers topics like rape, murder, etc. This is a drama that tugs at your heartstrings and makes you sad and angry at injustice. The cases are also based on real events, which is so devastating to think about. There's a sense of continuity in the drama, where the beginning episodes are equally important to the plot as the later ones and it all ties together, so you should definitely pay attention to everything!

Acting/Cast:
Signal has such a stellar cast, including one of my favourite actors Kim Won Hae. He's appeared in what feels like every single drama, but he's such a good actor although he didn't play a big role here. There were lots of familiar faces in the cast, and I can't think of a single one where I felt like the acting was weak. You will hate the villains, and rail at injustice and then remember that it's just an actor and not real life.

I was especially impressed with the female lead (Cha Soo Hyun), who appears in both the past and the present. The way that she portrayed herself from 15 years ago vs present time were so different and made it believable. Sometimes I feel like in dramas, scenes from the past come across as kind of fake or not believable that the actors are really younger (just dressed in different clothes) but this felt really real.

Music:
The theme song really fits in with the old time feel of the show, and I had it stuck in my head but then for some reason midway through they swapped out the song for a few episodes. I'm not sure if this was because of the plot or whatever, but then they went back to the original song. I can't remember the second song, but the first song is a solid 8/10.

Rewatch Value:
If crime/suspense dramas aren't your thing, I would highly recommend watching with someone.
I actually started watched Signal a few years ago when it first came out and then dropped it, but always remembered it as being a good drama despite that. I think it's just a very emotional/heavy drama and I usually prefer romantic comedies, but this time I watched it over Netflix Party with my boyfriend and I think it definitely helps to have someone to buddy watch with! It's not a show that I would recommend binge watching, more like watching one episode a day so things don't get too dark.

Honestly a really good drama. Get ready for suspense, cliff hangers, plot twists, and all the feels.

DEFINITELY worth a watch!
Intriguing, smart, funny, sad, smart, sneaky. really good!
Acting is spot on, you really get love and hate characters, understanding their frustrastions and other feelings, totally hooked in and didn't really get boring at all as something new would appear and make you raise your eyebrows. Music fits perfectly with the emotions and scenes. Good story and up your street if you enjoyed watching ""The Call"" as they're similar concepts.
Although it was a hopeful open ending I still was a bit disappointed in it, also due to the fact that is just that season and no more once you've finished. I was really hoping to see the sweetest man Jae Han himself finally reunited with 0.5 but still worth it.

Signal is the first drama I finished and for a first drama, it completely won me over! Signal is a lot like other mystery/thriller shows, but with a twist. Through an old radio, the main character speaks with a detective from the past to try and solve cold cases.

The characters in Signal are all well written. I felt an emotional connection towards both male leads and the female lead. Everything these characters went through engrossed me into the show even more. The villain I absolutely loved to hate, and the side characters made me laugh at times.

The story is mostly a thriller/mystery, but it also involves family drama and a little romance, so there's a little something for everybody. There is a little bit of violence and gore in Signal, but I never found it to be too much to handle. It's typical for a mystery/thriller series.

The one problem I had with Signal was I wish they better explained certain things during the last episode, but it was still a satisfying ending.

If you want a good mystery/thriller, or just good drama to watch in general, I definitely recommend Signal!

Best Crime Drama
This drama.is everything. First time that I liked the Ahjussi character. The trio is indeed awesome! Hoping for season 2 with the same cast. I like how the cases in the drama are based on true crime cases. This drama is a bit like the hollywood movie frequency and I love that movie that I one of my project was based on that movie :) The differences are the radio they used. In the movie the father and son are the one that's communicating while in the drama they don't know each other. The pallettes they used in the drama to transition from present to past is perfect. Best scene for me.is when Ahjussi is crying in the movie theatre while everyone is laughing it was heartbreaking. Even the supporting roles shine in this drama. Best Crime Drama for me. To those who haven't watch it yet I recommend you to watch it to know how amazing this drama is.

One of the best shows in any language
My first foray into the world of the K drama was Signal and what a first impression it made. This show his wonderful from its writing to the acting to the haunting soundtrack. Cho Jin-woong was spectacular as Lee Jae-Han. The movie theatre scene is a sight to behold. It really rips your heart out to see how he suffered in that moment. Kim Hye-soo as Cha Soo-hyun was a true paradox of the hard boiled detective who was very vulnerable when it came to Lee Jae-Han. As the profiler, Lee Je-hoon was excellent as the conflicted police officer fighting with his own past and the death of his brother. Jang Hyun-sang as the main antagonist was great and made it more satisfying to see his comeuppance at the end. There isn't anything about this series I could fault.

The Main Problems I had with ""Signal"" (Even though I Loved It)
I've never done this before, but here is a review/discussion on ""Signal"" for those who HAVE seen the drama.

WARNING: ESSAY AHEAD

As one of the highest rated shows here, it is impossible to miss “Signal.” If you haven’t watched it, you will at least try it out one day because the world won’t stop telling you how good it is. Nor will the reviewers stop reviewing. For some reason. Ahem. (But seriously, this review is addressed to those who have seen it).

However, after recently finishing the series, I went through reviews to try and find the words which described how I feel about it other than the extremes of “IT’S THE BEST” or “IT’S THE WORST.” Which, honestly, it isn’t either of those things.

Let’s be honest, though, it’s great. It’s a really well done show. Even if you haven’t seen it you KNOW that. So, as I seem to be doing to the popular things, I’m just going to discuss what is not so great. This time, with spoilers. All the spoilers ahead.

THE PLOT HOLE

Getting right into it, we have a bit of plot holes here which I’ve seen people mention exist, but no one seems to be really discussing what they actually are. And it is what the main one is which really impacts the ending of the season.

The radio transmissions. Obviously. The first transmission received is from Jaehan’s future—a future only made possible because of Haeyeong’s future transmissions. This becomes a whole “chicken and the egg” ordeal as it is supposedly Haeyeong which leads Jaehan to the latter’s death, when the show itself is constantly reminding us that the future only changes when the past is changed.

While their relationship’s beginning with Jaehan’s death adds to the suspense and weight at the end of the season, I did spend the entire time wondering when we would find out how the transmissions started in the first place. This curiosity was never satisfied—unless I missed something in which I would ask someone to explain (completely plausible).

CONSISTENCY

This show actually does a great job in keeping things pretty simple (though it certainly gets too simple as many have noted), but the second half also will make question the consistency of changing the past.

When the serial killer with ties to Soohyun gets arrested in the past, this results in several women surviving in the future. Haeyeong comments on this, but no solution is arrived at by the end of the season. When the previous case held drastic results for changing the past, this case ends up having no fallback. Rather, all the experiences the audience endured with the characters are lost, thus destroying the growth of the characters.

TIME

Where Jaehan goes through years of his life in the show, the present only seems progress in a few weeks—a month, maybe, based on the cases and conversations had between characters. Still, there seems to be a lot of room for character growth in this short period because so much heartache ensues in the current tragedies…until they are wiped away.

One of the “wait, what?” moments in the show for me was when Soohyun is able to address her trauma and finally catch the killer who tormented her…only for it to be erased from history completely. This growing period for her and other moments in the show are lost, leaving the audience to wonder about the cost of changing the past only to lose the strength gained from pain.

I do think that the last episode somewhat addresses this when *stuff happens* and the present changes in a nearly unrecognizable way. We see that all of these relationships Haeyeong built over the last several weeks are gone, and I wondered what he must have been feeling then—if he regretted it.

Part of the reason I believe audiences loved Jaehan so much is because he has all these years to grow and continuously show his devotion to people and his beliefs. His past never changes. On the other side, however, the present characters experience little change aside from Haeyeong. Even then, he is always in the middle of things and dealing with the new changes in the present.

Though I will say that even though I read how people felt the radio transmissions should have been utilized more, I would argue instead that the ethics of the transmissions should have been considered more. I am hoping that this will be addressed in the second season (if it ever comes).

ADVERSITY

I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m ripping this show apart, but I do also feel it necessary to talk about the villains. Despite the fresh take on crime, this show suffers from the usual “corruption” trope where we have these top dogs who love making the good guys suffer for seemingly no reason at all.

In fact, I feel like “Signal” didn’t even both coming up with a reason for our antagonists. They were just illogically against solving crime right and just wanted money and power for some reason. Super weird.

Interestingly enough, I don’t think “Signal” even needed some evil, corrupted, villain. Just this fight against time, death, and perps was enough to get my heart racing.

CONCLUSION

All in all, it was a great show. Many repeated flashbacks which were unneeded, but I still enjoyed that I could follow what was going on with the investigations rather than it just being a bunch of nonsensical jargon as sometimes happens.

I know I listed a bunch of problems it has, but I really did enjoy this show which is why I’m taking the time to review it like this. Oddly enough. It made me think and kept me pushing for the next episode because I just had to find out how they were going to finish all of this. I recommend it!

My rewatch value is my entertainment instead. And as always, I am so grateful to those who made this show available to us. The hard work that went into the making is evident if you take a look. Cheers!

After the first three or four ""confusing"" episodes, 'Signal' provides the outright most amount of emotion and attention-to-detail a drama could ever give. Phenomenal acting by each single member of cast alongside a confusing-at-first plot which turns into a masterpiece, and a production quality that Hollywood would be proud of - it is a definite watch for anyone who enjoys these type of shows. I believe a second season has already bee made and is waiting for release, but if I am wrong, I still believe that a second season should be made - although it's been almost 5 years!

Not to compared, but i love this over voice. It's more into criminal psychologic study and detective work. The forensic just give a little touch. There's not really called a thriller scene tho. But I loving the different generation to end with. It's no sense if we put it on the real life, since cold cases has too much holes to filled up. But through the time difference, they could! Even though the end was just normal, like other dramas that they'll still alive until several season. The music didn't stand out well. Since i was focused more on the story. But it help a lot wuth the sad scene. Well, this must got a good prising.

Great drama, just a bit overrated.
This is one of those shows that start out as your basic crime story but turns out to be a melodrama after all. The crimes they worked on are quite intriguing. The investigations, though, are sloppy and the police are either lazy and promotion-hungry or just plain lucky. Even the cold case squad members don't have excellent investigative skills. I guess the writer really wants to show to the viewers that the transmissions are the real hero in this story. Everyone else is just a tool --- the self-righteous profiler, the kind-hearted cop who always cries, and the grieving squad leader. The good thing is that there is a clear rule about the impact of changing the past that is established early in the show. Even though there are a lot of awkward dialogues, ugly crying and cliches about cops, overall acting is really great. Even the lazy, conniving cops are so convincing i had to keep myself from throwing the remote.

This was the first drama that rose my standard of what I wanted in a drama.
For summary sake this is about a police officer who finds a walkie talkie of a missing officer from the 80s and he can communicate with him from the past at a certain time. together they solve crimes in the past and present.
It has so many twists and turns I couldn't predict what happened next up to the last minute.
1. If soppy love storys are your type of dramas this isn't for you. YES there is a female lead who had a past spark with the missing officer (I never remember names) but is all very subtle and never really brought to the service although their bond is amazing.
2. The acting and emotions are great, I was really drawn into every episode by the incredible acting and storyline.
Minor SPOLIER - The ending can be frustrating as it is a cliffhanger and you have to kind guess what happens but It doesn't bring down the story at all just think of the ending you want as it leaves it up to you anyway.

Wow... Just wow
This is an epic drama. At first i thought this is just another boring crime solving drama. After watching it, i realized how wrong i was. This drama takes you to a journey of two different people connected by a signal from different times. It's not like you just starts solving cases and won medals and all that. If you change the past present changes too.
Signal is a crime thriller that will keep you on the edge throughout most of the show.
The main leads were really good at what they were doing. they were amazing at their roles. I loved this show.
If you want to enjoy an epic crime thriller with a time traveling twist. This is for you, Don't think twice just go and watch it. You can thank me later.

Must watch
I loved the series, why i didn't score it higher? because oce the mister is gone, is difficult to re-watch and get the same emotions. I would like a season 2 to complete to blank spots.

The character of Jo Jin Woong brought a baggage of emotions, while I was expecting more from the other 2 main characters, especially Kim Hye Soo, I truly love her works.

The story is great, don't want to spoil the mistery and the OST perfect, I have it on my YouTube private library :

This drama was fantastic... I haven't been able to find a drama that hooked me since My love from another star. I enjoyed everybit of this series. There were some plot holes and unrealistic reactions to certain scenes, but you quickly forgave it for everything else the drama offered. The leads were great. The story was super refreshing and well-written. And the OST was beautiful. This is a must-watch!

If you're into the crime investigation genre of drama, this is definitely one of the best. The cinematography is just amazing. The story plot was well written & all the main and supporting actors acted amazingly. The background music was well fitted into the show too. Every episode of this drama made me feel like I was watching a movie. Just remarkable.

this will be my first ever review. read on.

i started watching signal at a rather impressionable age. at one where i'd be easily blinded by enjoyment over everything as my primary factor for rating a title. then, it was a 10 for me. almost 3 years later, it's still a 10 for me, but now i've a bit wider vocabulary to word how i feel about this series as accurately as possible or even assess it.

this title greatly sticks out of the usual norm of korean dramas and, depending on the circumstances, it may not even be for everyone or, it might not be your cup of tea if you're looking for something light-hearted or totally opposite.

since i cannot summarize the story in my own way because of review rules, i will instead be vocal about my impressions on it, the other factors, and what i've disliked.

i don't have a particular preference when it comes to k-dramas but as i've said before, this one greatly sticks out of the norm. it is thought-provoking, it keeps you on the edge of your seat almost every time, emotionally, it plays with you and intellectually & methodically, it toys with you. events that happen during the series might not be immediately obvious to you, so that's why you have to make sure to pay attention so you don't miss anything. that's something i love about this series & observation is one of the key points of this drama, from a viewer perspective. the same goes for the plot hole of the series. what stops me from giving a 10 on story is the lack of information about the very key object of the drama, the walkie-talkie. what is it's origin, why is it able of doing what it does? those were the questions i've had near the end of the drama that eventually were not answered. although it would've been better for the general experience, it didn't stop me from enjoying the drama to the extent of giving it such high ratings.

onto the cast/acting. let's just say there's a reason why i gave a 10 on cast/acting. i've faced with most of the cast for the first time when i saw this drama, but i've had the fortune of watching tomorrow with you, in which lee je hoon was the main lead. i was impressed by his versatility & general acting. the cast chosen for this title is brilliant. they got into their characters remarkably well, i was very impressed. it was a tense & emotional run for me which is, for one, because of the cast.

onto the music. crème de la crème of this k-drama. music is very important since it takes part in setting the ambiance or, that might just be my opinion, i don't know. anyway. the ost is rather bitter & tearful and by giving it a listen you could have the general idea of what this drama would be like. the bgm is suspenseful & gloomy but right on-point too. i love listening to it sometimes, just for the reminiscing of it.

this concludes it i guess.

I, like some people watched The Tunnel first and loved that one. When I saw that Signal had almost the same premise as The Tunnel I decided to watch.

For some odd reason I only made it to the first episode. The female lead messed it up for me. Her demeanor, and facial expressions made this less enjoyable to watch.

Someone stated that I should definitely watch so I followed their suggestion. To my dismay I really didn't like this too much. The male character who was in the past played his parts to where I clouded up a bit in some scenes.

To me the two male cops connected even though they never meet. Other cast members seemed to be disconnected from each other.

The cases that they dealt with was interesting but in my opinion it lacked intensity and depth. Especially the last episode. It caused me to be so disappointed with the days I spent watching this. Some of the dramas that I've seen know how to wrap it up in the last episode and a lot of dramas that I've seen don't know how to wrap it up and this was one of them.

The pace in every episode was extremely slow too.

I wanted to like this but unfortunately I'm one of the few who didn't care for this too much.

Same Crime, Different Times.
Signal is a drama that is never missed in a list of thriller recs. Although the MDL synopsis seemed a bit boring to me, I decided to give it a try.

Park Hae Young, a detective, has an open disdain for the police force in spite of working for them. He had witnessed cases being handled for the sake of it's completion and his very own brother framed for a crime he never committed.
Chae Soo Young, his senior and team leader is unforgiving to this attitude, but she realizes that he had more spunk in him. Her sunbae, Lee Jae Han had disappeared 15 years ago.
Fate intertwines the three of their lives after his walkie-talkie that was about to be disposed off is found by Hae Young… leading to a chain of events that create waves in the past and it's ripples in the future. As Hae Young and Jae Han solve the past and the present, Hae Young seeks the answer to Jae Han's disappearance.

Hold onto your seats, because Signal is a mixture of thrill, mystery, suspense, despire, melancholy and various other heart wrenching emotions. The first few episodes deal with regular gory and disgusting cases, both in the past and future timelines (connected by the radio transmissions between Hae Young and Jae Han). It is during the later episodes that the ultimate dark side of the plot is revealed: Jae Han's disappearance.

I did not care for any of the characters initially. We don't see the inner workings of several of them, including Detective Cha. All the events seen through Hae Young's eyes, and his hatred for the police, made him one of my favorite characters. I have never seen the leading actor's performance before, but I'll definitely be checking them out in the future. Jae Han was a typical tsundere puppy whom I grew to slowly adore over the course of time. I loved his bravery and tenacity when it came to solving crimes.
I enjoyed seeing the two sides of Soo Young —- the inexperienced rookie cop and battle hardened detective.

Particular praise for the actor who played Kim Bum Joo, an utterly despicable and corrupted Chief of their Precinct. I wanted him dead until the very end.
The rest of the cast delivered stellar performances, even the minor culprits who popped up.

I loved how every case was solved and handled. As usual, the cops got on my nerves more than the killers. The stress was 100% real and my blood boiled whenever the cases were overturned. I feared for the life of the characters. I hated the villains. I adored the glimpses of family, loyalty and affection that were strong backbones of this drama. The music, especially the BGMs were spot on - I can recall several scenes because of it.

Definitely a must-watch (or must try) for fans of crime and thrillers.

I went into this drama with all the hype surrounding it, expecting a mixture of keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, twists galore a la 38 Task Force and a bit of the grimness/sadness in the character interactions as you would imagine from a drama whose premise is based on time paradoxes. A word of caution, I found it to be slightly overhyped, and some plot points predictable. Around midway through the drama, when they were solving a case, not central to the main plot, I felt like things were dragging a bit.

Why then did I continue to watch this? Of course because things picked up immediately after that especially with the ""Hongwon-dong case"", enough for it to be nail biting until the end. But it is also true that such dramas don't tend to have much re-watch value for me since the suspense factor is gone once you have watched it completely.

Having said that, this was not your usual crime procedural, nor was it like your typical time travel/time paradox drama. This was different, in its plot and execution. It made me think more than usual about time paradoxes, and more than anything, how, you would/could probably never change some decisions, even if you knew, what the consequences would be. The central characters all left a lasting impression. Coincidentally, this was also the very first time I was watching Lee Je Hoon and Jo Jin Woong on screen, and both of them made me sit up and take notice of their acting. Throw in Kim Hye Soo, and this was definitely a seasoned cast at play, I would say! There were no trailing plot threads either and everything was tied up well together till the end. In that, I think Signal has won (hats off to the director, writer and cast).

Finally, the message I take away from this drama is that ""If you don't give up, you can always change your future for the better"", and I will probably be reminded of this whenever I face obstacles in my own life :) Also if ever there was a second season, I think I would not want to give it a pass!

This drama already has so many reviews and I honestly don't think I have much to add on in comparison to some of the other ones. But I have never given a drama a rating of 10 on my first watch. Sometimes, if I rewatch a drama, I'll bump it up to a ten but dramas have NEVER gotten a 10 on the first watch from me...until now.

Which is why I ultimately felt the need to write a review to justify my rating.

An extremely detail-oriented drama with incredible and emotional acting is how I would describe it. Each episode felt like a rollercoaster ride with new twists and turns you did not expect nor have time to anticipate. Settings, props and extra characters were used so purposely and artistically that by the end of watching this drama, I looked around my study area to see what bits of evidence and signs of my daily life I leave behind each day. Of all the police/detective dramas I have seen so far, I've never truly wanted, NO wished more for these characters to be real, to come out from my laptop screen and solve the cold cases in my world.

As other reviews have commented, the acting was phenomenal. From the main cast to the very young actors portraying difficult roles to the nearly insignificant extras, the ENTIRE cast's acting was so palpable, so tangible and so utterly perfect.

I'd be hugely mistaken to leave out the script or the writer in this review. A part of why this drama is so beloved is because of the storyline. Everything is planned out in such organized detail I cannot even begin to imagine how long it took to come up with the script and how many times they must've checked it over and over to make sure everything aligned. All of the cases investigated cover the hot issues often involved in cold cases. These hot issues in part are a reason we as the public are so enthralled by cold cases. ""How on earth did ____ get away with such a horrible crime?!"" The drama does a good job of sticking up for the little guy, avoid victim blaming and placing responsibility is those that need it, all the while offering us a tantalizing investigative thriller.

Where could this drama improve? A very difficult question to answer, but one place they could start with is allowing their characters to have human memory. I noticed that the characters had very good memory (for the most part, excluding the depression-serial killer arch and the surviving witness...). In fact, their memory was so good that they were able to remember infinitesimal details in their surroundings that eventually gave them clues and leads. It was just jarring enough for my suspension of disbelief to fall through occasionally. But I suppose one could argue that they are detectives and are supposed to be on the look out for these kinds of things anyway.

One other thing, and this is just coming from my feminist nit-pickiness but Cha Soo Hyun, though a notable cop in her own right, was never all that critical to the storyline. In the beginning she had a substantial role but near the end she was almost just a love interest? If they took her character out entirely, the storyline as a whole would not have changed too much. She did not help propel the story forward substantially and acted mostly as a support role despite being a main character. I just wished she had as much impact as the two male leads did. (Message me if you disagree, would love a second opinion!)

I also did not give the re-watch value a ten because often times, investigative thrillers are so thrilling because you don't know what will happen next. But I still gave it a high re-watch value because there are so many other reasons for why it would still be interesting to watch a second time through, one being that you could notice the little details planted in each scene you may not have on the first watch.

Finally the OST: the signature old-timey theme was complemented so well with the musical choices and even now, weeks after having completed the drama, I still get chills listening to the theme song.

It's funny because this is a drama I kept looking at and saving in my ""plan to watch,"" but never actually starting. I don't know why I was so apprehensive. If you are feeling the same way, just dive in. I promise, you will not regret it.

Just hours ago I finished this amazing drama. I absolutely loved the narrative and style of Signal and have much to say in praise of the show. I'll break this review down into two categories: 'the good' and 'the bad'.

The Good:
Signal expertly weaves a story that spans decades. The writers use a circular narrative structure to pull the audience in while not revealing too much about the past while the audience and main characters are in the present. Had they not done this I don't think the time manipulation that is so central to what makes Signal work would have been effective. The plot in general is well structured and well crafted. Every episode left me waiting impatiently to start the next and the way the different cases were interwoven gave the audience much to figure out as more details were revealed. The cinematography too is excellent. The mood, tone, and ambiance of the drama is expertly achieved and adds to the storylines by alerting the audience to a scene's overall feel before any dialogue is spoken. The acting too is excellent on almost all fronts. The three main leads especially deserve praise for their emotionally impactful and gripping performances. Personally, I felt that Jo Jin Woong carried this drama. He was beyond amazing as Lee Jae Han and without his performance I don't think the drama would have been as successful and popular as it is.

The Bad:
My main gripe with this drama is with its villains. Early on there are hints of a bigger bad guy than just the perpetrators of the crimes being investigated in each episode. When he is finally revealed it was not shocking and that was okay with me as I felt that he has been built up and foreshadowed well by the writers and so the audience was already predisposed to dislike him. However, this character remains so one dimensional throughout the drama that I felt like I was watching a villain from an old James Bond film. I wanted to know more about his motivations, his character, and maybe see some growth or doubt. None of that came. The character remained stagnant with no deeper motivations or character traits beyond greed. The villain was also strikingly immoral in a way I feel that few actual human beings are. What made the villain stand out as being poorly written for me was how well the writers had done with portraying the inner worlds and motivations of the lesser villains. The perpetrators of the weekly crimes had more interesting backstories and story arcs than the antagonist. This was evidence to me that the writers could write bad guys well and simply failed to do so with our main antagonist. I also took issue with the way Park Hae Young's profiling technique was utilized. His prowess for catching the bad guy was almost otherworldly and to pin all this skill on his talent for profiling seemed highly unrealistic. He was just too good at his job for it to be realistic. I felt that Lee Jae Han's detective techniques and skills were much more realistic and better fit the realism of the story.

Overall Signal was great. It was well written and gripping. However, the antagonist was poorly written and plot devices to move the story along sometimes were too obvious. I would recommend this drama to anyone who likes both the crime and time travel genres. It is not a thriller but it is well paced and leaves you feeling satisfied with its conclusion.

A masterpiece.
That's it. That's the review. Signal is a masterpiece. Anything which follows is flavour text.

If I were asked to recommend a show to someone who had never seen an Asian drama before, Signal would be the recommendation. I'm at a loss for how best to even describe it, as I don't feel like any of the words I could give would do the series justice. In my opinion, Signal has one of the most unique stories I believe I have ever come across on television - definitely within the crime/detective genre, anyway - and it paces itself so well and so confidently that I'm worried it's set the bar too high for me to appreciate any dramas I watch after this.

Every single actor - lead, side or extra - gives every scene their all. You feel your gut wrench or your heart pound as characters are thrown again and again into these intense, impossible situations that sometimes do not have a fairytale ending. You may have seen other reviewers talk about how much they cried watching this, and I am no exception. Some of the cases the detectives are tasked to solve are harrowing, particularly when they are of personal importance to a main character. But the acting is so stunningly good that you cannot help but empathise completely with what each character is going through, regardless of the morality or soundness of their decisions.

For me, this series is a perfect illustration of why it's so important to give more older actors lead roles. The level of acting you are treated to is just unparalleled, and I firmly believe that this series would not have been the same without the seasoned, top-level performances that these veteran actors brought. The lead actress in particular won several national awards for her incredible performance in this series.

Although I wouldn't listen to the OST outside of this drama, I've given music a 10 as each song fit its selected scene like a glove. You can tell a lot of care went into the placement of the music throughout this series. Rewatch value is the only non-perfect score at 9.0, as to me the final episode started to outstay its welcome towards the end. However, this alone was not enough for me to drop any of the other scores from perfect.

TL;DR Signal is, to me, the true definition of a masterpiece. I enjoyed every second of it, and hope you do too.

Signal interested me immediately after reading the description, as I have an avid fascination with time manipulation. I'm happy to say that it kept my attention and even made me tear up a few times!

Signal excels the most in two categories: the plot and the characters.

The plot was surprisingly deep, well-written, and was executed brilliantly. The time manipulation aspect was not corny or cliched.

The characters took some time to develop and to understand completely. The show does a great job of showing perspectives of other characters and revealing backstories to create character depth.

The only weak aspect of the show was the slow pacing, which works well for character development, but not so much for plot progression. Some of the aspects of the main plot are easily forgotten after being dragged on for several episodes.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this show!! Check it out and let me know if there are any other shows that are similar.

Mixed bag
I've read so many raves about Signal and am aware that the drama garnered best drama at the 52nd Baeksang Arts Awards, so I was really looking forward to it. I like gritty detective stories, particularly Scandinavian noir and this sounded right up my alley.

Ultimately, I found myself disappointed in the drama. There was a lot of good, but some lazy storytelling marred the series.

First, the good:
Interesting premise: the idea of a walkie talkie that could connect detectives in modern-day (2015) Seoul with a detective in the past was intriguing and generally well used. I liked seeing detectives work on a case in both timelines--and the effect that solving a crime in the past had on the present. I was particularly intrigued in one episode where using the walkie talkie led to tragic consequences. It wasn't used as a device that magically solved all problems.

Tie in to actual past crimes in Korea. It was interesting to learn about some of these past crimes; I found myself googling the particular crimes to learn more about them.

Character development: I especially loved Detective Lee Jae-han and his commitment to doing the right thing. Park Hae-ye's storyline was also interesting, as we learned about his past family tragedies.

The not-so-good:
The romance between Lee Jae-han and Kim Hye-soo. She seemed mostly a bumbling, enthusiastic rookie with a rather immature one-sided crush on her superior officer. Her behavior seemed inappropriate to me; she kept chasing him even when he expressed his disinterest.

The crime solving relied on coincidence and the hunches of the profilers far too often. In one episode, the detectives in 2015 Seoul are trying to track down the victim of a crime who had lied about her attacker. Park Hae-ye uses his profiling skills to deduce where she might work, and then just happens to see someone walking past him and figures out that it is her--based solely on what? He's never seen her before, but yet she walks past him in the street? Similarly, in the final episode, Lee Jae-han determines that a perpetrator has thrown away a crucial piece of evidence at a rest stop near a particular pharmacy. But by the time he arrives, the trash has been collected. We next see him at the landfill tearing through bags, only for a homeless woman to walk by him with the very item that he needs.

I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the main plot device, but the crime solving aspect was just too far-fetched.

I still give this drama a fairly high score because it was well-directed and well-acted. If only the crime solving had been a bit more thoughtful, this drama would be an ""A"", instead it's a B, maybe a B-

Signal has always been a series which caused me doubts whether I really like it or not as the summaries I have read about this series did not really catch my eye, so I am glad that I gave it the benefit of the doubt (thanks to you voters!) and I ABSOLUTELY love it! It is pretty safe to say that this series is among my favourites right now.

The story was well-created and told in a way that it would keep your interests throughout the show, in which they mislead you with different plot twists and side stories, which eventually were connected to the main story itself.  By dealing with several crime/rape cases. the producers and directors approached each crime in a different way. For example in one crime, you'll know the culprit immediately, while in others you did not. They did even hire the perfect actors/actresses for specific roles as all three of them exceeded my expectations with their performance, especially Lee Je Hoon's role as Park Hae Young impressed me.

So I definitely recommend you all to watch it if you haven't watched it as of yet. It is totally worth it.

This is one drama that I would recommend to all my friends family colleague!! if you are a new fan of k-dramas, you definitely cant miss this thriller drama! from the plot to the small details of this drama, everything is perfect and it really can keep you on your edge of your chair. Although I have watched fashion king (where lee je hoon starred in), I didn't remember the role that he acted in. But after this drama, I'm in lost of words at how amazing his acting is! this has to be his representative drama other than the movie ""architecture 101"" where he acted with suzy in.

OH! if you are a fan of thriller dramas like Signal, I recommend you to watch ""voice""!!! IF YOU ARE MISSING ""SIGNAL"", YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO WATCH ""VOICE""

There's something seriously missing here
I have this thing that if somebody would recommend me to watch something a lot, I would instinctively postpone watching this thing till forever. Normally I want to know as little as possible about the series I’m about to watch, that way I do it with clear mind and no expectation. And maybe that was exactly the problem I was so disappointed after watching Signal. Plus, at the same time I was watching Kairos, series that’s based on very similar idea, and that gave me additional perspective on how Signal is using the motive of communicating with the past.

The idea is relatively simple. In 2017 detective Park Hae Yeong is solving long lasting murder case when he finds old walkie talkie that allows him to communicate with Lee Jae Han, who turns out to be police officer from late eighties, who’s also working on the same case but in the past. Knowledge that they both acquire helps them solve the crimes that were opened for years. But there’s a catch. Every, even slightest change to the past dramatically influences events in the future (or present, depending how we see it). So every step is very risky.

Writing about Kairos couple days ago I admitted that I love time travelling related motives and Signal was actually first on the list, since it was recommended to me so many times. And I’m honestly not sure where does all that praise come from, since Signal turned out to be merely mediocre drama for me.

I’d like to say here that I’d probably won’t be able to restrain myself from comparing Signal to Kairos, so if you don’t want any spoilers from both of the series, please beware.

I like how whole mechanism of communication via walkie talkie was introduced early on. Basically the first episode was pretty neat introduction to the characters and the way changing the future influences future events. So at his point the viewer has more or less knowledge of what can happen when the past is changed. Even tough first episode was pretty slow, at his point it wasn’t an issue. The problem was that the pace was like that basically throughout the whole series. It wouldn’t be that bad if we get some connection with the characters, but unfortunately they seemed so distanced that it was hard to get emotionally attached to them. And I don’t only mean time distanced but I think it also played a valid role in how the drama was viewed. I’ve wrote in Kairos’ review that the strong side of that drama was emotional bond with the characters. We’ve seen events basically from their perspectives. We’ve shared their feeling, we could immerse ourselves in their pain. Here I had the problem that characters of Signal were much more distanced. Obviously one reason was that they weren’t so connected to the cases they’re solving as it was with Kairos. They were also separated by much longer time period. The crimes were mostly pretty old, since in the present timeline they were dealing with very old, sometimes over 20 years old cases. So the emotional attachment towards them was almost inexistent. And I mean, we've seen some tears, we've seen some anger, but it was just not enough.

The first episode also proved that changing the history is not easy even if you know what will happen. There’s just so many variables that there’s always something that can goo wrong. This drama doesn’t give simple solutions, characters need to fight for the truth constantly, not being sure if their methods will work. And of course past doesn’t want to be changed. Every try may result in failure in other aspects of the investigation. Nothing is this drama comes easy for characters.
At one point this drama was so emotionless it was almost painful to watch. Overall slow pace of the show didn’t really help either.

After couple of really slow episodes, in the second half of the season we’ve finally had characters involved somehow in the action. The fact that they were directly connected to the case made it a bit more interesting. The fact thew Park Hae Yeong and Lee Jae Han actually almost met in the past seemed a bit too much of a coincidence but was quickly explained in a way that didn’t really spoiled anything.

Overall I was impressed on how detailed this drama was to all the events, but unfortunately very slow pace any really unlikable characters threw me off. I just couldn’t immerse myself in watching the drama. And I know that it’s very subjective but this drama just didn’t worked with me, it was missing something to make it more alive. What was good story worth when we get characters that cannot deliver it?

And why the hell is Park Hae Yeong whispering so often? Most of his conversations with Cha Soo Hyun are whispered and most of the times is doesn’t really make sense!

So overall, I really wanted to like this drama. It seems to fit perfectly in my interests. But I just couldn’t. I see good sides of it, I see well developed plot, but no chances to actually get caught up in it.

The potential...
So yesterday I finished the drama, and honestly I wanted to love it so so much but it just couldn't live up to my expectations. I really liked the plot, the music, the visual, it gave me a bit of a True Detective feeling. And still I nearly dropped the whole thing after the 4th episode, because the writing pissed me up so much. Basically every character was terribly written.
Lee Jae Han: Who is despite a policeman, creeping on his crush following her from 10 meter and hiding behind bushes when she turns? And literally trying to run away when the girl approaches him? Srsly? As a fresh policeman he should be more than 14 years old i guess. At least later on the show he matures and from there he is the most realistic character of them all.
Park Hae Yeong: The absolute worst character I ever met. In the majority of the show he just stares into the abyss with a question mark above his head, or just simply asking back to every piece of information given three times.
He is not the killer!
He is not the killer?
No he is not
So…. he is not?
Despite he supposed to be the brain in the “team”, he was basically useless in the entire show. He is definitely not a professional detective, just a selfish emotional idiot. Sometimes I was truly thinking he got some mental challenges to understand the most basic things happening around him…
The Cold cases team, is also a non existent thing, because the show falls into the most brasil soap op cliche of all times, the members are not talking to each other, not sharing informations the typical thing where a problem could be solved with 2 sentences but, nooo the characters just staring each other and then walking away silently… Oh Cmooon!
I understand they wanted drama everywhere but this is not the way you should make drama. This is just bullshit. I was preparing myself for the episode where they show us the Inju case (the main thing. The case which started all of this), I really hoped they will give to the `what happened that day` a full episode placed only in the past, and show us (the viewers) the brutality of the gang rape, how the whole village knows what happened, who did it, but keeps silent because of the absolute power of the cement company… That could have been dramatic where we see how bad is when company leaders have absolute power on people and even the police. What we got? A half episode a weird rape scene where one person rapes the girl who gets into the hospital after? So it wasnt a gang rape then? Or when did it actually happened? Did I miss something?
Every time something good happened, and I started to lay back to finally enjoy the show the writers decided to make some idiot choice which ruined the whole experience again and again leaving me frustrated because this show had so much potential. The way Lee Jae Han finds the scarf… I'm still shocked how bad that was. And why the heck they had to explain everything like two times to the viewers? I constantly felt the writers thinking im stupid or just really slow like Park Hae Yeong. I remember the scene where I was like “finally the scene they made clever”. It was the photographers missing girlfriend and the fact she was reading a book and they just showed the book in her hand for a split second and I was like omg yess the book the book! And what happened next? I can imagine the writers were like “Oke, we need to explain to the people what is happening because you know not all of them are so smart like our police” and bammm another disappointing solution. Same with the woman who comes back to SK because of the sick mother. You can put together the puzzle pieces but noooo Cha Soo Hyun explains you everything when she talks to the sister…

Im so pissed, because this could have been a unique masterpiece but the lazy, incompetent writing ruined the show for me.

Important Review Must Read!
I have not finished watching but I had to do the review beforehand. The United States movie ""Signal"" was nothing like this movie but it had to do with a murder case. This Kdrama and the Amerian movie Signal are both great. The KDrama had more of a story to it which I so appreciate. Lee Je Hoon whose character Park Hae Yeong was very strong and convincing as a profiler. I need to see more with this actor. Kim Hye Soo who played Cha Soo Hyun was also a strong and compassionate emotional female detective, she was also doing a believable job. I will let you know the rest as I finish watching it. I have not skipped any episodes because it has me focused on. Now the bad part.

Important: I always research the actor's main lead and supporting.

If u like murder mysteries n stuff, then this is the drama for you, I loved it from the beginning to end. No dragging, it keeps you on your toes all the time! 2 detectives from different times communicate through a walkie talkie to solve unsolved crimes of Korea. For me this drama was mysterious and interesting.
But the end, is it really the end? It is as if you have watched something only half.. the ending leaves you waiting for more!

All in all; a very solid drama.


It was better than good but the time travel / time skip / change the past and future aspect doesn't agree with me.

I do not like watching the characters meet and form relationships, form my opinion on these characters and relationships, pick favorites and root for something and then towards the end the writers say; oh btw; these did not happen.

It may help the story, but I do not like it.

just straight up a waste of time
Just bad. The first maybe 3 episodes were great and promising and then everything just took a turn for the worst. Every fucking thing is inconsistent and everyone is just evil. It's like they just had a big ball of the worst things humankind could do and kept picking chits out of it every 20 minutes. No catharsis AT ALL just pain and discomfort. Why were all the murders only of women and children? God i could write a whole book of the the plot holes and issues I have with this drama. Can't believe I wasted so much time — my sister and I started the show one night and got hooked initially but it was so fucking dumb and bad as it progressed BUT we couldn't stop. The agony. We had to complete nearly 18 hours worth of run time in 10 hours by skipping tonnes of shit and watching it at 1.5x (don't worry you won't miss anything) I've never hated lead characters this much ever before the two male leads (esp lee jehoon) were all that kept me going. And I generally only like the women in a show but MY GOD did they make me hate the FL. Just bad don't watch this show it's just awful. I should've just read about it on dramabeans. As a film and writing student especially i really lost the will to live while watching this raging pile of dogshit the crew and cast that worked on this need to reflect on their actions.

Signal was definitely a worthwhile watch, but the top review does highly overrate it. It is absolutely not the best storyline I've ever watched, although I do feel that K-drama storylines have recently become so trashy that this drama comes off as a ray of sunshine.

This is a crime solving story where there are 5 cases featured throughout the story with one big underlying ""final boss"" that the main characters are getting closer to identifying. There aren't many action or thriller moments but the suspense is great. There are a lot of flashbacks (there should be a category for rating the quality of flashbacks haha. side note: what's with the popularity of flashbacks these days? they're honestly so annoying to watch) but they're pretty well done and you don't feel like you're watching the same scenes replay over and over again throughout the entire drama.

Characters were pretty good! It was a great display of corruptions vs virtue and I think these traits were well written into the character. Lee Jae Han was the STAR of the story; you can't help but fall in love with him. He's so valiant and virtuous, storming towards justice yet stumbling through romantic situations. While this character is loveable, it is very overdone. That would be my one comment about this drama; it didn't feel ""new,"" but rather you were watching a story and characters that you're familiar with play out in an expected but definitely interesting way. While parts feel a bit TOO clean cut, theres still that sense of you don't know who will live, what will change, and who will die.

Continuing off that, while the story isn't new, there ARE twists that are unexpected (but nothing too outlandish or surprising). I cried episode 5 which I didn't expect to happen so quickly.

TL;DR I'm a kdrama watcher in their eariy 20's, so if you're bored by over-the-top romantic comedies and looking for something more serious (and a story that follows a line and doesnt just implode on itself) then I would highly recommend!

acting is a bit over the top
i was curious about this series because it has high ratings.. but now that im on episode 5, im still waiting for that reason that why i shouldn't stop watching this show. one of the main things that frustrate me is the MAIN LEAD, i feel so tired watching him act.. he talks like someone is chasing him... not sure if this is his character but i feel frustrated every time i see him on screen.

one word: over acting.
the female lead though acts naturally. the rest feels OVER the top.

I wish this male lead at least just acts naturally. in my POV i don't think someone acts that way in the middle of the case.... or while researching.

A miss, yet again.
I liked the lead actress and the past tense detective unfortunately that was not enough to keep me watching. I do not like flashbacks and nonlinear timelines in general but I could have overlooked that had the overall delivery been good but it really was not the case. The build up to the climax is great then it falls flat. It's seems like a pattern that many action/crime/thriller Korean dramas follow. It's really a shame because they have potential.
The acting bit is where it really did not disappoint. All the featured actors where anywhere from descent (the one that kidnapped the child) to great. I really did like the main actress a lot. The ""female law enforcement character"" is often a good one in Korean dramas that I must applaud.

Signal is one of the best K-dramas of 2016. The story involves time-overlapping; detectve Lee Jae-han is moving backward in time, while profiler Park Hae-young is moving forward in time. The drama is en par with the best British police detective dramas. The music and the suspense reminded me of the British Broadchurch drama, but Signal eclipsed Broadchurch in the story department.

Bad Guys: City of Evil sets itself apart from its parent drama, Bad Guys. The way the writer ties in the parent drama into this one is simple and sets the tone of it being in the same universe, but ensuring that this drama is not its parent, and has a story of its own that is carried out in a completely different manner and for different reasons than the original. No watcher should go into City of Evil expecting the same story or something too similar to the original Bad Guys—you'll be disappointed and won't be able to enjoy the story as much if you expect it to be so.

The story itself is an okay one, but one that most of us who have watched dramas surrounding corruption and prosecution should expect with a few twists and turns that give City of Evil it's heart. As it gets towards the end it loses some of the plot and some plots holes (to me) never really get resolved or in the midst of so many plot devices, get lost in the overall story. However, the gem in this drama isn't the story line, but the heart of the cast who did a beyond amazing job with their characters. There isn't one character you won't be rooting for, you won't cry for, from main cast to supporting—and if you watch close enough, you may recognize a familiar face or two from Bad Guys. Above all, Bad Guys and City of Evil are the exact same in one area—the teamwork and camaraderie between the characters is really admirable and what I really watch for.

It's packed with great action scenes, and the music score and OSTs from the drama help set a really great mood for such a dark drama. I don't think I'll really ever rewatch this drama much as I did Bad Guys, but I overall really enjoyed watching it and suggest it for somebody who wants an action packed drama with really great acting. It dives right into the chaos and you just get to go along for the ride.

I am trying to be fair when writing about this drama. From the first episode to the last I just saw a bunch of men brawling: there was brawling in a building, brawling a another building , brawling in a hotel , brawling on the wharf brawling in an underground garage and yet more brawling. The story was the typical Korean corruption story, good guys make a step and then fall 3 steps behind. If you like this kind of drama then you will enjoy this.
Why I was disappointed?

The characters:
The first 'Bad Guys' hit me hard. It was different. The criminals were not just senseless persons that went around throwing their fists- 'me man lets see who fists is tougher' while beating their chest. They were intelligent.

The story:
I am not comparing this to the first Bad Guys but I would think that if I am making something of the idea of something else then I would at least make it have something of the original. The first was an original the second was made from a blueprint of every other Korean drama out there. The only thing that was missed was amnesia. (I guess that would have been too ridiculous) If the child have not characteristics of its parents then it was probably adopted.

If you want a good action show I would recommend watching Heartless City instead.

This drama was packed with action. I loved every moment of it. I have a type...and this shows was filled with them. Love the strong big tough guy that can kick ass but for all the right reasons.

All of the main characters were great. They didn't need to say a word...they just needed to beat everybody up. Yang Ik Jun my fav prosecutor. He knew the law and knows how to kick ass at the same time. What more can you ask for? My fav.....Joo Jin Mo (OMG!!!) He had me at hello. He could be put up against thirty men and he would destroy all of them. I knew that no matter what the situation was, if he was there...they could fight their way out alive. Ji Soo (Han Gang Joo) is much better here than in Strong Woman. Although acting wise it was a little of the same but a bit darker. He used his fist to do most of the talking. and Han Jae Young (Park Jin Tae) rounded these beautiful men for me. It was a smorgasbord of these men and I couldn't get enough. I would definitely feel safe with men like them watching over me.

I know it is acting but everyone in that show can sure take a punch. There is no reason why you can still walk around after being stabbed, beaten with a metal pipe, hammer or bat.

Story...
Corruption, murder...the usual stuff you see so I was ok with it. At times, I was a bit anxious when the bad guys were blatantly getting away with murder and couldn't be caught. I know it was to stretch it out but I wanted to go in there and beat them up myself. I liked the way they basically created three stories that all circled around the same bad guy...Jo Young Gook. He was very good as the bad guy. He and Ha Sang Mo to me were funny. I know they were bad but I still liked them. Jung Suk Won although a bad guy was sooooo sexy. I loved watching him and Joo Jin Mo fight.

Music...
I loved the hip hop music being played throughout. I don't really pay attention to music but I felt it was appropriate for this type of drama.

Re-watch...I don't really like watching an entire show over again after I am done. Perhaps and episode here or a part in a particular episode I can do but not the entire thing.

From the ending, it looks like there will be a third installment of Bad Guys. Tae Soo from the first one showed up at the end. I think it would be epic if the guys from the first drama teamed up with the guys from the second one. They would be unstoppable. Criminals would not stand a chance. I would definitely like to see that happen. Hopefully, I won't have to wait long. YAY!!!

Bad Guys: City Evil had a cool story to tell.

Unfortunately it lacked all the elements that had me hooked on the predecessor. Personally I am not someone who cares much about plot, but instead about character development and relation dynamics and I did not feel either of these topics were well explored in this drama.

If you disliked the first Bad Guys drama because of problems or lack of focus with plot elements then I can definitely say the sequel has improved on this problem and you may enjoy this iteration in this series more. However if you came because you enjoyed the original drama's focus on character and relationship developments between the main cast like I did you will be definitely disappointed as these were definitely not the focus of this entry.

unfortunately, bad guys 2 did not manage to live up to its predecessor. i will mention that the premise of bad guys 2 is totally different from bad guys. so if you go into this show expecting something along the lines of the parent story, you'll be quite disappointed.

aside from it being totally different than its parent story, this drama fails to engage the viewer. the plot is all over the place, the characters are confusing and they're not interesting at all. for the first half there's only senseless violence and death. i would've liked to see it until the end, but alas, i'll be dropping it because i can't make myself go on.

i will, however, appreciate whoever scored the show. playing linkin park was an unexpected but pleasant surprise. the osts for this show are quite good as well.

Same universe with S01 but unlike it, doesnt develope with a psychological vantage point.
The story and the plot is simple but designed accordingly. Itsnt something new or unthought before but executed smootly. The cast might not be found spot on like their predecessors but theres nobody seen to be rejected by their roles or any mismatch. Judging music isnt my strong suit but I found them good enough and helpfull to the cause of dramatic intetions. In my opinion nothing is %100 rewatchable because of the obvious reasons like being aware of the plot but some pieces are can be rewatch after enough time passes and can be enjoyed to some extend and this's one of them. This drama, in my opinion of course, easly going to have a special place fot itself in the near future among others with such genre. I'm pretty sure its rating doesnt show its true value and will be change for the better very soon.

Does alot of things better than season 1.
Bad Guys: City Evil is a tough cookie to crack. Sometimes it can feel jarring with excessive fight scenes, lots of unnecessary violence (not a problem for heavy action fans) and weak character development on the main cast during the first half, but man, its really an engaging and thrilling experience.

Lets begin with the characters. The casting is perfect. I doubt anyone could play these respective roles better than the assigned cast. They all have their own unique motives for their actions, which nicely connects to the over arching plotline, as well as compliment each other.

First half undoubtedly was a weak point in character development. Much of the cast was barely explored, and towards the end of the show, alot of them still remain unfulfilled. I wish we had a few more episodes dedicated to just the cast itself. Instead of chasing the plot to the end. Would've loved to see flashbacks of Heo working for Jo. Jang Sung Cheol's relationship with Pil Su and how far back they go. So many things i wish were explained/shown. But its really not a deal breaker. The plotline is so much more engaging and well written, it helps overshadow these cons.

Moving onto the story. Brilliantly written. Fantastic twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. Devastating losses, and thrilling moments, really cements it as a superb action show. The primary villain of the show, Jo Young, is insanely well realised. Even though he may come off as a one dimensional baddie at times, he still helps bring an ominous intimidating factor to the show. One downside is the latter half of the show, where his character is ruined, the writers really took a massive dump on him. The first half is action heavy, if your'e a fan of fantastic fight choreography and large scale combat, this is a wet dream. So very well shot. Done alot better than most shows. Though sometimes the awful zoom shots can really disorient viewers sitting close to their screens. I love the gruesome imagery with really bloody makeup on the cast. They dont have a perfect face by the end of most fight scenes, which makes it alot more realisitc. The impact of weapons and punches is gritty and really hits you on your nerves. They didnt hold back for viewers weak to heavy violence. And i love it. The fight scenes do dim down as the show progresses. The quieter and arguably better paced second half helps balance the show and give it a much needed relief moment.

The direction? Really good. Loved the fantastic camera placements and still shots throughout the show. Really helps capture the moment and immerse the audience. Moments that are quiet, have good shot selection and emphasis on characters. Nice use of depth of field to blurr the background and keep ample focus on the cast. Wide shots capturing the entire set is probably my favourite. Those moments really awe me.

Soundtrack? Solid. Nice composition which fits the theme. Nice mixing and timing for selected music during scenes. Overall. Nothing wrong at all in this aspect.

Bad Guys: Vile City in my opinion, is, superior to the first show and most ways. It improves via a better and well thought out storyline, better pacing, better direction, even if the characters fall short.

I believe this show would've been perfect if it ended a couple of episodes before the final ep. And the rest was left to explore characters, and chemistry on a episodic story basis. But alas what we have is nothing short of brilliant.

Thank you.

I think its important to set expectations when watching this kdrama. Its not a sequel to the original bad guys but you will quickly figure out how they are related. It also doesn't really continue the idea which bad guys was about (bringing together a team of criminals to solve crimes). Its structured more closely to Chief Kim of all things. Essentially the drama has multiple arcs, each dealing with a boss related to the same corrupt scheme. It progresses pretty well but it can be kind of confusing. By episode 6 though things do become more clearer. There are some good twists in the drama and I was satisfied.

The original Bad Guys was more like a noir tv show that transcended the kdrama formula. This fall more in line with other crime, cop dramas.

Law, Order, Justice -- a double edged concept
If the intent with Bad Guys: Vile City’s opener was to be impactful, I have to say it was successful. Not only was it impactful it had me wondering why I had kept off watching it for such a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed the first installation of Bad Guys, not that I see this as a sequel but more as an extension and a pivotal one at that. The extent to which law, order, and justice are marginalized, making gangsters out of those who swore to protect the sanctity of the law, is horrifying. I can only imagine how bad it must’ve been for anyone, let alone a team of prosecutors, detectives, and public service persons, to take extreme measures of hiring and working with lawbreakers to catch criminals.

I couldn’t for a life of me understand why this group of law officials turned gangsters would need Noh Jin Pyung (Kim Mu Yeol), a rookie prosecutor on their team. Not only that, throw him in the chaos and expect him to follow suit blindly. I was baffled until I realized Noh wasn’t just a witness that could bring Jo Young Gook’s (Kim Hong Pa) criminal organization down but was a pivotal member of OH Goo Tak’s (Kim Sang Joong) Bad Guy’s. It all starts to make sense.

Aside from the impressive opener, I hadn’t realized Joo Jin Mo was part of Bad Guys: Vile City’s cast. I genuinely enjoy his method acting style. The way he immerses himself in his roles, and particularly here as Heo Il Hoo, a widely feared, former violent mobster who turns to the right side of the law after an assassination attempt, was fantastic to watch. Kim Mu Yeol, on the other hand, I was not familiar with until this drama, and he has my respect. The way he delivers the role, the conflict between good and evil, always on edge, constantly torn between law and lawlessness, was beyond impressive. Woo Je-mun (Park Joong-hoon) is another actor I am embarrassed to say I had never encountered before as an experienced prosecutor on a crusade. After losing two colleagues trying to follow the letter of the law, he decides to employ the same dirty tricks his target uses.

The same goes for Ji Soo as Han Gang-Joo, a young man, a killer who lived his entire life as an underdog, making every sacrifice to support and protect his younger sister. After an assassination attempt on his sister (meanwhile, the mayor’s secretary), Gang-Joo joins the investigative team, both for revenge and atonement. There is no forgetting Jang Sung Cheol (Yang Ik-June), psychopathic gambling, drug addict detective, broken to no repair but ironically determined, without compromise, to fight corruption to his last breath. Of course, there’s no forgetting Ji Seung Hyun as hitman Joo Jae Pil for the short time he was in the drama. He is a versatile actor who seems to excel in any role he takes, be it a sensitive veterinary in You Are My Spring to a morally ambiguous newspaper report in The Good Detective or a straight and narrow conglomerate in Hello Me.

A lot happens in Bad Guys: Vile City and when one takes a closer look at the totality of what makes a group of prosecutors and police detectives unafraid to deal out random violence and torture, but not only that band with an ex-mobster and an assassin, one can understand why they become determined to cross the line to battle organized crime, get revenge, and end institutional corruption in their city. More than the method Bad Guys: Vile City uses to reach its goal, it’s the journey it takes where a group of people who have nothing in common bond and come together beyond their common purpose sets it apart from other like dramas in a way including Bad Guys.

I really don't get why people are complaining this sequel saying it didn't live up to its name. Yes the prequel was hell of a ride but this was too. The only complaint I had was i wished they stuck to one story rather than many. Maybe connecting them in a bit better way would have helped. One thing that was similar in both the dramas was the amazing and strong cast. Both dramas had seasoned actors giving their best and doing hell of an awesome job at it. I honestly did not see where people were coming form saying this was bad. For me this was just as good as the previous.

Also another thing, do not go into this expecting a happy ending. My heart was racing the entire time scared as to who would die next. More than half the team died and I didn't even know what to feel at the end. You didn't know who the hell was the good guy and who was the bad guy till the end. Up till the ending sequence I was not sure who was good and who was bad which in my opinion was one of the best aspects of the drama. As per the last one and as per all of the writer's works this drama too heavily relied on comradeship which is what makes me totally addicted to this writer's work. If you go see his resume you can literally see how many awesome dramas the scriptwriter has done.

Well I wouldn't mind another season with the same cast, maybe make it a twist and add the old cast too yet still I'm kinda excited for the movie which would have taken place between these two seasons.

Another plus point, make sure you watch after the ending sequence in the last episode. You will be in for a treat ;)

I am absolutely mesmerized by the writers' talent. Bad Guys 2 was a major upgrade from 'local police mystery' in Bad Guys 1 (not saying that it wasn't good), which took on politics and the importance of civilians of a city. Just like BG1, BG2 was rich in moral messages from the writers. These moral messages hit me hard even back in BG1, but BG2 had an even bigger impact on me, as it was a mirrored representation of modern politics happening in real life. One of the most grim things about this drama was how many good men we have to lose due to the idiocy of politicians and businessmen.

Even though the drama is over for me, I still want to cry a bit as I remind myself of the things one of the lawyers said to the protagonist prosecutor... Despite being in ugly situations 85% of the time, he held onto his faith for good civilians and never stopped believing that there are other good guys out there. The drama also happened to wrap up around his original statement, where he came to convince people not to vote for a biased referendum, and yet, nobody came to vote. He was the happiest man on earth when that happened, for he realized there are good civilians out there, who were aware that voting in the referendum would result in great losses. If you read this but you're worried that the drama was spoiled for you - don't worry, I didn't spoil anything for you at all. This is merely a minor detail to the story which serves as a message from the writers. The drama's ending that's focused on protagonists and antagonists is much more impactful.

Without rambling on and on, let me move onto the characters.
All characters and cast were fantastic, every single one of them was a bad ass. I love their tempers, however there is something the writers left behind in BG1. While I still liked the protagonists, there was a distinct lack of warmth in their backgrounds, in BG2. We were not really given much to decipher the stories behind our protagonists, other than the fact that they were hurt by BG2's antagonists before the drama started. Sometimes I even get the impression the writers did not want us to get to know the protagonists better, for obvious reasons. Watch the drama for yourself, I don't think I should go into more detail.
The antagonists were actually quite impressive too - the writers did not stick with the good ol' defeat the evil drama. There were good and bad kinds of evil in this drama, which in my opinion was very educative. Some antagonists were blatantly egoistic, but there were also some that still had morals. In fact, there were several times when I was able to sympathize with one of the antagonists because they were better than the other antagonists. It scares me, but at the same time satisfies me.

The plot was a masterpiece. It is far from being the plain old 16 episode drama showing you how the protagonists arrested the antagonist. Despite being shown who the antagonist is in episode 1, you will be surprised at how the drama proceeds with the plot. If you're tired of watching dramas with an obvious ending, this drama is perfect for you, because it does not have an obvious ending.

The ambient touch to the music was perfect for setting the mood. There was also korean hip hop or rap to balance it out, but also to show the strength and masculinity of the protagonists, which I believe was great. Seriously, it was a perfect fit for one of the most exciting things about this drama - the violence. By this, I of course mean the fights. In my personal opinion, I wish there was more fights in BG2, as it looks like there was more in BG1, but I'm not complaining. As the ending hints that there will be yet another BG drama, I really hope that the fights will get better for the upcoming BG3.

Honestly, its beautifully shot and there's Ji Soo, I'm a huge fan and it gave me an intense rush, violent, gritty and fast paced action literally never stops.

A bit lacking in emotional depth. More violent than the last one, and there's Ji Soo, so naturally I had a great time. But it's pretty messed up, so be warned. But the cinematography is excellent.

Emotional depth wise I prefer the first season with Park Hae Jin. But plenty of content for those who can take violence. Another thing, in the last one they were actual serial killers but in this show pretty much all the back stories reveal people who are basically innocent.

There is some connection to the first season but is pretty much its own story. I liked all the cast but I think the first season had a better narrative. This second season had a bit too much going on and felt a bit confusing at times when the special crew went looking for suspects, cuz there was more than one, and I definitely suck ass with Korean names, I couldn't keep up with which suspect was which one.

But I gotta say I wasn't expecting and was disappointed that a major character was was taken out by the second half of the show. I still liked the show enough to watch it all the way though. But really that snippet they put at the end....they better be making a third season then. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. Because it'd be so lame of the producers to introduce that and then not have a third season. Then again look at what OCN did with TEN (two season and they didn't even conclude it - I really hated when they do this). So fingers' cross this will get a third.

Overall: not as great as the first season but still good.

Rewatch: no

Just watch Season 1. Its incredible and amazing. I loved it.
I will suggest you to not to watch it. Such a bad plot I have never seen. I wasted my time watching 9 epi so you should not do it. Just watch Season 1. Its incredible and amazing. I loved it. Park Hae Jin character is lovable in season 1. But please don't waste your time here. You are surely gonna regret like me. So please even if you have started then stop please. They will kill one of the main character in epi 8. And don't even have his proper funeral. I really hate that. I was watching it because of him

This is no where near like the first one
I tried as hard as I could to watch this. It's very slow and all over the place.

I'm all for action but all it was in the first two episodes was just guys fighting each other and killing some and for what reason??

I couldn't follow this mainly because they were dropping so many names I couldn't tell who they were talking about. Now I've already stated in several reviews that I suck at names. By this being foreign it makes it even worse for me so when they said some names I was like 'who the heck are they talking about?'

The cinematography in this was absolutely horrible! From dark backgrounds to extreme shaky fighting scenes, this made it even harder to follow.

This series was about political corruption. Then again what Korean drama isn't w/o it's political corruption. That's the only thing I could follow.

There was no chemistry in the cast because nobody cared about anybody. Everybody was just too angry about their own issues and that was it.

When I saw that there was a sequel to the first and I read the plot I told myself I wasn't going to watch this because it didn't reel me in. The only reason I went back on my word was b/c I've hit some Korean drama droughts and decided to give this a shot. I did and it's a drop for me.

I was drawn to this because the vibe seemed so different from most KDramas, and I really liked that, but Itaewon Class is the kind of drama that I think tries too hard to be cool and relevant. I like that it tackled a few topics like race, gender identity, ageism, and social status, but it also does it in a way that was too corny for me to take seriously. I still want to give it an E for effort because I liked the idea of the diversity and inclusive vibe of Itaewon. What initially drew me in about the story was the revenge plot, which sadly got overshadowed by an annoying love triangle... square... pentagon... which eventually ruined everything for me. The only consistent likable thing for me throughout was Park Seo Joon as Sae Ro Yi.

I think Sae Ro Yi is a great character. Watching him navigate epic hardships and relationships with an endearing stubbornness and loyalty was my favorite thing about the show. I've loved Park Seo Joon in so many dramas, he never disappoints, so this drama just solidifies what a great actor I think he is. Surprisingly the one area where he is weakest in this drama is the ""romance"" aspect, but that's not his fault. From ""Witch's Romance"" to ""What's Wrong with Secretary Kim"" it's obvious to me that he is a great romantic lead, but the problem here is that the romance plot is the weakest part of this drama. His relationship with Nara as Oh Soo Ah had an initial spark of chemistry but was soon too repetitive, and I thought his relationship with Kim Da Mi as Jo Yi Seo made absolutely no sense! They had no chemistry but seemed to appease some fans so it felt like it was forced into a story that didn't need it.

More than romance this drama focuses on friendship and loyalty. The cast is full of interesting characters who learn to accept and depend on each other with Sae Ro Yi as their guide. I liked the supporting cast in general, even if their acting skills weren't all equal. My favorite performance of the supporting cast was Lee Joo Young as Ma Hyun Yi, and sadly my least favorite was Chris Lyon as Toni (who's Korean was way more impressive than his acting... but I don't speak Korean so that's just a guess lol). I also thought Ahn Bo Hyun was great and consistently unlikeable as Geun Won, and Yoo Jae Myung was epically evil as Jang Dae Hee, and I love epic villains worthy of epic revenge! I can't really say that anyone was bad, but many in the cast were more decent actors than amazing.

The breakout star is clearly meant to be Kim Da Mi as Yi Seo, but she was not my favorite. She's a great actress, and was an interesting character in the beginning, with her sociopath social media savvy persona, but she soon became annoyingly obsessive and childishly whiny. I wanted to root for her being a young empowered and clever female lead character, but instead, she felt needy, self-involved, and just too hard to like at times... most times. The forced love story definitely didn't help me like her character. I guess some people found her devotion cute, but I thought it was creepy. I think people liked her IDGAF attitude, but I found her selfishness irritating, which overshadowed anything I liked about her initially.

That brings me to the plot, which was just messy! It starts out as the motivational story of a pied piper of misfits bringing random people together to create his dream to fulfill his epic plans of revenge, and suddenly focuses instead on a really bad love story. I can't blame the age gap, because the first drama I saw him in was a romance with a huge age gap. I just think the match didn't work and was so awkward to watch no matter how hard they tried to make it a thing. Then evil characters started to be less realistic and more cartoony, and things suddenly resolved and fell into place way too easily. Even though there are many moments I still liked, overall the script is more bad than good. I waited to watch the last 4 episodes because I stopped caring, and the last 2 episodes were so painfully drawn out and dragged so much that I was tempted to drop the drama with only 30 minutes left in the last episode. Even all of the confrontation and fight scenes that the show was building up to were boring to watch.
This has the same Director as "" Big"", one of the most ridiculously awful dramas I have ever watched, so maybe this turn isn't surprising after all.

Would I watch this again? Obviously not, and I almost wish I would have dropped this sooner, but I was still too invested in Sae Ro Yi and all he went through to give up on this completely. The ending was good about addressing everything that needed to be addressed and had a few moments that I liked but It still was not satisfying enough to make me like this drama as a whole.

Overall, I was excited by the beginning but the thrill didn't last till the end. Yes, there was an overall message that I am not mad at... about friends like family, what real power is, and what really matters in life, but the weak love story, rushed character development, predictable resolutions, and lack of emotional depth didn't execute those themes well enough in the end. It looked visually cool, but the substance felt too immature and unrealistic for me. I wouldn't personally recommend this drama, but I can understand how people can like it more than I did, especially if they liked Kim Da Mi's character a lot. For Park Seo Joon fans it may be worth it to watch even just the beginning, then decide on your own if it's worth your time. Personally, I wish I could edit out whole parts of the drama to make it better, but instead, I will move on to something better while looking forward to the next Park Seo Joon drama instead. It did make me curious about visiting Itaewon when I finally make it to Korea, because they did make it look cool, so I guess that's a good thing too.

Is SEO-JOON enough for you to watch a series?
Netflix aired this show WHERE i lived 2 episodes behind Korea - I went from looking forward to fresh episodes (even trying to find the latest episodes online) to completely forgeting there were new ones.

The series started out great, the first few episodes were standouts, the problem was it wasnt able to continue the momentum. It felt like the rest of the episodes dragged on that i was wishing the series would just end. It didnt feel like the show is reaching a climax and by the end i was bored.

Id only give this show an overall 7.5 just because of PSJ, he did, after all, acted his ass off in this drama. Yoo Jae Myung is amazing. I feel like Kim Da Mi is far too young for PSJ and to tell honestly, their chemistry a bit lacking. I love Lee Joo Young but why does a real woman play a transgender woman character??? Her beauty is distracting that i find it hard to believe she is a transgender.

Would i reccommend it - if you're a PSJ fan, yes. If not, you can skip it.

Itaewon Class was an emotional ride with an especially promising start. Just after the first two episodes, I felt immensely attached to the main character, Park Saeroyi, and was looking forward to following him on his journey. Throughout the 16 episodes, I definitely learned a lot from his hardwork and values. Park Seo Joon did a phenomenal job with his character and left me in absolute awe. Whether it may be understanding the beauty of life or being reminded the importance of hardwork; I was thankful to be able to get to know and learn from Park Saeroyi.

However, apart from Park Saeroyi, I did have a few complaints for the other characters. Some characters were especially annoying, and lacked development. I did like that the drama showcased imperfect characters, but it also sometimes excused the ignorant behaviour of these characters - almost making it seem that such behaviour was appropriate to viewers. Some characters were especially inconsistent, and just seemed random. This switch was really annoying to see because it didn't make sense. I think these characters had a lot of potential to really compliment the story, but the writer just changed them randomly in order to make Park Saeroyi look good. I wish the side characters had contributed a little more to the overall plot but unfortunately we were unable to see that as viewers.

The show also became a little slow in the middle, but then quickly picked up its pace later. I was disappointed with the last two episodes as I felt that there were unnecessary additions to the plot. However, the ending was still quite nice and most questions were answered.

Overall, this was definitely a meaningful and enjoyable watch. The reason why this show is receiving such a high rating (from me) despite its flaws is because of the lessons it served. As I saw this show and went about my life, I found myself thinking about Park Saeroyi and the importance of hardwork. Even if it was fiction, I really learned a lot from this drama and was thankful for the insights I gained. In addition, Itaewon class held some especially beautiful scenes that had my heart racing and gave me goosebumps. The OSTs were beautiful, and I know I will play them countless times in the future! Itaewon Class may have been lacking in some areas, but it was still a great show that managed to keep me eagerly waiting for new episodes each week ((:

When I first heard about this upcoming drama I hesitant to watch because there was a lot of hype surrounding the cast, mainly the star Park Seo Joon. I've watched a lot of his work so I didn't understand what the fuss was about. The show had not even begun and I thought it's probably overrated.

And it turned out to be true.

I like to highlight all the good points of a drama first least I be accused of bias (which I am half the time) but it's really to acknowledge someone's hard work. A lot of times we dislike dramas and then fall into a rant and I myself am guilty of this on numerous occasions but someone gave their best effort and it might not reach everyone the way they expect but good on them for doing what others could not.

That said what drew me to the show initially was the fact that it was a webtoon turned drama. I'm a big fan of these as they offer more range of expressions for the characters. You get to see them as more. For this drama the acting was top notch, with a special shout out to Kim Da Mi, she gave a phenomenal performance. Park Seo Joon continues to showcase his range and talent.

Another blast is the diversity of the cast. I loved it.

The first 6 episodes were very attention grabbing and I thought maybe I was wrong, the was definitely living up to hype but then it fell into the standard kdrama mold. The storyline was not strong to begin with but if it was told well I wouldn't have minded. It started strong then dragged in the middle then had a sloppy happily ever after ending that made me regret starting the show in the first place.

Park Sae Ro Yi (love the name) character showed almost no growth. He was practically the same from the beginning of the story to the end. The show was a span of fifteen years and it was only after an accident he resolved his feelings about his father and his love interest in a dream. In a show about David fighting goliath, that is how he reached personal growth? Doesn't count in my book.

Next pet peeve was the so called romance. The show wasn't focused on it at all and it should have remained so. It would have been better off without it instead of trying to shove a bunch of intimate scenes in the last three episodes. By this point I didn't care about any of the coupledomes. I was heavily invested in Park Sae Ro Yi's revenge. I wanted him to get his revenge and witness the ensuing fall out but none of that happened.

My Opinion

Sometimes I think the art of storytelling is dying but I know it's just being pressured under the weight of ratings and popularity which is sad. A lot of the dramas today have strong starts or interesting premises but get derailed by trying to win people over and marketing. But i keep patient because every once in a while I strike gold. This wasn't it but it was ok.

"" Itaewon Class "" had a strong start but it didn't keep up with the momentum.

The main problem with the drama was the pace. The skipping forward years in the future prevented the characters from having any character development and it just didn't help the romance at all. Especially the 14th episode was just bad, as it felt like they were trying to present the current situation of the characters in a fast and furious way, editing scene after scene and just blurting out that the main character now loves this girl, out of the blue, but that's that. No explanation was provided for their actions, no background and those four years in the future seemed like they four empty years (I mean even the flashbacks that the male lead was experiencing were from four years ago or of the same day, like nothing happened in those four years). Another factor that didn't really help with the love story was that the couple didn't have chemistry. They didn't have any solid heart-racing moment either. So, them getting together was just too random and forceful.

Finally, the characters remained the same as they were presented at the beginning of the drama. We knew the bad guys were bad and that didn't really change, although, the son did have some potential to demonstrate why he was the monster he turned out to be, a potential that was never really properly explored. The big boss and enemy of the male lead felt also more like a promise of a bad character after all. He sure was mean to the main character and seriously unlikable, but, in the end, his actions were left in the behind the scenes grey area. The main character, in addition, showed zero development. He even got a bit boring after a while and felt a bit too bland in others.

Now, for the good part of the drama. The beginning was just perfect. If you like melodrama, like I do, where the main character hits bottom and gets unfairly treated in order to stand up to his own two feet again and take matters into his own hands, then you are going to love the first half of the drama. The revenge plot was very satisfying as well, with a solid ending that was nicely presented. Though, it would have been nice if they showed how they actually managed to succeed, as the first part of the drama had focused on the struggles of them setting off. Another part of the drama that was pretty good was the characters. The members of the crew were unique and the drama didn't shy off from issues like racism and gender identity. So, it was refreshing to see those elements added in the plot. The female leads were delightful too. They were strong women, the one beautiful but a tragic character, and the other young, fearless, reckless and somehow, likable. Sure, she did some questionable things, but she was young and just too full of herself, so it was nice to see how the others helped her realize that her attitude wasn't always right and to grow up. I've also seen some other viewers not really liking her looks. Sure, she isn't the classic beauty, but, for her character, who was cool and interesting, I think she was just perfect. Finally, the OST was solid.

So, overall, six out of ten.

D A E B A K !!! GIVE THIS DRAMA A SHOT! DON'T BELIEVE IN THE BAD REVIEWS!
Okay, before I get into a slightly detailed review about Itaewon Class let me tell you first that a lot of the reviews I've read so far were made by bogus watchers of KDRAMAS. They're either new to watching or have watched romantic comedy genres only so far. If you don't care about a rich story and you're only looking for a fluffy romantic and funny drama, then I guess this drama aint for you. But this drama goes beyond what you usually expect from a KOREAN drama and keeps you interested the whole journey while episodes keep on getting better building up.

Itaewon Class is amazing. I literally adjusted all the scores of my completed dramas in order to accommodate my rating for Itaewon Class. Among the six remaining dramas in the 9.5 list of my profile, is Mr. Sunshine and Live -- which I consider co-top 1's. I firmly put Itaewon Class as my 2nd best drama watched ever, and it's not because it was lacking in any way, but quite the opposite. It's just that the two dramas ahead of Itaewon Class made me cry more :)

This drama had everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. From a dark-skinned character, transgenders, corrupt officials, and more. This drama tackled racism and gender discrimination at some point which are issues in South Korea. All I can say is that this drama is out of the norm.

I loved every second of this drama; as each episode goes by it keeps getting better and better. The characters were complex and character development was on point. The antagonists were perfect; they were so perfect to the point where you can't even hate them at the end. The story was rich and balanced dealing with a bit of romance and comedy, but a lot of heart-warming, sad, and hype scenes. Above all else that was amazing in this drama, the ending was perfect. The writers did a good job portraying each individual's last moments in the drama bidding them to a good farewell, having no loose ends.

Overall, this drama is a must-watch, especially for cultured drama watchers. It's hard to put all my opinions in one review because everything started at least 8 weeks ago, and my review can never do this drama justice, but just give this drama a shot and I guarantee you, as long as you keep an open mind and stick through the end; you'll most definitely get attached.

This show is fantastic; it's something new. This is among, if not the best, kdrama I have ever watched. Although I do have a few sentiments to share: (1) The show had an extremely strong beginning, however somewhere in the middle, it felt lukewarm. It did pick up again eventually. (2) I almost dropped it out of annoyance towards Yi Seo because of her obsessive tendencies and unnecessarily rude attitude. I had to continuously remind myself that she was sociopathic to rationalize the way that she was acting. One thing I cannot forget, however, is the scene where she kissed Saeroyi without his knowledge. That was creepy and unneeded. I would remove that, if I could. (3) There was a lack of romantic development between Yi Seo and Saeroyi. I wish the build up were shown more gradually and naturally because I never really figured out when Saeroyi started feeling differently. Was Saeroyi already lovestruck when Yi Seo confessed her feelings? If not, then when did he fall inlove? I don't know. I don't know if it was done purposely as romance is not the storyline's focus, but the romance between the two came out forced.

Despite what I've said, I absolutely loved watching this. It was a wild ride, and it made me feel so intensely. It isn't surface level. It is above and beyond Saeroyi's relationship with Yi Seo. In fact, it tackles many aspects of being human exceptionally - the importance of bonds, the sturdiness we should possess in hardship, the search for meaning, the effort it takes to abide by our principles, the way that everything else gets clouded in pursuit of something, the effect of upbringing to one's viewpoints, self-interest, dehumanization. Not to mention it also touches societal issues such as racism, bullying, and the scorn that transgenders receive. It's just so well-made and well-executed. Moreover, the casting is simply outstanding, both the protagonists and antagonists are effective. They give full justice to their roles.

All the characters are flawed, and while they are unconventional, they are also substantial. They are oftentimes irritating, self-serving, and unreasonable - but that's what makes them all the more enthralling. While they undoubtedly manifest all these qualities, they continue to move forward, gasping, struggling, improving themselves in their own way, seeking for reasons to continue on, even if their reasons are repugnant, such is life.

The plot encapsulates being human in such a spectacular way, and I truly admire that. You would find yourself disagreeing with plenty of things. You would encounter absurd worldviews. You would question your own morals. And you won't even notice it, but you would find yourself engrossed and attached. The flow, the storytelling, the dialogues, the OSTs - everything is impeccable. The ending was pure satisfaction.

Needless to say, watching this has been a great pleasure to me. Give this show a chance to prove that it deserves the hype.

A “ Lesson” For Itaewon Class...
Most people will probably tell you that this show is the “ most original Korean drama, they’ve ever seen” or “ the best one ever”, however, there was something about this drama which took me awhile to work out where my problem lay from a critical manner. Of course, there’s no doubt that Itaewon Class has some selling points which were tackled for the appeal of the “ young generation” and “international” viewers. This is particularly seen through; casting choices ( note fairly newcomer actors Da- Mi and American Chris Lyon) , themes tackled( attitudes to racism, LGBT rights and of course released prisoners) , fairly unique plot premise and characters as well . So, where did a show with such brimming potential go wrong? Well, its biggest problem was for once not entirely upon the acting ( this is something which I must give the show some praise for , especially from Da-Mi ‘s emotionally vibrant role as her role character Yi Seo, against lead actor Park Seo Joon’s sometimes lacklustre moments) , but, upon the characters and plot itself. The show ( based upon the titular Korean webtoon) centres around Park Sae-royi ( Park Seo Joon) who during his teen years, was wrongfully imprisoned around the same time of his father’s accident, when he is angered by bully and legitimate heir to Jangga Group, Jang Geun-won ( Ahn Bo Hyun). After being released, Sae- royi claims revenge against Jaanga Group by establishing his own restaurant in Itaewon with the help of fellow misfits , intelligent and tech savvy Jo Yi- Seo as his manager ( Kim Da- Mi), Yi- Seo’s classmate and illegitimate son of the head of Jaanga , Jang Geun-soo ( Kim Dong hee), fellow inmate Choi Seung-kwon ( Ryu Kyung-soo) transgender woman and head cook Ma Hyeon-yi( Lee Joo - Young) and Guinean- Korean part-timer Kim To- Ni ( Chris Lyon). As a premise, the show has a unique flair to it, but, I think it’s quick to become apparent that a show which focused upon the characters as plot devices rather than human beings at times, certainly has lacking emphasis upon characterisation . This cliche grew apparent when the show trickled into the tropes of revenge dramas from illnesses, illegitimate heirs to the stereotypical cliche of love scenarios between the “ older” Male lead Park Sae- royi, the “ young prodigy ,and not so innocent” Yi- Seo , the “ tangled between love and duty” Oh Soo-ah ( Kwon Nara) and the “ puppy -dog outcast” Geun- Soo. Whilst there was nothing entirely wrong with having romance in a drama about misfits, Itaewon Class made the classic mistake of centralising too much focus upon the romance of these characters rather than as individuals with personalities, pasts and lives outside of their relationships . For me, this was particularly seen with Sae- royi. Considering the amount of psychological and emotional damage he’s been through as a character since episode one, you’d expect such a character to be a realistic, cautious and likeable Male lead who is able to relate to viewers through their own painful experiences. Instead, Sae-royi is a perfect example of a “ stock Male lead” who has little emotional outburst, awareness to feelings, manipulation or any moments of weakness which truly make us reflect as viewers upon his journey. Arguably , there’s his “ romance” with Yi- Seo to make him more ‘ human’ ; so lacklustre that it’s a question why it exists in the show at all . Sae-royi seems to constantly mislead this girl with “ obliviousness” only to suddenly be falling in love with her next moment, with little explanation or reasons behind his feelings. Whilst I find it hard to fault Da- Mi, Yi- Seo was a female lead who I absolutely loathed upon so many grounds. I can understand where drama viewers are coming from to an extent by the argument that Yi- Seo is a “ strong and independent female lead”. The show made that evident from nearly episode one when she is able to “make or break “ an establishment’s reputation through her social media account and hold herself in a fight against people using her wit as well. This is also what irked me about Yi- Seo as well. She was a strong character , but she had little emotional depth as an individual. Whilst she did have some scenes which exposed more “ vulnerable moments” , these scenes didn’t truly add up with her “ sassy” characteristics at times or were truly built to expose this side of Yi- Seo without seeming somewhat “ random” and poor writing . Note the scene with the confrontation with her mother early on in the show about chasing an ‘older man’ ( Sae- Royi) rather than following her mother’s hopes for her to become a successful and independent woman. Whilst to an extent the scene explains some of the psychological reasons behind Yi- Seo’s desire to fall in love in order to escape from the planned- out intentions of her mother, there was little emotional bonding or vulnerability both with Yi- Seo and the mother who raised her, or anything truly emotional to expose Yi- Seo as a human being in this scene . Whilst I guess there is the argument of Yi- Seo being a sociopath suggested by several fans by her ability to grow on emotional attachments through her manipulative intelligence, there are scenes later on ( such as Yi- Seo bursting into tears in front of Geun- Won) which question whether this is simply bad character writing , or simply a confusing interpretation for us as watchers . I don’t usually bring in comparisons to my reviews, but, looking at dramas with similar “ strong female leads “ like Jang Man- Wol ( IU) from Hotel Del Luna or Ko Moon Yeong ( Seo Ye- Ji) from Its Okay, Not To Be Okay , brings a stark contrast between “ strong” and “weak “story writing. Love or loathe both dramas, there is the undeniable strength within both shows of a female lead who has emotional emotional depth; exposing these characters not just as “ plot devices for romance”, but, human beings as well with feelings, scarred pasts and flaws as well . Overall Itaewon Class isn’t necessarily a terrible drama, but it the epitome of recent romantic “ fad” shows - mediocre storywriting, poorly-written characters and easily forgettable the minute the watcher starts a new drama. If you’re bored and looking for something to pass the time, I’m certainly not saying that you shouldn’t give it a go , however, this isn’t a drama to watch if your looking for something to genuinely commit time towards.

I had really high expectations due to the hype and the cast. I actually quite liked the first two episodes and the romance between Sae Ro Yi and Soo-ah as students and also really liked the MC's father. The series had a really promising start and did live up to my expectations for a while.

Really like Kwon Na-ra (I find her super beautiful as opposed to the other girl) and I rooted for Soo-ah although her joining Jangga and helping the old man was a huge turn off and frustrating to watch even after her intentions were revealed (to betray them and help Ro Yi).

The other girl was refreshing at first. She had very serious flaws yet likable in her own ways such as being ""badass"", smart and capable. She soon turned into an obsessive girl who clinged to the MC too much. I liked the crew as well.

The acting, especially the villains' in the first half of the series (old man and f***boy son) really made me hate them and I was curious to see the old man's past and thoughts. The cast's acting was good all the way through but was eventually ruined by the forced romance and shitty overall plot. The life lessons the series tried to convey at first didn't really work out due to the messy plot and ruined characters. ""Stay true to yourself"", ""live with your head high"", ""power"", ""logic and schemes vs people and feelings"". All empty words in the end.

The series was bearable until maybe episode 10 and had somewhat of a plot going. With lots of typical ""drama"" and twists, cliches, etc.. However, the old man was not that great of a villain anymore and eventually got cancer (lolz?) The nice, innocent but spineless younger brother got negative ""development"" and lost himself. He became the same as the father he hated. Older son went to jail and got out...

By episode 14, after the 4 year time skip the Ro Yi suddenly falls in love with the manager girl and changed ( staying true to his way of living and not changing no matter what was his whole character and motive). Soo-ah, despite her flaws and stupidity, was still a better pick IMO as from the start they both liked each other and she was always there for him (even working for Jangga was to help him - stupid writing, i know). She was always the second lead female but was winning for 13-14 episodes until the other girl just won (horrible writing).

Crazy older brother got out of jail and kidnapped Yi-seo and the younger brother. At the end of episode 14 or 15 MC kneeled before the old man just to save his ""romance"" that came out of nowhere. His character was far gone. All that vengeance, hatred and negativity was useless and meaningless in the end as he kneeled before the character that ruined his life and caused him pain for 15 years, to save his new found ""love"".

I haven't seen the last episode yet, but I have no expectations left. All the characters are ruined, everything is shitty at this point and the forced couple will form in a cliche way somehow. In the end, among the many horrible things, the plot, the characters' backwards development and the disastrous romance stood out as the worst things about this drama.

UPDATE: finished the last episode and everything wrapped up the way I expected it to after seeing the first 15 eps.
Things settled down and it was a ""happy"" ending but the previous issues were obviously still there. Soo-ah and Geun-soo didn't get the development and closure they needed.

The scene with the old man at the end was not satisfying at all and just really sickening. The old man was a wicked devil, sure. However, the MC just pulled a ""I'm a business man"" move and acts tough and cool after the old guy kneels and cries. From the start, this series was always full of toxicity: violence, power abuse, early death of the father, etc...
However, there was no real positive message in the story in the end. They won the war and MC got his revenge and became rich, but that's all. It's just like nothing happened at all and all the drama was just there for the sake of it. A very, very shallow approach to appeal to the bitterness and hatred in audiences.

I usually don't write drama reviews but hopefully this will be helpful to some people. In the end, if you want a drama that makes you feel good watching, AVOID this so that you don't end up wasting a weekend and also feel miserable because of how unhealthy the story and the characters became. This is a very naively idealistic story that tried very hard to be inspiring but failed miserably.

I got the impression that the love story thread was added as an after thought. To be convincing this love affair needed a lot more story time than what it got. The writers needed to show how these two became love birds right off the bat. Instead the male lead is like a stone wall, and she is for some reason desperately in love with him. They didn't give the viewer a reason to believe that these two would fall in love at the end.

It was entertaining enough for me to keep watching it - can thank the actors for that who were able to make this mediocre story into something reasonably entertaining.

Promising start, Lame Story. Problematic OTP
Itaewon Class started on a promising note but degenerated into a lame story with problematic OTP. Initial episodes were good. I was solidly behind Sae Ro Yi’s quest for justice . The crew he assembled was interesting.

Early warning signals:
- I didn’t care for the OTPs. I was indifferent to Soo Ah after she joined forces with Janga. I liked
Yi Seo ‘s sharp acumen but felt let down when she started being clingy to Sae Ro Yi.

- the hero - Sae Ro Yi was becoming bland. With a singular expression and singular hairstyle. After his pain in the early episodes, now it seems nothing fazed him. I can’t relate to him.

Still I labored on. But at episodes 10-14, I can no longer ignore the obvious:

STORY IS LAME:
It resorted to improbable plot devices like a passable cook winning national champion, a fairy grandma storyline, a chaebol heir so stupid he boasted his own murder to a near stranger, and successive car hits.

But the biggest weakness of the writing is absence of believable transitions. There is a cartoonish stubbornness displayed by the characters - just like Sae Ro Yi’s unchanging hair - but then bang! - they make an abrupt switch. The audience isn’t brought along in the journey. Examples:

- The unquestioning loyalty of Sae Ro Yi (ML) to his original love was caricaturish . A normal person would at least be hurt when Soo Ah joined hands with his father’s killer. But no, he’s such a saint, he accepted readily as if his love was simply choosing a red lipstick. Ok no matter. After the time skip he continues to be unwavering .....then bang! abruptly realised he’s in love with another person all along. What nonsense.

- The younger brother renouncing his family connection. He didn’t seem conflicted at all. Then bang! - one day he crossed over to the dark side. Ok.

- A badass sociopath female who became super clingy. Which brings me to...

PROBLEMATIC OTP:
Yi Seo repeatedly saying “I love you” to Sae Ro Yi. SRY firmly declining and saying no, no, no. Then on ep 14 (with a few token flashback), makes an unconvincing about face. He’s in love with Yi Seo all along! (Umm, which part of no, no, no did we miss?) At best, this OTP is cringey. A bigger issue is the screenwriter applauding borderline harassment behaviour and finding it lovable.

The only progressive element is diversity inclusion.

With the help of FFWD button, I did finish it. I enjoyed Park Bo Gum’s cameo, otherwise ending is predictable. And as for the hero? Sae Ro Yi is now hooked up with the clingy female but continues to be as preachy as ever.

Here's the summary of why I hate this drama.

1. Let's remember that Saeroyi's mission was to destroy the Jangga company.
2. Let's remember that Saeroyi loves Soo Ah for more than 10 years. So does Soo Ah.
3. Let's remember that this drama is a good drama. It tells us about business and marketing strategy. At least at the early episodes.

At the last episodes:
1. Saeroyi is ACTUALLY failed to destroy Jangga. Soo Ah is the one who destroys the company.
2. Soo Ah had been struggling to find the way to destroy Jangga company stealthily. (this drama doesn't tell you what, how, when, where she did it = plot missing)
3. Soo Ah had been waiting for Saeroyi to destroy Jangga so that she would be able to resign from the company and live happily with Saeroyi after he succeeding his mission.
4. Instead, Saeroyi fell in love with Yi-Seo and dumped Soo Ah, who loves him for FCVKIN YEARS!!!
5. This drama turns out to be ""the story of a boss, who dumped his beloved, just to fall in love with a manager""

Conclusion:
I hate Saeroyi so much. It breaks my heart when he dumped Soo Ah. He FAILED to destroy Jangga but he got the company after acquiring it. WHERE'S Soo Ah?
The romance stuff RUINS the plot. The drama went from business-themed drama to sick romance drama.
After all, the conflict resolver is Soo Ah. Saeroyi? He went to a date with Yi-Seo.

PS. Still, I give 5/10 star-rating: 5 for business and marketing stuff. I appreciate that.

At first I was very curious about how Saeroyi would achieve his goal against Janga, but as the drama progressed there were absurd situations that you could predict how the revenge would end, but I didn’t think it would be so bad.

First Yiseo appears as the savior of Bandam and the only person ""capable"" of turning everything into success ,I don’t know how but she did.
On the other hand Sooah , who achieved what the main character longed for. Then where is the character of Park Saeroyi ??? He accomplished something on his own ? At times I was inspired by his way of thinking, but there were only empty words at the end. ?

Not to mention the romance that was sold us in the end, Itaewon Class deserves the award for the most forced, toxic and insipid couple that you could ever see in a drama. ??

Yiseo who was already hateful at first , gets worse with her one-sided love. Her obsession with Saeroyi was so irritating to see and the way she said things to others, I even thought she was more unpleasant than the ""villain"" XD No joke !??

The only thing I could recommend from the drama is its decent OST !
Sondia , once again I love so much you voice ♡

My rating : 5/10 ?

Started off boring, was good in the middle and went off the rails towards the last 3-4 episodes.

This was promised as an upbeat, youth drama. Instead what I was served consisted of some bits of what was promised with a heck lot of makjang. I think this drama was poorly written and executed. This should have remained as a underdog to riches story instead of the unnecessary revenge, crime and what-not being included.

Kim Dami stole the show. But even an actress of her caliber felt like she was struggling towards the end because the direction in which the plot went made no sense. Park Seo Joon had an ugly hairstyle and was mediocre at best throughout the entire drama. Shame, because this drama could have been one of the best roles he would have had. Kwon Nara is okay for me - never does much, but I believe she did the best to her potential.

There were some cool offbeat things about the drama like the youth culture of Itaewon and a diverse cast with issues like LGBTQ+ and racism being addressed. Some characters were great, others were okay. I feel like my time was wasted while I was impatiently waiting for episodes to come out. I won't even categorize this drama as a one-time watch. My recommendation would be to either skip it altogether or do a lot of skip-watching to get through this.

Park Saeroyi reminds of old-time self-sacrificing characters in old Bollywood films. They only live by principles and only want to be the better person in every situation, no matter how unforgiving the other party may be. Romance felt forced and the friendship focus drifted off pretty badly. Not to mention the time jumps made it all the more uninteresting.

At least the drama had a decent soundtrack.

It wasn't worth my time if not for those few good Itaewon-centered episodes and beautiful city and Namsan Tower views in a lot of scenes. It made me miss Seoul a lot.

Overall, it's not bad. I'd say if you like the characters, then I don't see any reason not to like it, as it's basically all your normal k-drama fare stuff here. Reason I'm not a big fan is because I didn't like all the characters. I really could not stand Jo Yi-so from beginning to end. I couldn't find a single likable thing about her. Considering she is one of the two main leads, I just had a harder and harder time caring about this show as it moved forward. Honestly, my feelings toward her were borderline hate. I have nothing against the actress btw.
Park Sae Royi was fine, but it all honesty nothing special. He is your basic sturdy lead who is supposed to be the all around perfect person everyone else looks up to. Nothing to dislike about him, but at the same time not super interesting. I'm probably more negative toward him just simply due to him being paired up with Yi-so.
It's nice and all that the show tried to add some progressive elements with Toni and Hyun Yi, but I feel like they could have done more, especially with Toni. For once I would like to see a foreign looking character be born and raised Korean, to stick it in all the racist faces that will only accept them as being foreigners. But yet once again they fail to do that here by making Toni just another one of these characters who has never even lived in Korea until a year previously. Nor was he even a registered Korean, which only proved the annoying Yi-so's point that he wasn't Korean. I appreciate the try, but I hope the writer can push things a bit more progressive next time, and not just what felt to me as just surface level.
The one thing that kept me going through this show was the revenge plot. It was entertaining and I enjoyed Yoo Jae-Myung's dastardly villain. And for better or worse, I did really like Nara in this, even though the show had to go and do her wrong, but she is a secondary lead so what else is new.

A Mixed Bag with a Dose of Deus Ex Machina.
Before I started the show, I expected a fun lighthearted youth drama about a bunch of 20-something year olds finding success in a saturation of big coporate businesses. Boy, was I wrong because I got the opposite. If you're someone who enjoys full blown gushy romance, this show is not for you. It definitely gives off an anime-risque vibe on the first few watch with its vibrant setting & flashy array of costume/outfits with a rambuctious main theme song sung by the talented Gaho. The core essence of the show is the main character's journey towards his ambition of success & revenge against the largest food company in Itaewon, J Co run by Jang Dae Hee.

The story is presented to the viewers from Saeroy's perspective as a teen boy into his adulthood as a 29 yearold. Saeroy is a socially inept adult who comes off as revering, & upright but also awkward & aloof at times, but nonetheless a calm, collective person who doesnt let injustice fly by. As a teen, he is somewhat distant to social circles due to his nature but after unfortunate circumstances, grew up to be someone of compassion & friendly. Saeroy's finer quality is that he's very patient & understanding of others. He is a man who lives with a set of principles. But his greatest attributes is also his greatest flaw which hinders his development. He's stubborn as a mule.

Park Seo Joon does a great job playing the role of Saeroy. There's alot of nuances in his body language & facial expression that doesnt rely heavily on dialogue. I dont consider myself to be a fan but this drama actually made me like him.

Yiseo is the main counterpart to the drama's story to helps Saeroy on his path to success. She is introduced as genius teen turned 20 years old who has behavorial issues & depression. She's nonchallant towards people, crude, unmannered, impulsive & reckless with a disregard to rules. Because she grew up self-absorb, so she is also narrowminded. Her quality is being wellversed in todays tech/social media & her expertise in management/business although she reads a bit like a know it all- encyclopedia. Her partnership with Saeroy as a friend/business partner is one of the show's highlighted aspect. Because she's presented as a terrible person, her flaw is her change to be good heavily relies on her love for Saeroy, not neccessarily for herself.

Kim Dami is a star. Her performance on this show has been my favorite thing about the drama. She plays off Park Seo Joon really well. Theres alot of nuances. She's a great emotional actress who cries effortlessly well. She's given alot to do in terms of dialogues & physical performance and she hits every beat.

I appreciate the heavily flawed characters since majority of them are introduced to be purposely terrible, which is quite refreshing from the usual cast of goody two shoes. The villians are fine. After or so they become a bit cartoonish & downplayed along the way but good performance by Yoo Jae Myung & Ah Boh Hyun. Kwon Nara does a fine job with what she's given with to do as Soo Ah.

I wasn’t too keen about the way the show highlighted social issues, specifically regarding bullying, mental health, sexual harrassment, anti-lgtbq, & racism. It is great that the show decided to delve into these kinds of issues especially in retrospect to todays's out look on marginalized people, depression, problematic behavior. The problem is when social issues are presented to the viewers, it isnt quite explored in depth & is gloss over in a light manner. It has potential but the writing barely scratches the surface. There's definitely psychological aspects pertaining to certain characters but it's not addressed in depth. Everything seemed to resolved by mere call outs and hollow apologies.

Overall, the characterization left something to desire, somewhat 2-dimensional. There's potential to explore the complexities of the characters. Everyone's existence barely revolves outside of Danbam or Saeroy's character. The viewers dont get to see how characters lead their daily lives, where they live, how they eat, sleep, the usual domestic activities. The writing lacked character development. The sudden growth exist to serve as a plot point. Drastic character action/change without buildup. The story suffers from a dose of deus ex machina. Certain things happen too seamlessly. The struggles/obstacles don't hit hard enough & is resolved in a short mannered. A story like Itaewon Class & its cast of characters, the show needed to be atleast 20 episodes to give everything more depth or maybe it's just the flaw in the writing. Because of the show's short span of 16 episodes, its drawn out sometimes as heavy-handed exposition rather than gradual progression.

Dont expect romance. Kim Dami & Park Seo Joon does a very great job at portraying the heartfelt moments between the two. SRY & YS were obviously two depressed people. The fact that the show didnt delve more in depth into their psyche to make it more palpable through out from have made SRY & YS much more relatable than how they were presented. YS was intrusive half the time. Im not sure if the writer intended this to be read as romantic because it is not. The codepedency is jarring. I initially liked the idea of YS & SRY as a pair more than what the show presented them to be overall. Their platonic relationship rings much truer early on as friends/business partners although Yiseo exudes verbal harassment & uncceptable behavior in the workspace.

Visually, it is a good looking show. The cinematography is beautiful. The ost & music composition is great. The show does suffer from straight cuts, which is apparent in the later episodes towards the later run in the show. Ep 1-10 are the strongest in terms of direction/acting & in writing. Ep 11-12 are fine. Ep 13-16 during the timeskip arc has glaring issues from a technical standpoint, both in writing & direction. The early essence of the show is bare & the storytelling feels bogged down. It almost reads something out of a telenovela or a kdrama from early 2000's. It's all very anticlimatic & everything is tied into a nice little bow at the end. Certain events felt contrived.

The way the show-writer handled the overall story is a mixed bag. It does have its moments but potentially to have more finesse throughout. If you want a revenge story with more grit, you might look somehwere else. But all in all, its one of the more unique & entertaining dramas that I watched with its distinctive cast of characters.

The Satisfaction!!
A revenge story that actually leaves you feeling satsified. The drama is well paced and the story unravels nicely, they dont leave any questions unanswered. I loved how everything wraps up at the end. I know a good amount of people shipped Soo Ah and Saeroyi, but i couldnt stand Soo Ah sometimes. I loved Jo Yi Seo, she was so badass, smart and knew exactly what she wanted. Saeroyi is a well developed character who grows patience and the will to become happy in the future. The soundtrack was amazing, well suited to the drama. If you're looking for something exciting, with some romance and an amazing cast. Then please go watch Itaewon Class!!

We need more dramas like this one!
I was super excited to write a review of this drama because I've enjoyed it soo much! If you browse through some reviews on MyDramaList, you'll see that there are many negative ones. I feel like this drama deserves a lot better and I'm going to tell you why.

Story: First of all, I think we all know this drama is not perfect. It was messy at times, but you could tell the producers tried their best to make it unique and memorable. For me personally, they really achieved that. As for the story, I loved it (at least most of the time). While watching this drama, I've learned so much about the definition of hard work, going after your dreams and goals no matter what and showing the world you can do it. And you learn some cool things about cooking, food, and advertising. It was interesting to get a little insight into this industry. I found it truly amazing how Park Saeroyi managed to stick to his goals and values, even though he had to overcome many obstacles and hurdles to reach his dreams. But let's just appreciate the fact that he really did it! His determination inspired me to go after my dreams as well. Now I feel like I want to work harder in order to live the life I want! Thank you Park Saeroyi for teaching me some life lessons and for motivating me to do my best!
I loved this aspect of the story but I figured the vibe of the whole drama (like being an outcast, working hard etc.) kind of changed at a certain point towards the end (when he established his company) which made me quite upset, to be honest. I was also a tad annoyed the main focus on this drama lied on revenge. This became quite tiring after a while... From then on I wasn't really excited to see the ending. But thank god, the last episode totally convinced me to give it a 9/10. Also, it felt super refreshing to watch because they covered topics like sexuality (transgender), racism, and whatnot. It was the first time ever I've seen something like this in a K-drama and I'm glad Korea is starting to get more open-minded in terms of topics like these <3

Characters/Cast: I cannot lie, THE CAST WAS AMAZING! This was my first drama with Park Seo-Joon (Park Saeroyi) and wow, he's an amazing actor and I cannot wait to see his other dramas! He totally pulled off his role as Park Saeroyi and it was perfect for him! As I have mentioned above, I love Park Saeroyi and I still think a lot about this drama and how he managed to achieve everything he wanted despite the circumstances. He is a big inspiration to me and I'm glad I watched this drama!
As for Kim Da-Mi (Jo Yi-Seo), She was my favorite character in the whole drama! I really can't believe it was her first role in a drama ever... She was absolutely amazing in it! I also cannot wait to see more dramas with her! Yi-Seo is now officially one of my favorite female characters ever! She was so damn badass, iconic, and cool! She would do everything for Saeroyi and it really pissed me off in the beginning that he couldn't see her as a woman. I mean yes, she is like 10 years younger but come on, who cares? I shipped them right from the beginning and I wished they had gotten together a little bit earlier. It took him ages to realize he loves her... At least they ended up being together which made me very happy. The two of them really deserve only the best!
A character I absolutely couldn't stand was Oh Soo-Ah! Gosh, I hated her so much! In the first episodes, I thought she was okay but oh no, she wasn't. Working for Jangga and the chairman knowing what they had done to Park Saeroyi and his dad made me so angry. I really couldn't understand how Saeroyi has loved her for 10 years! She was a hypocrite, expecting him to love her but silently turning her back on him. I couldn't even look at her face because it made me mad. But I do have to admit I was glad she had a little character development at the end. The last episode made me hate her a little less. What confused me as well, was the character Jang Geun-soo. I loved him in the beginning but once he started working at Jangga he really started disappointing me. I was glad he apologized for his deeds and became a better person in the end. I guess I don't have to say how much I hated the Chairman and his stupid, cruel son.
Other than that, I loved the squad and the staff at DanBam. Super lovely people <3

Music: This is something I was super excited to write about as well! The OSTs were amazing and I'm sure I'll never forget them. Especially the songs ""You Make Me Back"" by Woosung and ""Start Over"" by Gaho will stay in my playlist for a looong time! They are super motivating. I also loved the instrumental songs and I love listening to the whole OST album :)

In conclusion, should you watch this drama? Yes. Is it perfect? No.
I feel like this drama's imperfection is really not that bad cause it showcases that life itself is NOT perfect at all and that everyone is going through life for the first time. This drama was a total rollercoaster ride with unforgettable characters, amazing acting, and awesome music. It's now one of my favorite dramas and I hope it can become one of yours too. :)

Itaewon Class is a drama that strives to stand out from the crowd by proposing a peculiar mix of characters, including a black boy and a transgender, in contrast to a plot based on the most typical clichés of Korean drama: the class struggle and the love triangle. Despite the contrast, on the whole, the series managed to blend well the typical elements of kdramas with innovative and peculiar components, offering us a fabulous set of characters, perhaps at times too eccentric, a compelling soundtrack and excellent acting, where Kim Da Min and Park Seo Joon stand out.
However, as it often happens with kdramas, it has failed to entertain me in the long run, the solidity of the plot begins to lose its charm towards episodes 7-8, when the story begins to forget more and more about the revenge that the protagonist initially aimed for, fitting him into a forced love triangle and in a power struggle inherent in Jangga Co.
At the same time, the characterization of some characters will begin to falter, first of all, the protagonist, from revengeful man to martyr, he didn’t do anything for his own pub, other people have worked hard to make his dream come true, while he was busy helping & supporting everyone, enemies included. This kind of character totally clashes with his initial revenge plan. Overall Itaewon Class deserves to be viewed because as a whole it stands out from the multitude of drama that comes out every month, offering excellent performance in various aspects but it fails in the most important, the screenplay and the ML characterization, due to the inconsistency of writing. The drama had the potential to do more, especially without the romance part.

I heard a lot of good things about this drama so i thought id give it a go. Usually i watch thrillers and action dramas so this was a bit of a change!

Story:
I loved the first 4 or 5 episodes, the story felt very heartwarming. I enjoyed the diversity of characters, especially the transgender character (Hyun Yi), i feel the show handled her so well and i really appreciated it as someone from the LGBT community. Another favourite character of mine was Geun Soo, at least to begin with. I liked his sweet relationship with Yeo So and how he wanted to fight against his father. Unfortunately from about ep 6 onwards the show lots the warm feeling it had built. Everything became very serious, i really didnt like Geun Soo's complete change in personality (felt really forced) , Yeo So became incredibly annoying and clingy, Saroyi became unrealistically 'perfect'. I also wasnt a fan of the huge 10 and 4 year gaps, did really nothing significant happen in that time at all? The romance sub-plot also took a turn for the worse, the sudden change in Saroyi's relationship was a shock and not particularly satisfying! The ending wasnt great, we didnt really get full closure for a lot of the characters and i think the fight scenes were a bit unnecessary, like a last minute addition.
Acting/Cast:
The acting was fine, the cast did well with what they had. I have to praise Joo Young as Hyun Yi again, she was perfect for the role! Kim Da Mi and Seo Joon were also really good. Dong Hee was perfect as the lighthearted friend, but i feel as he had to become more of a villain he didnt fit the role as much, but as other people has said he's a young actor and has time to develop his skills.
Music:
I loved the ost! great songs and all matched the scenes well
Rewatch value:
Im not one to rewatch dramas anyway, but i wont be rewatching Itaewon Class anytime soon. I might give the first few episodes another go, but because i really wasnt a fan of the drama's progression id have to stop there

It was a bit of a shame as i had such high expectations from the first few episodes, however the plot was a bit weak and i guess to stretch that out for 16 episodes wouldve been a challenge! maybe if this drama had less episodes the story wouldve developed at a slower, more manageable pace.

Itaewon Class was a drama about surviving the obstacles a person may face in opening a business. It talks about many issues such as corruption, bribery and how people might use their power for the wrong issues. The popularity of this drama is no surprise as when you have PSJ as your lead then there isn't much to worry out. However, something was missing in this which caused my rating to go down significantly.

The start of this drama was amazing, we meet Park Sae Royi and find out the reason for him wanting to take down Jangga. We meet all the main characters and find out their motives. This part of the drama is truly wonderful as you get to know these characters and you feel emotions for them. Even though it is probably the time you will weep the most tears for these characters.

During the first half, they also talk about various prejudices and obstacles the Danbam group face. Such as Hyun Yi coming out or Danbam not being successful even after all the effort Park Sae Royi faces. We see Kim Dami gradually falling in love with Park Sae Royi and genuinely root for her. We also see the inspiring story of ex-convicts trying to make a name for themself.

*Also on a side note: I know that this was the scriptwriters first ever drama and I think she did a great job for her first time. While what I'm about to say isn't nice I do genuinely believe she did an amazing job for her first time.

However, all of this beautiful base seemed to crumble in the second half. There is a lot of things I had a problem within the second half. It felt as if they just switched from a nice drama about youth to a makjang ( and don't get me wrong I love makjang just not in a scenario where it's not matching with the vibe of the drama) which didn't match with the original premise. There were unnecessary twists, completely useless side plots and ridiculous scenarios. I would prefer to break it down character by character.

First, Park Sae Royi. His character at the start was a youth full of idealism and was overall very lovable. However, to the end, you realise his true motivation is greed and not justice. You might ask, how did I come up with this conclusion? Well, there is a scene with Soo Ah when she begs him to stop going after revenge and live a normal life with her but he refuses. That was the first time I realised he wanted something more than justice. How when Jang Geun Won's arrest came, I realised now this is more of a battle of greed and pride.

I feel like this change of mentality is more due to the influence of the person right next to him. Jo Yi Seo. Her character at the start was nice and even though they claimed she was a sociopath she didn't fit that label. She also seemed to very obviously manipulate people and didn't realise the importance of networking. Another thing I didn't like was how she was a genius in everything even though she seemed to have never worked in an actual company. I felt her character was too perfect in the world of management and seemed to get everything her way in a very unconvincing manner.

I also felt that the romance plot between the two was very badly executed. Jo Yi Seo seemed to genuinely love him but the way they showed this was bad. As she seemed to ignore his direct requests of her behaviour when if it was the opposite most people would've claimed he was harassing her. Which gave an unrealistic message to viewers that would give people the wrong idea.

Also, many people said that Yi Seo was a better fit because of the way she stayed by his side. However, if you use that knowledge then he should've chosen Seung Kwan or Hyun Yi. As they were the people who stood by him just because they liked him and wanted to protect him not expecting anything in return. They genuinely wanted him to succeed and that was better than expecting something like affection. I think her character was great for the business aspect but the romance was pushed too much.

The romance could've been nicely executed however the fact that they did a 4-year skip makes it hard for us to connect with this ship as we don't know what all happened in 4 years. This skip is problematic in many ways however we can discuss that some other days. For example, Jang Geun Soo becomes a director in 4 years now even for dramas that's a stretch a high school graduate becoming a director in four years. Geun Soo was just used as an unnecessary side plot. He's good then he's bad now he's good again. There was no character development and there's no no sense to his whole character. I'm not kidding when I say that his character served almost no purpose to the story. I honestly started to cringe when he came on screen because unlike the other characters there's no motivation to his choices and is overall badly written.

Now onto characters, I liked. First was Hyun Yi, I honestly loved how she was the one who was normal in this drama and also how unlike many tv shows (Western and Asian) her being transgender is not her personality trait. She was what a genuinely good person is in real life. She helps people and seems to be the only person who sees what's going on at times. I loved her character and I think she shows a lot of the struggles with being a member of the LBTQ+ community even when it's not on the centre screen.

I liked Jang Geun Won and Jang Dae He a lot. I think they made you hate them yet pity them. Jang Geun Won is not an inherently evil person but his upbringing caused him to be. How Jang Dae Hee was also manipulated by business and how his objective became different after facing tragedy. I liked how they both had quite similar stories yet the way they grew up affected the way they looked at their situations. I think they both acted extremely well and I'm excited to see both of their new projects.

This one is more of an unpopular opinion. Its the fact that I liked Soo Ah a lot. I felt her character was something I could relate to a lot and how she was a real woman. The way she reacted to Royi rejecting her was was something I would expect a real woman to feel. Letting go is never easy but we need to do it because we may be what's holding the person back. I liked how her ending was with Park Bo Gum because it shows that she's starting a completely new life of satisfaction. Also, how she was the one who truly brought down Jangga, not Royi was a powerful moment as you realised he was not the only one affected by his father's death.

I felt like this drama missed a lot of potential ideas and themes like how unfair life is for ex-convicts, mental abuse and, the reality of bringing down a company. I feel like the revenge card was not well played as even though he was planning to make Jangga bankrupt the drama seemed to forget how many people would go bankrupt and how many enemies Royi would get.

Overall it was an okay drama that had a lot of potential which was wasted. It is not really rewatchable because it's too plot-driven to rewatch. Also, it was a little too predictable but it is enjoyable or at least tolerable till episode 12 so I'd recommend to either do that or forward watch

Some great messages and themes, delivered poorly in an overall lukewarm experience
This show just didn’t do anything for me, kind of all over the place. Around episode 10ish I felt no tension at all about what was going to happen, bored, but I was already so far in so I trudged until the end. I liked some of the concepts and issues the show tried to look at (school bullying, transgenderism, racism, abuse of power) but the presentation was quite over the top and cartoonish, and undoubtedly a bit too corny to take seriously. Everything was a bit too shallow and skimming the surface, nothing and no-one was explored in enough detail and even if it was, it was presented in such an unexciting way I managed to forget it or it blew past me. It’s also one of those shows where the ‘epic slow-mo moments’ drag way too long and you become aware of them, making them super ineffective and not cool at all.

Annoying tropes which put me off at the very start of the show:
-The villain characters are extremely over the top and in no way redeemable, they EEEVIL
-'Oh look one of the main character did something bad/something the other main wouldn't like ( one ep later ) no worries it was just a misunderstanding they're still perfect (AKA Soo Ah never called the police it was the 'totally how real humans act' evil catty girls who hate Yi Seo, even though it was later established Sae Ro Yi wouldn't even see it as a terrible act nor was it that bad)
-Setting up a parent/parent figure as extremely lovely, wholesome and wonderful angel with no flaws and then killing them off super early
-Whenever in doubt just slap someone it's totally great ... slap slap slap slap slap

‘Romance’: Any romantic parts in this show are incredibly wooden, no chemistry or excitement between anyone involved, I was convinced halfway through that Yi Seo and Sae Ro Yi were going to end up as a brother-sister relationship as it seemed Sae Ro Yi did not and was not going to see her romantically at all, but props to surprising me at the end I guess? At the same time it made Soo Ah into a completely useless character since all that there was to her was her childhood romance with Sae Ro Yi and it ended up not meaning much so… what was the point of building them up at all, it was boring and really dragged. It was just so weird how these characters went 5 year timeskips after 5 year timeskips still pining quietly after each other and expecting the audience to care about their nonexistent romance after the fact… bruh… they should have moved on(Yi Seo from Sae Ro Yi, Geun Soo from Yi Seo) long ago instead of waiting on people that on multiple occasions stated flat out they don’t like the other. It felt unrealistic and just plain dull. I’ve had a huge crush before and if the other person clearly doesn’t care at all it just goes away and you find someone or something else to obsess about, you don’t just sit still and structure your life around someone who doesn’t give a fk about you.

Thoughts on some of the characters:

Sae Ro Yi: Ok since he’s the main lead I’m supposed to be enamored with him and I did like him at the start but overall he wasn’t all that charming?? All he really did is every few episodes suddenly shout and then once everyone was staring at him in awe because ‘wow he raised his voice!’ he delivered his speech. That’s literally the first thing I remember about him besides his not so great haircut. Not very expressive nor interesting, but I appreciated his values and care for people.

Yi Seo: Again a good first impression and interesting with her ‘psycho’ persona, but predictably got annoying later on with being petty and clingy, but overall one of the best characters in terms of having charisma.

Soo Ah: Not a bad back-story and good in the first half of the show but becomes incredibly forgettable and unnecessary later into the show – all she does is keep working at Jangga and there’s absolutely nothing else to her except going to work and occasionally staring at Sae Ro Yi. Written lazily past the first few episodes.

Geun Soo: Was actually the most likeable character to me personally, early on, he was kinda sweet kid and his acting was expressive. It made no sense he would suddenly work at Jangga but I guess since Geun Won was at prison they needed a new ‘villain’ since the old man wasn’t enough apparently. That kid who worked at DanBam and who was treated like nothing by his ‘family’ would never have gone to work there and hurt one of his close friends. He only seemed to because of the convoluted romance plot – again, as if you would structure your whole life around the person you have a ‘crush’ on(which isn’t even explained why besides he still ‘likes’ her even tho she has a terrible psycho personality) and become an asshole like your brother who you hated your whole life and had to live with. As if you’d go and help your shitty fathers company, after having worked in a wholesome place like DanBam with your friends.

Geun Won: It’s funny how in a weird way I liked seeing him on screen more than the main characters purely because his performance wasn’t so wooden and boring, this dirtbag had more charisma and expression in one scene than Sae Ro Yi had in the whole show. Sure, it was just Sae Ro Yi’s character personality but that doesn’t mean he isn’t sleep inducingly boring to watch as the main character. You can have a stoic main character all you want but if there’s nothing interesting besides virtue and justice to him he isn’t all that great of a character. Anyway, Geun Won was quite the cartoonish villain in many ways, could have been much more toned down to get the point across, almost thought he’d get some sort of redemption or twist down the line but sadly not, would have been more compelling.

Big Boss Dae Hee: One of the better written characters since he didn’t flip-flop around, it was clear what he stood for and what kind of person he was, yet still he could surprise. He was given enough back-story and depth so he didn’t feel as one dimensional like many of the other characters. The easily best in the show acting performance helped.

Overall I just feel, well, I don’t really feel much about the show. It just wasn’t great.

The first 5/6 episodes were really good and had a good pace to it- i was immediately binge watching it. But slowly to the middle they didn't simmer out the story in a well-balanced way and it was always a fluctuating spike of interesting scenes and boring scenes (mostly boring xp). Additionally, they also over-dramatised a lot of minute and insignificant scenes in an attempt to keep the story’s pace going- but it only further distanced the audience from the story as it seemed so unrealistic and reminds them that this is just a drama.

A lot of the characters lacked development and were just played it out in small stories here and there- not having a good dynamic as a whole cast together. Only Saeroyi’s character development was complete and consistent, Yi-Seo’s was almost there- though a tad bit forced. The main problem I have with the show is how archetypal all the characters were. Archetypal characters can be played out nicely when the layerings are done carefully- but because ALL of the characters were pretty archetypal and only Saeroyi’s story was the main focus, all other characters did not have a chance to shine and seemed rather flat and unnatural.

Another thing i would criticise is how the director lacked awareness of what each scene may bring to the table. The first few episodes established the love story between Saeroyi and Soo-ah SO WELL that it may mislead a lot of audiences to root for them. They had a much more natural chemistry as compared to the latter love story, albeit their efforts to make the audiences hate Soo-ah and favour Yi-Seo.

This was a good story and held its central values tight, it definitely had a core message that each audience can have takeaway points from- unlike most K-dramas. But it had too many elements they tried to implement and the romance was almost unnecessary, though it made the show a tad bit cuter. I would still recommend the show though my comment seems rather negative HAHA. But that’s because i really loved the show at the beginning, and the thrust of the story- i just felt like they didn’t play it out well in the middle and did not do the story justice. I would also like to compliment how unique the setting of the show was! It was such a treat for us oversea-audience!

|| OVERALL ||

Let me preface this by saying that I prefer watching rom-coms, and that I watched Crash Landing on You (experiencing its accompanying post-drama blues) while watching earlier episodes of Itaewon Class which inadvertently affects my review.

To put it bluntly, throughout the drama’s run I didn’t get too absorbed into the plot or any of the characters. The weekly wait for new episodes wasn't too difficult and there weren’t a lot of scenes I would rewind and rewatch. That is not to say the drama was terrible as there definitely were scenes every couple of episodes that would be touching, heart-wrenching, lovely, cute, or funny. My main complaint is probably that I didn't feel much of a climax in the story or a comparatively more significant scene until the last few episodes. There were scenes that intended to be intense but I just felt it was poorly built up or dragged on. Character-wise I felt some could be more three-dimensional and those that do show development lack a smooth transition (simply stating many years passed is insufficient) hence changes seemed rather abrupt. As such, I found it difficult to fully root for any character or relationship. Regarding acting, most were good although chemistry was a bit lacking. Something commendable about the drama are the messages about society and people scattered here and there, although it is unfortunate that the drama only scrapes the surface of many important topics. Ultimately, this was a decent drama, hence the decent score.

**I recommend this drama to those that like underdog stories, or when people from different walks of life come together to achieve a common goal to help each other change for the better. Some viewers prefer a more visually appealing cast when picking dramas, but for this drama the focus is more on their personalities.


|| DETAILS ||

= Story =
*Premise - Mainly just a group of “misfits” fighting for the same goal (main protagonist’s goal really) to take down a major corporation. Simple and not particularly unique.
*Genre - There were some elements of various genres but not enough to be categorized under any of them. In other words, there was some romance but not enough to cause heart fluttering, there were some funny scenes but not enough to trigger more than a chuckle, a bit melodramatic but not enough to be tear-jerking.
*Plot - As it was straightforward and simple, I expected more depth but it felt as if every time there seemed to be more to the story I get pulled back and realize the characters’ motives and justification to the story’s progression was quite shallow still. Though the plot could be seen as rather repetitive or dragged out, I won’t go as far as saying it was boring. It was entertaining to see their business grow and improve despite the setbacks, but I just didn’t feel that there was a major turning point or climax that would leave me curious as to what would happen next. The time jumps do justify a lot of the plot developments but because the foundation wasn't that strong, after the time jump the plot progression still felt somewhat sudden. Side plots were well executed in that they added some colour to the main plot and wasn’t too overpowering. There were themes of gender identity, racial discrimination, psychological disorders, and abuse, just to name a few. It is commendable that the story touches on these important topics but felt more like a flaw as the story could only scrape the surface of each of these topics making it seem like they were included just for the sake of representation. Somehow I just felt like the story had opinions on society and humans that were deep but these opinions were just thrown in which made it a bit cliché and extra.
*Characters - I liked how each character was significantly different from each other and had different reasons for why they were doing what they were. However, that’s as far as it goes. Focusing on the slightly more three-dimensional characters, initially almost all characters were so one track minded that it got a bit annoying to watch. The stubbornness made it extremely difficult to fully root for any character or relationship, and so I didn't find any character particularly outstanding or likeable. As the drama aimed to reflect real life struggles and conflicts, the characters also seemed a bit too extreme for my taste. The “evilness” of the antagonist was a bit exaggerated, and the sense of justice of the protagonist was also a bit ridiculous. Perhaps this could be favourable in another light as it’s the first time I felt annoyed with the protagonist, which is quite different. Character development was rather lacking in that there either was none or that the development felt rushed and random at times. It felt as if by stating numerous years passed, the abrupt change in character was justified. My recommendation would be to show more hints of change prior to the time jump so there is a smoother transition. There was definitely potential, just weak execution. For the character relationships, the main love line is unique but again difficult to fully root for. I flip-flopped too much between rooting for the two female leads that it got a bit tiresome. Near the end, I decided that the protagonist didn't deserve either female lead so didn't really care much about who he ended up with. The strong friendship between the Dan Bam crew was decently executed and explained though.
*Ending - An extremely predictable ending with all loose ends tied. I hit the fast forward button multiple times throughout the episode as it was dragging on, and the happily ever after aspect was a bit forced and try hard, but I suppose a plain ending is better than a bad ending. Simply put, my opinion on the ending was compatible with my opinion on the drama. There was nothing added, nothing lost. In the end, a decent ending for a decent drama. Unlikely to have post-drama blues for this one.

= Cast =
*Acting - For the most part, the actors / actresses portrayed the characters well, though I didn't feel that anyone in particular stole the spotlight. One of the actors I thought was a bit lacking regardless of the character design was Kim Dong Hee (Jang Geun Soo). Given his character’s experience I felt like he could’ve shown it more with his expressions (his go-to expression is the mild pursing of lips or just slightly raising his eyebrows) or his actions, as it seemed a bit mundane throughout the drama. However given he is still a new and young actor there’s plenty of time for him to improve.
*Chemistry - Didn’t feel that there were any perfect matches or overwhelmingly good chemistry that was exuded. Perhaps that’s what the story was going for as the Dan Bam crew were misfits after all.

= OST =
Decent soundtrack which was quite unique. There were a variety of songs including uplifting motivational ones and also sentimental songs. As a whole, not really the type of music I enjoy, however the songs were a great pick and did match the drama well.


|| A LESSON ABOUT POWER ||

True power comes not from materialistic possessions but from those around you. With the right people, everything impossible suddenly seems possible.

Unfortunately Overrated
I was really excited to watch this drama because of the immense hype around it.

After the first 3-4 episodes, I thought it would become one of my favourites. I loved the backstory they created for Park Saeroyi's character. Those episodes really make you hurt for him and root for his ultimate success. Unlike some Kdramas (e.g. Heirs), it was unique to see the male lead really stand up against bullying and class differences at school, and I was expecting an epic and satisfying revenge arc for his character.

Unfortunately the drama started to go downhill from that point. What could have been an amazing story fell flat. I expected the plot to be more layered and complex than it was. The episodes became excruciatingly slow, and the main female lead increasingly unlikable. Much of the dialogue became stunted and contrived, with excessive pauses and blank stares. Character motivations were difficult to justify, and felt cartoon-ish and unreal (particularly in the case of negative/villain roles). The social justice messages in the drama were also conveyed in a very long-winded, preachy and non-subtle way. And without saying too much - I also found the final few episodes laughable. It seemed as though the writer didn't know how to end the drama, or resolve loose ends, so they decided to throw together a cocktail of cliches and coincidences to make it work.

I understand that for a Kdrama, it was definitely unique and progressive for featuring characters from different backgrounds, in terms of race and sexuality. For that I give it credit. The actors did a great job too, and the OST is brilliant. But unfortunately, those things don't save it from being poorly written. I hope in 10 years they decide to remake the show, with the same premise, and a better ending!

Itaewon class as one of the most expected drama in this year was just an okay experience for me. I agree that there are segments which were different from the regular set of ROM coms but sometimes the drama tested my patience. Park SEO Joon had very little to do in this drama where the rest of the costars where mainly involved in the acting part. Finishing the drama, I had mixed feeling . Rich evil guy is something that is overused in kdrama world, and in this drama, it seemed more unrealistic. The chairman who played the antogonist role was superb ,I would say. The lead actress was okay, but there were moments when her acting got on my nerves.
Music and ost are below average. Finally , this is not a drama that I would recommend if you value your time and data

If you want to go on a journey about human relationships that explores all the subtle nuances, gray areas, and motivations, that encompass being a human, then this is a must watch. Every single character was so finely etched and just the fact that you sympathize with each and every character in the show at least once, conveys the amount of depth and sincerity in the narrative. Every single scene has so many undertones and if you try and pay attention to everything that is NOT being said, along with everything that is being verbalized, you'll come to appreciate the brilliant storytelling even more. I can for sure say that just by watching this show, I was able to reflect more on my actions, motivations and aspirations, and grow into a better human being. The acting is A++++++. Will not be forgetting any of the characters, especially SRY and YS for a long long time.

I don't know where to start. It's so fascinating how a story with such a gripping hook and beautiful portrayal of a broken teenager could turn into a sap story cliche. Not only did the acting turn sour, the characters and the plot completely pushed it down the cliff of cringe. Some of the moments were honestly so atrocious, I found myself yelling at the TV screen; how could a series go from phenomenal to something so sub-par in a matter of 8 episodes?

Let's start with the acting. For the first 5-6 episodes, Park Seo-Joon had my heart. I felt like I wanted to hold him as he battled the more than flawed system. I wanted to kill anyone who'd damaged this poor boy, yet he continued to get up and persevere. They way that he swayed me with his constant belief in his principles and how he didn't want anything more than to be a son that his father could say he was proud of; he totally had me. I was constantly impressed (that is until episode 8 and on). He went from the strong boy to a clueless and dependent man. Nothing like I wanted him to become.

And his relationship with his female leads? Atrocious. Purely horrendous to watch. First it's that childhood crush of his, Soo-Ah. He constantly talked about how independent she was and that she should only rely on herself? I call bull. Constantly wants to be assured that PSJ likes her while she's practically lying in bed with the family that killed his father, got him expelled and tried to ruin his career. And she sheds a tear when he gives a little more attention to himself than to her? I honestly have to laugh at this hypocrite. Selfish, inconsiderate, dependent, lazy, etc.

And let's go to little miss Yi-Seo. If you think constantly reminding someone who's rejected you for 5-6 years is romantic, you're twisted. If you reversed the roles around, the man would be considered to be harassing the women, but just because she's a young, pretty and smart woman, it's a pass? That's disgusting. Nothing about their relationship is romantic. She's a smart woman but wouldn't know professionalism if it her in the face. This goes for Soo-Ah too. Not any of the three deserve to be in a relationship. PSJ is indecisive about anything related to his heart, Soo-Ah just likes the idea of being chased, and Ii-Seo has can't get over a first love. It's ironic that she once said that just because you get rejected once doesn't mean they're the only one, and yet she's being an annoying baby about PSJ. Both females are hypocrites, and PSJ is just plain stupid.

Honestly, the saving graces were To-Ni, Hyun-Yi, and Seung-Kwon. Thank the directors for being inclusive with these characters. I wouldn't say I'm an advocate for the LGBTQIAA+, but I truly wanted to understand the group better thanks to Hyun-Yi's portrayal of one of their many struggles. Thank you for that refreshing character.

I was really hoping for a lasting drama considering the acting cast. There were so many weak links, it just couldn't be possible. I have to say though, the first 8 episodes were beautifully well down. I do not mean to hate on this drama, but I'm criticizing it because I know that the actors could and can do better.

To me Itaewon class is one of those drama I would definitely let my kids watch. Apart from all the romance in it. It’s such an eye opener. You get to see the world from different angles. It also shows us the relationship between people. Those who will willingly sacrifice for you and those who are greedy. I always tell my friends this. We can never choose who are parents are, we can never choose your own name when you born and you can’t choose the color of your skin either. But we can choose who we make our friends, we can choose our spouses and we can choose who are business partners are. So choose wisely.

Danbam, a sweet night. And I had many sweet nights (and days) watching this drama on a weekly basis.

The story is not ground-breaking. It is your standard David vs Goliath revenge tale, but sprinkle in characters like Park Sae Ro Yi and his immovable principles, Jo Yi Seo and her cunning brilliance, and I'm hooked.
Contrary to what is said in the show, is it not easy to be a person like Sae Ro Yi (or Yi Seo, either) and that was a lot of the appeal for me; to see a character so unfamiliar and uncommon in a world that does not favor those who don't compromise.
The development of supporting characters is also very good, especially Seung Kwon.
The romance wasn't the point of the story for me but I wasn't disappointed or confused by the result. It was also really enjoyable to see Soo Ah and Yi Seo square off time and time again.

I would definitely recommend a watch of this show and hope you can take some lessons to heart on the way.

Itaewon Class is one of those rare kdramas that have an explosive start. The first two episodes are enough to capture the viewers' attention and raise their anticipation. The plot is strong, very promising, I wouldn't say unique, but is still a rare gem in the kdrama world an feels like a breath of fresh air. The screenplay is amazing and gives a sense of hope and inspiration while showing common people strive through hardships and do the unthinkable. The drama has also touched sensitive issues like racism and lgbtq and has dealt with it quite well, given that it is a korean drama. But the ending just put me off very badly. I am so disappointed. They could have pulled it off in the most majestic way, yet they had to drive us all into the overused hole of romantic angles and cliches. The determination and principle that started the very plot of the drama seem to fall flat towards the end. The drama didn't do justice to many characters and gives a bad aftertaste.
Well, I couldn't end the review without talking about the characters. The group of misfits namely Seungkwan, Hyunyi, Toni, Yiseo and their boss/leader/mentor Saeroyi are the center of attraction in this drama. Park Seojoon's portrayal of the character Saeroyi is awesome. He is trustworthy, dependable and an awkwardly funny character, capable of making the viewers laugh with him as well as shed tears with him, though his decisions towards the end of the drama disappointed me a lot. The unbreakable bond between these characters is a delight to watch. Kwon Nara as Soo Ah has done a fantastic job. She represents the independent working woman of 21st century, struggling through her internal conflicts between loyalty, gratitude, competition and love. Ahn Bo Hyun as Jang Geun Won is totally believable as the typical rich brat who bullies anyone and everyone on his way but is actually an insecure kid at heart, terrified of his father. Speaking of his father Chairman Jang Dae Hee (played by Yoo Jae Myung) is the epic villain of the story. This character deserves equal appreciation as that of Saeroyi. He is evil, shrewd, plays dirty politics but on the other hand, is hardworking, self-made, inspiring and a successful man. Yoo Jae Myung gives a new persona to this vicious character and i am sure the viewers will see this villain in a different light. As much as I hate this character, there is a certain sense of admiration and respect towards him in my heart which I can't explain. Lastly Yiseo (played by Kim Da Mi)- oh boy, i can't deal with her. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't like her at all, nor relate to her feelings even remotely. She is a confident, smart and very capable young lady but has lots of negative traits. Okay, her character is meant to be a sociopath, but that doesn't give anyone the free pass to act in the most hypocritical way possible. She uses people and discards them like an old tissue. The fact that she is one of the main leads in the drama and doesn't even have a character growth at the end just angers me the most. The rest of the supporting cast have done their job quite well. I just wish there were an alternate ending to this story, a more righteous and impactful one. I would recommend you to watch Itaewon Class but I can't guarantee you that you will like the ending. For Park Seo Joon fans, definitely go for it, for the awesome fight scenes and his signature awkward comedy.

REVIEW
The opening episodes did an exceptional job to draw you in with a very unjust conflict that reliably foreshadowed the themes of revenge. The first 3-4 episodes was executed in a very unpredictable manner that was great at making you second guess on where the plot was going and made it effortless to binge watch. However, I can't give the same compliment to the rest of this drama as the scenes begin to drag soon after and this got worse later on.

(Spoilers) By far the biggest issues I have with this drama are the characters and their character development. Firstly, our main protagonist Park SaeRoYi really wasn't all that intelligent as a businessman. Had he not luckily got YiSeo to fall in love with him, he would have not even come close to his success in the end as he did. In fact, both of the women that loved him were far more competent than he was. It only took a numerous amount of second chances where he'd almost completely run his company to the ground due to his stubbornness before he was able to learn from his mistakes. And technically, Soo Ah was actually the one who destroyed Jangga, not SaeRoYi. Secondly, I also just cannot relate to YiSeo's character. It made no sense to me that she would love SaeRoYi so much just after learning about his past whereas before she was a girl who did not give a f*** about anything. Her character is quite controversial among all the reviews I've seen - people either find her creepy and overly obsessive or admire her dedication. Either way, her character as a whole is just a huge stretch especially if you consider how little she knew of Park SaeRoYi before deciding to dedicate her entire life around him. I also want to comment on HyunYi (the chef of DanBam). She came from a background with zero education and experience of cooking and somehow she is able to be beat Jangga just by some trial and error style learning with YiSeo's taste-testing? Like, I wish the world was that easy. The last comment I want to make are for the villains - both Jang Geun Won (the son) and Jang Dae Hee (father)'s character just feel really flat and one-directional. The son being reckless is something I can see but Dae Hee is the CEO of a massive corporation. Yet, his way of thinking is just way too immature for anyone close to being as successful as he is supposed to be.

Overall, I think this drama had good ideas and meaningful intentions but tried way too hard to make a grand finale for this story resulting in poor and disconnected execution.

PSJ was the reason for the success of this drama
PSJ was the reason for the success of this drama. You could put a bunch of actors in a room, but no one would have been able to portray his character (Park Saeroyi) like PSJ did himself. This drama was released at a time when Crash Landing on You (CLOY) was becoming one of the highest-rated shows of all times, and whilst this didn't quite compare to CLOY, it did however peak my interest in other ways. For example, the supporting cast involved characters from all different walks of life and is a good affirmation of that saying: ""never judge a book by its cover"". It highlighted discrimination, gender issues, corporate power/greed, and perserverance very well. There were some scenes which were a bit lacking and the chemistry b/w the lead actors could have been stronger, but overall this drama was well written and directed.

Storyline -- started off great but then overly exaggerated towards the end with unncessary back and forth revenge acts, and in particular, Jo Yi-seo's character who was just annoying, irritating and difficult to watch.

Acting -- great execution and compelling performances by Park Seo-joon in his portrayal as Park Saeroyi, and from Yoo Jae-myung who played Jang Dae-hee (CEO of Jangga Pub).

Characters -- I loved that each character came from all different walks of life and was determined to put up a fight regardless of societal standards and values.

OST -- wasn't that big of a fan of the (pop rock) OST to be honest but maybe just a few song selections here and there.

I love Park Seojoon and was so thrilled that he had a new drama coming out. The premise seemed intriguing, and when I finished Episode 1, I was already desperate for more. However, as I continued on, I started falling more and more out of love with it.

While I'm a sucker for time skips in dramas ( usually I like that it helps to move the plot forward without having to go through all the filler in between ), this one seemed to make use of it too much without it explaining why or how we got to a certain point. The way certain characters were developed didn't seem consistent with their original characterization. It felt like the drama wanted us to get to a certain point, but it didn't really go about the best means in doing so.

I didn't feel anything for the relationships between the characters, and most scenarios were predictable at best. I do have friends who really liked the drama ( and others who hated it to the point they just dropped it altogether midway ) and it seems like people also feel a wide range of emotions towards it on this site. Wouldn't be a drama that I'd recommend immediately, but perhaps if you really like one of the cast members, you'd be interested in checking it out.

Wow, so many negative reviews. Even though I agree that Itaewon Class is not the best drama out there and it has a lot of flaws, I can't deny the fact that I enjoyed watching it and I really appreciate the message the drama tried to say and did it very well.

Itaewon Class started in a very cliche way and honestly, I wasn't really into the first two episodes but I decided to wait before dropping it and I'm glad I did it because the drama truly got better as the actual plot started progressing. I loved the first half, it was slow-paced but at the same time it wasn't even close to being draggy or tiring. Each episode was filled with excitement and intensity. The whole atmosphere around ''DanBam'' was so heart-warming and beautiful and I was so glad to see Se Roy's dream becoming true. Itaweon Class is a very inspiring show and it really gives you confindence about your dreams and goals in life. Seeing our protagonist giving his all to achieve his dream, seeing the passion in his eyes, it just makes you feel very motivated and it gives you energy. Of course, the drama has a very idealistic view and Se Roy himself is an absolute idealist which is why it's hard to connect the storyline to the reality we are living in. But the purpose of Itaewon Class is not to be realistic and you shouldn't approach it that way.

The second half was when the drama started getting a little bit too draggy and repetitive. All things I loved in the first half lost their impact somehow and I lowkey stoped caring about what's happening between DanBam and Jangga Co. There were so many filler scenes which had literally no impact to the actual story and it was very easy for me to get bored.

However, even though I was definitely getting bored at one point, I didn't stop watching because I really, really loved the characters and I believe they are written very well. Park Se Roy, as I already said, is a total idealist who never betrayed his ideals and stayed true to himself till the very end. Being such a sweet and kind-hearted human being, his character is very easy to like.

Jo Yi Seo is definitely the most interesting character in the drama and she's also the one who developed the most. They introduced her as a sociopath and one thing I really love about IC is that they never try to romanticize the fact that she was a sociopath. It's true that she was a very cool, sassy rebel who knows how to kick some asses and defend herself. However, no matter how bold she was, some of her doings and things she said were horrible and repellent. Sociopaths lack emphaty and so does she. But as the story progressed, she developed so so much. Her love for Se Roy made her a better person. You know, Se Roy is this type of person who always gives you positive energy, whose ideals are so big that they make you feel small and you just want to become a better person like him. I have never ever thought that Yi Seo's love for Se Roy was an obsession.

Oh So Ah... was quite useless? When the drama started, I thought she would be a super annoying bi*ch but I think she was just... fine. I don't know, I feel like her existence in the drama was more or less poitless, but I guess Se Roy needed to have a crush on someone. I wouldn't say she is a bad character -- on the contrary, she was quite an interesting persona but it's just the fact that she had no real connection to the plot.

The Danbam crew was amazing! I love how different they were but how they got on so well. The villians -- Jang Geun Won and his trashy father whose name I don't remember were a bit weak to be honest. Especially the father, he was just annoying. Geun Won though... this man was just disgusting.

The romance is not a big part of the drama, but it is definitely there. I don't really know how I feel about it though. [SPOILER >>> ] Everything felt so rushed, like Se Roy liked Soo Ah the whole time, not showing any interest in Yi Seo, but then suddenly, he realizes that he was in love with Yi Seo all this time? It was way too rushed in my opinion.

The acting was very good, especially kudos to Park Seo Joon and Kim Da Mi! Also, my man Ryu Kyung Soo!!! I'm really thankful that they casted him, he is very talanted but very underrated unfortunately.

The ending was very satisfying and it gave a good closure to the drama. Gaho's OST in the end almost made me cry, I just love this song soooooo much!

Overall, Itaewon Class is a good show which has flaws, but it's quite enjoyable. The characters are its charm for sure and I would recommend it if you like character-driven dramas.

I’m not really one for writing reviews- just because I’m terrible at it haha.

Let me start with saying that it’s been awhile since I have been sucked right into a show with all the things I love, action, fighting, Revenge, I wouldn’t say romance to be exact .... maybe near the end but it fits perfectly with the direction of this show.

The story starts and ends really nicely for the amount of episodes, it ties up perfectly not rushed and finishes everything cleanly, I was super impressed actually since some shows tend to rush and leave you with questions.... they literally cover everything.


Music was really good I actually downloaded some of the sound track. Music was fitting with the scenes.


Acting: Every single character was amazing in there part!! I’m always blowin away with Park Seo-Joon acting, very talented !!



Like I said I’m no good at writing reviews lol this show is well worth the watch !! :)

Happy watching

The Strong Prey on the Weak
The strong prey on the weak, that's what the President believed his whole life, but he never once accounted to one day being the weak. Life is but a series of learned lessons, and if one pays close attention, they might be blessed enough to understand its power and the fact that every weakness contains within itself a strength. For me, the biggest takeaways from this drama are that one should focus on character, not reputation, and count their blessings rather than their misfortunes. In the end, revenge was a proper fuel to get Sae-yo-ri to where he needed to get to, and once he got there, he understood it was time to let it go because revenge only makes wounds fester. The value of life is in the people you choose to have around you. It is too short to waste on people who don't respect, appreciate, and value you.

I enjoyed this drama a great deal, with all its subtle difference in, or shades of meanings, expressions, and actions. Most importantly, I appreciated the writer, director, and actors for tackling sensitive matters such as racism, transgender, relationships, and love in all its forms. True love is to love with all of one's being -- provide support and love to that person through anything and everything. Love hard, with everything you've got. I also appreciate this drama for all the heated and passionate discussions and for helping me understand that the meaning of life may mean different things to different people. Still, we are all just trying to live to the best of our abilities.

Itaewon class started as a full of heart, emotional and intelligent drama not unlike its beautiful characters and it stayed that way for most of the part. To the point, that based on the first 60% alone, I'd give it a solid 9.

However, towards the end it lost a lot of its identity and took a turn most run-of-the-mill k-dramas do. The writing took a lot of hits as it floundered confused about what direction to take.

Out of the blue kidnappings, dramatic fight scenes, near death experiences and other ridiculousness that was so unlike what the show stood for. It started as a very bearing drama with a constant melancholic but hopeful vibe as it documented the journey of various characters with different paths in life who came together to build a dream with tenacity and determination. Never knew it would turn into fucking ""The K2"" towards the end. Lol

Speaking of characters, Park Sae Joon did a brilliant job bringing forward a hero unlike many others. He was the definition of silent strength, a brilliant mind and perseverence. A man who got up again and again even with the odds stacked against him. Someone who managed to retain his composure, compassion and child like purity despite all the shit life handed to him.

Kim Da Mi, surely the breakout artist of the year was a delight to watch. Yi Soo was a tiny ball of vicious energy. She was driven and determined to the core, with a sharp young mind and someone who never gave up no matter what you did to her.

At the same time however, she was also incredibly rude, selfish and did downright horrible things. I'm all up for that as it added to her complexity and made her sweet moments all the more impactful but I hated that her backstory was not explored at all. What made her that way? I would really like to know but nopes.

Some people didn't buy the romance but I did. I think the drama pulled this aspect fairly well. Both of them played a significant part in the other's life. For Yi Soo, her quest for love gave her genius but idle mind a purpose, it grounded her and made her a better person and for Saeroyi, Yi Soo was his backbone. The true kingmaker and the force behind his success. When everyone told him his dreams were impossible she not only stood by them, she made them happen.

They were good for each other which is why the romance rang true for me. Sure, Yi Soo was a bit obsessive and took it to another level but that was her character from the start. Love or success, she'd take everything to the extreme. (Again, I'm annoyed at the fact why that was so. We are just supposed to accept her personality as it is though without any insight.)

All the characters had their amazing moments in the show however some did not develop as nicely as they could have cause of bad writing 101. The second FL came through at times but mostly her victim-is-me mentality annoyed me to no end. The villains were okay-ish, none too exceptional but they did the job.

Over-all, the drama delivered a lot of important messages and did a good effort at being woke. That said, it also had a lot of corny, overly sappy and unrealistic moments where I couldn't help but roll my eyes.

In the end, I'll say that while this drama was definitely not exceptionally good in terms of writing and later on even the execution, it was a fun ride for sure. I binged it in 2 days straight and never found an episode that made me yawn.

So while I do reccomend it, I would advise not to have sky high expectations going in, because of the hype surrounding it.

A solid drama, not 10 stars though
The acting was superior, especially that from the main characters.

I have some major complaints though:

1. The plot. it is highly predictable. The "" kidnap and torture"" scenario is so cliche. I mean, 90% of all action dramas have some form of kidnapping. It's almost like people dying from cancer or the main character's mom abandoning him in childhood.

2. Social diversity. Okay, so they decided to show how ""progressive"" Korea is - they lumped all the ""nouveau"" social categories into one narrative - a transgender, an African Korean guy, an ex-con, an Instagram influencer. Would the story be less appealing without them? They are just there for decor, they don't really do anything. There was a pivotal part when the transgender woman was accepted by the public but I believe it didn't make this drama more interesting.

3. Chris Lyon. I mean, what do I even say? I watched his interview and he is a great guy with a lot of charm. Unfortunately, it didn't transfer into his acting. He needs to work on his acting skills. I am sure he has great potential.

Overall, a solid drama, although I am disappointed. Less original that I would like it to be.

I am a huge Park Seojoon fan, let me start by saying that. But, I am not a blind fan and I can acknowledge his faulty dramas (Hwarang I am looking at you). I don't normally write reviews for shows I don't love either, but I just feel so strongly towards this.

In the beginning, honestly this was a great show. I was in on it, even if both the female leads annoyed me to no end. However, I could acknowledge the distinctive characters, especially Yiseo who was a refreshingly unique, and although we didn't see eye-to-eye (she is a damn sociopath), I would prefer her character over a typical candy girl. However, it almost felt like her character was being forcibly redeemed through the loveline to show her less manipulative aspects but it seemed obvious and awkward. Her character was refreshing in the beginning, but became whiny, childish, and completely annoying. And honestly, I was not asking for her character to change or suddenly become kind, because, again, that would be unrealistic. But, what I would have liked is not some sort of general acceptance of her character, as if she was somehow good or ""badass"". She was constantly shown to get whatever she wanted without consequences, and I would have much preferred she didn't ""get"" Saeroyi. It would have been so much better as a plot device to almost ""atone"" for her actions and realize she can't have everything. Just finished watching Misaeng, and there are so many characters I absolutely despise in the beginning but now naturally love/like, and it really did not feel forced, I almost did not notice I now liked them. Comparing that to Itaewon Class just made her character's awkward growth even more evident. Saeroyi's sudden turn of feelings towards love seemed so sudden and so forced, they should have left their relationship as coworkers and completely omitted any romance, even with Nara's character. I would have much preferred they shown her as a first love that he now knows is in a different situation from the past and let her go. The themes of camaraderie, friendship, and loyalty were so much stronger than the romance, and were the strongest aspects of the show. They should have continued to built slowly on that instead of the uninteresting romance.

Saeroyi's character was also not the strongest, he felt like a typical Shounen lead. However, it would be a lie if I say I didn't love Park Seojoon's version of the character; much like Naruto, even though it felt kind of annoying watching him accomplish so much based on stubborn goodwill (because that is really not how life works), it did feel rewarding watching him win and did put a dopey smile on my face every time seeing him happy. Jang Geun-soo's character switch into becoming an antagonist was also so sudden and his reasoning did not seem enough to make such a drastic change.

The acting was great, Seojoon was incredible (although that is a bit biased). Yoo Jae-myung as CEO Jang was also great and Dami played her role well too. Nara still has a way to go, I was not sold on her acting. The supporting cast was also decent, some stronger than others.

Considering the story, in the beginning it was really interesting and I was really glad it covered inequality, corruption, and also a lot of societal issues. But, eventually the show began to battle itself trying to become too ""woke"". And often times, the marginalized characters like Toni were shown to be discriminated against, but then the problem was quickly swept under the rug. It felt as if the issue was half heartedly added to make the show superficially look ""aware"" without actual thought and care being added to exploring it. The fact that the main female lead was openly discriminatory but became nice at the end simply because she saw some profitable value from the people she unjustly disliked was not enough redemption or a valid reason to gloss over the issues. Again, the plot felt very Shounen manga like, i.e. unrealistic problems being thrown at the lead, while predictable solutions just happened to be there too. (What are the chances the guy he saved from being bullied just HAPPENED to become an excellent investment manager, making him lots of money, and still being connected to the other CEO lady? What are the chances that the boy who he just expelled for punching was also the same person that ended up killing his father?).

Overall, I was excited in the beginning and genuinely enjoyed but at the end, watching became a chore so I dropped it with 2 and a half episodes left. I love you Seojoon, but this was not my cup of tea and I really hope your next drama makes you shine brighter than this did.

My dude. Where do I start? The series was so promising at the start. Probably could have been one of the best KDramas ever. I don't know what the fuck the writers smoked to come up with the most cliched drama bullshit love story after the 4 year timeskip. The series was going so well, the characters were well made, nobody was overly good or overly bad. The love story seamed to either go towards the initial love interest or towards a no love interest at all. Then, out of nowhere. We get a dumbass timeskip and suddenly the main character who has loved a certain character for over 10 years and has been shown in the series to love that character suddenly does not do so anymore? Seriously? and then to top it all off, we get the most forced ""its the end of the series we gotta have some high stakes action"" bullshit ever. This just took me out of the series and reminded that I am not watching someones creative work. I am watching someones soulless commercial bullshit that just attempted to appease the fans of the show when it was airing. What a disappointment.

This is NOT a drama for those looking for cliche romcoms, as romance is not a central part of the story.

Itaewon Class is about fighting for what you think is right, even when everyone else is against you. It shows the best and the worst of the Korean society and humanity itself. It's proof that there's no good or evil, but people who make the wrong choices, and that it's easy to judge without knowing what the other person is going through. It shows the importance of our choices - if you make a mistake, you should take responsibility for your actions, but if you are doing what you think is right, no matter the outcome, you'll have no regrets. And above all, it has a very clear message: there's nothing you can't do if you try hard enough, you just need the strength to get up again every time you fall.

The characters all have their own stories, and they are perfectly played by the actors.

The OST is good, I might even add the songs to my playlist now that the drama is finished!

I'll definitely rewatch the drama in the future, especially next time I feel like giving up.

Thank you for reading!

Impressive array of emotion and depth, exceptional music.
My favorite Kdrama song so far has come from this series. I am a bird, yo, now cook me some fries! How you make a song with such weirdly shallow lyrics so beautiful I will never know, but it's absolutely stunning to my rock-beaten eardrums.

The Kdrama itself has such a deep, expansive, and compelling storyline. The lead actor is exactly perfect for this role, he's basically a world-wise older brother who quietly, slowly, but persistently moves through life past every failure to success. The lead actress, at first I thought she was a side-character. Her character is both fun and annoying, she's a legit shallow brat at the start. But her character arc is exceptionally well executed and she ends up being the anchor for the entire drama. The actress delivers an absolutely masterful performance that has such a broad range from child to brat to growth to powerhouse. Both the main leads have such growth and intelligent story arcs that you feel like you are watching people actually progress through life. The whole thing was really well done.

I went into this drama like...wtf Itaewon Class?? I don't want to watch a school drama...I don't want to watch a cooking drama...meh this sounds boring. But it got such good ratings I decided to give it a shot. Boy is it nothing like its title. It's not a story about cooking, and definitely not a story about cooking, it's an inspirational story of overcoming absolutely devastating life challenges. Not by supernatural ability or even astounding talent...they overcome every challenge by sheer force of will and dogged persistence. It feels like it's a story about actual people that could actually exist.

The best part about this drama is watching the growth of the lead and side characters. You're anchored by the male lead and you watch as the other leads and side characters like water moving around a rock in the river. They are often so far from where he is at every step, and yet he brings them all into his gravitational pull and they end up with such a deep cohesion that you literally want to be one of the planets orbiting the sun that is the lead.

Dude does have the worst haircut of all time. Couldn't avoid mentioning that. Someone at some point needed to take this dude to a barber in the show so we'd all get to stop looking at that truly disastrous fringe. I didn't knock any points off for the bad hair though, since clearly it fit with the character's personality....but come on...

The FLs
I really don't know where to start but I'll start with the story, the story was honestly really attractive and that too with a character like Seroyi made it enjoyable to watch in the beginning.

But the cliches in the drama didn't go unnoticed. I'm talking about the cliche where the writer tries to make the second FL into an ""annoying"" character, to make the main couple everyone's OTP, I was honestly expecting this but the Uniqueness of each character at the beginning made me think this wouldn't be the case. Even with how much, they try to make Soo Ah an annoying character I feel like she was a well-developed character, she knew what she wanted, went for it, and made it happen. Which I thought was something that made her and Seroyi similar.

Now, Jo Yi Seo, I'm gonna be really honest about her character. At the beginning of this drama, I loved Jo Yi Seo, cause she had an IDGAF attitude, she didn't let anyone take advantage of her or anything and that was totally lovable about her...Until she made something I believed was a transphobic statement towards Hyun Yi, a lot of people try to defend this action by regarding the development of their friendship, they became friends, good, but I don't remember watching any scene Yi Seo apologized ( correct me if I'm wrong). Not only did she do that she also made an offensive statement to Toni about his skin color, this seriously made me mad, what made me even madder was that there were some drama stans trying to defend this action.
(This might give anyone out there the impression they could say this to others).

This could also count as a pattern I noticed in some of 2020 Kdramas. And that is when it's so obvious that the writer is trying so hard to make the FL into a badass, and due to this reason these characters make an offensive statement but it's covered up with the fact that they're ""Badasses."" I Just Want Y'all to know a character could be cute, sensitive, respectful, and also be a Badass.

And for those who still feel like they had to hate Soo Ah or Jo Yi Seo for the sake of their ship, STOP, it's just childish at this point. I know it may seem like I'm hating on Jo Yi Seo I'm not cuz she's just gonna be a fictional character at the end of the day and due to the reason that I thought she was gonna be my fave character I wrote this review and I really think if Jo Yi Seo's character wasn't like data, she would have had amazing chemistry with Soo Ah, I have my reasons.

I don't even know where to begin.....

How does one ruin a show that's starring Park Seo Joon, Kwon Nara, and Kim Da Mi? Well we have to give it to the writers of this show


Story

TRASH. Straight up fucking Trash. A story that looked beautifully written in the first 2-3 eps, and just went on a downhill spiral from there. The closest I can compare the quality of the story is to Bride of the Water god's: a fucking joke.


Acting

The show had good actors, even the supporting ones. I'll give them a pass: They all played their characters right, the story just brought them down. This is definitely Park Seo Joon's worst drama up to date


Music

The saving grace of the show (if there is anything left to save lmao). Good OSTs


Rewatch Value

No, I will not re-watch 16 hours of trash.


Overall

If you want a drama that's not sci-fi, but as unrealistic as a sci-fi is, then watch this shit show

I was so drawn by this show and just kept watching it. The first episode captured me into the story wanting to know what is going to happen. This story started from want revenge to ending up finding a found family at the end. I also loved that they add diversity to this show.

The OST was one of my favorites, maybe even one of my top 5. My favorite song is Sweet Night by V and Begining by Gaho.

Park Seo Joon is one of my favorite actors and I loved how he played Sae Ro Yi. Sae Ro Yi is one of my favorite character in the show he very true to himself which and his values. He has a positive effect on people around him and which shows that he will never be alone again.

The DamBag gang in general is one of my favorite friendship groups. I would do anything to be a part of this group. They have shown how loyal they are toward each other and basically created this family. I love the leadership that Sea Ro Yi has in this group, he showed what it means to be a leader and it left the group with positive impacts from him.

YI Seo was my girl !! I freaking love her! She is such a strong woman and didn't take crap from anyone.

BEST KDRAMA EVER
I had no idea what to expect before coming into this kdrama, but I was blown away. By far the most entertaining show I have watched this year. I loved the revenge plot, romance subplot, tremendous acting, ost, etc. Surpassed all my expectations, such a different and refreshing show. Just amazing, deserves this high review from me. I especially liked the main two actors, Park Seo Joon and Kim Dami. Park seo joon is usually the rom com king, but I really liked his performance in Itaewon class, he had lots of emotion in his acting. Now Kim Dami was equally amazing. I had never heard of her before this show, but I am excited to watch her future works based on her performance in this work.

First part is good but is rushed the second part
We watched the series to prove that he does not need to kneel down to those disgusting people. If he would do that just for a girl he magically love why can't he do it for his father which means EVERYTHING TO HIM. For the story? Well that makes the story shit. The pub was supposed to be used to achieve his goals and in that goal he has Oh Soo Ah in it (did not happen because of sudden changed of heart which is kind of a bad decision because he loved and treated Yi Seo as a little sister), To Destroy the Jangga Co. (somehow managed to achieve by destroying its core but decided to buy it), To destroy and make Chairman Jang and His Son apologize. (Make an old sick man on a cancer kneel before him which makes the whole awaited moment became the most pitiful moment, which is hard to swallow even if you know what that old sick man did at the momment). We also watched and I certainly enjoyed how the pub goes bigger and bigger by a single step but suddenly the time skip, also turns out that they stopped clashing with the Jangga Co. which makes no sense at all. Starting something and suddenly stop for a break and let the little pub grow bigger without us interfering. THAT IS THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT being bullied by the powerful just because they hated your guts, but then after sometime well actually no let's let them do their thing even he put my beloved planned successor in bars and after being humiliated by being 2nd on a tv series that hurts our pride because we are and we SHOULD be always at the peak, let us not be bothered. I mean WTH its the perfect time to take your move because he actually did something for you to get on your nerves then decides to do nothing. Now there is Soo Ah where was the first love the one who waited 15 years, the who knows it all and been there all the time but don't have feelings but actually do for Sae Ro Yi enjoying their rivalry but did not like both of them to win (LOL) being in the enemies side while being a dog of the enemies boss but was actually a helping hand. She is one of the reason why Sae Ro Yi wants to destroy the Jangga Co. because of what they did to both of them which is forgotten by the time. Did not get chosen, but here is the thing she also waited for the 15 years did not dated anyone, and is safe to say did not have a single relationship, INSTANTLY falling to a chef from the palace (LOL).

The pub arc was good the only reason why I finished the last two episode because the building the pub from the very beginning while trusting your co workers to achieve things step by step was the best. I was thinking on how he can manage to defeat the No. 1 in the industry (which came out that its not a good way). First I was shocked that Seung Kwon beat the ass out of Sae Ro Yi when he is such a fighter (shows in the school days and should gain more punch when he's done all those job) but turns out to be an elite fighter him self that fills out the hole, and all the club moments were the best you can see them as a true co workers and it is God damn satisfying. Hyun Yi was the best! she resembles the looks of Jeongyeon of TWICE and acts boyish and I actually thought that she was a girl acting as a he but I AM DEFINITELY WRONG! I am a new fan of hers actually immediately search her to see if she is not a real thing but thankfully she a real SHE, going on her acting is so good and the being bad at first although cliché comes up good and the actually winning the contest is just satisfying. Toni is a needed additional he made the pub story more interesting the only thing is that his father was an idiot for not noticing they are RICH, or is just lying to Toni for no reason at all. Yi Seo on the building the pub is a good character which did care if her feelings is not returned and was clearly rejected the ""it's not a business"" thing but in the end swallowed and does not make sense at all, moving on she is really good at her role as a psychotic manager who will do anything to make the pub the No. 1 in the industry. Thought Geun Soo have invested in the ""IC"" and will use that as a card for later issue like how Sae Ro Yi did but turns out that was never an option and him being the instant villain is not that good choice because it was for naught. Geun Soo was suppose to be searching for someone to lean on and forgot all the things they've been through and the I belong to DanBam not in the Jangga Co. just for NOTHING. Soo Ah is also good at her role, being around at the pub while being boycotted is good (for me atleast) and actually being nosy on the pub makes the rivalry enjoyable.

Overall
It was a ok KDrama, if they just don't rushed it and expanded the grow the little pub little by little and get another season for better story it will be one of the best but the time skip really messed up.
Actors/Actresses is the best and did what they are supposed to do.
Music is great it can really hype the situation up.
But I don't really think I would rewatch it if not for the pub arc.
It was a roller coaster ride if it not ended like that would be much more fun.

Itaewon Class shows us how to LIVE truly LIVE! The characters were beautifully put together. I can barely find the words to describe how beautiful this drama really is...! THE OST, lays down the emotions of the scene and ugh makes the film so life changing. The story line!!! Love the twists and turns. The relationships between the characters were excellent. I put this drama as #1 of my favorite dramas ever! (And i have seen many, many good shows!) This tear-yanking show really shows the meaning of life. The most beautiful quotes... i just cant! Please DO watch this! I looked over it because it didnt seem my style but darn! I was wrong. New perspective on life coming out of watching every episode. LOVE LOVE LOVE! ♡

I recommend this to all Kdrama fans if you are just planning to watch this. Please watch it right now the last episode will be airing tomorrow so You can now watched it with no delays I mean by waiting for the next episode to be released. IT IS A MUST WATCH DRAMA OF 2020. Park Seojoon portray the role very well even his hairatyle suits him though. Kim Dami which is Jo Yi Seo in the drama is really amazing a bad ass female lead but when she's inlove We can say she changed a lot. This drama shows injustice that might happening in the society nowadays. Respect for LGBTQ society which is really admire too. Respect (not racist) for those people like Toni in the Drama (a African man who lives in Korea). You can learn also in this drama that even if you are ex-convict expelled in school or had unlucky life it is not the end of the world so I AM TELLING YAH ALL TO WATCH THIS. A WORTH IT DRAMA

This may be unpopular but I can already see from another review that I can't be the only one thinking it. I have watched every drama Park Seo Joon is in and each one was enjoyable/entertaining/well-acted with mostly likeable/tolerable characters. Movies he has done are also great, he's a good actor. Until Itaewon Class.

12 episodes in, the unlikeable characters have become increasingly irritating to watch, especially Yi Seo. Park Seo Joon is the only one holding this drama and even then his character this time is naive and so idealistic it's eye-roll worthy. I find myself rooting for evil Jangga boss and his sons instead, that's how irritating the protagonists are. Too bad, I really want to like this drama because anything with PSJ is usually good.

Not sure if I will even finish watching, at 12 episodes with just 4 more to go I'd probably power through just to conclude and be glad that it ends, unlike other dramas which has left me sad that it ends.

Sadly, this is nowhere near as enjoyable as Crash Landing on You.

I started watching this drama for my great love for food, cooking and Park Seo Joon and I just finished it. I wanted to write a review for a long time but I waited to finish this. IT IS PERFECT. The story is really nice and refreshing, with the right amount of drama and cuteness. Everything makes sense and you won't skip even one thing. The caracters are amazing, with great development, everyone even the side characters has a backstory. They use great with all the seriousness and in the right directions themes like powerful yet sensitive women (Ms. Kang, Grandma, Soo Ah, Yi Seo etc), a black character and a trans character in the main cast. I never saw something like this in any other drama. And the cast was perfect for everyone, with special credit to Park Seo Joon and the ""Jang family"" Yoo Jae Myung, Ahn Bo Hyun, Kim Dong Hee. Also, really good soundtracks with a lot of emotions.
And as an architect, I really couldn't forget the really nice scenery and plans. A lot of Itaewon and you feel like you are there even if you never went.
Overall it is a really nice drama which ends with a comforting feeling. No character is good and bad, make mistakes and underastands the meaning and the concequences of them. Besides, that's how life works.

(I'm sorry for any mistakes. English is not my first language)

The premise is intriguing. It's trying to explore people between humanity and trying to survive facing of prejudice in social class and status in society. It trying to explore about how much human would do in the worst situation in social standing, versus someone who already achieve so much, and has acknowledge high status in social standing. There is both opposite reaction between the way Soo Ah and Sae Ro Yi choose path in other to rise and being accepted and succcessful . And it's intriguing aspect in the narrative that never explore succesfully. It lack great effort to dig deeper and the writers certainly playing safe. Sae Ro Yi, someone who has so many handicap in earlier episode to achieve his goals, suddenly achieve so much and has so many advantage , so is the story, as if refusing to get deeper, and end up less believable. And in the end, they are losing track in the third act. . Some character action and development felt contrived and inconsistent. Well, After this, I really become appreciate a writers who attempt to write a very well written complex character, dare to take a risk in the myth of losing audience. Nice attempt though. I understand of what the writers want to convey, but it's just never reach the potential and feels less belivable in execution, in terms of writing and the direction.

But thankfully, the unconvincing plot get helped by the strong performances from Yoo Jae Myung and Ahn Bo Hyun, who make a really convincing villain, and a reliable acting from the rest of the cast. Or else skip this drama and don't wasting your time,

What I think about this series
Ep 8 is on fire. That complex move that the directors, screenwrighters and producers put in there is so cool. Its like trying to make us think if Yi-Seo is actually joining the other team or not.
Basically I am jungshook at the twist plot, I mean... When Yi-Seo entered the Jangga.Co's building. My heart stopped beating due to the fact she is the main character so she cant betray the male character but my mind has so many doubts. But like is she planning to do something to their business or what because this hold for new episodes to be uploaded is nerve-wracking. But I think she has a trick up her sleeve since she likes Park Sae Ro Yi.

Favourite Part:
When I was spectating the Behind The Scenes of 'Itaweon Class' there was this scene-they were suppose to kiss but they were joking around and making fun of each other. Also when Yi-Seo kiss-blocked Soo-Ah and mentioned the 'Criminal Law Article 32' but then thinking about it she kissed him as well so she basically- I love her.

Ending:
Oh also people ahould stop thinking Yi-Seo is self-centered or selfish but basically thats her character, role. So people shouldnt say that they thinkbis the actress that makes Yi-Seo bad. I am sure enough that those peopld are no better than her. Anyways if u think she is cringy always remember nobody is perfect.

Thanks for reading.

This is not for you if you don't like Jo Yi-seo
I did like the concept of the drama. I was absolutely in love with the story of Saeroyi vs. Jangga. I was completely involved in the story about Saeroyi's path for revenge. And I especially loved Soo-ah! You got to see a lot of character depth in her, and her inner conflicts about what was right and wrong.

Here's the thing though. I do not like Jo Yi-seo in the slightest. Which was such a pity because I love Kim Da Mi! But I did not enjoy her character one bit. She was rude towards everyone. She seemed like the type that would use people as long as they could do something that would benefit her. She was this cool type that everyone adored with her huge social media following.

I think this show appeals to people who strive to be like Yi-seo. A lot of people liked her because she was hardworking and badass. But honestly, she was not a nice person at all. Badass Female Lead doesn't need to mean Mean Female Lead. In the end, she didn't care about anyone except Saeroyi. I don't wanna spoil too much, but she had been largely offensive towards almost ALL of the characters. She willingly belittled most of the characters in the show, just in an attempt to get closer to Saeroyi. Her apologies were so lousy, yet all the characters ended up loving her anyway, which I didn't understand. Anyone I have talked to about this issue, all say that I just don't properly understand her character, but I really cannot see what I am missing. I wanted to like her but, sadly, I just couldn't. And it ruined the show for me.

The show had some good themes, even though I might have found the ending incredibly unsatisfying. I would not rewatch it though. At all. It was the kind of drama that once I was watching it I would enjoy, yet when I wasn't watching it, it would be hard for me to even press play. It took me very long to finish it because I had to force myself to watch it. I honestly wouldn't recommend it, but if you like Yi-seo, this is for you.

Park Seo Joon is known to be one of the greatest actor in S.Korea but in this drama he proves even more. Super galing, dalang-dala ako sa emotions nya, he deserves an acting award in this drama. This drama is about revenge in a good way and tells you to never give up in life instead use your weaknesses to be one of your motivation to become successful. I super love Saeroyi's character. And the team Dambam's teamwork is also very inspiring. Since the start of the drama one of the character that I also loved is Yi Seo, this badass chix never gave up in expressing her love to her boss.
And I am so happy that Saeroyi managed to be successful and found the love of his life.

This show had a lot of hype, and it had the incredible Park Seo Joon. I was expecting to fall in love with this one.

The beginning episodes went through the backstory in too much detail. The middle was definitely the best, although some characters got under my skin (both the FLs and all the villains... aka, way too many cast members!). I sincerely wish the show ended as soon as we established what happened to everyone in 2020. The plot lines after that were so unnecessary and farfetched.

I wish certain people were redeemable. I wish a certain early-story ""boss"" built some sort of loyalty with our protagonist, instead of being tempted by money.

I also did not ever like either of the female leads (okay, maybe I came around when Park Bo Gum showed up). I found Sooah to be too self-serving and took Saeroyi for granted. I wanted to shake Yi-Seo, because I don't think it's a good message to suggest that if you persist with your affections, someday it'll magically work out. I also felt that she had no growth in the story, still only caring about her boss above all.

The OST (especially the Gaho song) was lit though.

Entertaining though the story isn't remarkable or anything special. It's kinda predictable and a bit unrealistic like how the main character randomly falls for the sociopath even though he's never had any feelings for her for all the years that they've been together. Not sure why it has been getting so much raves to be honest. Maybe because the soundtrack is produced by a BTS member and that the lead actors are quite famous. Crash Landing on You is far superior. Though I did enjoy the representation of a trans girl and a black guy in a K-drama.

Had everything but 'class' ...
Ah .. where to begin.

I went into this without even reading a synopsis, dove on into the murky water.

And what murky water it was.

First episode was .. interesting.

I feel the 1st person visual experience of the dad's accident was not needed; made me cry (my own dad died in a car accident).

The villainous son had such an odd look to him - almost like a modern joker in Korean form.

I can't put my finger on it, but his look was just off throughout.

I kind of felt bad for him b/c he was clearly mentally sick due to years of abuse.

Which brings me to the bad dad, the owner of Jaanga (or however you spell it).

He said he started the company so his family would never starve YET he starved his family of the most important thing - love.

He was horrendous to everyone around him, especially his sons.

And do people really get away with slapping others in front of a whole board meeting?

Such odd concepts of abuse scattered about that seem almost over kill (for lack of a better word).

He was a vile creature and the actor portraying him did a great job pulling off the sliminess of the character.

The ML was nothing too special - his feelings were kind of all over the place in the end.

And what was with the romance angle?

His first love choice was just weird; selfish, self centered, and grossly contradicted his core persona.

Then the FL was obnoxious, had horrible hair (distracting throughout), was creepy stalker-ish with ML, completely unprofessional, and her overall role was just ridiculous.

How is a teenager (with no societal status other than social media followers) leading corporate big wigs around, calling the shots?

And then the ""woke"" concepts they tried to fit in this ... *smh*

There were several that could've been left out.

The story was all over the place already and the side issues were flung in there with no rhyme or reason.

There was no chemistry, no romance, very little solid story to go off of, and outlandish business scenarios.

The music was not that great .. intro song grated my nerves.

Eh .. it was a weekend watch that ended up not being very enjoyable.

Just more garbage churned out by Netflix.

An optimistic heartwarming revenge story that's all about the people
Firstly, I have to point out I'm not a big fan of revenge plots and rarely fall in love with them like I did with Itaewon Class which has a more refreshing and modern take on the usual one man VS corporation storyline.

I liked that this time, It wasn't a story of a tragedy but rather a fantastically optimistic telling of a person who got back at those who wronged him by not abandoning himself, his values or his precious people. Our main lead Sae Ro Yi got knocked down hard, at an early age, having lost his father, his dream of becoming a policeman and his freedom. Now following the footsteps of his greatest nemesis, he chooses a new dream, opens a restaurant and with the help of friends he met along the way they work together towards becoming the leading company in the food industry and thus taking his revenge on the current number one's leader.

------storyline gets a 10 from me
***Moving on to the characters/acting:***
1.Park Sae Ro Yi (SRY from now): SRY doesn't get much of a character development throughout the show nor does he necessarily have to. He is pure, inspiring, ambitious, never strays from his believes and protects his people no matter what. The consistency in his character is what makes him a such a great one and what draws people to him. Park Seo Joon never disappoints.
2. Oh Soo Ah (SA from this point): has to be the comment section's favorite character.SA is an orphan who relies only on herself and her ability, never asking or taking help from others, and always thinking and acting according to her best interests. She ends up receiving a scholarship from Jang Ga, the leading corporation in Korea's food industry which is also lead by our main villain and later gets accepted to work there. She is also SRY's first love. All and all she is a very well-written realistic character and the only flaw I find in her is her behavior towards our main lead. Despite also liking him she is always passive, never encourages him and acts as the devil's messenger in times not even by necessity, making me wonder does she really like him at all.
3. Jo Yi Seo: My personal favorite (sadly it seems I'm a minority): YS has some sociopathic tendencies, although never officially diagnosed, is a social media influencer with a large following, an extremely capable person and a genius who looks pretty like an angel but in truth is somewhat of a devil (loosely quoted). She meets our hero, falls in love with him and decides to do everything in her power to help him achieve both his dream and his revenge consequently becoming the new manager of his restaurant.
What I find so refreshing and endearing in her is how she, a 20 year old at the beginning of the show, never doubts her capabilities, bases her dream around a man but never feels apologetic for it or lets it diminish her value as a person. She strives to make him happy and to make him fall in love with her trough her actions as her financial and mental independence allow her to follow through with her decisions. YS's and SA's characters demonstrate that there are many ways to be a strong female, particularly YS who is both a strong female and is hopelessly in love with a man (because somehow dramas have them girls suddenly become all week and dependent on the man, and also a bit of change from the male lead who is always pulling strings for the girl is always a blessing). Now, some of YS's behavior is bit controversial and not to everyone's liking, I say you have to judge for yourselves how you deem her behavior to be as I find there's a big double standard in many of the comments on her.
4. villains: for the villains we have the CEO Jang Dae Hee (JDE) and his son Jang Geun Won (JDW). Honestly both actors did a good job, I pitted JDW and could never completely hate him even when he lost all hope of redemption as he was but a mere result of his father's values: the strong pray on the week and regular people outside of Jang Ga's ranks are livestock (there's a pig and chicken metaphor here but I won't get into it). But the true villain star is You Jae Myung who instead of hate got all my admiration for his acting skills and I secretly wanted to bow to him in admiration of his versatility. He did an amazing job playing a cold, collected, prideful and arrogant CEO who believes he's above everyone else. Also, apparently no makeup makes a scarier villain and those freckles should be added as a skill in his resume for playing bad guys. Overall, the ""evil"" characters weren't over the top and you could understand their reasoning. the only downside goes to JDW character development toward the end, frankly he lacked true conviction for his extreme actions and was kind of meh when he could have been a big source of feels and sobs from the viewers.
The side characters were awesome apart from Jang Geun Soo (the CEO's second son) who wasn't developed properly, and you got to give kudos for the diverse representation of people on the show.
----- charecters and acting get an 8.
***OST***: I have no complains-------it's a 10,I keep listening to it over and over. It fitted perfectly with everything that was going on in the drama and gave me a lot of feels.
***Rewatch value***: 7 because revenge still isn't my pick to relive boredom and yet Iteawon Class was simply too good.
***To sum it all up***, Itaewon Class had The Best Most Satisfying end for a drama I can remember in my almost 11 years of watching almost exclusively Kdramas and had me holding my breath for episodes come Friday and even during the entire week's wait. I don't like to criticize things especially if I enjoyed them so much, so even though it had some problems and sparked a lot of debate, I give it an overall 9 - to be objective , though i hardly am (in my heart it's still a 10).

A soulful class of misfits
""My friends need me. And I`m curious about our future."" ¬ Park Sae-ro-yi

This is one puzzling drama, I must be honest. From the moment I got into Korean dramas, I`ve seen quotes, edits and snippets of this drama scattered all over social media. After some time, I became a huge fan of Park Seo joon as a person and I came to believe that, when saddled with a good script or director(or ideally both), he can do great things. When it comes to this project, I was right. This is, without a doubt in my mind, the best role PSJ has ever taken on.

Giving life to idealistic, yet gravely wronged and revenge-fueled Park Sae-ro-yi was probably the best decision he has made in a while. Regardless of the other aspects of this show, this character will be one many fans will remember, even if you`re not fond of PSJ. I`m sure of it. This drama managed to highlight many, if not all talents he has to offer, proving that he`s not just a `pretty face` many people have been referring to him as for years. But he`s not the only positive about this ambitious program. In fact, the reason why this drama confuses me is due to its ability to overcome its own mediocrity. Let me elaborate.

Like many others before me, I`ve got to agree with the fact that this script is not the best. In fact, it`s not even that good, to be honest. While few shinning moments can be put aside, like Hyun-yi`s competition and clever parallels drawn between Mr. Jang and Sae-ro-yi, for the most part, this script isn`t the inspiring or, for that matter, soulful aspect of this drama. When it comes to direction, whilst adequate, it also wasn`t the main ingredient for this drama`s win with me. No, from my point of view, this dramas was bound to be seen as average or even below it in my eyes, since I`ve seen this plot, this ending, these characters befo-
...
That right there. That was the reason. The characters. The reason why this drama got me addicted enough to finish it in three days. The reason why I didn`t feel the need to take a break between episodes and devote my time to something more fulfilling for a bit. Never did I feel like that with this show. Even when they used predictable tropes to move the story along. Even when they dropped the ball on the last three episodes with our main couple. Even with the way they concluded the grandiose revenge. Through all these warning stops, I still cared about Itaewon Class. Because they achieved unity that was so effortless and charming. From the lovable but clueless Choi Seung-Kwon, brave yet vulnerable Ma Hyun-yi, optimistic yet scarred Kim Toni to, finally, savvy yet ignorant Jo Yi-Seo, this gang of misfits was a joy to watch. And this is why I must call my review a subjective one. Not everyone is going to think like me. In fact, I urge you not to. But when I talk about how chemistry between the actors can and will overcome almost every average script, directing etc. this is what I mean. Even if the characters besides Yi-Seo, Sae-ro-yi and Mr. Jang could`ve been more fleshed out, I loved what we got from them too. And I love the message behind our main couple, maybe more that their clumsy, but happy end. Support. Being there for one another when things get tough. Growing together. These are principles present in the relationship between Yi-Seo and Sae-ro-yi. Even if their actual progression to a romantic connection was indeed, rushed, for me it was believable BECAUSE we spent so much time watching them work hard together, make mistakes and grow. Key word:together. Which is why I would have never been able to buy a serious relationship between Soo-ah(whom I really like as a character, on her own) and Sae-ro-yi. I`ve had similar experiences and it`s not fun nor is it rewarding. I won`t spoil it further, but I would`ve been upset if they had ended up together because they are too fundamentally different to a certain point. One more thing I must mention is how they dared to make the main female lead an ignorant one when it comes to social issues like racism and transphobia, but let her grow in that department too. Never have I ever seen that in a drama.

As for the drawbacks, apart from these I`ve mentioned, I do feel like they could`ve substituted the last two episodes with more development from Toni, Seung-Kwon etc. I would be fine with this drama having 18 episodes, for example, if they were to use them on further development of side characters and the main couple. Another minor problem I had also, and I`m going to nitpick, is how many things were set up conveniently and some decisions that were made were questionable. The OST was good, with the theme song stealing the show for how well incorporated it came off. It was worthy of ITAEWON CLASS.

Finally, while this show had its fair share of problems, it was still fun, comforting and never boring, even when it was biting more than it could chew. A recommendation well-earned.

Story is just amazing
Fast paced and well scripted story immediately grabs the audience in the first episode.and its the same with this drama itaewon cass. Seeing him in school actually made me confuse for a bit but as the story progress and he becomes a convict I got totally excited that whats going to happen next. And with each episode this enthusiasm kept on increasing. The transgender and racism character also gave me a reason to watch the show as it was quite refreshing.
I liked that the story has less romance and more focused on the storytelling. Its hard to see dramas like this.

Park seo joon was as usual awesome. He just melted in the role of park sae ro yi. Kim Da Mi as Yi so was tough yet soothing character. It was her first drama and I really liked her.am gonna check out her other works.

Startover ost was has made its way into my playlist. Its usage in the BGM was perfect.
Rewatch after some time when the meomry fades away.

I've watched this one thousand times
Just after i finished this one i had a whole week with no sleep. It got me thinking about how life goes and what am i doing with my life. The way Saeroyi just exists is amazing, the way he thinks and make thing for his people is really touching. It made me feel hope on humanity again (just lasted few weeks but did something). Idk, i found Itaewon Class so touching that i just loved it. My english is not the best, sorry about that. The acting was on point. The music was really good, I still listen to the ost's.

Good plot, romance and FL r weird
I felt like I had way higher expectations of this drama that what it actually is... so this is not a typical story and it has its sad background but overall it's all about hope persistence and hard work and they show that really well

My only problem with this was mostly the FL, the actress is really good but the character was so unreasonable violent and ill-mannered and while she gets better as her development she was still really annoying (to me)

Another thing is the romance... when pairing a couple with an age gap usually they show how the younger one is responsible and the older one isn't mentally old but here it wasn't like that and it was kinda hard for me to like them and it got to a point where I didn't want to see any romance at all (coming from a rom com obsessed teenage girl) hence my low rating

I think the actors did a pretty good job, at first I was exited about but around ep 8 I dropped it bc I didn’t think it was that interesting but a few weeks later when it was finished I picked it up again but I only watched the ep with soo-ah bc the rest was a bit boring in my opinion. But I did like the last ep and how it turned out surprised me. I personally think the way he wanted revenge is not really like in reality. And I don’t get if soo-ah had a car why she took the bus most of the time I know it’s kinda stupid question but yeah?

I enjoyed Itaewon Class. It was not your typical K-drama focused on triangle romance, rich vs. poor and good vs. evil. Of course, it had all of those elements but the real story behind Itaewon Class is about a downtrodden good guy with a quest for revenge upon the powerful family that did him dirty. I f*** with this concept so I definitely enjoyed watching our ""good guy hero,"" get his revenge. Does he ultimately get there? Well, you will have to watch 16 very long episodes to find out. Itaewon Class also progressively took on racism and transgender acceptance which I appreciated for being bold but felt like it was glossed over. Itaewon Class really missed a good opportunity to take the story to the next level.

The 16 episodes were an easy binge. They were long but they were entertaining enough to motor forward. The ending started to drag... A LOT. There were way too many flashbacks, repetitive conversations between characters, and dramatic slow mo editing, especially towards the end of the show. This drama could have done without all of that. I felt producers should have devoted precious minutes instead to all of those missed opportunities that I mentioned earlier.

Overall, I did find Itaewon Class to be a really interesting story. The main characters were easy to root for, the main villains were easy to despise. It did wear a bit on my nerves at how conveniently characters happen to be at the right place, at the right time. Main character goes jogging around the city, happens to conveniently run into female lead. Female lead flies off of motorcycle, conveniently happens to land on male lead. You catch my drift? Major eye-rolling ahead, people.

Anyway, I do recommend this drama. What else are you all doing anyway during this pandemic?

Was Good At First...
I liked this drama at first and it was good enough to make me watch it all the way through. But it went downhill in the last few episodes. Most of the characters are annoying. (Not the actors/actresses. They did a good job portraying such unlikable characters.) The ending seemed so forced and rushed. No, it’s not the worst drama ever but it’s definitely not the top of anything. I guess it’s like when they make a movie based on books but in this case it’s a webtoon, What I’m saying is, I think the webtoon is probably better. I should read it and see for myself.

(I have nothing else to say but I need 500 characters...)

The ratings were high and first few episodes were awesome. I had great expectations after i started but highly disappointed afterwards.

Story:
The story was very good during the first half which is where most of the positive points come from. The friendships, trust, protecting people, learning from each other, growth - things were perfect in the beginning. The characters, cast, momentum - everything was going great but it went completely downhill from there. The show had a lot of potential but lost its way in the middle. My favorite character used to be Geun Soo. His character had so much potential to grow and contribute. I didn't understand why writers forced him to turn bad. His character wasn't like that. He was originally sweet, caring, compassionate and forgiving. Unfortunately, in the middle, writers took the track in a totally different direction. I didn't like how Saroyi and Yeo So totally ignored his feelings when taking revenge or even in the end towards the finale. Yeo So became very annoying. I loved her character but there weren't real learnings for her. She did good things just for her boss and never was shown actually learning her lessons. Remained inconsiderate till the end especially to Geun Soo. Geun Soo deserved much more. Didn't like the 7 year and 4 year leaps too. The growth of the company was much easier than expected. Expected more challenges there. Ending was horrible. Saroyi and Yeun So had no chemistry. I would have preferred Saroyi with none of the woman. Janggak Co was number 1. Could the chef really beat them so easily in the competition! Many things like that put me off.

Acting/Cast:
Cast did a good job in terms of acting. Yeun So gave a powerful performance as well.

Music:
Music was good.

Rewatch value:
I don't think I would rewatch it because by the end of it, I got really frustrated and wanted it to just end. First few episodes are wonderful.

12 episodes should have been good enough.

7.5 chestnuts?
It’s been a very long time where I can say that I was able to watch a number of episodes non-stop.
I did put this drama on hold for a while, I wasn’t even going to consider it. I have to admit I completely judged it without even giving it a shot, I didn’t know what to expect when I started it and my little theories were very much proven wrong (For some reason I assumed it would be a martial arts drama, idk I saw ‘class’ in the title and I went with that). This drama is way different from what I thought it to be.
Although some elements were very predictable, I truly enjoyed the concept of this drama. It’s different and a change from the dramas that mainly focus on the romance and I liked that. It’s nice when you’re rooting for other things besides the romance.
About the predictability though, I cannot stress enough how many times I screamed at the screen “I’m disappointed but not surprised!”
I truly liked every character but I will have to say not one failed to not frustrate me. You will find yourself being frustrated by each character in this drama.
I have to also mention the time skips in this! I felt like I went through a time machine. I can see why they were used for the plot to an extent. But I feel like we could have got more glimpses of what happened during them. QUESTION, HOW IS HIS HAIR STILL THE SAME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?!!!!
Overall, would I watch this drama again? Did I enjoy it all throughout? And would I recommend it?
I wouldn’t necessarily watch it again and that’s because personally I have to be in the right mood to watch angst-filled dramas kinda like this. I mostly go for light-hearted and fluffy dramas so this wouldn’t really normally be on my radar but I can still say that I enjoyed it and I’m glad I watched it. However, to answer the second question, I didn’t enjoy it all throughout, I kind of feel like the ending was dragging for it to be you know - predictable. That being said, I would still recommend it to anyone, it’s a good drama and a lot of life lessons that could be picked up. Park Seo Jun really did great with his role!

First of all, I really think that the most popular review of Itaewon Class on MDL, written by user manicmuse, sums up pretty much everything about the show rather perfectly. I have always been lazy to write a lot, especially when someone else has already said almost everything I wanted to say. With that in mind, I'll try to spare as little effort as possible on this.

I'll start with saying that I'm no Kdrama expert. If anything, I'm a total newbie. That is to say that, I've no means nor any intention to compare the show or the actors to anything else. Now coming to the point, I did think of Itaewon Class as rather interesting in the start. But it went on to become unstable from interesting and then nonsense from unstable. While the first 4 episodes of the show builds upon the premise to give you hope, the final 4 epsiodes just ruins pretty much all of your expectations. I know it's called drama for a reason, but you expect it to satisfy the least of your expectations. On the contrary Itaewon Class managed to do practically everything I dislike towards the end. I actually do think that it's quite incredible in itself, not gonna lie. A story that could've become a lot with better handling and a romance that doesn't make much sense is self explanatory for everything the show did.

All that said, I actually do expect most people to like this, as I know my tastes are quite weird in itself and that the very thing that drives me to dislike this is what people usually love to see. But if I meet someone with my tastes and have to recommend it based on a scale of 1-10, I'll give it a 0, not because the show is particularly bad, but because I don't want someone else to feel the disappointment I felt. Just know that it's not everyone's cup of tea and watch without any expectations in particular, and that'll help you either really like it or at the very least not be disappointed.

Cho Yi-seo queen
Ep. 8 left me in a limbo. It'd be stupid to believe Yi-seo would betray Sae-royi, but I'm afraid that whatever she's planning will be misunderdtood -if it's not planned with Sae-royi.

This drama is so perfectly made that I have 0 complaints about it. Yi-seo is mean, selfish and goal-oriented no matter what, which makes me love her since her first appearance. But what I love the most about her is that there is so much room for improvement to her character and that's what I'm looking forward to the most. I don't really know how I feel about Soo-ah yet, but I definitely don't like her as much as Yi-seo. She's a strong woman who lets nothing stand on her way too, which I love, but I'm not entirely sure about her stand yet. Also, the fact that Yi-seo and Sae-royi are complete opposites makes their dynamic so much more interesting.

On the other side, I hope we can see some character development on Sae-royi as well. We see him as the perfect man: emotional, but cold-headed enough so he plans everything out; goal-oriented, but also incredibly empathic and people-centered, so he can manage a group to reach the goal. He is perfectly balanced and has been planning his strike back at Jangga for the next 15 years and can overcome every obstacle that gets on his way without losing focus or his values. He is way too ideal, even has the perfect amount of emotional character. There MUST be something to improve on him.

Of course we've seen him grow from a hot-headed teenager who was about to kill his father's killer with his own two hands, into a man with a perfectly-planned goal for his future; not to mention that he was an asocial boy with troubles to make friends, but who now is the owner of a pub in which his main focus is to reach his goals alongside his workers who he thinks of as friends.

There has definitely been some development in his character from teenager to adult, but I'd also like to see some improvement during his adulthood, but I just can't think of what could that be because he comes off too perfect.

Anyway, I'd still need to wait until the end of the week to see what on earth is Yi-seo planning after meeting Mr. Jang. It had been a long time since a drama made me this excited while waiting for the next episode.

I had high expectations bec of the hype for this drama, but i personally think it's just one of those predictable kdrama, nothing special. I didn't even feel the chemistry between Saeroyi and Yiseo, they build Saeroyi and Sooah's story way too strong in first 2 episode. Then Yiseo came and i thought they'd have a good chemistry based on what i read in other reviews so i still give it a shot, but i don't really feel it, they would be better for a brother sister relastionship. I also thought Yiseo's character would be a cool sociopath based on the first episodes but Yiseo's character became too childish and annoying. Not just that, some situation are too predictable and some are too much and not realistic. I think it would be better if Saeroyi didn't end up with any of the two female lead and just have an open ending for the romance. Park Seo Joon and other casts' acting is good tho. That's it.

Disappointing and wasted potential
This drama started really, REALLY well. It was deserving of all the initial hype. The editing, cinematography, and plot coupled with great scoring were unprecedented. However, everything got thrown away at around ep 12. The writing became too sloppy that the characters seemed liked hypocrites. So much for character development huh. Plus the last 2 episodes? What was that even? It’s like the writer didn’t know how to end things well, so he used his webtoon experience and just whisked whatever plot twists he had in mind, capitalizing on what most fans wanted to see. That in the process it lost coherence, logic, and brilliance. Acting-wise, the actors were stellar. But everything else about this drama was just plain disappointment, especially the romance. It was almost disgusting and seemingly a mere afterthought.

I wanted to appease myself with the fact that it’s the first drama of the screenwriter anyway, but no, he just created a very big damage to the story that it’s beyond forgivable.

I would not recommend this to friends without a big warning. Watch at your own risk.

Itaewon class is definitely not a rom-com if that's what you're coming here to watch. I'd be honest and say that I was disappointed too, but it has opened me up to a new type of drama that I really enjoy. It's one of the most eye-opening dramas that I've watched and really makes you think about your own life.

I've read my fair share of reviews and many have mentioned the lack of depth in character, romance, or storyline. Park Saeroyi's character is very unique. He's persistent in what he wants and he cares a lot about those around him. Some people have mentioned that he lost his character once he kneeled in front of the old man for a woman but he knew what he was doing. He had no choice or else one of the closest people around him would die. Knowing his character, he would've done it for any of his friends.

Many reviews have said the romance wasn't well developed. While I agree that's semi-true, the reason why he's been rejecting Yi-Seo over and over again is that Geun-Soo was always after her and he didn't want to betray him. He was also very focused on his revenge for his dad so his life did not revolve around his love story. And he had a clingy Soo-Ah to deal with. He kinda lost track of who he had feelings for before he did realize he was in love with Yi-Seo.

There are some places where I think the storyline could be better. It did feel a little rushed towards the end and some scenes gave me a question mark. For the most part, it was a good story and I feel like PSRY's life has given people a new perspective in life. I especially loved that the story featured a lot of minorities: strong female leaders, LGBTQ+, PoC (other than Koreans), ex-convicts. It gave a fresh feeling to the drama.

I'd say go for this drama if you don't want the typical sappy rom-com. The acting is superb from all the characters, especially PSRY, Yi-Seo, and the old man. This drama is different from the norm and I'm all here for it.

actually problematic
i got hooked on the first few episodes and then it came to a point when the plot was DRAGGING. it became an old good for nothing rich man vs. young good for nothing poor man. it tried so hard to justify both parties' actions and why you should hate evil old man and root for good young man to the point it became pretentious for me. only the acting was what pushed me to keep watching. its good they addressed issues like racism and transphobia, but it felt like they were just there, just so (but im not one to comment about it because im not a black poc and im not trans).

but WHAT BOTHERS ME MOST!!!! is

that part of 10-years-younger yiseo kissing DRUNK AND PASSED OUT 10-years-older saeroyi???? HUH this must be some male fantasy. and then later on...we see yiseo stopping drunk sooah from kissing saeroyi and then blabbing laws about harassment?????? HUH? WHAT ? WHY ???? the only explanation is that it's written and directed by men. up until this day, men cant write actual strong female characters without making them act tough or cold. they really tried to prove a point that a huge gap isnt predatory because the younger girl was the one who pursued the older man... and they painted yiseo as some highly-competitive woman who refuses to lose, to hide that fact.

even if healthy huge age gap relationships do exist, this was simply not a good one to show it as it believes it did. lol.

First of all I decided to write this review because I read the other reviews and comments and saw too many negative opinions. So I want to write a good one for all of us who enjoyed it a lot. (Would want to point out tho if we even watched the same drama because the drama I watched was good LOL).

Points:
- People say that they couldn’t take Yi Seo. I get it, at some point of the drama I hated her (maybe for two episodes) when she got really mean with Geun Soo and Soo Ah about the building thing but the thing is, did the writers give her a free way with this? NO. Saeroyi got mad with her. But the thing is, if she didn’t bitch about the building thing, do you think Saeroyi would have decided to buy one? She made him realize that at that moment they needed a REALISTIC alternative. Yi Seo’s role here was set right from the start if not from the start, you guys should have seen it the moment she cut off the would-be kiss of Soo Ah and Saeroyi with her hand over Soo Ah’s mouth. She is a crazy character. And if it’s only me I like her. For once a refreshing main female character.
- People say that the romance between Yi Seo and Saeroyi is weird. I don’t think so. If you actually watch kdrama a lot, most of the earlier scenes point out that Yi Seo will end up with Saeroyi ( I really don’t know why some think otherwise). And if not Yi Seo would you like Soo Ah? Yi Seo even pointed out the obvious when they met at the cafe four years later that Soo Ah was only for herself, even Soo Ah realized it and knew what she lost because of hesitating too much when Saeroyi was so determined to save Yi Seo.
- Jang Geun Soo turnover haha. Tbh his characters is one of the pitiful ones. Some say it’s weird that he suddenly became a villain but I don’t know about you but I called it that moment Yi Seo said “If you really decided you want me, take over Jangga.” I knew at some point that he will go to Jangga. If you look at his last conversation with Saeroyi at the rooftop when he resigned, he said that Saeroyi is really amazing. And that he would want to change to and try to achieve his goals like Saeroyi. His goal was Yi Seo. But the thing is HE WAS A KID. At the ending scene after the IC Co. took over Jangga And Saeroyi was talking with Geun Soo, Saeroyi literally called him a kid. Not sure about the real reason why but I assumed that it means “It’s not your fault, the adults around you didn’t really show you a good example so you haven’t grown up yet.” Maybe who knows. But it was obvious that he was going to turn against them.
- Park Saeroyi kneeling down. That scene was phenomenal! I didn’t think that PSJ’s back was so powerful hahaha. He was kneeling down to show some kind of “surrender/deafeat” but he was dominating that shot! I couldn’t take my eyes off of him. And it was not much of defeat but out of pity. Saeroyi realized that the old man was actually ridiculous to the point that he was not worth it at all. At first Saeroyi saw him as a powerful man and wanted to reach for what he did but he realized at that moment that the old man was nothing but “trash”. He couldn’t believe he wanted to go after a trash and so kneeling down became nothing. Did you see Jang Dae Hee’s face when Saeroyi explained that to him? When I saw his face “SATISFACTION!” hahahaha.
- Romantic change at the end. Tbh Saeroyi didn’t have anything to live for anymore. Nothing that would make him happy, hence his scene with his dad by the bridge. He keeps remembering Yi Seo who put her life on the line for him and he decided that I want to live for that person too because I love her. And it’s not weird that he only realized it at the end. Remember he’s a 34 years old guy who didn’t have his first kiss yet. And he was used to the thought that “I like Soo Ah” that he didn’t realize he actually loves Yi Seo. It was pretty well written for me.

But then again, this might just be me. Still It was a great drama! It slowed down in the middle a bit but it’s fine because Park Seo Joon hahahah.

btw this review will be basically me talking about the ending because i have A LOT to say!
so don't read anything if you haven't watched ep 16 yet.

story and acting was really good, i liked most of the characters, evil characters were portrayed really well.. i also liked how human many of these were (like Sooah and Geunsoo), showing us that good characters can have flaws as well and learn from their past mistakes. i was very fond of Saeroyi's character, definitely one of the few main male characters i actually like lol.
however, i have to say that i didn't like Yiseo much :/ i found her to be really petty, which is okay if you think about that because she's a sociopath and of course she's not going to be flawless, but still her attitude most of the times didn't sit well with me :| and i'm happy that they ended up together, they look very cute, but i disliked how she treated everyone real badly EXCEPT him just because she was in love. i think i'd have given this drama a 10/10 if Saeroyi's didn't end up dating anyone, because the romance of the drama wasn't the main topic, you know. i think i kinda ship him with Sooah tho. like I know she did bad things but in the last two episodes, she really redeemed herself. but anyways, im happy that she respected and supported Sry's relationship with Yiseo. she deserved to go on her own path and open her own restaurant! im so proud of her character development.
the friendship of the Danbam staff was really cute, i like how theyre there for each other. we definitely need to see more dramas like these, without the stupid work hierarchies existent in korean society (and other societies as well ofc). also, i appreciate how this drama touched on taboo topics, like foreigners and lgbt. very different from what i've been watching these years!

definitely recommending this to my friends :)

You may call me biased because Im a huge Park Seo Joon fan. But this show is something else! Not your regular, same old romantic comedy with shallow stories.
This drama tackles about life. The hardships people suffer, injustice in the criminal system, power of the rich vs the poor/weak, standing up to what is right and being true to yourself, different outcasts in society, gender/racial issues, struggles we face and how we try to survive and even succeed in life.
After finishing all 16episodes, i experienced a real whirlwind of emotions! Anger at the antagonists and how they made Park Sae Royi suffer. But the same time, I was amazed at how amazing of a person Sae Royi was, how strong he was and how he handles every hardship. I was also amazed by Yiseo, she was cool, extemely smart, talented and strong. Her portrayal of the role was spot on. I loved her character because she wasnt too girly at all.

All in all, everyone's acting was amazing. The story is really nice and teaches us about not giving up on our dreams until we reach it, it teaches us to stand up for our beliefs and principles, and teaches us not to be a pushover.

Honestly i was about to do harsh review while watching the first half of the final ep but somehow i enjoy the last parts. but thinking about it that what i feel while watching this show i love it but hate it sometimes. and i have a love hate feeling to all the mean characters through out the show and that was nice.

The story start good even tho i'm not fan of revenge dramas it was interesting, i loved Saeroyi unique character, that boy that have strong views of life and some how Lack social communication skills in good way. and let's say that the drama strong point was the unique characters not the story it self, that's why when the time come for the story to move on and Saeroyi grow his job they half ass jumping it felt unrealistic easy. and same thing in growing the characters. so i enjoy the drama tell ep 11 then it fall down with fast jump and force push for the love line and the boring long scenes even in the final ep, but i got satisfied just seeing everyone happy in the end so i give them a pass for that.

so if you going to start it don't thing so much in the revenge but the characters you will enjoy them but they will annoy the hell out of you too.

Acting was so good
i'm not fan of PSJ that's why i wasn't planing to watch this show in the start but i fall to him her he completely suit the character.

Yoo Jae Myung as Jang Dae Hee was amazing AMAZING what a great skills to hit me with the right feel.

Kim Da Mi as Jo Yi Seo : let's be real if any one play yiseo instead of DaMi it would get ton of hate ( it get ton but it would have another ton) the character is annoying and childish but she act it so well make it a bit cute and i'm sure a lot fall for the actor more than the character. Honestly i hate her till ep8 just think the actor cute then i start to love her after what she did for Saeroyi

Nara as Oh Soo Ah : same as Dami, her acting give a lot to the character to make me understand it. people who born alone in world learn to live alone and strong only for them selves.

osts was super good especially kim feel and Gaho osts.




spoiler coming so this part for people who watch already ::

in the start i enjoy the unique character and i have big hope for a character development but other than yiseo calming down a little there are non. and i thought the love line will go way better but..

for me it was a good drama until the ending of ep11 that rejection scene, then it's like another writer take over the drama like hell what someone who can't cook 2ep ago is wining competition against all big restaurant and the big lol a rich grandma in the street and yeah fast forward IC are 2 in the country. god if you plan to be ridiculous why give us a hope in strong Saeroyi and smart yiseo journey. and what with the wigs *sigh*
then the forced change in love line like the saeroyi who was in love with Sooah for 10 years i can accept that he lose interest in some point but the sudden falling in yiseo like ""ah it was all her"" was so off and forced and then push that by stupid kidnapping so we believe that love, ep 14/15 and half 16 was just ridiculous and boring. they could use that time to show him falling in love.
but i love that very last part when everyone become happy even tho i wasn't convinced by Saeyori ( and the kiss was bad) i loved how happy yiseo she deserve to be happy she worked hard haha. also the scene that get me so emotional was when she apologized to Geun Soo for using him. and SooAh bogum girl won. haha.

as i said before the unique characters was the best thing in the drama yet it annoy the hell out of me Honestly i hate yiseo till ep8 so childish and annoying and that type that get what i want no matter what and Run over and take advantage of other feelings so i hate that people hype her as badass while she is so bad the say she better than sooah but she just as bad lol the only different she work to get the man she want. i just love her bc she is cute and all lol but no don't hype that act young people me love to act like that lol. and what if she don't get the man girl leave everything to build him.
i also don't like the random gather of every type who have social problems like transgender, gay , black korean, gangster like yeah good to talk about accepting others but it feel forced by putting them all.

so yeah some are hyping it so much it was just good.

This drama is different from what people usually watch. It tackles about business, corruption, life of an ex-convict, etc. If you want something about hardwork, revenge, business, and food, this drama is for you! Don't hesitate to watch it because of PSJ's hair haha. You'll learn to appreciate it. Da Mi's character is also different from the usual female leads. She is very straightforward and has a very strong personality. The acting of the villains is also superb! Chairman Jang was amazing all throughout. He'll really get you pissed, and irritated but you'll also pity him. The father-son relationship was also heartwarming. You'll see the difference on how the fathers teach their sons. This drama is a very good watch!

Uplifting!
I was holding out on this drama but I finally caved and watched it and I quite enjoyed it! PSJ was perfect for this role! Not a lot of people like the ML girl but she portrayed her character really well! The plot is nothing spectacular but I liked how it talked about different issues that are happening in society right now ( racism, transgender etc) There are a lot of life lessons you can learn from this drama that I find uplifting to watch! Towards the end it did get a little draggy but overall it was a good watch!

This drama was quite emotional from the start. Story seemed really interesting and i thoroughly enjoyed watching the starting episodes but then it lost taste. Things seemed scattered. Nothing seemed to be on point but felt like the story is being dragged.
What was the fault of oh so aah? saeroyi gave her hope for 15 years and then what happened? His heart changed. Yi seo was the most heartless and inconsiderate person. Nothing good came from her mouth. Her personality was so annoying. She destroyed the life of guen-soo and wasn't even ashamed for it. Now the revenge part. I couldn't see any revenge by saeroyi. Everything kept repeating. He knelt before jang dae hee, he was again a victim of hit and run, he was powerless at the end. So Aah did everything and eventually it benefited saeroyi.
I felt bad for oh so aah all the time and was disgusted by the personality of yi seo. The story could have been better. The revenge could have been better. Guen-soo's character could be better.
Acting of park seo joon was way too good. His acting was mindblowing and i cried with him in the first two episodes.
I hope others think like that too.

Itaewon Class was a breath of fresh air in that it takes familiar themes that we know well such as revenge and childhood affection and develops them in unique and unexpected ways. The cast is colorful and interesting and the leads are well acted and unlike your typical drama heroes. It doesn't lose steam until the end and there's plenty of jokes and exciting moments to go around. The OST only adds to the whole experience. The first few episodes are very much a setup and I didn't feel like it'll keep me interested but I realized I was slowly getting attached to the characters and it eventually became one of my favorite dramas ever.

Characters
I don't care whether others like this drama or not but i totally hooked up to this drama. I think it's because of the character design.

Park seo joon: Male lead follows his values and principles , park seo joon did wonderful job

Kim da mi: As for female lead kim da mi, she's mind blowing and excellent. her character is very unique she'll do anything for sae ro yi. The way she warns others and being honest about her feelings most importantly she is a psycho I loved that I'm actually watching this show because of her only. I'm actually disappointed because Kwon nara is not the first female lead but after watching kim da mi I totally feel for her and her acting.

Kwon nara: first thing she's pretty. She involved in her character. The way she struggles between male lead and her company is potrayed perfectly she done a good job

Lee joo young: she's beautiful, her acting was good her character is also unique she's a transgender especially her voice I loved it. I loved her acting mainly in episode 12 Ending.

And every character has its back story and unique characterization. It's worth watching

Absurdity at its finest. Free falling after a good start.
If I had a dollar for every time I thought to myself how the show started interesting but got progressively stupid, I’d be on a Hawaiian vacation. I’m beginning to wonder why I keep watching K-dramas at this point. So many shows have similar unrealistic storylines that I’m coming to a conclusion that writers have to steer their stories to ultra absurd territory to satisfy the fans. It’s maddening because the writers have to take everything so far that it’s hard to go along with the characters’ choices. Toward the end, you’re just staring at the screen in a mixed state of unbelief, frustration, anger and amazement. Obviously, different shows fall differently in the spectrum of ridiculousness and some are better than others. Itaewon Class is definitely near the top of “What the hell just happened and/or why is this happening?” spectrum.

Good stuff
- Revenge plot. The premise was good and refreshing.
- All sorts of colorful characters. Some felt tacked on and unnecessary like Toni and his grandma but they were interesting.
- I like the message of perseverance and second chances.

Bad stuff
- Main bad guy, Jang, is so evil it’s almost comical. So they want you to believe he’s an evil businessman who’s willing to do anything for his company. But it’s done so terribly, it’s not even believable. Anytime he or his messed up son does anything wrong, he asks the victim to kneel and apologize. Every freaking time. As if it’s his MO. What?
- People that work for Jang. He is basically a criminal and people in his company know it but they still work for him. Like for years! They tried to make it sound like Su-ah was plotting her own coup but it was too late and done sloppy.
- Multiple time-skips didn’t work at all. Only things that change after time skip were people’s clothes and hairstyles, except Saeroyi. You wonder what the hell they’ve been doing for the last whatever years because there’s no character development at all. Exact same people as if there was no personal growth during the time skip.
- Transgender cook couldn’t even make simple pub dishes and almost got fired. Then within a few weeks or so, we are told to believe that trained chefs are no match for her and she wins the competition???????????
- Personally, these K-dramas are not doing Korea any favor by portraying it as a country full of violent drunk people who get into fist fights all the time. The main bad guy assaults his own son in front of his employees like it’s nothing. Why are they so proudly exporting this crap?
- Forced love story was awakened. I liked Yi-seo but she’s more of a psycho little sister material than a lover material. Saeroyi knew this and kept things that way until the end when the writer forced him to see flashbacks and “realized” he loved her. Major cringe.
- Geun Soo turns crazy evil like his dad just so he can have Yi-seo. The change is so jarring and unbelievable. It’s like Anakin Skywalker killing little Jedis all of a sudden. Another example of storyline being pulled out of thin air.
- the kidnapping plot line at the end. Just please stop. Why do they take things so far?? End the show if you have no more storyline.
- Searoyi wakes up from a head injury and gets into a car collision and then gets into a fistfight and gets hit in the face multiple times but wins the fight at the end. Is the writer delusional or are we stupid for watching this nonsense?
- At the end, my wife and I just couldn’t wait for it to end.

If you like stories about revenge or underdogs coming up then this drama is for you. The romance could’ve been executed better but this story was solely about avenging the past so you rom-com lovers might not be so interested in this because of that. But if you want a break from the typical dramas then I recommend this one.

THE PLOT seemed a bit basic when reading up on it but I was intrigued to see how the life of an ex-con would be portrayed and lemme tell you they got the struggle life DOWN. And the different themes explored in this drama are what urged me to watch in the first place. There were a few sensitive topics that were addressed such as racism and gender equality, which were all executed very nicely into the story. I just wish they went below the surface a little more but with the way South-Korean dramas are, I’m glad they included issues like this to begin with. I think such sensitive topics should be brought up in dramas more often so people can be more educated and intelligent discussions can start.

THE MAIN CAST was interesting. Except for the villian and his father. Might be the worst antagonists I've seen in a drama. I was impressed with the diversity with the cast as well as the extras. This drama makes me wanna visit Itaewon lol. PSJ was solid in this. I didn’t like him in What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim and much prefer his role in this. You get to see a bit more of a range from him in this drama’s setting. His character was dedicated to avenging his father’s death but it never consumed him. There is a way to want justice without becoming obsessed with revenge and throughout his suffering, he never forgot his father’s teachings or the people who helped him along the way. Yi-seo was interesting but very contradicting at times. Hyun-yi was a tasteful portrayal of a transgender man and was one of my favorite characters. Toni had a lot of potential but was surface level in the end. I liked Soo-ah more than Yi-seo but you never really knew where her loyalties lay. Geun-soo’s backstory was good but he didn’t really do much throughout the series. His storyline could have been better executed. Geun-won was annoying and practically useless and was only present to help drive the plot forward.

THE MUSIC was good but nothing special

OVERALL I give this a 8/10. Probably wont rewatch again

After receiving recommendations on MDL and Netflix, I finally decided to watch this series. Truth be told, I was a bit apprehensive as it did not look anything like my usual picks. That was my energy before watching this series... it was the complete opposite after I watched. I really wished I was not so stubborn and decided to see it sooner.
Itaewon Class is a progressive K Drama that feels different, and tackles tenuous matters that many other dramas avoid. Solely on that basis, this series deserves commendation for daring to do so. For being brave and bold enough to put out art that can encourage the important conversations.
I became invested from Episode 1, which was easily my favourite episode. The cinematography was beautiful and the groundwork for an intriguing story was laid. However, I do think the scene where Park Saeyori beats up Jang Geun-won at the hospital to be slightly dramatic and a bit drawn out. While I understand it is an emotionally-charged moment discovering that Geun-won was responsible . I think it could have been better done. Still this may be my all time favourite episode of a K Drama. It is really poignant and captivating, with some really great moments.
The story progressed really great in the early episodes, in my opinion. The characters were very interesting and layered especially Oh So ah, Yiseo and Geun-soo.
I am Afro Caribbean and was eager when Kim Toni appeared on my screen. It is impressive that he has learnt the Korean language but his acting honestly still needs some work. What he can do extremely well is sing. Everyone should check him out singing Start with Gaho on Youtube. It is incredible to listen their version! Besides the songs Start, Still Fighting, Maybe and Sweet Night the OST did not really stir me.

Some of the Life Lessons Interwoven in IC:

All Unfair Games Will Play Over
Injustices and evils committed against others do not simply disappear, they return in this karmic cycle called life. I longed to see Saeroyi get his revenge against Jang Dae-hee.

Just Keep Going
Even in the face of life's curveballs and surprises keep pushing forward. Saeyori's journey took him from the prison to the boardroom.

The Tables Can Turn
Jang Dae-hee was oncce highly revered as the owner of an extremely successful food company. Years later, the company is in limbo and being investigated for various crimes.

Power Is People
I think this perspective that Saeyori adopted is a nugget of wisdom that is often easily forgotten. The relationships that we forge with one another is our true richness and power. Also don't be afraid to connect with persons who may seem different from you like he did with Hyun-yi.

Now about the love story. I really wished he ended up with Oh So ah in the ending. But Yiseo was really a ride or die chick. Honestly, the last two episodes were not the best. Still I think this is a drama worthy of your attention. The lessons in it are paramount.

IC IS STILL SWEET!

What a drama man. First time watched the weekly drama & totally loved it.
Itaewon class plot line is revenge, but there is much more to it. It breaks the stereotypes of Korean dramas & Korean culture as its shows about
-Transgender
-African (u can see one in the pic)
-Bar rules

Also, take a bow Park Seo Joon for doing such a fantastic acting. Have seen him in shewaspretty and whatswrongwithsecretarykim but in this he just nailed it.

KimDani was badass and I loved her style.
Would love to see more of her dramas

Thanks for reading,

Great and Good
To be honest, I watched this when i was first starting to get into K-dramas and I loved the story, cast, acting, and ost. The entire story behind Itaewon class is honestly incredibly inspirational as it taught me a lot of life lessons that a lot of people are not willing to teach me in real life. The reason that I titled this great and good is that I couldn't help but feel that their were some points to the story that were lacking. To avoid spoilers I wont go into specifics. However, the first 10 episodes were just chefs kiss and so satisfying to watch as the plot unfolded. However, after the time skip I felt that there were some inconsistencies with the plot. Nothing to do with the actors just bad writing as I guess my expectations were incredibly high because of the amazing first 10 episodes. Only to be slightly disappointed with an adequate but not quiet right end.
Now onto the specifics

Great
First, Actors amazing all around as even though the characters varied and there were so many different emotions showed from dense, psychopaths', sociopaths, butterfly (transformations), and dirt on the bottom of my shoe(people who have watched this know which characters I'm talking about :D) A lot of people often say that the hype behind this show was because of Park Seo Joon. However, I can't really say that because I was new to K-dramas at the time and didn't know anything about him. So I can say this as a neutral and uninfluenced party I loved this shows acting. The actors were all talented and there was incredible chemistry between the two main leads even in their darkest of time

Second, as someone looking to work in the film industry I found the behind the scenes work to be soooooooo satisfying to watch. The actions shots, profiles, angles, and even some discreet pigeon shots (distorted) were all included. So If you are worried about the shots and camera quality, there's no need to because It was Immaculate.

OST- Great, don't know much about music production so I can' get into the details

Inclusivity: I just had to put this in as a black member of the LGBTQ+ community (Biromantic). There inclusion of a black and a trans character in the main cast is something honestly unprecedented in Korea which I will always always always be grateful for. To be honest, the black character did indeed have a meaning to the plot but I feel like he needed more screen time. However, just the fact that he was in the main cast PERIOD will always have a special place in my heart.
The last scene was so satisfying toooo :)
Now onto the Good
I say good because it was just ok, nothing special

Story and script: The writers did a phenomenal job on the script and storyline in the first 10 episodes and I will always consider it to be some of the best intros that I have ever seen in my life. Just the last 6 episodes were underwhelming. They started out so great, but instead of reaching higher heights or plateauing even, the writing just plummeted. Not drastically but there were obvious changes in the script and storyline which tells me that the writers had cooked up a great intro but realized that there were 6 episodes left and were like ""oh f*** we have to end this soon what are we going to do? Oh Ik how about a hospital scene those are always good! Oh how about a kind of but kind of not satisfying ending."" I don't know if they changed writers at the end, but the close and personal touch i felt at first went away a little at the end because of how rushed it felt.
HOWEVER, I am not dissuading anyone from watching because of the rushed ending as overall this was a great show, that just needed a little more time to develop.

A Long Story
Random thoughts:

- Park Sae Ro Yi 's hairstyle never changed once from high school to 15 years after
- All characters at some point in the show were hateful
- .....except these two: Ma Hyun Yi and Choi Seung Kwon - my favourites
- Jo Yi Seo deserves Park Sae Ro Yi, she was fiercely loyal to him and stood by his side throughout
- I don't feel as sorry for Oh Soo Ah - her potential chef love interest is yummy LOL
- I wouldn't really call this a love story
- I wouldn't call it a food show either
- Revenge, revenge, revenge that turned people insane
- So when you sometimes watch a show and you wished that the characters would just please speak up and be honest to avoid misunderstanding, well this show has that - speaking their minds without filter
- The show gets draggy with extended flashback scenes, some dialogues feel repetitive from previous scenes. Towards the end, I didn't really care anymore, it felt like it would never end, I was just looking forward for the finish
- It has great OST

Beautiful Drama and an amazing story
I rated Itaewon Class a 10 out of 10 because I really think that this drama is worth the rating. Having watched many asian dramas, there are only two that I have felt deserved a 10 out 10 waiting and this was one of them.
The story is heart wenching and had me crying so much at the beginning because I felt so much for the issues that our main protagonist had to go through at a young age and I was so touched at how he was able to rise up to every occasion that life threw at him. I love the diversity of thought and characters introduced here. How some characters were more accepting than others, and how the others had to grow and learn to accept and be open minded to people who saw the world and interacted with the world differently than them.
One of the things that really stood out to me with this drama was how many of the main characters came from single parent homes or they did not have parents at all. The one mother-daughter relationship that was portrayed in the drama, I thought was beautiful done and well portrayed. One of my favorite quotes in the drama came from a conversation that happened between Jo Yi Seo and her mother. The quote is the ""That's not how I was raised."" In the context of the show it makes perfect sense. Every single one of the parental-child relationships we saw shaped the lives of that child and how they were to ultimately live their lives.
Park Sae Ro Yi's dad raised him to be principled and good. In turn, Jang Dae Hee raised his children to with no principles. The defining moments of this show for me were in the little moments when you saw the human interactions, most especially the father to son interactions.

It’s just bad for many reasons
1. The only likeable characters are the male lead and his friends who most of them belong in minorities, so that’s the only positive thing that has as a kdrama. The diversity.
2. The female lead is so unnecessary mean. Not only that she’s racist and homophobic/transphobic and the only reason she “changed” towards the end is because she wanted the male lead to like her, which I find very wrong. You will say she’s a sociopath so that’s why, but please that’s not an excuse for everything.
3. The way the story goes on is a bit frustrating because everything happens fast and there’re throwbacks and then back to present, escalates at the start and at the end only. A bit messy I would say.
4. The love story between the leads is very forced because it gives you a very blunt ending. Not only that there’s a big age difference with the characters which makes you wonder are they really … gonna be together now!? Meh
5. The villains are not likeable at all obviously haha (you know sometimes you guilty like them) but in the end they’re the only ones making this kdrama interesting.

I thought this drama started amazing the storyline... the character build up and even the romance between Sae Ro Yi and Soo-ah the chemistry between them two started out amazing and not going to lie... I was rooting for Soo-ah the whole way in the romance department. I’ve seen a lot of Park Seo Joon drama’s and his acting is always top notch and in character but I know I’m going to get a lot of negativity for saying this but romance wise Park Sae Ro Yi and Jo Yi Seo had zero sparks for me ....the chemistry between the two is great but a brother sister/ family love . She was one sided the whole way through and usually when you have a one sided love drama in the end when the other actor falls for the other actor you see and feel that chemistry of love but maybe I’m spoiled with “fight for my way” and “what’s wrong with secretary Kim” the chemistry with park min young and Kim Ji won is just a million times better than that kind of romance with Kim da mi
This drama showed two different ways to show love between two types of family with money and friendship. It even hit very touchy subjects as in transgender and race in episodes which made this a very impactful show. But the ending was just kind of rushed in a way I mean the time jumps were no joke in some parts. I would of been smarter to have tired to bring back a season two instead of rush things.

Apart from all the regular stuff that we see in a k-drama this one does a great job of exposing the many problems that we face in our day to day lives. Being a member of LGBTQ and a POC in Korea. I started watching this because of the title that seemed catchy ?
Boy I'm not disappointed. The acting by all the cast members was just brilliant. Especially Kim Da-mi was too perfect for her role. From being a talented and troubled kid who has lost her interest in life falls in love with a person who is the exact opposite of her and then tries so hard to make him fall in love with her and being with him through his troubled times and helping him get his revenge on the people who was responsible for his father's death. Through this journey she also starts to see herself changing. She is simply amazing. The ML Park Seo-joon who was a socially inept guy and lost his father to men in power strives to get justice for his father and to make his words have power and to lead a life with no regrets and consequences. Even with a poker face he was able to connect with us so well through his actions.
The OST was amazing.
Overall it's a good watch. I would recommend this ?

Amazing show.
Just finished the show. In general I’m not a fan of kdramas, but I felt that Itaewon Class was completely different. The revenge plot and romance sub plot were great, but the best part was that all the characters were flawed, which made the show much more realistic and enjoyable. Plus the acting. Wow. Park seo joon as always put on a great performance, but I was extremely surprised at Kim da mi. I never heard of her before this drama, but she did a fantastic job at playing the character of yi seo very closely to the source material. Will definitely check out her future works as well (wouldn’t mind another park seo joon/Kim da mi drama in the future-their chemistry was off the charts). Maybe the acting also covered for a few weak plot points in the show lol. Overall I am very impressed with Itaewon Class, only drama that lived up to the hype for me this year. Well Deserved 10/10.

One of the best shows I've ever seen. Every of the show was unique & had a different vibe from the begining. There were no cliches or any similarity with other kdramas. Everything about the show was mind blowing. eye opening & moving. The OSTs inspired me a lot & after 'CLOY', this is the 1st show which's OST have me captured even after ending it. The story was spectacular. It broke so many social taboos & pulled curtains of a lot of ignored social problems. Every character was iconic & had very strong stories to tell. Even the villain was an amazing person & had a painful backstory. The message this show bears is important for everyone. Always stick to your beliefs, be yourself, you don't need others validation about who you are, live a life without regret whatever the consequences. I learnt a lot from this show. A must watch show. Worth watching again & again.

Have Tissues!
This has been on my “Plan to watch list” for a few months. Normally, with a lot of dramas, I’ll watch an episode or two, then decide if I’ll continue, or put it on hold. Or, I watch a drama, get bored and fast forward through most of it. But with this, I was hooked immediately, and didn’t fast forward once throughout the 16 episodes. It had everything I loved. It had revenge, which was the main theme of this drama, love, heartbreak, friendship, and best of all, an ending that tied up all the loose ends. Oh, and did I mention revenge?... Park Seo Joon was excellent as the main character, and his emotions and heartbreaks really played out well, and it made you believe everything he was supposed to be feeling. As far as revenge dramas, this is the best I’ve seen. If you aren’t into that kind of theme, don’t watch it. But if you are, it will satisfy you, especially the ending. There is nothing I would change about it. Just be sure to have tissues, because it is an emotional roller coaster of sad, happy, accomplishments, failures, failed love, happy love, pretty much everything!

It was one of the first korean dramas i watched on netflix and it remains one of my favorites. I love the cast , the story and the fact that they tried to tackle modern issues that have to do with gender and race for example. I don't think that the issues were tackled in a perfect way but I really appreciate them trying to raise awareness of really important matters that still carry a lot of stigma in modern societies. I also really love the fact that it tries to capture an international audience. I totally recommend giving it a try !

POW!!
Park Seo Joon (PSJ), like I hadn’t seen him before. From “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim” to OMG Park Sae Ro Yi! I loved every second he was on the screen in this story. However, here’s what worked and what didn’t work for me:

What worked for me was the story of a young man coming out of the dark, sticking with his principles, and standing in his truth. I loved how his character accepted responsibility for any and all of actions. Lots of great learning themes like, “emotions, love, and expectations are not give and take.” All of the bad guys did an amazing job! I sincerely have come to appreciate the outstanding level of acting Asian actors bring when portraying the ultra-bad guy. As an American, many times I am actually screaming at the screen about the depth of evil doing portrayed in these stories. For me, if at the end all I want is the bad guys to pay in the worst way for their nefariousness, I give all that credit to the actors (Yoo Jae Myung, Ann Bo Hyun, and Won Hyun Joon). I will certainly be on the lookout to see them again.

Park Seo Joon (PSJ) is perfect (period) in his ability to portray the tortured, disappointed, hurt, and angry young man. Part of the intrigue for me was just watching PSJ tell this story. Toward the end though, I found myself growing weary of the revenge aspect in this character’s end game. All that hate and pain only lives as we continue to feed it. Was Sae Ro Yi ever going to grow and realize that he drank the poison and is still waiting for the bad guys to die. While one can exact a revenge plan of action, the emotional toll is heavy on losses and expensive. Overall, the interest to stay the course to end of this drama was PSJ. I will continue discovering his storytelling as a new fan of his work.

The IC team all grew accordingly in most instances in this story. I loved the diversity, however awkward at times it felt. The awkwardness felt authentic, appropriate, and timely with regard to being new to the medium of storytelling in this instance for the culture. I loved the loyalty, and again, the consistent message to be sure to follow your own path. Live the life that serves your dreams. No one owes us anything and we don’t owe anyone, especially some misguided “fielty” that might include deferring our dream in honor of expectations. This message made the story worth watching until the end as each of the characters would have to step into their own understanding of it.

Here’s what didn’t work for me. The love interests, period. I did not love Yi-Seo as a character and especially as any love interest. The one salient point she made was in some later episode where she tells Oh Soo Ah, and I paraphrase, “while you’re just waiting on homeboy to come riding in to save you from your own delusions, Imma stick right here by his side become what he needs, and watch his heart melt for me. And so, we saw that happen. However, I just couldn’t get into who she was as a character. Both of these ladies were equally annoying and insensitive, I was not rooting for either of them to win his heart. Again, chalk that up to the actors, Kim Da Mi and Kwon Na Ra. Bravo!! I didn’t really miss the usual sexual tension in this drama. I was more interested in Sae Ro Yi. I couldn’t see him winding up with either one of them. Loved seeing the actress, Kim Yeo Jin (since Vincenzo in a better light) as Yi Seo’s mother, however, that character was just as annoying and shallow.

While the message to take responsibility for one’s own outcomes in life based on those experiences that build character, it was sad that Sae Ro Yi and bad guy, Jang Geun Won, were kind stuck in the past emotionally.

I would rewatch only to watch PSJ’s lovely face, fabulous acting range and to admire his talent. Otherwise, no because the female leads are just too annoying and uninteresting.

The production, story and soundtrack are very good. That’s my fifty cents worth! Enjoy!

He’s not just a mediocre man, I will turn him into something amazing - Jo Yi Seo
নতুন স্কুলে বদলি হওয়ার প্রথম দিনই দূর্বল এক স্টুডেন্ট এর উপর অন্য আরেক স্টুডেন্ট এর অত্যাচার মেনে নিতে না পেরে তাকে আঘাত করে বসে কঠোর নীতিবান ছেলে Park Sae Ro Yi. সেই আঘাত এর প্রতিশোধ নিতে হাজির হয় সেই ছেলের বাবা Jang Dae Hee, যে কিনা কোরিয়ার সবচেয়ে বড় ফুড কর্পোরেশন Jangga এর মালিক। চেয়ারম্যান Jang Dae Hee, সে-রোয়ি কে হাঁটু গেড়ে বসে ক্ষমা চাইতে বলে তার কাছে, না হলে তাকে স্কুল থেকে বহিষ্কার করা হবে। নীতির সাথে কখনো আপোষ না করা ছেলেটা কোনো ভাবেই রাজি হয় না বিনা কারণে ক্ষমা চাইতে। যার দরুন চাকরি হারাতে হয় তার বাবাকে এবং স্কুল থেকে বহিষ্কার হয় সে।
কোনোরকম আশাহত না হয়ে বাবা ছেলে সিদ্ধান্ত নেয় ছোট্ট একটি রেস্টুরেন্ট খোলার। সবকিছু ওলোট পালোট হয়ে যায় যখন সে-রোয়ির বাবা হুট করে একটা এক্সিডেন্ট এ মারা যায়। এবং জানা যায় এরজন্য সেই চেয়ারম্যান Jang dae Hee এর ছেলে দায়ী।রাগে, দুঃখে, হতাশায় সেই ছেলে কে মারতে গেলে পুলিশ তাকে Attempt To murder এর কেসে জড়িয়ে ফেলে এবং ৩ বছরের জন্য শাস্তি হয় তার।
এপিজে আব্দুল কালাম এর একটা কথা আছে ""স্বপ্ন সেটা নয় যেটা তুমি ঘুমিয়ে দেখো,স্বপ্ন সেটাই যেটা তোমাকে ঘুমাতে দেয় না।"" এই ড্রামার জন্য,বিশেষ করে সে-রোয়ির কাছে স্বপ্ন তাই ছিলো যা তাকে ঘুমাতে দেয় নি। মানুষ চাইলে কি না পারে! দরকার শুধু ইচ্ছাশক্তির। ইচ্ছা আর স্বপ্ন থাকলে কোনো কিছুই যে অসম্ভব না তার জ্বলন্ত প্রমাণ Park Sae Ro Yi এর চরিত্র। যতই বাঁধা আসুক সামনে, সব কিছু উপেক্ষা করে এগিয়ে যেতে এটাই এই ড্রামার মূল বক্তব্য।

চরিত্র বিশ্লেষণ:
Park Sae Ro Yi: বাঁটিছাট চুলের অসম্ভব নীতিবান ছেলেটা এমনিতে খুব চুপচাপ ইন্ট্রোভার্ট হলেও স্বপ্ন দেখায় বিশ্বাসী সে।দূরদৃষ্টি, বিচক্ষণতা, পরোপকারীতা তার চরিত্রের অন্যতম ভালো গুণ।
আমার কাছে সম্ভবত পার্ক সে জুনের সবচেয়ে ভালো একটা ড্রামা এখন পর্যন্ত। তেমন কোনো গ্ল্যামারাস লুকে না এসেও কিভাবে শুধু এক্সপ্রেশন আর অভিনয় দিয়ে তাক লাগিয়ে দেয়া যায় তার সবচেয়ে বড় উদাহরণ হয়ত এইড্রামা টা!
Jo Yi Seo: এই চরিত্র টা একদম ই অন্য রকম। কম বয়সী, তুখোড় বুদ্ধিমতী, সোশ্যাল মিডিয়া স্টার আর একি সাথে রুড, স্যাভেজ। প্রথম দেখায় বয়সে এত বড় একজন কে পছন্দ করে ফেলা আর তারপর তার সাথেই থাকার সিদ্ধান্ত নেয়া আপাতদৃষ্টিতে হাসির বিষয় হলেও সে কিন্তু সফল হয়ে দেখিয়েছে।

এই ড্রামায় আমার সবচেয়ে পছন্দের একটা ডায়লগ হচ্ছে Yi seo যখন বলে- I Have To Be Someone Who He Needs. মানে সত্যিই তো! আমরা কেনো সবসময়ই ভাবি যে আমার জন্য সে-ই সব কিছু করবে। সে-ই আমার স্বপ্ন পূরণ করবে। অথচ এমন স্বার্থপরের মতো চিন্তা না করে এমন টা হয় না যে আমি সেরকম একজন হবো যখন তার প্রয়োজনে সে আমাকে পাবে, দুজনে মিলে দুজনের স্বপ্ন পূরণ করবো, তার স্বপ্ন আমারও স্বপ্ন হবে। আমার কাছে মনে হয়, যখন একটা সম্পর্কে এই মনোভাব থাকে সেই সম্পর্ক পরিণতি পেতে বাধ্য!
এই ড্রামার বেশির ভাগ OST সুন্দর। Gaho এর Start Over টা শুনলেই মনে হতো- হ্যাঁ হয়তো আসলেই সব নতুন করে আবার শুরু করা যায়। পুরোনো সব ভুলে নতুন ভাবে একটা দিন সাজানো যায়।

Itaewon Class had a very promising start it already got me crying at the first episode. I thought the story was brilliant but unfortunately was not executed so well. What I hated the most was the unrealistic time skips, It was totally OVERUSED and I also hated the romance, this drama did not need a romance to it. Personally I preferred So ah's story more than Yi seo just because I think So ah and Park Sae royi’s relationship goes on a deeper level. For Yi seo her liking him started way too early and all the good she did was literally only in favor of Park Sae royi. If you hate So Ah then you simply don't understand her character, I wish the writer could have reviewed her intentions earlier. The revenge plot was interesting at first although it seemed impossible to destroy Jangga, I was definitely still eager to see how he would go about it but then it started dragging and it became a tiring watch.

The irony is that he did not end up destroying the company but did the latter. I don't know how to feel about that. Kim To ni's story was just so messy like what in the world, next time I see an African in kdrama it should be of a decent role. There was literally little to no character development, the leads had as little chemistry as a mustard seed. I hated how they tried to shove their romance down our throat towards the end. The best thing about this drama is the ost its so good, I still play it. This drama is very different from usual kdramas, it pointed out all the negatives about Korea. Overall it was not too much of a bad watch, if you are gonna watch, watch for Park Seo Joon because he literally carried the show and to me this is his best work (acting wise).

I had conflicted feelings. I like and hate it at the same time.
It’s crazy how people ship Sae Ro Yi with Oh Soo Ah.I understand that it was his childhood crush and that he liked her for 10 years (just because of some high school memories, made absolutly no sense to me), but there’s a reason for why nothing happened in 10 years. If they really liked each other they would’ve made it happened. First of all, accepting the job at the company was a huge betrayal, and working for someone who made Sae Ro Yi’s life a living hell is disgusting, even though she admitted that it hurt her. She had good grades, opportunities but she chose the easy way out. I found it weird that she rarely visited Sae Ro when he was in prison and that they didn’t keep in touch with each other for 7 years, She could’ve helped him save money for the pub and contributed and supported to help him achieve his dream. But she did nothing. Only watched, never gave anything and accepted things from him. She had a lot of power and could’ve made Geun won confess and THE WORST PART she should’ve submitted the evidence she collected from the beginning instead of waiting 10 years. She was just selfish and cowardly and did not deserve to be with the male lead. She was like “Poor me, save me” I hate character that only complain, and do not take matter into their own hands.

Let’s talk about Jo Yi Seo. I didn’t like how she was obsessed and selfish with him, and every choice and action were for Sae Ro Yi. For example: She started to do business for him and gave up on college, took advantage of Geun Soo, worked for only him. Where are her personal dreams? It was too much. She was too depended on him and rarely had a life on her own. I hated how she kept pushing her love for him when he told her not to. She had been forcing her love on him for years. It was weird, annoying, and childishly whiny. She didn’t respect his choice, and got mad at him when he was with Jo Yi So. She has no right to make him feel bad. Its more than enough to confess your feeling once, and then you must keep it for yourself since it’s your problem. You don’t have to flirt with him. tell him that you love him and make it awkward when he just wants to be friends. This tells me that she has no respect. Her “I don’t take a no for an answer” mentality was bad. I liked how brave, independent, and smart she was. But her IDGF attitude was rude, and nothing can justify that she had no compassion and only cared about herself (except for Jo Yi Seo) , (the only reason why she « changed » with the others is because Saeroyi told her to change)
But a good person isn’t only good to a specific number of people, but to people around them without an ulterior motive. She was a bad friend to Geun Soo from the beginning, I felt bad for him.

From the very beginning, I knew Sae Ro Yi was going to end up with Jo Yi Seo. Not because she is the first female lead, but because of the depth in their conversations, how they support each other and how he looked at her. The show had many great moments between these two, but when she got that voice recording for him, i can’t describe the feeling. The other girl Soo-ah never tried. Never did anything for him and he wasted time liking her.
I also liked the scene where Seo Ro Yi opened the safe and went through what Yi Seo wrote and realised his feeling for her. It was emotional and cute that he realized that she been there all along, how he wouldn’t be where he is today without her and how much she helped him. But I wish their romance was a slower process and that Ro Yi` sudden focus on romance was slower too. And that Yi Seo developed herself more before their relationship started. For starters I wish she realized that forcing your love on someone isn’t going to make them yours, and that you should respect when people don’t reciprocal your feelings.

Other things that bothered me: the transgender was female, I was really confused since I thought she was a female from the beginning. Levi and the grandma’s story were unrealistic. What’s the chance for them to have a connection? And her living in the neighbourhood and at the same time be filthy rich. Weird, just weird. I also felt like the other characters didn’t contribute much to the business and that it wouldn’t make a huge difference without them.

I hated how the CEO got sick in the end and was going to die. It was a cliché twist to move the plot forward. I really wanted him to suffer, he doesn’t deserve to die after 6 months. I wasn’t a huge fan of the kidnapping; the villains were lame, and the issue could’ve been resolved if they called the police from the start. Sae Ro Yi lost every sense and jumped at it without a plan or a weapon. And when they ran from the gangsters, he suddenly confessed to DaMi. That was so stupid and made no sense. Not romantic since i couldn’t enjoy the scene, i was focused on the gangsters. Poor writing. It was like they tried to squeeze everything in one scene. Another example of poor writing was how he had a long conversation with the chairman when she was captured? I was like, hurry the fuck up. It’s not like you have all the time in the world. But I liked that he kneeled at the end. He finally understood that revenge and pride isn’t everything. He regretted devoting and wasting his life to follow the footsteps of someone who wasn’t worth it. It was a powerful scene. He was the one who kneeled, yet he held all the power. He was composed and crushed the CEO with his words. Even though you don’t agree with me about the character development. It still wasn’t out of character because a life was at stake and that can’t get compared to the beginning when it was only education and a job.

This drama is so charming because the protagonists do not come from some filthy rich background. Instead they work their butts off for success despite the obstacles. (Not to mention it questions what is “success”) It also shows that success is made with the trust among people. I found myself cringing when the drama forced itself to be unique/original and the whole Itaewon, foreigners’ concept was a bit cringey. But it was a fun watch with interesting/different character (Some needed more development, since I felt like they were statues) It was predictable at times, repetitive and boring. Especially the last episodes, they felt out of place. The OST fit the scenes, and I really liked the piano melody/music. There were some scenes that made me squeal of joy, and some scenes that me emotional. The feels hit me hard. I felt anger towards the people who made his life a living hell. I really loved Sa Ro Yi and he felt like a real human being. His traits, habits and reactions felt real. I hope he’s happy and finds true happiness. (I know he isn’t real)

Overall, I enjoyed following the journey of the main character and I was excited for the next episode. I watched the whole thing without regret and that itself is a good thing.

Revenge is sweet
Likes:
1. Park Saeroyi's dad must have been one amazing man to be able to make a huge impact to SRY and Soo ah.
2. PSRY finally realizing what life is all about and smiling (i missed those eye wrinkles)
3. Danbam reaching the top after a lot of hard work
4 i disliked Soo ah for the most part of the show and she proved me wrong and redeeemed herself in the end. She totally deserves Park Bogum in her life.
5. Love that this show wasnt the typical kdrama and tackled a lot of social issues even though eps 13-15 felt like a different drama with the sickness, kidnapping, and gangster showdown.
6. Yiseo getting her man and still being a badass
7. Park Seo Jun can start growing back his hair!

Dislikes:
1. Chairman Jang and Jangga. I could never understand why everyone thinks he is so great when all i see is a pathetic and petty old guy trying to prove to the world that he is still powerful and relevant. I loved the ending when PSJ finally realized that he wasted a lot of years over nothing. I felt the same way and i could have told him that 5 episodes ago. Lol.
2. So what happened to Geun Won? I guess it doesnt matter now. I was still hoping he would change and be a better person but he was so far gone.

Revenge dramas are ALWAYS fun
I'm a sucker for a revenge plot, and this one caught my eye because it was business and brain-oriented, not like the other revenge dramas where the main guy just goes around beating up bodyguards and secretly recording corruption. No, Park Saeroyi did everything BY THE BOOK, and I appreciated so much that he was willing to play the long game.

I was super into this drama for most of it. Even though the romance was unusual, I actually didn't have an issue with the age gap, because we saw Saeroyi fall in love with someone who stuck with him through the years, instead of the typical ""first love"" trope.

One point of the romance that did sit badly with me, however, was a non-consensual kiss which I would've preferred was actually a dream.

A lot of people have complained about the car crash writing of the last three episodes, and I pretty much felt exactly the same way. I would've loved it much more if PSR just continued with his plan and most of the conflict remained business-y, instead of suddenly throwing over-the-top kidnapping, gangsters, car-of-dooms, and hostage situations into the mix. In doing this, it essentially didn't give me the redemption arc that I wanted (that would've been more realistic and heartfelt) but also seemed to make the situation much less realistic and out-of-control.

Still, I loved how this drama managed to balance smaller sub-plots with different characters that addressed LGBTQIA+ discrimination and racism in Korean society. It's definitely not something you see in every drama and they handled it pretty well.

A gem of a character I wish got more screentime was Ho-Jin, the nerd who was bullied who went on to be a genius financial advisor. I loved that he had such strong character development and found it in himself to ""forgive"" his bully at the end, knowing that being successful and happy was the best revenge he could've gotten. Beautiful scene.

Will forever be a favorite.
**Taken from my old review: 3/27/2020**

I CAN'T EVEN WITH THIS SHOWWWWW!!!!!!!
Has anyone seen my mind? It blew and I'm not sure where it landed. Nope, not blowing smoke. Totally honest. I admit I have seen a lot of Kdramas... Okay not A LOT - a lot... but I've seen my fair share so far. I must say this show... Had a lot of things that I haven't seen before when it comes to dramas. I'm not saying they haven't been in others, I'm just saying it's new to me and I haven't seen it before. Just a few examples: a openly gay actor who plays the gay guy (Hong Seok-cheon, I'm looking at you, boo!) to a transgender character, lets face it, that is taboo in a lot of places, hat's off to the writer and director to being open with it and actually showing some of the problems transgender people have to go through. There is so much more that just left me shook about this show and I loved it and want to say more but I don't want to give it away.

I loved all of the character developments! Holy crap! I don't think there was one character who didn't grow in one way or another... and by that I mean up or down. Some characters went to the dark side I never thought I'd see em go to. X_X

Now the only thing I didn't like about this show was the actor that played Toni. Oof I know that sounds terrible but I feel like they could have picked someone better to play him? He seemed so monotone and he just wasn't a very enjoyable character. I feel like he brought down a scene because he just fell flat. No matter what the scene was going though. Happy, sad, mad... I felt like a wall showed more expression... UNLESS that is how the character was supposed to be, I'll admit it here that I have not read the series it was based off of, I know I need to. I realize a lot can change thought wise when you read the book something is based off of... Unless it's Twilight. Kristen was the worst. BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY!! lol anyway What I'm trying to say is... I wish there was more to his character. Especially since his scenes were so little. That's just me though.

There aren't many things I have watched that as soon as I finish them, I instantly want to rewatch them. I think the last drama that evoked (invoked?) that feeling in me was Boys Over Flowers.. So for me to find another show that leaves me feeling like that is amazing. It's like a really good book that leaves you with a book hangover... This would be a drama hangover I guess? Haha!
As much as I wish I could rewatch this right now, I do need to finish Kingdom and the books I have been reading. Lol Goodness. X_X

If I could give this more than 10 stars, I would. There just aren't enough stars. From the setting to the actors to the acting, to the storyline... everything was amazing and whatever feeling you were meant to feel, trust me, you'll feel them.... Unless you are a robot. Lol

There are a lot of things that i had a problem with in the drama. First of all, why is it that when two people are shown as competitors, they also have to compete for liking the person. like if they have good and a healthy dating life, they cant be competitors. What i hated was that the women in the drama although started off as powerful women, they were eventually reduced to love interests of the male characters. The fact that the female character described as young genius multitalented athletic strong sociopath who had been to various places and had friends of varying nationalities and gender/ sexual identities was portrayed as a transphobic racist in the begining was kind of hard to digest. It portrayed paedophilia in certain parts. Also the typical chabeol shit , about being portrayed as the negative character.
Although this drama tries to be like about how we should let go of racism and queerphobia and stuff, but its like too cliche and fails to achieve that aspect and ends up being a typical kdrama about the chabeol as the villian.

Entertaining as hell, a bit frusturating
Well, first of all, I rlly liked this drama more than I like most dramas! It was rlly entertaining and I don't understand all the reviews that gave this drama less than an 8. It wasn't perfect, at all, but it was rlly refreshing!

Pros:
1. ML's personality was GREAT.... He was always honest, never gave up on his dreams, strong personality, and talented as hell.
2. Jo Yi Seo was a genius, extremely beautiful/cute, badass, rlly fashionable, and while she had her less impressive moments, she always corrected herself in the end.

3.The amazing friendship the DanBam staff had!!!

4.Yi Seo's mother was rather entertaining to watch!

5. ML's many friendships with many ppl ofc.

6. I LOVED how they discussed a lot of hot topics rn like BLM and LGBTQ+.....They showed both sides of the story (the hater & the hated, the accepting & the accepted and how these ppl al felt!!!)

7.GREAT ENDING...THE LAST EPISODE was simply perfect! especially the lil extra scene at the end

Cons
1.While ML is great, I didn't like how he handled his love life at all... I rlly hate Oh soo ah so I was rlly mad whenever he brushed her 'betrayals' aside and didn't move on nor do smth more w their 10/14 year old little so-called relationship or whatever it was. Nor did I like how -even after 4 EFFING YEARS f Yi Seo constantly proving herself and how much she loves him-he still did absolutely nothing about it and even was ungrateful enough to not even give her birthday presents?! and let her overwork herself till she was hospitalized?!!! like rlly? Well, he did fix himself in the end & was rlly sweet and protective!!!

2.Absolutly hate Oh Soo Ah's two-faced, lying, selfish, pushy, over-confident self.....rlly don't get why many ppl liked her aside from her face, clothes, and great business mindset.

3. The villains annoyed the hell out of me....Like wtf is wrong w ppl these days srsly...

A Perfectly Told Story, what TV Should Aspire to Be
I was absolutely blown away by this drama. It's the first full length show I've given a 10. With an incredibly unique story and satisfying romance, with interesting and diverse characters with multiple and changing dimensions, with setups and pay offs executed perfectly and just the right amount of unpredictability, I was drawn in from the beginning and gripped until the end. I fell in love with every character, loving the enemies while also hating them, and rooting those who were trying to change or overcome hardship. Every emotion, I was along for the ride. When the characters cried, I cried. When they cheered, I cheered. When they loved, I loved. It's perfectly done, and I wish every show I watched from this moment forward were just like it.

It's not something to be taken lightly when I say I liked all the characters. In almost every other show I've watched, even the good ones, I tend to find a single character I care about above all others, and so my enjoyment of the show hinges on their experience and actions and plots. This time around, I cared about everyone. Not only did every person feel real and developed, they each were reaching towards their goals, all of them pushing past their own hardships. Instead of feeling for the characters through their attachment with the protagonist, I felt each one of them as a person, through what I knew about them and what I knew they valued. Because of this strong empathy, I was able to experience strong vicarious emotions in every situation. No moment felt unjustified or unearned. This one element is, in my opinion, the most important aspect of any show, and what makes or breaks whether you even decided to watch it, and whether it is memorable and exciting. These detailed and empathetic characters are exploited to their full extent, producing moments that lift you into the sky or crush you into the ground or set you on fire with rage, all while maintaining a balance of conflict and resolution that isn't too taxing on the viewer. Even better is that each character changes throughout the show, completing arcs which are believable and well-earned. I could easily name each internal flaw they all faced, although this is a spoiler free review and so I cannot (you can bet if there were spoilers the whole review would just be me ranting about every specific detailed that I loved). Long story short, the characters are perfect, and that's what's really important.

Let me quickly mention the diversity, which was extremely welcome amidst the generally homogenous production of Asian dramas. Perhaps there still isn't as much as we're used to in the west, but you have to admit they're making great strides. Obviously I'm referencing the Afro-Asian character Toni (although this could have been handled a tad bit better in certain areas), but what I'm really impressed by is the transgender character, Hyun Yi. She, after helping the other protagonists overcome their own preconceived judgements, manages to overcome her own flaws and learn to be confident about her identity, and the show fully accepts this identity in a mature way. Especially considering the often biased views of many other kdrama regarding even homosexuality, transgender representation is just great to see.

I loved the plot. Holy cow. I won't say it's the most genius plot, I've definitely seen shows that are smarter, but this plot embodies all that a drama should strive for. A clear set of values, a core message or two, and a thorough and interesting exploration of all these things wrapped into an intense and exciting main storyline. Where other shows might drop the ball while trying to subvert expectations, and others still might crank out something mind-numbingly predictable, Itaewon Class toes the line between the two effortlessly, leaving you without a clue as to where it'll end up but still being satisfying, justified, and most importantly gripping. This is one of the few long-form shows which have managed to keep me interested enough to binge it in a few sittings.

I hope I've said enough to convince that this is well-worth a watch. Don't judge it by it's premise like I almost did and just give it a chance to snag you and pull you along. I one hundred percent love this drama and implore you to watch it, as soon as possible.

Park Saeyori is a really ideal character, but flat. I found him boring, predictable. I wanted to see him as an immature, for correction personality at the beginning who gradually became corrected and upright, but from the very start he was already this firm and upright. Somehow he seemed too perfect. His facial expression throughout the entire drama seemed to be only one, which was his emotionless face. I found him no fun. Besides, I think he became too greedy and vengeful when he wished for the total overthrow of Jangga. It could just have ended when jang geun won have been imprisoned. And I didn't like what he did to Chairman Jang in the end when the old man did that. I was somehow expecting him to still be ""compassionate"" as what the drama wanted him to appear, but no, he didn't, and it was as if Chairman Jang was the one who murdered his father. I didn't find his character admirable there. He became the typical heartless businessman, no trait that sets him apart from others anymore.

Oh Soo Ah. She was so beautiful. I hoped the story dug deeper on her character and origins since she was a main character, but no, the writer only gave her one scene where her mother left her in the orphanage without even giving any more info. I really liked her character, she was smart and nice but just got tormented because she owes a lot to jangga. But then, I think there was really no real romance between her and Saeroyi. It was all just like a puppy love, they promised to each other and tried to keep on to their promise, but in reality, they don't seem to do anything for each other. They just go to dates. Keep on telling that they like each other, but there barely was any showing. I was expecting some stupid acts from them that will manifest their real liking for each other, or some sacrificial deeds for each other that would make themselves at risk, but I don't remember anything. They were always safe. And I don't think that gave them any sparks. Their liking for each other will really die if things would just go like that. But I was truly rooting for her. Sadly the writer doesn't seem to want them together.

Jo Yi Seo. This was the b*tch that almost made me discontinue watching the whole drama. I dislike, or should I say remorse, her so much. I hate to say this, but she was ****. I hate her so much. Imagine seeing a character like that and seeing her not so pleasant face, I truly almost gave up watching this drama. A character like this shouldn't even be a main character. Or, if the writer wanted her to be one, the writer should develop her to become someone truly empathetic and kind, where she didn't need to hear Saeyori's words and chooses to be that on her own thoughts. But no. If Saeyori won't tell her, she is still the same f*cking bitch who will mistreat other people with her ruthless words. I especially despised her for mistreating Jang geun soo when he had done nothing to her but kindness and genuine care. She only becomes kind and considerate when Saeyori says. It was like she didn't have her own brain and only responds to Saeyori's words. And that kind of character, man, shouldn't be a main role. Yes, true, she had done so much for Saeyori, but it was all because of obsession. I won't even say it was out of love because she was not even capable of loving, or even just being kind and sensitive, to other people. Especially to Geun Soo. And even in the end, she only became nice to Geun Soo when she already got what she wanted, which was to make Saeyori fall for her. Her character made me despise even her romantic scenes with Saeyori. It didn't become romantic to me at all. I was disgusted. And this Saeyori, I even think he just fell for her because she was so eager to be used to achieve his dream. And I find that selfish and somehow like a ""user"". His ultimate goal actually became too vengeful already. And this jo yi seo just blindly pursued since it was ""Saeyori's dream."" When in fact, the person who truly made Yori achieve his dream was Soo-ah, when she gave all the evidences of Jangga's irregularities to the authorities.

The supporting characters. They were all excellent. I truly love them all. I think the supporting characters and Soo Ah were the reasons why I still finished this drama. Chairman Jang, wow. Truly evil and unfair. But hey, because of the holistic characterization given to him in the story, I was actually attached, curious, and sympathetic for him. Jang geun won, excellent. He could be the spoiled evil son while still showing how vulnerable he truly is. This guy was one of the best actors here. Jang geun soo, he was my cutie crush here. His character became surprising. But actually, I hoped he became wiser with his feelings for Yi Seo. She didn't even deserve to see his cutie face. I hoped he was wiser to realize that Yi Seo was not worth pursuing.The transgender and the gangster ex-con, I was really rooting for them since the beginning. Gladly the writer satisfied me here. And Ms. Kang and the detective!! So adorable. Lee hojin, he had a really great revenge. I Loved his scene with geun won in the end.

Unexpected and perfect
I hadn't watched this because I was sure it couldn't live up to the hype I have not been so wrong since I put off watching My Love from the Star.

But this drama is moving, profound, and lovely. It creates characters you love from beginning to end.

I adored this drama and I wouldn't change anything about it. I've noticed that others didn't like Yi Seo but I loved her character and the romance line. I genuinely feel as if I'm parting from dear friends, now that I'm done watching. For me, this was simply exceptional.

Best Show
I literally made an account just for this because I am so in love with this show. The way the story progresses is so easy to follow. Also, I love that it takes place in Itaewon. The cast was immaculate. Park Seojoon is one of my favorite actors. But the people I thought took their role to a higher level were Kim Dami and Ahn Bohyun they were just so very easy to follow and you were able to feel all their emotions.
Please watch this show if you need another k-drama or are stuck in another stay-at-home order.

Talking about real stuff
Well...mostly at least. Although I found this drama very lengthy, it carries a special place in my heart due to the things that are talked about. Taboo topics that aren't very well spoken of in some countries are put into the spotlight in this drama - which I'm a sucker for. I honestly love people who use their public platform to speak about gender, racism and self developement in any form.

The following might be very controversial, brace yourselves (no spolers don't worry)

To be completely honest, there is none but one character in this Drama that I actually like...and the one I do like is a support role (hurray Kim Donghee). It's hard to say why I don't like these characters without giving spoilers but what I can say is, that I'm not a big fan of selfish ""step over another"" people. Nevertheless (Song Kang stans hands up) I guess not really liking any of the characters makes this drama even more charming, since you don't really have anyone to root for and, in my case, can watch without really caring what happens to the individuals.

I know I have been quite hard on this drama but it is only because most people know of it or have even seen it...so maybe people know what I'm talking about.

The overall acting as well as the production are perfect, all of these Actors and Actresses reall unterstood their assignments portraying their roles.

I'm guessing I am pretty torn between liking and disliking this one, so I really think it depends on taste and preference in story and development thereof.

Itaewon class was really good. Personally i love dramas with a revenge plot. He kinda saeroyi kinda started that then stopped and let others do if for him. I loved his name so much tho. Had to look for the meaning,lol.
From the reviews i read before watching it, Soo Ah was portrayed as this really horrible character, althought i
didn't really like her much, i also didn't like the way Saeroyi abandoned her for Yi seo . Like dudddddeeee, this girl's probably ignored all other guys just to end up getting rejected, felt so sorry for her.
Then Yi Seo kinda just kinda toned down her psychotic side, but why? Lol. I really loved that about her tho.

The show overall was ok , though it just went from this anticipation feels to just wanting every episode to finish so you can go sleep.

Itaewon class is a cradle of all topics and it worth it!
At the beggining, I should admit my reasons why I began to watch Itaewon Class. I have known about this drama since it was airing, but I wasn’t sure if I will had to try it in future. In any case, my great friend recommended this to me and then I found out Kim Dong Hee acts here which was for me really predominant factor because I have known him from the Extracurricular where he amazed me. The another reason for me was also Park Seo Joon who I have met in the Hwarang (which is my nostalgic series although it isn’t anything special).

Although my reasons didn‘t touch story line at all, the story line was exactly what made me to watch this drama farther. Yeah, and of course actors and actresses, romance that wasn’t fluffy and dull, ambience which was just unique and I really want to go to the Itaewon sometime (but I don’t know how I will do it because I live in the heart of Europe, country named Czech republic and that’s why my English is still really bad), topics of gender, different colors of skin, thinking about life in different forms… There was really many things and someone can say that’s why this isn’t good. But exactly opposite – this mix of all topics with great characters and unique story line made this drama extraordinary.

I must admit that before writing this review I read reviews of others. And I freaked out a little bit because of the negative opinions. Again I have different opinion than others, I should be less surprised, I have different opinion almost all the time.

The story has incredibly interesting thought, I liked how emphasis was placed on moral values, which Seo Joon as Park Sae Ro Yi was showing us mainly – his character is one of the most interesting here for me, he compels you to think about yourself and your life and you probably really say something like „he has an interesting view on the world and I think I should live like him“ (but if you are already living like this, you probably won’t say this and your reaction will be same as mine, just you will admire him like character).

In my opinion, the story line is kind of new (or I watched only a few dramas and this story line is actually totaly cliche, what I know, but I loved this), all the time we are wandering in the dark topics, which will fascinate you, melt your heart or often make us cry, and definitely we can’t expect sweet romance like for example in Wait, My Youth. So if the romance is for you main point in the drama, you probably will not be satisfied with this. The story line here serves us romance like the last bite, the moral values, teamwork, hardwork and so on are the main priorities for this plot. Itaewon Class is really good especially because of the thoughts which this tries to tell us. And I love these types of dramas a lot so this is my cup of coffee.

As far as characters, I can mention Park Sae Ro Yi, how I said before, he has incredibly interesting temper and all the time he comples you to be obssesed with his life story. For Yiseo, I probably understand both opinions from viewers, I understand someone doesn’t like her, but also I get why someone loves her. For me Yiseo was like a nut – sometimes I didn’t like her behaviors because sometimes she was obssesed with Park Sae Ro Yi, sometimes her words were maybe too creepy. But I definitely can’t deny that her character was interesting for me. Also her character had nice development (now I want to mention one scene from last episode but I can’t cause I don’t want to spoiler something, so I don’t do that) and I enjoyed that.

Again I must bow to Kim Dong Hee, this boy is amazing actor and again he acted perfectly, character of Jang Geon Soo was fascinating to me the most, although he was secondary character.

Every character won me by something, with exceptions (I don’t like jerks, so sorry, Jang Geun Won). All of them were realistic because they were doing mistakes, nothing wasn’t pink in this drama and I think this is really great.

I have actually only one thing which I didn‘t like and that’s why my rating isn’t 10/10. I didn’t like end’s fighting scene too much – or maybe better saying, I am not a person, who loves these fights, so for me it was too much, but I understand it. Just it wasn’t for me and I believe it could solve in another way. On the other side these action scenes fullfilled the absurdity which I find in every asian drama.

Romance which is waiting for you here is postponed to the background, it is a big plus for me. I am not a person (yes, these sentences „I am not a person“ are my favorites) who is romantic, I watch completely romantic show rarely. So romance here was perfect for me. Also I can say the romance here wasn’t bad like others write in their reviews, I can’t imagine different way of the romance here, the more passionsate love will not suit this story (but it’s only my opinion and we should respect our opinions).

All in all, this review is too long, I definitely can recommend Itaewon Class! I am amazed by this and I think if you want a story which will amaze you with the idea and thoughts, which the story wants to deliver to viewers, here you will definitely find it! Just try that! You have nothing to lose, just try it and you will see if it worth it!

Going into this I was super hyped to finally watch this as Ive heard really good things about this drama and I love Park Seo Joon so Im always stoked to watch his dramas....though unfortunately this one fell somewhat short for me =(

It started off great!! I loved the first 8ish episodes but after that, the story just seemed to lose its momentum...the pacing seemed to slow down, became somewhat repetitive and very predictable....which made me start losing interest in this drama very quickly to the point i was debating on even finishing the drama by episode 12....but since i already got that far I pushed myself to finish.

Apart from me not really liking the overall story, I really did enjoy the different characters, its diversity and cleverness in incorporating societal issues that many people deal with in their daily lives. That was refreshing to see, and I really did enjoy each character's story and their development. They all felt real and relatable. Now, I want to talk specifically about Saeroyi and Yi Seo....I loved Park Seo Joon's character Saeroyi in the beginning. I loved his perseverance, determination, and a sense of justice he had!! Couldnt wait to see how his story would unfold and how he would prove Mr. Jang wrong in the end...however I was left unsatisified...Saeroyi seemed to mellow out half way through the show and didnt seem to make much progress in beating Mr. Jang until near the end and it really wasnt even his doing...which was a total let down...I think it would've been more satisfying if Mr. Jang wasn't sick..so that his defeat wouldve been even stronger but thats nots really important LOL!! On to Si Yeo...I was looking forward to her character as many people seemed to praise her...however she was the character that I admired the least and was annoyed by her throughout this entire series. Her character was probably one of the main reasons for me not enjoying this drama. Her confidence showed off as arrogance to me half the time. Yes, I loved that she was an assertive and intelligent female. Knowledgeable in her field, but her behavior and the way she talked to people was just not admirable for me. She always seemed to be looking down at people and insulting them in some way shape or form. If she wasn't so bossy, manipulative and clingy (specifically towards Saeroyi) I think I wouldve liked her more. To me she had very little character development, until maybe the end and even then it was still 50/50...but at least we did see she was way more professional in how she spoke to people especially friends. I honestly couldve went without any romance in this story because it didnt really seem to do anything for me at all...I didnt believe in the main couples relationship...and honestly wouldve preferred Saeroyi to stay single orrr end up with Soo Ah (even tho I knew from the beginning she wouldnt end up with him because their love/bond was just not strong...it never was...and she never was transparent with her feelings with him. )

Overall, it was an okay drama, not the best Ive seen but Im still glad I watched it but its not a drama I will rewatch. The OST THO!!! isss awesome, probably my favorite thing that came out of this drama.

A story that is full of emotions
I watched this drama solely after hearing about the acting skills of all the individual Actors that made this drama so popular and they really didn't disappoint me through all the episodes.. Each episode was fully packed with all its up and down.. And I really enjoyed the story line.. The actors were so immersed into their characters... That I was emotionally attached to them.. And the negative character played by the father and son is surely to talk about.. I totally enjoyed it..
But I did have a small wish... If the ending could have been a little better and a little impactful..

I've hesitated writing a review but the ratings are all over the place. I thought I would add my two cents. This is one of these love it or leave it genre of dramas. Although, the storyline (revenge) is a commonplace theme in different dramas this drama does an exceptional job of depicting the execution of the plan for revenge and its accompanying hardships. It started with great cliffhangers which allowed you to have a desire to return, weekly to follow the episodes. The added bonus was the highly skilled unusual (pretty and strong) female actress who plays the female lead n this drama

In this dramas, the viewer's common sense was put to the test near the end. Instead of focusing on the story the viewer would have to start asking basic questions - like why did she do this/ or why didn't he do that? or normal questions like why don't you call the Police? why are you running down a road? Or why are you out of the hospital so soon after a near-death experience? and the list becomes endless near the end and distracts away from the initial quality of the drama. For some reason, Korean writers are infamous for killing a good drama with a bad or poorly thought out ending because of the cliche culture. This is definitely the case in this drama.

Needless to say, it is still a watchable drama and worth the investment of time. As a reviewer, I was disappointed by the endless ""reflection"" moments during the end. Before I end -- I must say I was TOTALLY disappointed in the development of romance in this drama. Logic could not even save these afterthoughts of ""who in the heck writes these dramas?"" Give it a go and you will love it, leave it or be muddleheaded after finishing.

This drama got better by each ep. That doesn't mean it started as a 10/10 and became a 20/10.
It literally started at point zero. They went through all the revenge setup cliches that it was agonizing to watch, BUT it improved alot as it went by.

My favorite part was Yi Seo. I'd not have watched this if it weren't for her and I'd have totally missed this cliche yet rare gem. she was everything, strong, independent, she stood up for herself, she had alot of aegyo and though she was not ""perfect"" she did grow and improve as time went by (also she could easily kill someone and get away with it xD)
But the 2nd fl had her own charms too. They were both like parallel opposites. One was driven, and one took things slow, a little too slow :)

SRY is actually my 2nd least favorite male lead type (the 1st is of course the jerk).
He was naive. Stubborn. 1 minded. Driven by revenge. a little hard headed like a rock, BUT he didn't let that ruin or control his life, tbh this might be the most rational revenge plot ever xD
His stubbornness and 1 mindedness was also his charming point. He saw the good in people and he gave them a chance without being fickle about it. He didn't let others sway him but he did listen to the voice of reason.
This was not a romance drama nor was it a love triangle.
Sure they had a love line, and the usual 2 fls and 3 mls (ie the double triangle), but there was no rivalry. No hate. No angst. No one fought for attention, everything just happened naturally and -a little too- slowly xD.


I wonder which points were made by the drama writers and which parts where done by the webtoon writer. The development of the plot seems like a kdrama move while the well layered characters feel like a webtoon move :)
this was not plot driven or character driven, but the characters saved this from becoming another useless drama..

the ost here was gold, Lee Chan Sol, Gaho, Ha Hyeon Woo, SONDIA, Kim Woo Sung, Kim Feel and the others all set a great mood throughout the drama~


I don't rewatch dramas so it's always either a 1 or 10 :)

There are dramas that rule a time, that no matter how much time passes after it’s airing they are still reference and still talked to this day of what made them excellent. They are the classics. Full House, Boys Over Flowers, My Love from the Stars, Secret Garden, Goblin to say some of them. Now I dare telling Itaewon Class is to become one of them.
Let me try to tell you why:
Iteawon Class is a classic revenge story. Rich people destroying someone’s life just because they can, not seeing that the one suffering will do whatever necessary to make they pay. I am a sucker for revenge stories. It can make me a little bias, but it also can make me very critical and I know bullshit when I see bullshit. I can say Edmond Dantes (The Count of Monte Cristo) would be proud of Park Seruyi.
I.C. has all the classical aspects of a revenge story but it is made so fresh, everything seems new and surprising. The way the plot is constructed is so well made, the pace is on point, everything is done so perfect, not one minute of this drama is boring. And the clefhangers, it gave me goosebumps and anxiety problems. This is the King drama of clefhangers, just to let you know.
About the acting… Lets honestly talk about Park Seo Joon.
I choose to watch this drama simply because I wanted to watch something fun and I can always have fun watching Park Seo Joon, that's why I began to watch it, you can see that I really like him, but he is an actor of one only character. I’m saying he is a bad actor, no, Marilyn Monroe was an actress of one character and no one can say she was a bad actress.
The problem with this situation is that it can be a hit or miss in a drama, Fight My Way was spot on great, What is Wrong with Secretary Kim was not, let’s be honesty here we watched it for the eyecandy (:/). And on I.C. it was just on the line, good, not great I can think of actors the would do a better job being Park Seruyi, but Park Seo Joon doesn’t disappoint. He does not because the real Queen in this drama was Kim Dami as Jo Yiso.
I felt that everything on this drama was made for her to shine. We went back every week to watch her, to see what she was gonna do, she was the star. And truly for half of Iteawon Class I thought she was the second lead girl, I just convinced myself when I rewatched the trailer and saw that Soo Ah is not featured there.
This drama made the annoying segund lead girl, she is a bitch, follow the guy around even if he does not like her, hates and torment the girl the guy is in love with. She is everything we supposed to hate, but here we are on her side, we cheers for her, we choose her. This is the reason why Iteawon Class will be a classic.
On everyone else, everybody does a great Job… Nara as Oh Soah, Ryu Kyung Soo as Choi Seung Kwon, Yoo Jae Myung as President Jang… man, this man can act, I could empathise with him, even him as a villain.
One thing I want to talk about too, is about Lee Joo Young as Ma Hyun Yi a transgender character, I have to applaud Korea, being a very conservative country, having a saying, a very small, but present saying in this discussion so current all over the world. I see on this a new step for more diversity in Korean dramas and it gets me excited.
And for the last the ending, it was a little bit more slow than the rest of the drama, but there were one scene the final conclusion the winned it all me. And even if there are a lot of people who did not agree with me, I loved this drama, truly.

If it wasn't for who Seo Ro Yi are with at the end the drama would get 10/10 from me, but in this situation she has 1/10 because she really got on my nerves, honestly, she might not be in drama and even be killed, I would not be offended for that.

Apart from this one aspect, the drama is really brilliant. Hats off to the writers, actors and everyone involved in the production of this drama, except Jo Yi Soe, she really ruined my opinion about the drama and the drama itself.

Generally interesting view of life. I think this is a real life drama

It started really well, I was really invested in the beginning. The revenge plot, the romance that's so close yet so far, an impressive girl to pursue the guy, and the interesting side characters, really gripped my attention in the beginning.
However, after a while, Sae Royi and Oh Soo's romance started becoming stagnant, did not move forward at all, the character of Yi Seo in the beginning was cool and independent, but she just became needy and selfish later (although on a side note, she gets the guy so maybe we should aspire to be like her, lol).
What I hated the most was romance part, Sae Royi and Yi Seo didn't even make sense (every boss might as well start marrying their efficient secretaries) . Being grateful and falling in love are very different things but this movie blurred the lines between that. This was the breaking point for me. It might sound silly but to me romance in a story is of importance, not as high as the plot (which was interesting in the beginning but towards the end, I started losing interest) itself but without an attention-grabbing love story, and a lethargic plot, I just decided to drop it but not before watching the last scene so I'd know how it ended.
Not rewatching it, but I loved Park Seo Jun (I firmly believe the character he played was at fault, not the actor)
P. S. You could try watching and form your own opinions, mine might've been a bit biased coz I don't like stories where a new girl succeeds in breaking apart an already established couple.

Well, first we examine the problems that people reapet and then a general reveiw.
The common drawbacks are:
1. There is no personality such park sae ro yi.
2. Why didn't the sae ro yi's hairstyle change after 11 years?
3. Why get out of the car at the end of episode 14 and worse, hug each other?
4. It was a cliché hostage!
5. How did Hyun Yi become a chef?

((Because these questions are very repetitive, I would like to explain my point of view in detail))

1.
For example, do zombies really exist? (Kingdom 2019)
Is Gandalf in the real world? (Lord of the Rings 2001)
Do people die in reality, do they steal in their sleep, or is the food of the whole world corn? (Inception 2010 -interstellar 2015)
We have rome of Subconsciously dreams? (Stalker 1979)
In fact, can humans go back to 1700 or 1500?
(Midnight in Paris 2013)
Does in our planet We have a fish that become a monster that breathes out of sea?
(The Host 2006)

Well, these are some of the most famous and highest level productions, and popular directors like Christopher Nolan, great directors like Bong Joon Ho and Woody Allen, and directors who are among the top two or three in history like Andrei tarkovsky.

Surely you are saying that all of them are fantasy or science fiction, but the Itaewon class is a drama and realistic, so it doesn't suit him.

Well, I have to say that we have a style that a combination of fantasy and realism is called magical realism!
But… This series is not magical realism at all!
I just wanted to say that there is such a style, and for example, kill me heal me has such a genre, that is, in the real world, with real rules, but a couple of motifes are unrealistic in it.

Now that itaewon class is not magical realism, then how is it realistic ?!

So is there a guarantee that there will be no person like sae ro yi in the world?
No, we don't have the Innocent people, but we do have the people that have a little negative morals and the park sae ro yi were the same.

2. Well, when do people's hairstyles change when they change themselves; For example, in classic movies, whenever women cut their hair short, it means that they are tough and their personality getting cold.
Well, we see that from the beginning, the sae ro yi and Jang Deh-hee do not change, but the others change to accompany them.
For example, yi seo, which could not be changed at all, she changed because of the sae ro yi, but on the other hand soo ah, she did not change, and their destiny became that.
(You may say why the sae ro yi should not be changed and turned upside down. First of all, this could be the opposite and it could have been the opposite. Now it doesn't matter, but let's calculate that the sae ro yi was a symbol of good behavior. …)
Or Jang Deh Hee didn't change and his son became like him to be with him.

3. So tell me, what difference does it make if the car is looking for a car or a person?
You just saw that sae ro yi made Jang Gion Won's car have to go a long way and he had a plan and the time to buy… You say why they hugged each other in that sensitive moment… Well, we knew that this is just a drama, but In fact, they are close to death and sae ro yi probably want to say something that has been in his heart for a long time , and his feelings become uncontrollable, and… Incidentally, this scene, which we think is stupid, is like a real person. Foolish moment!

4. First of all, tell me what is your favorite series?
If you want to try to say Kdrama's avangard, you probably say, ""My Ajusshi or Mr. Sunshine its probably the answer of 80%. ""
Do you want me to tell these clichés?
Stereotypes are not a negative in themselves; How long did it take for the hostage-taking to end?
Maybe half a episode.
Well, no matter how much you write a new product, there are similarities with something and somewhere.

5. Well in ep 4:
You see, when yi seo want to show her abilities to be hired, she turns to park sae ro yi and says:
What kind of food is your specialty?
- we carefully came up with every recipe, but we dont realy have a specialty.
The camera in the fridge or freezer or whatever, Hyun yo and yi sro in front of the fridge.
Hyun Yi: i organized it yesterday. Its all clean.
Yi seo: we dont need many things on the menu.
Jusy have one specialty and use two or three overlapping ongredients to keep losses to a minimum.
.
.
.
Well, you see, now it makes more sense that Hyun Yi has succeeded with repetition and effort because they have limited their list.

This is from this.

What else can I tell you?

The Park Seo Joon, Kim Da Mi, Nara, Yo Jae Myung, Anh Bo Hyun , are all currently running in Baeksang.
I mean, the whole series is almost nominated, and we have to see what happens.
Do I need to tell you more about acting?

The director of the series has been nominated, but since it is difficult for you to understand the difference between a good director and others:

See the first part of ep 4 the conversation between the sae ro yi and Gion Won. First, Gion Won comes with pride to make fun of the sae ro yi but...

So director how show me sae ro yi's Self Confidence and geon won's stress with camera?


Exactly at the end of episode 15, when he kneels ; It slows motion and keeps that beautiful movement going, and more importantly, the camera slowly goes to sae ro yi, and somehow admires it by going to it and approaching it!

End of episode 11
How effective was the silence we saw at the time of the confession?


Tell more about the script and its details?
The fact that he puts Yi Seo and Soo ah in the cafe in front of each other and marks.

Sae ro yi open up his heart to yi seo in ep4...
Why did he tell yi seo what he didn't do to soo ah all the time?
Becuase he feel comfortable around her.
Should I talk about music?

Music?
You mean, like, all these records aren't enough for gaho and v?
It's okay to serve you. I have to say that at the Baeksabg Festival, they have a special technical awards , and the Itaewonclass is nominated for its music.
Basically, you go and listen to the itaewon class from the album of soundtrackthe whole series will be reviewed for you.

We have how many marking and motif like ""how does it taste?""
How many times have you seen such a beautiful motif in Kdrama before?

Just big wow
I watched some dramas and i had my faves but Itawon Class just kicked them out. It was literally the best drama I watched.. everything was so on point! And those details.. I'm-
It's the first drama ever that made me thinking about it more than after few hours.
I already miss all this characters so I'll do rewatch and I think I'll make more than one rewatch, no scam..

I love it so much, it's maybe because i feel so conected to main characters cause I share some of their characters.

Anyway it's really worth it to watch drama.
Definitelly!

Very good, character led drama. I'm somewhat glad that this drama did not heavily rely on romance, which is something that I like in my dramas.
The first couple of episodes are boring, but they are just setting up the backstory and introducing the characters. Once that’s done, things start to get interesting!
The characters are well written, and I enjoy that they each have an episode that has a larger focus in them and how they connect to the plot!
The plot is pretty interesting but sometimes gets lost. I did enjoy the suspense of wondering what someone is going to do next and how the DanBam crew is going to handle it together.

I love this series! No doubt why this series is on top of the list in Netflix! The story reminds me of my dream.


Actually this is my first time to watch a Korean Series in Netflix. Yes, I doubt and hesitate at first but I've found out my self keep on watching, not minding about what episode watching on the process.

This series brought me to a different point of view and realizes how KDrama conquered the Asianovelas.

Looking forward to watch more and wonderful series! Fighting!

What made Itaewon Class a well made drama? Well undoubtedly its representation of clichéd storyline enamored by moralistic blanket and the well written characters. Adapted from a renowned webtoon of the same name, the main attraction of the drama was the main lead character played by Park Seo Joon who was socially awkward but undyingly loved sticking with his values and principles taught by his father. He was the perfect epitome of an altruistic person who by their magnanimous attitude towards his/her surroundings are able to win uncountable hearts. They are considered the gem of a human who can go to any extent to save their loved ones.

The whole story started with one utmost tragic turning point of PSJ’s life which ultimately led him to the success he always desired. The main moral of the story depicted was that whatever it is if people are put forth foremost before anything then any venture will be successful. Greed, arrogance, self-absorption in the end engulfs into nothingness. PSJ’s character was an overall package of level headedness, gritty, charismatic and an undaunted true leader. A true leader tries to encourage and motivate people under him/her which this character exactly portrays. All the other characters both the antagonists and protagonists have their own story to share but the focus was mainly the lead male protagonist who after facing plethora of hurdles thrown at him by his enemies could get out of it scathed but much stronger than before. The more he faced the trials and tribulations of life the grittier he became in achieving his goal. The point is to portray that life for each and every living human soul would throw lemons but we have to know how to make lemonade out of it.

Moreover, this drama through another characteristic of the main lead’s character portrayed that not necessarily every single person has to gain higher education. Without gaining much education, having right attitude, morals, values and righteousness it is possible to reach any apex in life, of course with the help of some true companions. Sae Ro Yi (main character played by PSJ) had some wonderful people working for him who turned into his family members. His love interest is also one woman among them.

Next about the two female leads, the one PSJ chose is one of the best written female characters in the history of Korean dramas. Never have I seen a female character given so much empowerment, strong self-determination, confidence and free spirit like the character Jo Yi Seo. Without a single regret she always chose her destination exactly responding to her mind. It is interesting to watch how she accomplishes her goal as per her set target. She was shown as a bit eccentric unsocial person yet she was sacrificial for the one whom she truly loved with pure dedication. Her self interest never stumbled on her way since she made that one single person her final target.

Although the story is nothing new about the same old subjugation and corruption by the rich to the poor strata of the society but the interesting part of this drama which made it truly beautiful are the characters. More or less it can be referred as a character based drama. PSJ was the scene stealer in every single of his expressions and dialogue throwing. It is undoubtedly his best performance so far. Dedication is evident from his natural acting skill. Truly commendable job he has done. The rest of the ensemble cast did justice to their roles but PSJ overshadowed everyone.

This drama through the various characters had basically tried to teach and preach about maintaining humane quality no matter what and to remain honest irrespective of hardships of life. The moral and philosophical base of the story is quite strong.

Although it has gained humongous popularity so there’s no harm in watching it if you haven’t yet watched it.

I watched this entire series with my mother when everyone is required to stay at home. Nara was so beautiful, but I saw chemistry between saeroyi and the manager when they were still starting to grow the business. From episode 4 I already knew they will end up together. I also knew that it will all end with him having a sweet soju taste. The only thing I wasn't able to predict was Nara starting a fine dining restaurant.

Acting and cast was perfect for the lame storyline so I was able to bear with it. It's well worth the watch.

Life is marked by tribulations, but we must grow and mature.
This drama give me thrills. Its not your average drama and the characters are interesting. Look - there's people here who complain about the ""wooden"" characters and don't realise that the acting is a reflection of the writing. This is based of webtoon and Park Seo Joon stoicness IS a defining character trait that his character has to work around and he does try despite how uncomfortable and messy it was (as how growing up is in real life). People forget there was a a total of 10 years time skip and the character did not just did a 180 per se, I've gathered a character analysis of mine and other thoughts of their developement below. You need to think about it that way, they had to fit a webtoon into 16 episodes. And believe me, I know they could have gone to at least 30 episodes with the amount of character growth, but they did the best with what they have and made the series drama length. The writing, acting, story was good, and worth the watch.

Here both the main leads are opposite in personality yet bonded with one thing in common, and their choices in own journey is what brings them together. This is a drama about the underdog and the usual heroic traits that is emodied by Park Sae Ro Yi through his usual determination and stoicness and his unbending to his principles despite the tragedies he face. The main story is about how he will accomplish the hard task of beating down Jangga Co, headed by Chairman Jang. However he is not an infallible hero and soon, encountering many life lessons, from people in his past and present, the Dan Bam crew, Yi Seo, Soo Ah, the brothers, through pursuing his revenge, they come to understand what is most important in their life and how much you can change your life with just the choices you make.

No character here is perfect. And this is its main strengths. There are so many themes explored: what being true to yourself costs, is it worth doing it if it hurts others (no matter how you try not to get others involved), how parents shape their child, what life is all about, and what is important in the end. This drama allows you to experience many emotions and its this that make the crew stronger and wiser. Here, a hero becomes a real human, that needs to be grounded in life and be shrewder to actually accomplish his objectives. And to navigate all of the traps set by his enemies requires planning, strategy and patience. Our hero may have patience but the writers are honest in showing that he needs others to be his second set of eyes and to teach him his on what he is lacking, and the fact is, he can't do it alone. They need each other to be successful and only after that, is he able to defeat his enemies, and the for him, closure over his own tragedies in what he calls, ""his endless nights"".

The acting was good, casting was great, and writing, pacing, direction was well done and music represents their struggle well, I love V's theme.

Some of the weaknesses of this drama: The main evil person is SO evil, that his character never for once causes us to takes his words seriously even IF there an element of truth because we all think ""oh, he is manipulating us again"" The writers don't give him a real chance to show us his inner thoughts other that this character really is beyond salvation. We all dislike him because that make him easy to hate. Despite that he has a story of how he was poor and wanted to feed his family to make the business, we don't understand WHY he became such a ugly character. And then the show hints that aw, he started from the bottom like Sae Ro Yi, but doesn't go on to show anything else. So he serves as just a shadow of maliciousness waiting for SRY to meet him at the final boss battle. His premise leaves a lot of questions to be explored.

Also some of the themes did NOT have time to be expressed well. Like the transgender issue, racial issue, bullying issue. There was many themes just jampacked in a show of only 16 episodes which could have fit more. I understand maybe the main story wasn't enough to also fit in the new themes while avoiding filler episodes so there's that. It would have been better to leave it out then because stories like Tony and the grandma side story and also his time in prison and the gangster history was also left to dust. Similarily, the love story and IC's growth also had potential to do more instead of the 10 year time skip which is a lot, but still I felt they knew to prioritise those two stories the most and it showed. The 2 main stories they did choose to develop, developed well despite the rush and was a fresh take that Kdrama land needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Yiseo and Saeroyi relationship:

I like the dynamic between Sae Ro Yi and Yi Seo. They are similar in personalities, but one distinct difference is that he stands by his conviction even when he gets punished for it, while YiSeo reminds me of Ying Luo from Story of Yanxi Palace; cunning, intuitive, resourceful, intelligent but with a heart of gold.

Where SRY's philosophies and kindness puts him in a position where he ends up being the 'suffer in silence' type, YiSeo has no such qualms in striking back AND gets away with it, even if her audacity [or recklessness] gets her into trouble.

I like that she chose him; to support and protect him from that particular weakness [helplessness against injustice] that he has, how they balance each other's outlook in life literally like Yin and Yang; her rash, apathetic attitude with his wisdom, his destructive temper with her cool-headed shrewdness. The fact that this time it was a female lead that was the rock in the relationship, the one pursuing the guy and staying by his side.

I'm not really sure why people expect PSY to make a total 180. He has never been good at expressing his emotions and showing his affection towards others. We've seen how much he loves Yiseo by how much he shares with her, how honest he is with her. It may not be the most exciting way to show it but it's realistic to his character.

The start was promising, but. Eh?
To be honest, I just wasted my time with this show.
Now I am bias because im a BIG freak for romance shows and this barely had any nor made sense.
People ship Soo-ah and Saeroyi, yet I don't. Soo-ah put herself before anybody else. She knew Saeroyi liked her yet never accepted his feelings and kept leading him on? I also thought her personality was a bit boring. Nothing special with her.
Now the main couple, Yi-seo and Saeroyi. Made no sense to me. Seemed force tbh. Since Episode 7 I was thinking, ""Why does Yi-seo even love Saeroyi in the first place"" as they barely spent any time together. Saeroyi was also in love with Soo-ah so theirs no moments with Yi-seo and Saeroyi. Also, Yi-seo's character is some what eh to me. She isn't my favorite but I didn't like her attuite when it came to some people.
The acting was average and good. Nothing mind-blowing. I do love Park Seo-Joon as that's the reason WHY I even considered watching this drama, but. Wasn't worth it.
Music isn't mind blowing either. It's average aswell, I only liked the outro music and sometimes the intro music. Also thing I love this drama for is whoever decided to cast the guy for Toni. First Kdrama I've seen with a person of color!
Unless you just need something to watch or you're into revenge dramas with slow romance then go for it. This show wasn't THAT bad but I defo am not going to rewatch this show unless I just need a blast from the past or what not.

I am not a film critic but I am a picky viewer from Canada. After watching Crash Landing on Netflix , I needed to watch the next best thing and I heard about this show. The story of Itaewon class is unique which featured social issues in Korean setting.
ALL the casts were amazing in acting ! You can feel how they delivered their role in a true to life scene. Having a plot of revenge , courage , friendship, love is integrated in every scene. Park Seo-Joon as Saero-yi was able to reach his goal and ended up still the good loving son, friend and kept his true feelings for the woman he loved. I think it was love at first sight when he first laid eyes on Yi-seo who happened to contribute a lot in his quest for happiness.Hey, age does not matter ! Kwon Nora was a great support till the end . Like anybody else wished , she should have a part two story with the new chef who she finds amazing . Kim Da-mi role was strongly delivered with fierce and humor in the name of pure intention to help her great love Sae-ro-yi. And their love story totally worked for me. It is sweet and great relief that finally they will experience happiness together. The pup casts were great supporting role , each of them have their own story to tell. One thing that also caught my attention was the great acting villian roles of Jangga Group father and son. Ahn_Bu hyun delivered a superb role as a son who longed for his father love and trying desperately maybe the girl he really liked can still love him who was Kwon Nora. Great story! Music was really cool and cinematography was at par. For those who said the story was dragging, I don't think so. Here in Canada there is subtitle, so it's easy for me to read it in a good pace. Well done IC.

What a breath of fresh air!
Likes: The character of Yiseo and Kim Da Mi playing her. Park Seo Joon's...well...everything. The Itaewon setting and vibe of the drama. The great emotional acting.

Dislikes: the 2nd half of the drama sort of lost it's way. the time lapse to the future where everything sort of wraps up neatly in 1 episode type of thing. The cliche sub stories to advocate diversity.

It's so rare to come across really cool female leads that are smart, mean, and likeable. I love the character of Yiseo for not pretending to be nice, for being smart, strong and confident, and being able to fight for herself. And I love the actress Kim Da Mi that plays her. I remember watching the Witch Part 1 and asking who is this kick ass actress that blows me away with her natural acting? And again she doesn't disappoint in this drama. She is definitely one to watch.

Park Seo Joon really blew me away with his intense emotional scenes in this drama. I've always thought of him as a great actor, but he really shined in this one. It's a memorable character with a memorable haircut. :-)

I loved that they set this in Itaewon as it's almost it's own character, but I thought that they were trying too hard to be diverse and hip. If you are going to try to open up minds, then you should flesh out the sub stories better instead of going down a cliched route. The first half of the drama was so good, but the second half I felt the story sort of lost it's way. Overall though, I did like it...just wish it could have been a little tighter.

I was hooked from the start. Yes, the plot does involve the usual drama between a rich family vs handsome main lead. The main lead, Saeroyi, is admirable. His tenacity, stubbornness, and ability to continue to persevere through all the obstacles that have been thrown at him by Jangga's Chairman and his oldest son is what eventually will win your heart. Even at times from his only childhood friend and love interest, Soo-A. She was the only other person aside from his father he had on his side. But, the more you watch the more you find yourself joining Saeroyi's fighting spirit, fighting! In addition, to an entertaining plot I think the drama added something very valuable to kdramas, a diverse cast from various backgrounds. There were some underlying issues that surfaced with this drama that weren't necessarily part of the main plot but I'm sure resonated with many viewers. Part of these struggles were faced by two of the main cast members Hyun-yi who identifies as transgender and Tony, a darker skin Korean. Additionally, two of the team members including the main lead himself were ex convicts. Yi seo's battle with mental health concerns and counseling were also briefly touched upon. I would also like to add, though I do not agree with all of the actions taken by both female leads. I truly enjoyed seeing strong independent female roles instead of the norm of the pretty girl tearing up at every other scene.
Whilst the plot is centered and focused on revenge, you are able to feel for each character as they also battle their own personal problems and lean on each other. Even with some of the challenges in terms of the business/revenge plot being a little generic this is by far not your typical K-drama. If you are looking for something refreshing to watch, this is it.

I really liked this drama because of the revenge idea. Also, the main characters were really motivating and strong, with unique personalities. I also really liked the idea that someone who started off with nothing built his way into being a top pub globally! The cast did a great job on this, and the music is also pretty good. The rewatch value is not that high because if you watch it again, the suspense and the build-up of the plot isn't the same as the first time. I would definitely recommend watching this!

GIVE IT A SHOT!
To start off, this story is a complete cliche. Just a normal revenge plot with a complicated love triangle. But that's where the negative aspects of the show end. (even though many might consider it enough to drop the show, I suggest all give it a try)

I absolutely loved Itaewon Class as a whole. It had everything I was looking for in a Kdrama and more. First off, this drama isn't much on romance. Even though I mentioned earlier that it has a complicated love triangle, the romance aspect of this show is close to nil, which I really appreciate for some reason (considering the fact that I'm a huge romantic, it surprised me that I came to like it). The charm of this show lies in the bonds of friendship and trust the characters share among themselves. The loyalty, the hard work and the genuine nature of each character won me over and what topped it all off was the perseverance of the main lead. The female lead was so cocky and imperfect but so raw as a human being. No one is perfect with the way they think and the character of the female lead proved that right. I had mixed opinions on various characters throughout the course of the drama but in the end, I was able to make a firm decision on all of them.

The acting was definitely incredible. Especially the actors who played the antagonists were really good at what they did. The OST of this drama is worth going on everyone's playlist that every track suited the scenes they played it along with.

The plot could have been better but the number of laughs and smiles that came out of me and the anxiety the show gave me makes up for all the plot holes I came across.

Definitely worth a watch.

Starts off really well and then...
I honestly loved this drama at the start, every Friday, I couldn't wait to go back home and watch the new episodes. And then it became really boring and stereotypical. Also I just couldn't stand some characters. I especially didn't like Kwon Nara's character.

Some parts of the story were also really hard to believe i.e. Tony's heritage, the whole thing with Hyeon-yi, like couldn't they simply hire a real trans actor? They wanna be inclusive, but on their own terms.

The acting towards the end was also not convincing at all, I really don't believe that he liked her after years of shunning her,

Overall it's a good drama but you probably wouldn't be missing it out on a lot if you drop it halfway through.

Great idea. Average execution.
I think I should begin by of course applauding this drama for its activism, if it can be labelled as that. Kim Tony was a surprising addition to me, as I've never really seen a kdrama get so far into how black people are treated in SK. It was interesting, but only really dealt with in like 1 or 2 scenes and then Tony's character was doomed to fade into the background. I then have to talk about Hyun Yi, the transgender MTF character in the series. The actress is stunning, and was very good at making me feel for her character too. I loved her scenes, although I think at the end she ultimately met the same fate as Toni and faded into the background, as I guess her character was not deemed as important to expand on as the dreaded love triangle (square? more?). Another shame.

Onto the main actors. Park Seo-Joon did amazingly well from the very start. His ""crying"" scenes pulled me out of it at times, but that's a minor criticism. The revenge plot is what had me so invested in this drama and what ultimately stopped me from dropping it a few episodes early, and it was ultimately the acting chops of Seo-Joon, Geun Won and Jang Dae Hee that had me on the edge of my seat at many times. The two villains were excellent at making me want to punch them both in the face. Perhaps a bit lame in how typically ""evil"" they were, but a joy to watch all the same. I only wish the drama had focused a little more on their storylines, especially towards the very end of the drama.

Jo Yi Seo and Oh Soo Ah. When Yi Seo came on the scene, I honestly loved her. She seemed very bad-ass. Shame they completely destroyed her character and made her into a lovesick fool, much like Sae Ro Yi. I don't even want to talk about the love triangle too much, as it annoyed me to no end. It took over all other plot by the end and made everything else seem unimportant. Sae Ro Yi rejects Yi Seo all series long and shows no genuine interest in her, then in the course of 30 minutes falls irreversibly in love with her and coldly rejects the woman he's held on a string for the past 15 years, proceeding to have flashback upon flashback of their time together (I've already watched the series - I don't need to see it all again in flashbacks when we're reaching the climax of the show?) and seemingly leave all his dreams of revenge behind for her all of a sudden. The actors also show no real chemistry, making the pairing cringe-worthy to say the least. I actually ended up wanting him to be with Soo Ah, especially after finding out she'd spent the last 10 years compiling information to help the guy who just threw her to the side like she meant nothing lmao.

I can't keep going on like this or I'll be here all day. To summarise, the revenge plot is a great one and the drama starts of very well, but as usual with many many dramas, the awful romance overtakes it and ruins the character development of all characters involved (I refuse to discuss Geun Soo, my baby). I definitely wouldn't re-watch this, although i will say i rated it so highly for its really good start. plus the ost.

It was great, then it was a little what the fuck?
I watched this for mainly 2 reasons: 1. Park Seo Joon 2. Everyone kept saying how great this show was.

And not gonna lie. It IS great.

It keeps you hooked to the end. However, it seems to have very high standards as a kdrama, but the last two episodes were kinda... what? NO SPOILERS, but some things that happen in the last 2 episodes are a bit... unrealistic and weirdly plotted.

But the ending is great, so if you're unsure on whether to watch it, I'd say watch it and judge for yourself!

So going in i guess i wasn't expecting anything.I watched this drama without knowing what all the hype was about. I won't make this review super long.Just the main points.
STORY:It was a refreshing break from the usual rom-coms and a pretty impressive story i would say. Though some elements of the story may seem unrealistic (like come on how convenient that a ex-convict with little education ends up finding a bad-ass genius who willingly helps him) , it's a show after all i guess. I did find what happens in the last few episodes wholly unnecessary though i guess the makers decided to wrap up the very long revenge saga in this way. I do wish it had been done better but we can't have everything.

CHARACTERS: I actually love the characters. There are the good ones ,the straight out villains,the struggling with conscience villains and the gray characters that belong nowhere,much like in reality. I did feel like some of the characters had potential to be much more(Yes I'm talking about Kim Da Mi) . But overall they did a pretty good job of showing the struggles and development of most of the characters.

MUSIC: If the osts aren't wholesome and true to the theme of the drama i don't know what is. I honestly still listen to the playlist to this day. It's my go to when i want to give up and need to push myself. I love the music. The ending song being sung by V is just another unexpected sweet addition to an already spectacular playlist.

So a lot of people had problem with the romance track in this drama. But i personally liked it. For the most part atleast. You guys have to remember that romance is not the main theme. So obviously there wasn't much of it. A lot of people said that the good story was ruined by needless romance but one of the things i actually admired about this drama was the fact that it didn't let romance interfere with the characters goals. Ambition always took the front seat and the romance was mostly bonding. Overall i would say it's a good watch.

As to rewatch value, I will definitely go back to watch the revenge sequence if not the whole drama whenever i want to get all fired up

Favorite kdrama of all time
I LOVED this kdrama and I will never shut up about it.
If you‘re contemplating about watching it, I‘ll encourage you to do so right now!

Story
This story had me hooked and emotionally invested from the first episode until the very end. It was an emotional rollercoaster that had me laughing, crying, and shaking out of anger. I could feel so much empathy and sympathy with Park Saeroyi and just wanted him to fulfill his dream and finally be happy in the end. Another thing I really liked about this drama is that it talked about topics that aren‘t frequently talked about in Kdramas like racism or transsexuality.

Characters/Cast
The cast in this drama was great and Park Seo-joon really killed it with this role. His acting was amazing and so authentic I literally had to remind myself that this is just a role. The side characters were all very unique and interesting and lastly the villains in this one were very well casted and never failed to make my blood boil.

Scenery
This drama and all of its beautiful scenes really made me fall in love with Itaewon. It just really shows the unique charme of this part of Seoul.

OST
Itaewon Class might have one of the best OSTs of all time. The songs were perfect and just so fitting for the drama that just hearing any of them makes me emotional.

No other kdrama has ever moved me as much as Itaewon Class did and I rewatched it like 3 three times already. 10/10.

Corporate Politics: Cover-Ups: Revenge, and Pubs. All ingredients in a surprisingly satisfying show.
*Spoiler Free Section*

Itaewon Class was as someone else put it - trying very hard to be relevant. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this drama. It has seeped into me and has been on the forefront of my mind for the past few days of watching. There were plot twists I didn't expect, there were characters who changed in ways I never thought were possible and there were character archetypes done in a well-rounded manner, one I've rarely seen to this standard. However, I cannot disregard the earlier statement. Yes, it tried very hard to be relevant but I think it worked.

Itaewon Class is a corporate political thriller with a sprinkling of romance, action, drama and bright-coloured lights. Within was a well-balanced cast with great representation. There were a few questionable scenes but overall the show proved to be a great, diverse, well cast well-acted and well-filmed piece of work. I believe that this show will be another that's on the top 10 lists for years to come. And though it is not perfect it is entertaining and enjoyable nonetheless.

The male lead, Park Saeroyi, is an empathetic/morally high kinda character. As we watch him through his life we are attached to his unwavering personality, revengeful dreams, and heartbreaking struggles. The supporting cast of characters is a melting pot of people with their own struggles that found their anchor in Saeroyi. Each one is unique in its own regard and each back story is heartbreaking and heartwarming. I rooted for some whilst I hexed others, and I found myself at the end of the show on teams I never expected I would be on. This show managed to make me doubt my understanding of characters and the written word, some scenes shocked and others were exactly how I would have written them. It was a fun watch and there were times where I was genuinely on the edge of my seat or crying for the characters.

The love V between three of the characters was bitter and annoying at times. At least for me. But it resolved itself sweetly at the end and in a very nice way that will be stuck in my head whenever I write another romance story. It was another blind lead type of romance where everyone else knew his feelings yet he did not know his own, until about 15 hours in... despite that though, it was enjoyable to watch and progress.

I was satisfied with the ending of this show. There are a lot of shows out there with endings that are not satiating. This was one, in my opinion, was not one of them. This show satisfied me and I'm glad it did. Sixteen off hours not wasted. It's a quality show that deserves some hype.

If you enjoyed Uncanny Counter, K2, etc. This may just be right up your street. Give it chance if you need something to watch.





*Spoilers in the form of quotes and rants*

1) The beginning and the last episode. I thoroughly enjoyed the build-up of one scene created in the first episode when Yi-Seo is talking to her councillor and the conversation regarding death between Saeroyi and Yi-Seo comes to light. It's well done as it paints him to be merciless and cold when in reality he is the polar opposite. And when at the end you find out the full conversation it's because both of them have found their true selves and have come to an understanding as we (the audience) have just watched that journey unfold; we now seeing it again highlighted to us. The parallels there work brilliantly.

2) When Yi-Seo and Guen-Soo got kidnapped I was certain he was going to die to save her. I'm actually disappointed that no character died in the last two episodes as it was, in my opinion, a) the right time to have done it and b) kinda implied. Though, Yi-Seo's escape was very fitting with her character, using Guan-Soo.

3) Yi-Seo. I loved her character. 79% chance she is a sociopath. I would have loved her to have had more sociopathic tendencies though and for the writer to have kept on that line a bit more. Not saying she couldn't have loved Saeroyi as that is 100% plausible, I just think more should have occurred. I also loved the scene where she used Guen-Won and recorded his confession. She was the MVP of this show in my opinion.

4) Soo-Ah annoyed me throughout the show. I hated her. Until. She pulled out the evidence against Jangga. Co. I just could not believe that she could work them after what Chairman Jang and Geun-Won did to Mr. Park. I was raging most of the show watching her help Jangga Co. But now, I see it was a brilliant way to blind the viewer to Soo-Ah's true intention of bringing Jangga Co down herself even if that wasn't always the case or was the last resort it was always something she was willing to do. She just needed the right motivator. I thought Saeroyi would have offered her a job, in the end, I think it was a missed opportunity.
Quotes that I enjoyed or thought had significance. (There as translated by Netflix and are likely to be remembered or recorded wrong, my apologies if there are any mistakes). But I like how she ended.

5) Hyun-Yi and Choi and Toni. I like their stories. I can't say much else. I like them.

6) the background love story was sweet! Min-Jung and Byung-Hun. Loved it.

7) Geun-Soo I wanted so badly to have stayed with IC. co and beat his father at his own game alongside Saeroyi, I was completely taken aback by his character development AND how he outed Hyun-Yi. I wanted to hate him but I'm sympathetic.... still annoyed though.

Saeroyi:
'I wanted to live myself without regrets. I regret... I miss you like crazy.' (Parallels between Yi-Seo's dialogue towards him and Searoyi's feelings).
'Am I going to die there? No. I'm going to survive. I'm afraid, if anything happens to Yi-Seo, that I will really be destroyed.'
I'm already happier than I ever imagined I could be.'

Yi-Seo:
'If you die, I'll die.' (Though most of what she said was iconic).

Soo-Ah:
'I thought, as the girl who was never loved by anyone else. That I should at least cherish myself.'

Seung-Kwon:
'I didn't know what those tears meant. But I'm relieved.'

Mr. Park (Saeroyi's father):
'You can overcome anything as long as you're alive.'
'How does it taste?...[sweet] Means you had an impressive day.'

Tee.

ok! i must admit. this drama was on my watch list and i only wanted to watch it because of the transgender character but once i watched the first episode i fell in love with the actors. the acting was 10/10 and the storyline was not something out of mind. i mean i normally don't like korean romantic dramas cause i think they're cheesy a lil bit but this one had the balance and more real. there wasn't any rich and spoiled boy character only the self-made ones and seriously i learned so much from this drama. i study business and successful people's lifestyle and for sure the storyline was so good and real.
not to mention the soundtrack. Gaho is the best and i think he deserves more acknowledgment.
i already rewatched it 2 times since november and it's worth it!

A magnificient masterpiece
Itaewon Class is a drama that deserves to be watched by all. Not because I have a slight soft spot for Park Seo Joon (a sweetness to look at through his physique and acting) but because it deals with several themes that are still a problem in the world but especially in Asian culture in general (except for some points).

First of all, and this is one of the major points of the story, he tackles the problem of social classes. From the first episode, we can see that the ""weak"" are obliged to submit to the economically strongest, letting their whims pass or keeping silent in front of them. But Park Sae Ro Yi, a character played by Park Seo Joon, will prove the opposite by opposing Jang Geun Won, son of a Jagga leader. Of course, as everyone suspected, everything does not go well for him and he ends up in prison, shortly after his father's death, for beating up Jang Geun Won, the person responsible for his father's death. Then everything becomes a ""logical sequence"" of events, that is, a perpetual fight between Park Sae Ro Yi and Jang Dae Hee, the president of Jagga, all sprinkled with a love story (although this later becomes a secondary one).

Two other themes, important to me, are also discussed, one of which is particularly touching to me. Racism and transidentity. These subjects are major points in the news nowadays. Numerous movements, already existing for some time, have become much stronger in the fight against discrimination, racism, homophobia and so on. I think it's quite good that the producers have introduced these subjects into the series, making it more striking because they are still problems that society has to deal with but doesn't want to address, as if they were still taboo. Obviously, they are not the first to have addressed these facts but they have tried to have a positive impact on the current mentality. Being black or transgender does not make people less human. It has always been there and it won't stop anytime soon, so we might as well accept it and live with it.

As far as acting is concerned, there is not much to say. It was a marvel to watch. I don't think it was perfect, but overall the selection of actors was the right one. All the characters in this series brought a little extra, both the main and secondary characters, and that's pretty rare to see, especially when, in most cases, the secondary characters are only there to help out with problems that one of the main characters may have, or just bring more problems than they already have. In Itaewon Class, the secondary characters had an existence of their own, independent of that of the main characters.

Good drama held back by female leads
I really liked Itaewon Class overall. I was gripped from the first episode which is unusual for me because it often takes me a couple of episodes to really get into a kdrama. I love a good revenge drama and Itaewon class is just that, however I did sometimes get frustrated with Sae Ro Yi's blind obsession with revege but at least there's also more to the drama.

I especially liked the storyline with Sae Ro Yi's employees. His employees are a bunch of people who would have a hard time fitting into Korean society, for example; ex prisoners like Sae Ro Yi and his co worker, a trans co worker (who would've been better off being played by a trans person) and a Korean co worker with an African parent. I loved seeing their trials and tribulations and the way they're supported by Sae Ro Yi.

I thought the revenge storyline was compelling, I've seen people paint the bad guy as cartoonishly evil but I kinda enjoy some of these kinds of characters. I also think some of the other ""bad guys"" are more nuanced than the main baddie which balances him out.

Possible spoiler next paragraph, I don't know how to hide them.

I think the worst part about the drama was how the two main females were written. Oh Soo Ah is annoying in that she goes with the flow and expects Sae Ro Yi to change her life instead of doing it herself and Jo Yi Seo is so much younger than Sae Ro Yi and keeps throwing herself at him.

Even with some of the faults in the storyline I did like the actors but as I said before having a trans actor would've been an improvement. I liked the way Itaewon Class showed off the neighbourhood of Itaewon and it makes me want to visit there. The OST was pretty nice, with my favourite song being You Make Me Back by Kim Woo Sung.

Amazing, I’m speechless
I seriously didn’t expect this to have many bad reviews, and when I came here and saw them I was like O_o what why? Cause I loved the drama. Except for one ep, the whole drama was freaking amazing. The story about revenge and the love story also fit together, I admire how it isn’t made of cliches and actually focuses on all aspects of the show. I loved the suspense too, of what would happen next. The acting was great, and of course seo joon never fails to disappoint. I loved the diversity, the inclusivity and variety of different aspects too, plus the heartwarming moments, like in danbam, were just perfect. Also I wanna go to itaewon now :))

Hard Work Pays Off
His attitude and his hard work...he is such a good man with a strong goal and zeal.I don't like Soo Ah even though she has a goal she shouldn't be like that and should have supported him and been with him through his hardships and thats what people say right one will find you while you are chasing the wrong one.Yiseo is talented and supported him and been through the rough times and proved that in everyman's success there is a lady behind.A good Story doesn't require any romance but there is love.I totally liked this drama.I have seen many Park seo joon's dramas but this stand's front and now he became one of My Favorite Actor and Oppa ❤️❤️.

Pretty decent kdrama even if the unnecessary love triangle is there
So I basically decided to watch the whole kdrama on Netflix since I wasn’t able to find the Webtoon anywhere. However I’m glad I did watch the drama since the webtoon pretty much had the blandest art I’ve ever seen ngl (no offence to the artist btw). The colours and the scenery man are just stunning like seeing the breathtaking views of Seoul day and night just blows you away!

I was really enjoying nearly all the characters. It was even unique that it added in transgender character who really needed more screen time to be honest. Lee Joo Young did such a nice performance as the character! I really wanted to see more of her character and Ryu Kyung Soo‘s character together! The character I obviously couldn’t stand is Jang Geun Soo who always simping over Yiseo and just turns his back on Park Saeroyi a few times. He is like a “damsel in distress” character like for effin sake man, wipe off from the story jeez! Btw the actor who plays him is cute tho, I’ll give him that lol! To add, it’s also good to see an African man join the group too, I like the fact we have a kdrama representing diversity woop woop!!

I gotta admit the whole thing took the whole day to finish it so the length to finishing it is ridiculous. Fair warning to all who have busy lives! I really enjoyed it though like it is worth the binge! It’s emotional, funny, gorgeous, tense, nearly everything you do or don’t expect in a romance drama depending how you look at it! Just watch kg guys, it’s a decent kshow to check out if you don’t want to read the Webtoon!

Definitely one of the 10/10 drama
Amazing acting, Amazing story and plot, amazing cast.
Loved that YI Seo was the main female lead. Even though you can't tell at the beginning.
Loved the revenge.
Good guys won and bad guys got what they deserved.

It wasn't half finished nor did it leave unfinished businesses, maybe beside one minor thing, which is not that important anyway.

I rated down music because i am not interested in music. I rated down rewatch because i am not that into rewatching it. but i really enjoyed the drama. finished it in like 3 days i think. haha

A must watch!
This is one of the best Kdrama I’ve watched. When I fist heard about it I thougt it’s just another love story like other kdramas right now but when I started watching the 1st episode I can’t stop watching another episode. I also became a fan of PSJ because of his amazing acting in this drama! I love the storyline coz it’s not your typical Romantic drama, it is full of emotions! You should be emotionaly prepared when you watch it. The Soundtrack is also the best! I’ve been listening to it again and again! Love it!

I have to say that this was one of the bests dramas that I've watched until now. I was apprehensive because I feel a little disturbed with stories that are moved by a revenge plot. Nothing in particular, I just don't feel good when I saw some productions that exalt revenge as a powerful gun to confront issues. But ""Itaewon class"" showed the real face of revenge.

Seeing Park Saeroyi (Park Seo-joon) constructing his life based on injustice was a lesson. His motivations always are revenge and this made him reach great things, money, friends, respect... But even with all this, his life always was sour. He wasn't satisfact with nothing until realizing the value of his life and what really moved your heart. On the other hand, we had President Jang (Yoo Jae-myung), that started your journey with the right ambition, but in the middle of the way lost his principles and let this ambition drag him to the end of the well. Saw this journey was pretty intense and made me reflect on my own ambitions and what can move me. Still reflecting on this. Without talking about the important topics that were trate in the drama, as preconception with gender and color of skin. If here in Brazil this is topics that still are delicate, I imagine the impact of this in Korea.

But talking about the production... The recent dramas are doing a great job showing visceral things to the audience. The places, the acting, the OST... Everything was very good and impressive. I loved Kim Da-mi as Jo Yi-seo! What character! She was totally consistent and funny! I love to have a female lead that was insensitive for once, even when she was totally crazy about Saeroyi. I'm not saying that this was healthy or that I agreed with this behavior, but I thought was new entertainment between so many female leads that look the same. Recently we have the amazing Ko Mo-young on ""It's okay to be not okay"", but I still thought Jo Yi-seo more unpredictable and different.

I love the close and how they put the heal of Saeroyi as a priority. We have romance and friendship, but the peace of Saeroyi with himself was the most remarkable thing. And how this journey tasted? Just sweet!

Happiness. The warmth I share with you.
I cannot even begin to explain how heart wrenching and emotionally uplifting this drama was. This drama has to be one of the most unique ones I have watched till date and without doubt it has secured a tight spot in both my heart and rewatch list. I have watched a lot of dramas in my seventeen years of existence and this has to be one of those rare dramas that literally has everything I have wanted in a Kdrama; LGBTQ represantation, a culturally diverse cast as well as complex characters with determination. The romance between Park Saeroyi and Jo Yo-seo is just a warm little bonus that made my heart melt.

Finally
At last a kdrama with a tiny bit of romance that didnt make me want to smash my tv!!! An edgy drama with good characters, plot and the slightest bit of romance (rather than the usual absolute smothering of romance that kdramas are ruined by). Female leads didnt get all mushy and destroyed and played a stromg major role in the entire story. And best of all the cute, unlikely romantic winning female, actually got the guy in the end! Its been a long haul through a mountain of absolute dross to finally find this diamond of a series (strong girl Bong Soon at last has someone else on the podium)

Highly recommended drama!!!
This drama actually blew my mind and also changed my choice of life. The story is really good. It is actually a life son that you can learn from here. I just don't find any words to describe how good and spectacular this drama is. The casting is good, OSTs are beautiful good suiting with the drama, the storyline is good, and everything else (which I might have missed out on) is good. It actually feels like this story is an actual incident for me.

Well, I am watching this drama for 3rd time, ACTUALLY ( I aM nOt kIddInG rIghT nOw)!!???

Probably my favourite drama
Itaewon Class is... well, insane. It will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and have you bawling your eyes out and cheering within the space of 5 minutes. When I watch dramas, I don't really detect good or bad acting, so I can't really say anything about that, however, the actors make you hate their characters and love them.

I really struggle with giving low ratings to shows, but this show really deserves all of the stars I gave it. Itaewon class is not a cheery show. It has it's cheery bits, but things *do* go wrong, but it makes you cheer all that much harder when something good happens.

All in all. Watch. Itaewon. Class. You won't regret it.

Worst haircut of 2020
When I started watching Itaewon Class I didn't care for it. Not even one single bit. That's why me and my best friend with whom I was watching it gave up on it after only seeing three episodes. It's been almost a year since I stsrted this and only now was I finally in the mood to pick this up again. Surprisingly, I didn't dislike Itaewon Class as much when I started watching it. It's definitely not as bad as 2020 Emma thought it was. It's, however, not the masterpiece other people say it is. It's actually a pretty decent, entertaining, and thought provoking show but it is nowhere near as good as other kdramas I've seen (which is of course a matter of personal taste).

I definitely think that Park Saeroyi was the heart of this show. He is what made me like Itaewon Class. I honestly saw so much of myself in him, but with a better haircut. He truly wins the award of most relatable fictional character of 2021 for me. He and I are both people of principles, which isn't something people always understand. Not only did I think Park Saeroyi was a breath of fresh air, he also made me feel less lonely. A lot of times people didn't understand why I stubbornly stuck to my principles while I could have chosen an easier route. I, therefore, felt seen by the portrayal of Park Saeroyi. Besides, my heart fucking ached for him too. I truly wanted to wrap him in one huge bear hug because man did he suffer.

I also lowkey shipped Hyunyi with Seung Kwon. I thought the actors had great chemistry together and I liked how the show ended with them going on a date. That somehow felt like a full circle moment. Besides, I may be the only person on the plan who thought this but I actually thought Hyunyi was even prettier with her blue hair.

It's pretty funny how this show went from 5 stars to 8 stars to 9 stars. If I'm being honest I cried whole damn rivers when Park Saeroyi told Hyunyi she could walk away even though she didn't do anything wrong and also that she didn't have to prove to anyone who she is. That moment alone is worth 9 gold stars, right there. I mean how can you not sob because of that? As a queer person I just love this message and I simply applaud the show creators for doing this because you have no idea how many transgender people still need to hear this. I also thank them for letting Hyunyi win the contest because we need more happy queer stories.

I'm not really sure how I feel about the budding relationship between Saeroyi and Yi Seo. In the beginning I wasn't feeling them at all but slowly I started to think they might be really cute together. This was however ruined by the jump in time. I felt like that the show was finally establishing and hinting at a future romance between the main leads to suddenly talk about 4 fucking years later where they still aren't together. This Jump in time really ruined any set up the kdrama had for these two leads as a romantic pairing. I'm really upset by this. Their romance could have been so great if it wasn't for the fucking fast forward in time.

Furthermore, to state it simply: I OVERALL FUCKING HATED THE FOUR YEAR TIME SKIP. WHY... DO... KDRAMAS... KEEP... DOING... THE... TIME... JUMPS??? SERIOUSLY WAEEEE? *Insert Yeonjun from TXT going like WAE WAE WAE AWEA AWAEEEE*

Oh wait... it now went from 9 stars back to fucking 8 stars again because I'm salty as hell and fucking hate fast forwards in time. I've realised that jump in times are my most hated, loathed, disliked tropes EVER. I believe I've only liked it twice out of the bazillion times I've seen it happen (one of them was CLOY which is just overall a masterpiece and the other was weightlifting fairy).

Also, Lee David my man you truly deserve different roles. Like both in Law School and Itaewon Class you were out for revenge and helped the main characters in their quests for revenge. I mean you nailed both roles but I would like to see you portraying a different kind of character.

And don't even get me started on every characters' growth. Each one of them grew so much as a person, which I absolutely loved, but Yi Seo's personal growth was definitely the cherry on top of the cake.

Puppy Jangga Co. son was so much better as a pushover like Jo Yi Seo said. He truly became the definition of a shitty, heartless person. He truly went from adorable uwu to omg you should burn in hell person in such a short amount of time. I really wanted to see his and his family's downfall. So when that actually happened I felt like a little kid receiving s lollypop because damn those people 100% deserved to be ruined. They are the core example of why I never want to go into business and fucking hate capitalism. I truly love how vicious Saeroyi's revenge was.

Okay... in the end geun soo wasn't as bad as his father and brother. I will also never ever get iver how Yi Seo was like on three we fight and then fucking left Geun Soo. That's gold star quality right there. The same goes for the just die line.

However, what surprised me the most is that I actually didn't hate Soo Ah. I thought she was a pretty fascinating character, even though she needed to grow a freaking spine/backbone. In the end, she did grow one and became a whistle-blower. I'm honestly impressed by her now.

Jo Yi Seo was so much more prettier with the short dip dyed hair than with her boring basic black long hair. However, nothing beats Park Saeroyi's haircut. That's still the worst haircut ever.

The park bo gum cameo though, that was CUUUUUUTEE. I love how they both had cameos in each others kdramas last year, which is just the CUTEST thing ever.

Lastly, Kim Toni is the most underrated, underappreciated character ever since his smile could light up a whole freaking room. I hope I will see him in another drama soon.

Truly at last, the Taehyungie OST song had me in tears.

Overall- would recommend to everyone
I watched this drama because i had previously seen dramas with Park Seo Joon and i was interested in watching this one. I think the story was interesting to follow through most of the series. I liked how there was a continuation of a sentimental moment Saeroyi had with his father before his father passed away early on in the series, the way the wine tasted. I think it was clever how the mention of weather the alcohol was sweet or bitter also reflected how things were going in each characters life. i think there was the perfect amount of suspense in this story and there was always something going on. I actually ended up really liking the character of Jang Geun Won despite the fact that he was meant to be unlikable through the series because of his actions i pitied the character because i think it was because of family pressures and not nececerally spite.

Refreshing for me!
This drama really felt so fresh to me. I appreciated that for the most part things stayed relatively low stakes and focused on character relationships. There was some less believable aspects of the story and the character interactions, but for the most part it stayed grounded and realistic. This feels rare for a lot of dramas sometimes!

Those last few episodes after the final time jump though..... Woof. they really leaned so hard into the drama tropes! So much hospitalization, kidnappings, a coma, they did it all. It was like they strayed from the traditional drama writing for too long and they couldn't resist at the end.

Overall I thought the actors did well, I loved the music, and the story kept me interested.

IC
producing a business story drama is challenging, because professionals who will watch this series will compare it in real life even if they don't realized it.

Story: not a typical series, and it covers the other side of the food business, sure food business will require taste like the series GOURMET but IC tackles more on the side outside of the customer peripheral view and that is the decision making that a food business take (could be personal or could be purely related to emotions)

Acting: First drama series could not even imagine other actress taking the role of the pub manager,

Music: excellent soundtrack

Rewatch: series could help inspire people who are in the food business

Overall: watch it, rewatch it and watch it again, hahahha If you are into series which focus on business, this series should be on your list,

Park Seo Joon is Awesome
This was a really good series for the most part. I enjoyed the diverse cast and atmosphere. I was glad to see a character like Kim Toni and Hyun Yi.

I watched b/c of Park Seo Joon and I was not disappointed. His face emotes so well. I felt all of the pain of his character Saeroyi. I understood his single minded focus once he made up his mind to get revenge. Loved when he finally realized that living to hate someone is not living at all and only existing.

I really loved the cast and everyone played their roles well. I love the actor that plays Chairman Jang. Such a ruthless and manipulitive guy. Leading by fear and power. Very different from other roles he's been in that I've seen. He was in Hwarang and he was one of my favorite people. Here he was the worst. Rasing his oldest son, Geun Won to be that way never teaching him right from wrong and pitting him against his younger brother, Geon soo... WOW!!! Geun Won never accepted responsibilities for his actions.

I really liked the actor playing Seung Kwon too. See what a little faith can do for someone.

I really didn't like either FL and didn't want either to be with Saeroyi but it is what it is.

Hated Her, but Loved the Story
A friend and I were talking about Kdramas, and she mentioned how sometimes with dramas, it feels like we watch them knowing they will come to an end. But occasionally, you come across a drama that is so good, that you become so immersed and invested in the story, that instead of knowing the end will come, you become so focused on the fact that you need to know what happens next. Instead of you just watching to pass the time, it’s as if you are almost living in their world and need to know how things are going to finish. I knew exactly what she was talking about, I had not found a drama like this since earlier this year, but Itaewon Class was something else. There has yet to be a show that I have watched with Park Seo Joon that I did not enjoy. Though there were aspects of the show I thought it could do without, overall, I still quite enjoyed the show. I looked forward to every episode and was so invested in the characters’ lives that I needed to know how things were going to ultimately end.

Female Leads 1 & 2: To be blunt, I do not think this show needed the romance aspect, I would have enjoyed the show so much more without it. Honestly the female leads, Jo Yi Seo and Oh Soo Ah, were reasons I almost dropped the show. I thought that each one of their characters were so annoying, I don’t even know which one I liked more because of how much I disliked them both. I don’t think I have ever come across a show where I truly did not like the female leads, I hated them. Jo Yi Seo is an irresponsible sociopathic child. You could say young adult but common really? It’s mentioned the beginning of the show that Yi Seo is 10 years younger than Saeroyi, right off the bat for some people it’s a turn off because of the big age gap, personally, it did not matter to me, love is love. What bothered me about her character was (1) that she literally decided not to go to school for a man that she just met and (2) that she is said to have 70% sociopathic tendencies and that was never addressed. Sociopathic tendencies or being described as about 70% a sociopath, is not something to take lightly, yet in this show, it was. It was mentioned a few times at the beginning of the show, but never addressed again. The way that her character was depicted, the audience is let into some of her decisions and is shown how she lacks empathy, compassion, and kindness, yet about halfway through the show, she is fine. As if that was never said and she is just an angry child.

Our other female lead is none other than Oh Soo Ah. To put it simply, she was so wishy washy in the most terrible way, the type of person I would like to believe does not exist. As women, we need to remember that we are human, and we can take charge and make our own decisions. Somebody needed to remind her that. They also need to remind her that you can’t take things for granted because at some point, they’ll be gone, they’ll leave.

Another note: I did not think that Saeroyi had chemistry with either one of these women. Friendship, yes. Romantically, no.

Transgender Representation: Yes. Loved it. Love her. I did not like the way it was handled when she was exposed to literally the world by who was supposed to be her friend, because nothing was really done about it. We saw no consequences, but other than that, yes.

Villains: Old Man Jang ->10/10
Jang Junior -> a little over the top but really well done 9/10 * p.s. he gave Joker vibes, in both his character and clothing *

Saeroyi: I loved that he was a man of his principles. It was stated time and time again and he proved it over and over with actions. But see with that there needed to be a line drawn between sticking to your principles and not being walked on by other people. Because Saeroyi was a man of his principles, he had a hard time differentiating when someone was being genuine or not. He was continuously letting himself be used and abused by those he cared about because of his principles. He needed to be better

Good show with some issues
The reviews on here for Itaewon class are very interesting with a lot of very high or very low scores. At the end of the day I think it's somewhere in the middle.

I think Itaewon's biggest failing is the story, it's a revenge story but not a particularly good one. The ML is wronged and he spends the show attempting to get revenge, but it's not very interesting. It's a weird mix of ""the best revenge is living well"" and also attempting to take down his enemies. This really ends up being framing for a charming restaurant slice of life and romance with a great cast.

Kim Da Mi and Park Seo Joon play off each other very well with Kim's outgoing and forceful character picking up the slack for Park's more limited dialog. Watching them run a restaurant is great and the three employees at DanBam are good and fit in well. I want to give the show extra credit for having a transgender character and handling her well.

While I don't think the revenge plot is great Yoo Jae Myung does play a great villain. His actions are sometimes uncaring, sometimes cruel, but always feel like they're coming from the place of a real fleshed out character with his own motivations.

My largest issues with the show come near the end. The pacing starts to suffer and the writing starts to feel the need to inject extra tension and drama into the last few episodes rather than letting the story come to a more natural conclusion.

But at the end of the day I really like the show, it was my first kdrama and while it isn't my favorite it's certainly above average and the cast and setting are great.

The message is the most significant
The message of this drama will always be, in my opinion, that our happiness and value are in the people around us. The money and things we have don't have any value and we will not be happy if we don't have people we love around us. I will always think that the enemy situation that drove the story was a little overwhelming since the beggining, it made me especially rethink about the fact that people with money really rule the world as they want without punishment and it is something that really should stop.
Geun Soo, Hyun Hi e Soo Ah were my favourites characters, Geun Soo and Soo Ah had theirs ups and downs, hurt people in the process but they are characters who really had a big evolution overall. Hyun Hi was definitely the character that stole my heart, the history, the way she is portrayed and how strong she is are an inspiration.

One which can be re-watched with delight
Should you? Would you? Could you?
You should watch this one (YES! )
You would recommend this to others. (YES!)
You could watch this again. (YES!)
Ending: Happy

To me, Itaewon Class is all about the dominance of the character of Jo Yi Seo portrayed by Kim Da Mi. She is brazen. She is impulsive. She is loyal. She is emotional. Her unwavering faith and support for the main lead Park Sae Ro Yi is something you don’t get to see in real life. Once she has made up her mind to do something, then nothing can deter her. That’s the strength of her character. I love the way she has no qualms in telling everyone that she is a sociopath. Now which character does that and gets away with it? We see her character showing no empathy or sympathy at all even with her team but under the guidance of the protagonist’s sense of values, she learns to realize her mistakes and forms a great bond with the same team, eventually. I absolutely love her confidence that she will make sure Park Sae Ro Yi falls in love with her.

While the story is all about the main lead’s journey and his determination to make it big to extract revenge, it’s the support that he gets from his team that really binds his journey together and makes it a worthwhile watch. Park Seo Joon is brilliant as the protagonist. His deep sense of justice and morals is what defines his character. His unwavering faith in his people makes him a leader for whom his people will do anything. When the antagonist tries to poach people from his team, we see their loyalty to the fullest. His entire character is based on his principles which his father instilled in him that does lead to his downfall initially but it's that very faith that makes him a winner in the end. I’m not sure there is even a person alive like this anywhere. He brings hope.

The one character I really didn’t take to is Soo Ah whose actions just don’t seem to justify any end. I don’t understand why she had to accept that scholarship and work for the enemy. If she loved the protagonist, shouldn’t she be by his side come what may?
The crew that makes up DamBam are equally endearing. Each one has their story which is interweaved in the plot and revealed when required.

Chairman Jang is the perfect villain of this piece. You know he is willing to do anything for his company, Jangga Co…even sacrifice his son for it. So then why would he spare the protagonist? For him, it's all about ego and powerplay. The fact that Park Sae Ro Yi refuses to bend on his knees and ask for forgiveness is the catalyst of the whole plot. Its consequences are fatal to the protagonist which in turn becomes the reason for the whole revenge angle. Chairman Jang never acknowledges that Sae Ro Yi is a real threat to Jangga Co but at the back of his mind he knows that only Park Sae Ro Yi has the capability to oust him. His character is cruel and has been played impressively by Yoo Jae Myung.

His two sons - Geun Won and Geun Soo ultimately show traits that reflect their dad. Geun Woo more so as he is the rightful heir and hence is cold, cruel, and heartless. He is responsible for bullying, killing, and kidnapping. Geun Soo starts off as being more sympathetic and loving when he is an outcast but when he decides to join his father, we see a dark side to him which is a reflection of his dad. He betrays the very friend who accepts him and shows little remorse. But he does manage to get a little redemption in the end as the good people around him realized that it was temporary madness that overcame him.

It’s a good show to watch and re-watch. Re-affirms our faith in sticking to values.

I liked this drama a lot.
I loved the main character and I think that he had so many lessons to give; you should not give up on your goals, don't forget your values though it might be tempting at times, you may have a lot of things to learn from your enemies, accept, trust and support the people around you, don't think people are your enemies just because they do something that seems to be against you, because they have their own goals and that sometimes there are situations where you should forget about what you think is right or fair, just because you value a person more than that. His character and presence was indeed shining.
I would describe this drama as a story about ethics and life values. It also touched on so many issues in the society in a very fresh way, setting an example. I will always recommend this. It doesn't have a lot of romance, so it is appropriate for all ages. You should give it a try!

Loved it, specifically the character ""Jo Yi Seo"".
I've completed this within 2 days, I am really fond to these type of series and I really liked it.
I could feel every essence of every character through their acting skill and they really try to put on the table.
Father son relationship what's father taught to his son. Very inspiring how hard for the startups to survive against the giant firm.
one quote from this, I feel like share here.
""Life is a series of choices.
Producing a result, that matches your value"".
Never let your spirit of hope die at any cost before you reached to the goal.

A comeback revenge story but with central storylines that are heart warming
9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean romantic drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.

Park Sae-ro-yi (Park Seo-joon) is a person with a very strong sense of justice and moral integrity. He is an only child being raised by his widowed father and the father and son are the most important thing in each other's worlds. Sae-ro-yi is very goal driven, his dream is to become a police officer, but the dream is shattered when he inserts himself in a bully situation. As the eldest and only legitimate son if the Jangga group, Jang Geun-won (Ahn Bo-hyun) has been groomed by his father to think of those of lower socioeconomic status as beneath him. He is a bully at school, which leads to a violent conflict with Sae-ro-yi who is not the type to stand by and allow it. When the high schoolers are disciplined the school allows Jang Dae-hee (Yoo Jae-myung), Geun-won's father and CEO of Jangga group, to decide the punishment. Since Sae-ro-yi's father happens to work for Jangga group and is a favored employee Dae-hee says he will forgive what he perceives as an insult to his son and family if Sae-ro-yi will kneel and apologize. Sae-ro-yi does not feel as though he has done wrong and refuses to kneel. He is expelled at the recommendation of Dae-hee and Sae-ro-yi stands behind his son and is forced to resign. Things seem to level out when Sae-ro-yi's father utilizes savings to open a restaurant but tragedy strikes and Sae-ro-yi's father is killed in a traffic accident by, none other, than Geun-won. At first Sae-ro-yi does not know the culprit but when he chances to find out who it was, he nearly beats Dae-won to death and serves a 3 year prison sentence for attempted murder. Sae-ro-yi spends his time studying business toward the goal of opening a competing business, DanBam, and ruining Jangga group. An unlikely group of employees/friends work for Sae-ro-yi and he also has the help of a social media guru, Jo Yi-seo (Kim Da-mi) who, after several chance encounters with the affable Sae-ro-yi vows to stay by his side and help him reach his goals. Sae-ro-yi's school friend and first love, Oh Soo-ah (Kwon Nara) works for the Jangga group and Sae-ro-yi still has feelings for her. Will a school drop out and ex-con be able to pull off the take down of a well established conglomerate like the Jangga group? Will Sae-ro-yi go with his feelings for his old love or is this new woman more of his second half?

Spoiler Altert** This is a great story that reminds of so many other good stories I have seen in the past. It has elements of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and some Rocky Balboa like elements as well. Like his father who the viewer got to know briefly, Sae-ro-yi is one of those rare people who lets nothing deter him from the right path. He is kind to those that deserve it and harsh on those that do harm to others. The people around him make mistakes but he never holds those types of things against them and it causes everyone in his inner circle to like and admire him. At first I was cheering for his first love, to be the FL and main love interest, but as soon as Yi-seo entered the picture I loved her spunk, energy and the way she was all in with whatever she was doing, including her pursuit of Sae-ro-yi. One of his inner circle is transgender and I was surprised that it portrayed the South Korean people as not very tolerant of different sexual identities. She was one of my favorite characters. Another person in his inner circle was black and there was a lot of prejudice about him being a black Korean. I loved how his business model was about his people and how they, as a result, respected him and loved him like family. He accepted them all for the people they were black, transgender, a little bit psycho and helped them realize their own potential. There were some characters tome that did things that did not make sense. Sae-to-hi did change and harden just a bit which is not such a bad thing but did result in him not forgiving to the same level he did in the past. I loved the friendships and the love story. There were some slow parts toward the end where an element of the story was dragged out more than necessary. Very good and I highly recommend.

Flavor of youth, freedom and victory of the underdogs
You know it's a great show when Park Seo Joon decides he wants to inspire the youth, by chasing his ambitions be it Fight For My Way, or Itaewon Class. The feelings I experienced this show while the second wave of the pandemic was going on in my country cannot be explained. I loved episodes 1-13, but the last 3 episodes can just go to hell. While I did love the show, I will not shy away from talking about the things that bothered me in this show as well.

Let's talk about the Characters and their arcs.

Park Se Royi - He is one of the best male protagonist in any K-Drama I've ever seen. Never have I seen a male protagonist protecting his values and his morals in such a way and him being challenged for them was highly intriguing. We see his journey and his ups and down and it is his journey that makes my heart melt. His relationship with his father was amazing and really tugs my heart. Park Seo Joon knocks it off with his superb acting.

I love other characters as well. Lee Joo-young as Hyun Yi and her representation is historic in K-Drama history. Even her arc was done very sensitively. I liked how they never overdid Seung-kwon's character as well. Toni's arc was kind of hit or miss for me. But amazed to see the representation.

I'll talk about my controversial opinion on some of the characters here now.

Geun-soo - Started off as a really good character, but his character just took a random U-turn after episode 10 or something. He became randomly vindictive for a ""crush"". And don't even get me started on how he outed Hyun Yi while they were such amazing friends. I really liked him though.

Soo Ah and Yi Seo - Ok hear me out. These two really switched positions by the end of the show for me. I hated Soo Ah in the beginning for her selfish ambitious which to me seemed preposterous. Like honey it's not really difficult to switch jobs. I loved Yi Seo in the beginning because again after IOTNBO, she is the only other APD diagnosed FL I have seen in any drama. She stood up for not only herself but for Seroyi as well, and it seemed appropriate that she is what Seroyi needed in his life to balance his principles.

But but but, by the end I realised how toxic Yi Seo is. She made so many questionable decisions throughout, and clung to Seroyi too much while being toxic to other characters. Also it was because of her Seroyi had to bend his principles (which I'll come to later). On the other hand, Soo Ah literally came out as the winner in the end for me. She single handedly brought down the main villain of the show which even the protagonist was not able to do. She also took her revenge in a much more practical and less headstrong way. She was the GOAT

About the villains - Jang Dae-hee was an amazing villain and amazing acting by the actor. Didn't care much about Geun-won though. He had his moments but the writing was limited for his character.

Romance - While Soo Ah did redeem herself by the end, she definitely wasn't deserving of Park Seroyi inspite of their wonderful chemistry. She kept him on the hook for too long. And I loved how Seroyi just let her be and never held her against her ambitions. And while Yi-Seo is definitely great for Seroyi I was really uncomfortable with the age difference and the lack of chemistry between the leads. Plus the insta love in the last 3 episodes really ruined things for me. They were so great before that as colleagues and business partners.

Also I'm not sure that I understand why Seroyi HAD to bend the knee in the end. Was it to show his love for Yi-Seo, then why didn't he did it for his father?? Anyways if someone know then please comment. Overall I loved the show except the last 3 episodes and the music and the OST was absolutely amazing and gave me all the youthful rebellious feels.

One of the best KDramas of 2020!
For those that are sceptical about watching this drama, do yourself a favour and watch it now!! I have only recently finished watching this drama and I can easily say that this is in my top 10!

Firstly, I just wanna mention the OST!! Each track matches the scenes really well, particularly Start Over and Stone Block. These two are the ones that I can just listen to or jam in the car all the time. I also love Still Fighting It. Just every time I listen to that song, it’s very uplifting but at the same time it makes me feel nostalgic and sad in a good way.

I love all the characters from the leads to even the supporting characters. Everyone would expect me to choose the ML as my favourite character but the FL is the one that stood out for me. It was sooo refreshing to see a female character who was a badass and can fight back rather than always being a damsel in distress. It was so satisfying watching her scenes. Now although the leads are what makes this drama, we must also give credit to all the supporting characters. They really uplifted the show and gave that light and funny element that we always crave for in dramas, making it a fun and enjoyable watch.

As many of you already know, Itaewon Class is a slice of life type of drama. So don’t expect a big plot with many twists and turns. It has none of that. It has a simple plot and it is very character driven. I know a lot of you get turned off with character driven dramas cause even I do sometimes but this is one of those times where it’s an exception. IT IS WORTH YOUR TIME.

One thing I would like to pinpoint was how well this drama handled the sensitive topic of racism, transphobia and orphanity. The mtf trans character was played by a woman which made me really happy since trans women are women and trans men are men just like any cis person. Yeah she was played by cis actress but still it was a development. Tony's character was also nice and I liked the Park Sae Ro Yi was supportive of both of them.
The stylists made an amazing job with all the costumes as they were absolute fashion goals!
Overall this was probably my favourite drama of 2020. The sixteenth episode was a bit meh though but overall the drama is worth watching.

Well, what can I say. A very addictive beginning. Excellent storyline, high level acting. The threads in the whole series really surprised me. But I expected a lot more from the very end. The end of the series was very ordinary. Although the very idea of the series was exceptionally original, the last scenes were taken out of the romantic comedy alive, as if we expected a happy love ending. But I was hoping for another final scene. Well, not everything has to go according to the viewer. I highly recommend watching this series. It's awesome.

best revenge for your enemy is your success
My expectation is high before I started to watch this drama.

I love how good the cinematography was, so colourful and feel so fresh. The characters in the drama were interesting enough. some of them have unique and strong characters which is inspiring.

The first episodes make me interested, it tells story about how struggle ML to reach his goal. How big his intention to do the revenge. This drama definitely describe ""best revenge for your enemy is your success"", that's what the ML was fighting for.

Bu when it comes to the last episodes, there are some of the scenes that were predictable. and I didn't feel interested to watch more, I felt so bored, so I stopped on the episode 15, just because I thought that I know what would be happened, and I was not curious to watch till the end. I'm sorry.

Okay like after five days I finally finished ITAEWON CLASS.
And oh my god it became one my favourite k-drama. It was incredible good. So so good. It was so good, incredible actor and I like both protagonists so much. And the message behind it was so incredible. Also the OST's were so great, that i almost downloaded evry song :D

So like it was the first time the girl protagonist wasn’t so girly and she didn’t even once said: “Oh nO I dOn’t liKe hIm.” From the beginning Yi-seo said, she like him and you could feel that. In general i liked her a lot (okay in the beginning she were a little odd and I didn’t like how she was treating Geun-soo and also some things she said, wasn’t that perfect but she definitely changed to someone really good (and I liked her in the beginning because she did her own thing and if people talked down to her she fight back.) And Saeyeori, I like him a lot. I like his principles and that he always stands for the right things, also that he protects his own people. I like the message, the moral and the ethics a lot in this drama and I could definitely identify with them.
And Seung-kwon, I think he was my favourite character, he was funny and also developed to someone really good.
Geun-soo, I don’t know, it was an up and down, sometimes I really like him but then in the next episode I hated him so much but I really like his actor Kim Donghee, I watched him in Sky Castle and he is such a great actor.
Hyeon-yi was also great, I liked her attitude and she was so strong. I think it was the first time a transgender played in a k-drama, I liked it a lot.
Toni, Toni was also cool. I liked him also and I was so sorry for him because of his Dad.
Soo-ah, I don’t know, On the one side i liked her but on the other side i don’t know, she went to Jangga co. although she knew what they did to Saeyeori. But she did the right thing in the end.
And the last Geun-won, I don’t know I even can’t say, I hated him. He did awful things and I understand if no one wanted to forgive him but he had also an awful father.
Jang Dae-hee, he was the worst person. It was horrible to watch how he always stayed loyal to his company but didn’t even once cared for his sons.

In conclousion I really liked the drama, i also like Park Seojoon a lot and actually I'm quite a big fan of his acting. I don't know if I would watch it again but it was really worth it watching it.

Overall good
Itaewon Class started as one thing and finished as something else, which isn't a bad thing at all, but I can't point my finger at what troubles me still.

I thought the troublesome thing was Soo Ah. I couldn't stand her whole ""I'm the most important person in my life"" thing. Ok, you go, girl, I can get behind that. You can put yourself first, and that's perfectly fine by me, though she used Sae Roy loves to have some kind of moral boundaries, and I got kind of annoyed. She redeems herself towards the end. I understood her motivations, but why not be clear about it?

Maybe my problem was with Dae Hee and his archetype of a villain. Nobody goes to those lengths just to make a person kneel. I understood the desire he had to be the most powerful person in the room, for real. But people letting and accepting everything was too much.

Amazingly enough, Yi Seo was ok. She was always selfish and never hid it from people. Her endgame was Sae Roy. I find it tiresome sometimes, but I understand it, and to be honest, I didn't care that much.

The OST is something else. Just perfection! Every music was a match made in heaven. And Taehyung with Sweet Night chef's kiss.

The romance made sense to me
Each to their own opinion but I just can't fathom SooAh and Saeroyi as endgame. And while the idea of them is nice because they have history that goes way back, and how awesome would it be to end up with the one person who has been there since the beginning of your struggles. But the reality is that they were just not meant to be. And honestly, SooAh is just not ideal for someone like Saeroyi. Homeboy has been through hell and back, he has seen the darkest of the night, felt the greatest pain and losses. He does not need someone unpredictable like SooAh who if given the chance, will drop Saeroyi without hesitation if she were to be offered something of greater importance. What someone like Saeroyi needs, is loyalty. Of course Saeroyi is smart and thinks ahead, reason why he made a plan. But he was simply too vanilla (for a lack of better word) He needed someone just crazy enough to carry it out, and Yiseo was like the missing piece to his puzzle that he's been looking for all along. She was young, ambitious, and clever but most of all, she was loyal to the core. She wasn't wishy washy with what she wanted but made it clear multiple times she is dedicated to this one man and when everyone else just watched and hoped for the best, Yiseo not only fought with him, but she turned his dream into a reality!

And at the same time, it also benefitted her. I know some people might feel like she does nice things only to get on Saeroyi's good side, but for a sociopath like her who before, cares about no one but only winning, to want to become better because of Saeroyi, or even just do nice things for others because of him, I think that's already pretty great in itself.

All in all, these two really complements each other. For Saeroyi, someone whose had a rough life to have someone completely dedicated by his side, and for someone like Yi-seo who lacks empathy for others, but to meet Saeroyi and just feel for this guy, his perseverance and determination, and to want to bring happiness to this dude, but also wanting to do better things because of him. Chefs kiss.

I'm also really tired of the first love = true love trope, so I am glad he ended with Yiseo. It proves that time isn't a measurement of love. No matter how long Saeroyi has known SooAh and clung onto her, Yiseo+Saeroyi proves that love is built through loyalty, teamwork, trusting in each other and having one another's back. All of which Saeroyi's and SooAh's relationship lacked even though they had the advantage of knowing each other longer.

Every character is so full of themselves
This drama is just plain bad! The first few episodes were pretty good. Then the writers completely lost their way. In terms of conflict, the writers forced it by having the main leads basically s--t talk each other. Also with the exception of the main character, all the other characters just don't make sense. That's the reason why I couldn't like any of the them and found all of them increasingly annoying with each episode.

What finally made me quit watching was when Park Sae Ro Yi, the main character called up Jang Dae Hee, the villian of the story who was dying of cancer, and told him you better stay alive so that I can get my revenge. Come on! It's absolutely absurd!

To sum up, this show is bad. Oh my god, it's really bad.

Possibly the worst hairstyles ever for both the men and women
The story marginally passed in that it barely kept my interest. The casting is great in the diverse sense. Kim Da Mi is believable as the digital marketing specialist but she's so unattractive to me. I didn't find her relatable in any other way. Kwon Na Ra is much more attractive and a better character. There were some good performances here and there but I didn't find it convincing.

This plot had potential but failed in so many ways. I will not watch it again and can't recommend it unless you're extremely bored and have nothing better to do.

I almost loved every second of it
Itaewon Class for me was very unexpected, it was exciting, thrilling and I almost loved every second of it but I wasn't even expecting to like it. I went into this drama thinking this might not be my cup of tea but ended the first episode thinking, wow this is brilliant, when can I watch the next. Each episode ramped up my anticipation to see the next and my excitement for the upcoming week when I would finally get to Friday.

This drama did not shy away from controversial topics and I thought that was brilliant, instead of letting it fly under the radar they instead discussed these topics. The topics were discussed through an entertaining, well thought out, narrative and in my opinion, they did well for the most part. I do believe there is one issue that could have been handled better (Spray paint) but I do love that they are now addressing different topics and the lives of different people and possibly opening up new conversations.

One of the things that I loved most about this drama, are the characters, minus the antagonists, and their friendships, I loved that the characters, especially from DanBam, cheered each other on while also learning more and more about one another and being understanding. I loved Park Seo Ro Yi's' resilience and the fact that no matter what obstacles were put in his way, he would still find a way to get where he wanted to be. I especially loved the friendship between Yi Seo and Hyun Yi, especially towards the end, their friendship made me so happy and the way they supported one and another was brilliant. Although I did love the friendships, the romantic relationship was a bit exhausting to watch, with Yi Seo not letting go even after being told no countless times. In my opinion that completely disregarded Seo Ro Yi's' feeling and to me it felt hard to watch as well as that the love triangle just felt weird. With these two women fighting over a guy for years, it just felt odd that it would go on that long, I understand that they think he's a great guy but in my opinion, it just seemed very tiring and I couldn't understand the amount of time spent fighting over and pining for him.

As well as this another aspect I did not like about this drama, is that it felt like a completely different drama towards the end, it's like they jumped ship into a new genre and left me baffled. While I loved the drama as a whole, the last few episodes were not my cup of tea and just seemed off to me but that might just be me being picky. It just didn't feel like the drama that I was watching from the beginning and it disappointed me, I watched the drama for the friendships and the behind the scenes of the business, not for whatever this was. I suppose it was where one of the main aspects came into play but it just didn't ring true to me and I still can't quite put my finger on why that is.

I thought it may be important to mention as I don't normally like OSTs, but the soundtrack to this was empowering and awesome, I loved how the music made you want to get up and do anything. Whenever I was sad about anything, I could put this soundtrack on and feel happy again. My favourite song from the soundtrack was Gaho Start, which actually felt like the perfect song for this drama and often brightened the mood of any scene it was in, in my opinion.

Overall, I do love this drama, while the last few episodes and the romantic relationship did let me down, how I felt during the beginning and middle of this drama made up for that and left me feeling sad that it was over.

Definitely one of the best K-dramas of the Year
First 6 episodes were absolutely insane! So so good! So intense! I kinda wished the story was always as intense and ""realistic"" as those first episodes, but for a K-drama it's definitly one of the best out there. Touches important topics such as discrimation, racism, lgbt... just overall amazing!

Who would've thought a korean prodution would touch such topics... i am truly impressed and satisfied with the evolution of times! All the actors killed it, but there would be no Itaewon Class without Park Seo-joon and Kim Da-mi... forever iconic duo! Every K-drama with Park Seo-joon is already a guarantee is going to be good! He never disapoints! A MUST WATCH! Probably already one of the best of the year!

I've no clue what all the hype about this show was about.
I hated this show, the cast were quite good, but I hated the characters of both the first and second female leads with a burning passion. I get the whole thing about the female lead was supposed to be admired by male watchers for her loyalty. But honestly she gave me the creepy crawlies, i hated her personality, yes she was strong sticking up for herself, but otherwise a plain asshole to almost everyone around her, Also, i hate the main leads haircut. Also, what real character development occurred, all they did to the FL was water down her personality. I also found her super clingy and creepy, and i feel bad for actress that played her (who is stunning btw).

Interesting story, romance makes no sense
This drama had a lot of potential and there were many parts I liked, but the romantic parts have ruined it for me and I don't think I can keep watching because of that. The cast is really cool and like many other reviewers have said the diversity and attention to social issues was a big plus for this drama because they make it stand out from many other dramas and add interesting, realistic facets to the story. I also loved the revenge storyline, and Yoo Jae Myung and Ahn Bo Hyun were able to elicit a strong emotional reaction with their portrayals of their characters. Just the first few episodes inspired fury, grief, pride, happiness, and determination. Additionally, he drama made an interesting commentary on class and corruption.

However, where the drama really fell short for me was the romance. It was not only unnecessary, but also left me confused as if I were missing something. Park Sae Ro Yi's crush on Oh Soo Ah seemed to pop up out of nowhere, but was sweet at the beginning and the story provided enough context and explanation that I was able to accept it even if it seemed a bit farfetched. However, as time passed and the story progressed,Sae Ro Yi's romantic feelings for Oh Soo Ah began to make less and less sense. His primary goal in life was to get revenge for his father's death and yet he was completely willing to accept the fact that she had devoted 7+ years of her life to work for the family responsible for his dad's death and the subsequent cover-up? Additionally, his crush lasted years and years without any indication that she reciprocated his feelings even though he had only been close with her for a short time and hadn't even had contact with her for 7 years? And yet their relationship made more sense to me than the romance pushed between Sae Ro Yi and Jo Yi Seo.

While I really appreciated Jo Yi Seo as an interesting addition to the plot line as well as her general bad*ss-ery, she was an overall unlikeable character. She and Sae Ro Yi had little in common and no visible chemistry. While I am sometimes okay with an age gap between couples in dramas, the age difference was far too clear in Sae Ro Yi and Yi Seo's relationship to overlook. While Yi Seo was able to help Sae Ro Yi with his business using her experience and connections; emotionally, the two were almost never on the same page. Additionally, on multiple occasions Yi Seo got in between Sae Ro Yi and his actual crush, Soo Ah, which I thought should have drawn Sae Ro Yi away from Yi Seo instead of toward her. Every time the two of them appeared together on screen I found myself wondering ""Am I meant to want them to get together?"" Because their relationship made absolutely no sense. The scene that made this clear for me was when Sae Ro Yi allowed Yi Seo to tag along on his trip to visit the detective who had mishandled his case and began telling her all about his life. Because Sae Ro Yi had never been open about his emotions, plans, or experiences before (not even telling his Soo Ah who had been around for his dad's death and he supposedly had feelings for) and because Yi Seo had never expressed empathy or interest in anyone else (including her supposed best friend) this scene seemed wildly out of character for both of them and left me completely confused. Was I meant to believe that because of their ""romantic attraction"" they were going to act like completely different people? Even when they had no reason to be romantically attracted to each other in the first place? Instead of adding to the story and drawing my attention like romantic plot-lines often do, I found myself getting irritated with the characters and the story every time there was even a hint of romance. This unnecessary addition to the drama really hurt the story instead of helping it.

Overall, the drama has a lot of potential, and perhaps I will eventually end up finishing it by simply skipping over any romantic aspects. But because the love interests are such integral parts of the story, I fear I will miss out on important plot points if I don't watch the emotionally confusing and out-of-character romantic moments.

I started this drama without great expectation from the plot as I am not the type of person who enjoys revenge stories. I started watching this only because of Park Seo Joon. The story started off great. I respected Sae Ro Yi's character though he didn't have much development. I know the whole story cuz I read up the summary. I detested the main female lead's character. There is a thin line between being badass and being a hypocrite and in my opinion, Jo Yiseo was leaning towards the latter side. An instance is when she tore up the DanBam poster that Sae Ro Yi gave her. It didn't have a particular reason and to me felt just like a forced action to make her seem badass and cool. Such instances were there all over the story. I didn't like the second female lead either. She seemed too self centered and said she would date Sae Ro Yi only after he became rich. Jo Yiseo also seemed too immature and whiny to have a strong bond with Sae Ro Yi. He was mature though slightly naive. So if the romance was removed I would have liked this a whole lot better. I also felt that one second Yiseo tears up Sae Ro Yi's poster and falls in love with him the next second. The romance was confusing and messy which overshadowed the revenge plot. The OSTs acting and everything else was pretty good in my opinion.

I've seen a lot of reviews saying that the plot is poorly written and I have to disagree with that. Because it is probably one of the best written kdramas ever and I'm definitely a huge fan of the writer after this. Yeah you have to pay attention to the small details but that's what makes this drama so beautiful.

So let's start with the characters. Saeroyi. The character development and the deepness of his character is mind blowing. The way I fell or him because of his actions right away and I felt like his character is someone who deserves the whole world says a lot. His dark past and things he had to go through yet he still managed to be the best person ever believing in himself and people around him made him not just a character in a kdrama but almost like a role model. ""I value people not money"" is probably the most beautiful thing he said. He could've choose the easier way so many times yet he still decided to stick to his principles and beliefs because that's what his father thought him. And if that's not someone you would want to look up to then I don't know who is.
To be honest Yi-Seo's and Saeroyi's characters were completely different but that's why it made a great balance and I loved them both as I think their love story was so well developed and everything had a reasoning.
The supporting cast. Again, brilliant. I truly felt like I knew these people as their character were so well written explaining actions we might not agree with ( such as SooAh). That's what it made them so realistic. We don't always make good decisions thats why we are here so we can learn and move on.
Even the evil characters. Yeah I hated them which was needed as they created the tension however sometimes they still had reasons behind their actions.

This drama thought me so many things, made me happy, made me cry. There was no moment when I was bored which I think is really important when it comes to kdramas. Every single detail and plot had a reason behind it. The plot was so nicely laid out and the ending was truly perfect. Everything we needed.

The romance. Probably one of the best ones I've ever seen. I knew why those two people fell in love and I knew why they needed each other. Because it was clearly explained and it was slowly developed. It suited both of their characters. It was meaningful and beautiful.

And the music. What can I say? Just perfect.

So if you hesitant to watch this drama please don't be. I am so glad I did because I can say it is one of the best, most mature drama. Not with some pointless characters or plotlines. Not with some lame romance. It's just perfect. Perfect balance of action, romance, comedy, crying, happiness. Everything was so well presented and I wish I could watch a drama like this again.

This drama was overly hyped through social media. To be honest, the first half of the drama was totally great which makes me hook into it. The storyline was somewhat new and unique for me since it was all about revenge and food war. But as long as I watched the series the hype of it really strike down since there are episodes that are totally nonsense and left me thinking that I might lose the interest of watching the rest of the series. But for the sake of it that I already made it this far just made me force myself to finish it till the last episode. But the good side about Itaewon class was that it tackles a major issue in our daily life especially when it comes the discrimination and acceptance to the public of both different races especially for black people and the members of LGBTQ.

In my opinion, Itaewon Class is pretty awesome.
First of all, I'm a really big fan of the casting. I like Lee Joo Young's role (her tomboyish nature reminded me of her character in Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo) and also the other characters are very fitting in looks as they are with their personality. I enjoy the funny scenes as well as the scenes with more depth. I'm looking forward to watching as the plot develops further. I would very much recommend watching this drama as it is very unique and interesting.

Last year hotel del luna gave me this feeling that is excitement and eagerness to wait for the next episode
Liked the personalities of both main lead and female lead
They both are just amazing and music is ???. You can watch itaewon class on Netflix which makes the ep available ASAP as 2 hours after airing in korea or Other third party websites such as kissaian which usually takes 6-12 hours.
Cant wait for the next episode ????????????

Not worth of my time.
I stopped watching this drama even though i love park seo joon.

i already watch a lot of korean dramas but I added this drama on my boring list.
the casting was great. park seo joon, kim da mi, ahn bo hyun and kwon na ra they are really good actors and actresses.
I know that they are trying to be different to other kdrama storyline but i stopped watching because story is getting uninteresting. i don't hate the drama, it is not the type of drama that i like.
I love their OST especially Gaho's Start Over. whenever i listen to that song it makes me feel like i should watch the itaewon class.

if i will continue this drama. it is not on my priority list. maybe i can only finish this drama for one to two months unlike for other dramas that i can finish it for less than a week

Ending messed up
From the start story was going good, no problem with that but as the story continue more of a personal fight it became a business fight, so at the end what OH SOO-AH did messedup the whole story if at the end jangga co will lead by jang geun-soo and the fight begins between them fot the no.1 spot it will become more attractive and more fun to watch but after jangga co. Went bankrupt and then he took over it it's no fun to watch, i think ending of search WWW DRAMA ending was more fun to watch than this, otherwise is was a nice drama..

I underestimated this amazing drama.

For one, I thought it might be just another overrated drama.

And two, because I never really liked Park Seo Joon until Itaewon Class.
Wow, this role TOTALLY suits him and he slays it!
So to say this is my favorite role of his, because I never completely liked any before.
His portrayal of Park Sae Ro Yi felt contained yet so powerful.

Kim Da Mi? Wow. Bright future. I’m looking forward to her upcoming projects. I really hope she does more dramas because she’s just wow.

It is an inspiring, unique drama, with a fun story and cool music. I was impressed.

[insert the lady gaga ""talented, brilliant, incredible etc"" meme]
When I asked for perfection this is what I mean
When I asked for a powerful power couple this is what I mean (Yiseo step on me)
During this global pandemic, I found myself watching Itaewon Class and I realized that everything else did not matter anymore because Park Saeroyi is the only man that matters today and tomorrow.
The characters are compelling, the plot is well written, the soundtrack is amazing.
I do not have any complaints, this was truly great.
Also the side characters were great and I am so happy they talked about trans people and racism in SK.

Wow, what a show! Itaewon Class delivers the hype around it with phenomenal acting and gripping story, along with a few nice twist and turns in the plot. I finished the show in less than four days, with a normal KDrama series taking at least ten days - that's how addictive it was to watch - perhaps the first ever drama I will re-watch too. The backstory to the present day, I don't think I would have changed anything with the plot and outcomes, it was brilliantly crafted.
A few think this show is overhyped but I personally strongly disagree, I think everyone should watch it to see how they feel about the show but I think it's a masterpiece. Itaewon Class has changed my life's perspectives.

I saw the series listed on Facebook. I passed it several times because it just didn’t seem that good at that and I thought that it was saying taekwondo class. So I kept passing it. After a while I just decided to give it a shot and try to watch at least one episode. Let me tell you that I could not stop at one. This series is most certainly not about a real class but it is about having class and showing class and so much more. The cover image of the series somewhat lead you to believe that it is about competition and competing in battling and different things of that nature. That’s what I gain from the cover image however what I got from episode one all the way to the end with something completely different. This series is about so many things that we encounter every day or people around us and counter every day. It is about sticking to your values Values and beliefs, loyalty, friendship, unity, patience, revenge, love, tragedy, overcoming, justice, diligence and wisdom. This series had it all.

I have watch so many shows over the last few weeks but this one is by far the number one pick for me. I will admit that my genre is usually historical romance but every now and then I will watch action and sometimes mystery. This one honestly tops all of those. this is an absolute mess watch. For anybody who has ever been wrong or suffered an injustice and for anyone who’s ever had others doubt their ability to succeed this one is most certainly for you. I loved it absolutely loved it.

Something different
This is one of those dramas where I skip a lot but at the same time, I love it. Even when I skip some scene I will still understand what is happening. The story itself is eye-opening. You might feel like you are connected with one of the characters. The casting is amazing. I love how there is a black person in this drama. I hardly ever seen black or African people in a Korean drama usually it all white. people. ( this is only my opinion so please don't hate me ) The rewatch value for me is half and a half...... I think maybe in a few years I come back and watch it again. This is something that is different from what I watch usually. Ost is the best. I love the intro song just listening to it makes you think back what has happened in the drama. This drama a lot talk about a topic that I haven't seen in the drama which is transgender. I feel like this drama talk about a lot of topic wherein reality is not easy to open about.

sorry if this review did not help a lot.

( this is all my opinion please don't I guess me )

The cast did an amazing job at everything. This is not your typical drama but it is worth watching. Not that much love scenes or cute scenes but still really worth watching. I did not read the webtoon therefore I cannot compare the two but I did see pictures of the webtoon and I can tell you that they matched the actors to the characters in the webtoon. This drama is something out of the ordinary since 1. I have never seen any drama like this and 2. the story line gets you hooked on real quick.

The story is unpredictable, unconventional, and promising. Itaewon Class tackles different social issues which are very relevant in Korean society. Each characters have a different story to tell. These characters have their own distinct pain and suffering, but that what interests me the most. Their pain becomes a tool for them to be connected, and battle the pain as a team. However, the ending was a big disappointment on my part. I think the ending should have been grander. More so, I think Saeroyi should have been more empathetic and humble to his enemies. But overall I enjoyed the series

Story: It was good, but it was not the greatest. I don't know, the first episode felt a bit ""meh"", I already had an idea of what was going to happen from the first 10-20 minutes, but stayed for Nara and PSJ and thankfully the rest of the drama did not disappoint. Aside from inaccuracies about Kim Da Mi's character, it was not that bad, but it was not that great in my opinion. The plot was different-ish compared to other dramas, but the ending bit was a bit too wild to go with the rest of the drama. I did not mind it, but it cut the flow of the drama a bit, IMO.
Acting/Cast: Of course the cast and their acting was top-notch and I'm glad that they touched on topics like racism in Korea with the inclusion of Toni (Chris Lyon/Ryan), as well as LGBTQ-related things.
Music: It was good, not the usual set of soft/sad/melo/ballad type of songs. My top 3: Diamond - Ha Hyun Woo, Sweet Night - V, and Start Over - Gaho.
Rewatch Value: I don't like rewatching dramas in general, to be more specific, I simply can't so it's more of a score to help me get the average overall score.

Something fresh and real
This is my first review and more for my entertainment :)

Itaewon Class, while having a pretty common story, manages to capture the attention of its audience, why you ask? Because of the characters, and the cast that portrayed its characters so beautifully.
Humans are neither good nor bad (sadly, we find that concept very often in dramas though : ""the good guy"" aka hero, ""the bad guy"" aka villian, and the ""well-mannered"" female lead) and I think this drama perfectly captured that.
Here we have something different. Even the ""bad guy"" was not entirely bad. His actions were not justified, but they kind of made sense (to me at least). The female lead, that many people here even called ""Bitch"", is someone with antisocial tendencies, and she knows it. Sometimes I loved her actions and her decisions, and sometimes I was disappointed. And by dissapointed I dont mean, that I am blaming the writer for not writing a more ""morally acceptable"" character, but more in the sense, that she did something, that was probably not the nicest thing to do, but it is part of her ""nature"".

I think the cast did a great great job! I could probably write pages about every single character, and what i found intriguing and what could have been better about them.

S O L I D P E R F E C T I O N !!!
WOW! Just WOW! I finished Itaewon Class just now , weeks after its last episode aired worldwide. I know I'm late to join the party but I'm grateful I watched this one and I won't skip my chance to write a good review here and spread the words about how good this drama is. Gosh! This drama is on another level! It's mind blowing! It's a solid perfection!

I'm seriously in awe and losing my words. I'm speechless! I don't know what to write here because right now, there's too much good things in my brain waiting to be poured in this review. This drama is 180 degrees different, comparing to any K-drama nowadays. It's nothing about lovey dovey relationship or cutie pie story. It's all about something real: fighting hard and be determined while achieving your goals!

The casts in this drama are amazing. Park Sae-ro-yi is the man of his words. He had been through sickest and darkest hell but still standing strong until he finally achieves his goal in the end. Jo Si-yeo is the real deal, the badass! She's the real definition of fierce. Her confident is what makes her very rare and precious. She's genius, has nothing to afraid and exactly knows what she wants in life.

To me, there's not many movies or dramas which can change my life and give me new perspective after watching them. But Itaewon Class is seriously a game changer. Please tell me, how often you watch a movie or drama which successfully boosting your spirit at their ends? When you find one, it feels so so so good and somehow, satisfying!

To sum up my review, I will simply put: Itaewon Class makes me wanna try at life again.

The typical story of a poor main lead who defies all odds to battle a bad, rich antagonist.

There are a few key differences though:

1. The character of the male main lead - a very morally upright person that ""does what he believes in"". This may lead to socially indifferent situations, some logically questionable decisions, and also some superbly heroic ones, and while it isn't necessary different from a lot of main chacters in dramas today, the intricacies in his character development, and the way its acted out is superb to say the least.
2. The character of the female main lead - a exceptionally smart and good looking girl who may seem socially cold, her character is not something you would often see, especially in Korean dramas where they would simply be there just for emotional support.

The first half of the drama was exceptional, beautifully directed and shot. The pacing was on point, along with the character development of the team, but then, as with a lot of successful Korean dramas, it got popular, started getting littered with product placement, and the effort, character development, and everything that made it great got lost with it.

TLDR: The writing and key plot points were very clever and well thought out, and I'll be sure to give the webtoon and any of his future works a look. But the lack of execution from direction and production towards the second half of the drama was disappointing to say the least.

This drama is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I personally prefer thriller, crime and action drama. Therefore, for romance it should be very good to catch my fancy, and above that it should be an epic to make me write a review praising it. This drama is one of those.
Firstly, acting is superb and either of the male or female leads are specially great and bring forward their persona completely, either in their facial expressions or their dialog they build characters that the viewers can connect with. The male lead is a very talented and known actor that does not need much introduction but what surprised me was the acting of the female lead. It was breathtaking. The personality of the female lead and her acting is so strong that in the most scenes her role feels more important to me than the male lead. Sometimes the acting of an actor or actress is so natural that you feel like they were born to take that role and no one will be able to do better; this was one of those times.
secondly, direction is good and the flow of the story is always appealing.
thirdly, music complements the dialog and events completely. Specially in important scenes music is like a third dialog that helps transfer more emotions and meaning and completes the scene.
As for the rewatch value I would say definitely and without doubt. Actually I believe this drama is gonna be one of the classics in a few years.
The only complaint that I have about the drama is the logic problems in the story. maybe it is a problem with the webtoon and not the drama itself, but never the less it exists. Some events seem too far-fetched to occur in real life which make the story feel like a fantasy and something that is never gonna happen. I'm specially talking about the phase of development for the male lead and his teem. Another matter is that in some specially important scenes, the reaction of the characters to someone or some events are unrealistic and sometimes too strong, it seems that they react in this way just to make story move forward and make something -usually romantic- happen between the characters.

What can i say about this drama?
For one i absolutely loved it. For me i literally couldn't find a fault in it. This drama is a breath of fresh air. So unlike other dramas. It tackles so many issues of modern day problems. Being racism, and the harsh opinions on those who want to live as a different gender. These components are rarely introduced into Korean dramas. And i especially like how they were involved with this drama. The actors were amazing. Park Seo-Joon did a great job playing his character. He was strong, and caring. Never wanting harm to those he loved. And Kim Da-Mi also did a good job in playing her character so badass and protective over the ML. You could easily tell how much she loved him. These main leads were perfect for the role. The whole cast were amazing. The story line was great to. I found it easy to follow without getting bored at all. And with the music as well. It made it so much better, and with some scenes, was very intense lol. This is definitely a drama i would rewatch. I'm sad that it is over because now i don't know what to watch next. For anyone who is thinking about watching this. Don't hesitate. Watch it. You will not regret it. Its soooooo good! And for those who are wondering if this drama has a happy ending... it doesn't.... Nahhh i'm joking. Best ending ever!

Itaewon Class Is Fun But Not Special
As far as Kdramas go, Itaewon Class does nothing to distinguish itself from any other Kdrama that relies on tired tropes, sibling and romantic rivalries, and overarching themes of revenge. Still, the characters are likable enough and the performances are pretty solid and manage to maintain a consistent energy throughout. There's even an attempt to address hot-button issues like racism and transphobia but they seem to resolve too easily and in an unsatisfactory way just to score some quick social justice points. And I'm not sure why Chris Lyon's character, Toni, would be the only staff member at Danbam to be required to learn English. But I did enjoy the cinematography, the fashions, and the overall David v. Goliath vibe of the show.

i really liked so
this show was really so emotional and pure love
it made me feel warm many times

except few things in it like the timing, it wasn't right during the last episodes in many scenes
such as when (ahn bo hyun) was chasing them with his car (park seo joon) was telling the FL about his feelings
far away from being incorrect time for this confession the car took so long to reach them although it was very short distance
and many other flaws like this during the end

it has also a great messages
like..
*under any circumstances you should never abandon your principles
because once you abandon one time the rest will be easier

*and away from whom you love, even if for long years
only situations & supporting can make you continue loving him or not


what bothered me much.. i felt the ML was senseless many times, he even discovered his feelings too late
and i couldn't feel sympathy at all with (ahn bo hyun) the whole drama although he was victim for his father

and (Nara) was a real selfish, coward B***h

Inspirational Park Saeroyi is worth 16+ hrs of your drama watching time
At first, I was not that into the show, just finished Sweet Home, and here's yet another show where there is nonsense bullying, a corrupt parent enabling their child's evil deeds, turning the child into a mini-version of themself, and the evil cycle continues on. But Park Saeroyi (Park Seo Joon). It's impossible that he will not grow on you. He's just so decent (How to be you?), which is so rare nowadays. Itaewon Class is a great inspirational underdog (revenge) story.

As the world becomes more and more chaotic, it's becoming much harder to be a stickler for the right morals and principles, as people struggle to survive in a 'dog eat dog' world. It's so easy to conform, and take the easy path. Saeyori knows the righteous path is usually the harder path, but he knows no other way.

I appreciate that the writer veered away from the usual 'Candy' heroines, both Soo Ah and Yi Seo (Kim Da Mi) are complex and driven characters, but the romance has to be the weakest part of Itaewon for me. The idea of a Romeo and Juliet type of romance between Soo Ah and Saeroyi felt more drama epic, I wished the writer showed more of Soo Ah's struggles along the way. For Yi Seo, it was hard to understand her very frank ways at first, I'm also not comfortable about the fact that she risked it all for Saeyori. Maybe I'm more forgiving in fantasy dramas than real-life setting lol.

Itaewon has an unforgettable OST that's just perfect for the motivational message of the drama. Good cast, I watched Ahn Bo Hyun in Kairos first, but he's a phenomenal villain here that comes off a little unhinged. All in all, Itaewon is more than a classic revenge story in a modern setting, it also tackles struggles of the youth and life lessons, including timely issues like transgenders, racism, business startup, and that there is no single path to success. Saeroyi is definitely worth 16 hours of your time.

This series was very interesting! The story of this series was very empowering and motivating! The actors and actresses displayed a lot of powerful emotions and persistence in terms of displaying each roles emotions and actions with passion and care. I was immediately drawn to this series after watching the first episode! After each episode, my interest remained throughout the entire series! I was impressed by Park Seo-Joon and Kim Da Mi’s exceptional deliverance of their roles! Their on screen chemistry was admirable and adorable - waiting out til the last few episodes was a different approach but the long awaited blossom of love til the end was worth the wait! Full of passion, persistence, competence, hard work, determination and exceptional acting! What more could you ask for in K-Drama Series! :)

This was definitely a fresh drama with a beautiful storyline that almost seems real and surreal at the same time. Inspiring, lively and unbelievable at times, is what I would describe this series. Personally, the first part of the drama was more my style, as it kept me coming back for it. Iteawon Class is a lot about Korean culture, and lets you into the newer emerging culture about business and nightlife in Seoul. A lot of viewers were quite disappointed with the ending, which is totally understandable with the whole shift in dynamics and the main point of the story. However, I dare to disagree, as the characters and the overall aesthetics are what made me fall in love with the drama. On top of that, the side characters got their little own screen time + there was an emphasis on Korean food, which looked amazing. Yes, some character development was disappointing, but it is not something major. Lastly, I found the OST very dreamy and uplifting, and now some songs are on constant repeat.

Although I thought it would not be your typical drama, it did have those cheesy Kdrama moments. I do believe that this drama is worth a watch if you are into vibrant, inspiring slice of life series!

I think those who are giving this show a low rating were the people who were expecting a romantic comedy. Please you guys should stick to watching crash landing on you . I admit that I only started to root for the main couple during the last three episodes but the main focus is not on the romance. It's about the life struggles of a guy who lost everything and had to fight his way to the top. The side characters are also amazing and I loved how each female character was empowered and had an important role to play.

The show never gets too dark or dreary that it would make it unwatchable , the colorful streets of Itaewon and the glamorous restaurant scene of Seoul just added enough fun to balance out the sad parts. There was no scene which felt unnecessary and this show had my focus from start to end. Considering how important romance is to me in a drama the fact that I managed to enjoy it without the main focus of the show being on the love story shows how amazing this drama is.

This show had some amazing messages and I feel that I have actually learned a lot of things about life from it. The soundtrack featured more rock songs which made it different from the usual cheesy stuff we are used to hearing in kdramas. Park Seojoon outdid himself here and the actor who played the villain did an amazing job. Please do give it a chance.

I’ve decided to write this review because this is the only way through I can express what I’m feeling right now. This drama was just one of the best k-dramas that I’ve seen in 2020 until now.

Before it was released I was very excited for this drama because of Park Seo Joon and Nara. After this aired, I’ve waited to be complete because I wanted to watch it on Netflix, and after it was complete I’ve read some reviews, which -I must admit- it made me to not feel as excited as I was at the beginning. But I told myself that whatever people say, I will watch it. And I tell you – I don’t regret anything.

Of course, I know that everyone has different tastes, which is very normal, because this is the reason why there are so many genres of dramas. And normally I don’t write reviews, but I don’t know why, this drama had a big impact on me.

I think that one of the best parts was that I didn’t feel when this drama ended. Time flew so fast, I didn’t feel it at all. It all went so smoothly and it was a pleasure to watch it.

Saeroyi was my favorite. Watching him throughout the 16 episodes has made me to reflect about my life. No matter how much hardships he has forced to endure – he was a strong and ambitious character until the end. His story it was just brilliant from the beginning to the end. His perseverance and stubborness were the best things in this drama. Park Seo Joon never disappoints me.

This k-drama is a life lesson, and I’m very grateful that I could learn something from it. I literally loved every actor and character.

Overall the drama was just amazing. The drama revolve around park seojoon but each of the characters have their share in telling their stories and it was shocking. The characters consist of an ex-convict, transgender, illegitimate son, a bully, arrogant ceo, selfish woman and even the female lead character is a sociopath. Kim Dami is really a good actress and she bring the sociopath character just right.
On the other hand, Im not trying to exaggerate but every eps there must be a plot twist or a shocking element.

So, I just finished watching this drama and I am really impressed with how Park Seo Joon portrait 'Park Seoroyi"". This is definitely a new role that he has never done before and I really loved it. I'm more into a romance-comedy show but this drama really gave me new inspiration to focus on other genres. The moral lesson was really captivating, it gave me the motivation that we shouldn't feel hopeless or say that Life is useless because 'Your life may seem repetitive. But no one really knows what could happen tomorrow. Not a single day was predictable. Some days were tough, and some days were sad. But something fun always came along every once in a while. Every day is full of excitement. Who knows? One day, your boring life might turn into an exciting one.""This quote really helped me to think thoroughly about life. This drama is not mostly about romance and more into action, thriller..ish and revenge?? I really love how they made 'Lee Joo Hyung' into a transgender even though she is a female. xD In 'Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo' she's also like a mix of bi...?? And I like how they made her do the same sort of character. I find it funny and pretty cool. I am also shook about how they added a fi=ioreigner in the drama, in Korean dramas, they don't really add ykow foreigners and such... only as a cameo and this hopefully gave the viewers a change that everyone is welcome into the show and there shouldn't be any discrimination against other nations. This drama is mostly about the moral lesson of life, and that we shouldn't do stupid things. We tend to do stuff but we should always think of the consequences that you will get with your action. I am proud that 'Kim Dong Hee' is part of this drama, at first... I couldn't recall where I saw him but I was amused that he's getting there towards his acting career. I first saw him on A-TEEN and that short film was really Inspiring because I am as well in High school. But overall, I loved the cast, the chemistry of the actors and actresses, and I wish to see them more on future dramas. Thank you IC team!!!
People inspired me to watch this drama because I keep seeing it LITERALLY EVERYWHERE and, I am thankful because it changed me and gave me inspiration that no matter what happens in your life, always have hope, faith and TRust and that's what Park Seoroyi did!!!

I am not good at writing reviews and I usually don't but I had to try to write one for this drama. It's a very motivating drama to overcome anything you do in your life and realize your mistakes and overcome them, when you fall to get back up. The story 10/10! Most people are in for the romance but if you pay attention to the storyline there are so many lessons in this drama that made me realize different perspectives of life. Songs 10/10! I had to go look up the lyrics to the ost but the messages are amazing and powerful! The cast 10/10! I felt as if I was the main actor, the expression the cast put on during sad moments was so well. Overall I'd rewatch this again and again once I finish watching my other dramas this is something I'd like to rewatch for motivation.

I don't think I need to tell anyone who is an avid KDrama watcher that PSJ has always been a fantastic rom-com actor but Itaewon Class has definitely been a great addition to his repertoire of great KDramas. Park Sae Ro Yi is a terrific character written by Kwang Jin writer nim and PSJ had done full justice to his role, he almost shocked me with his subtle emotional acting which I thought he was not able to showcase in his not so serious feel-good dramas of the past.

Now, lets come to the crux of this drama, Itaewon Class is a beast of a drama when it comes to detailed description of the wonderful Itaewon region which itself plays a character and even drives the plot forward. The dramas shows the class division between the meglomaniac rich and the hard working class using food & restaurant industry as backdrop. It really sets itself apart from other dramas on how all the characters main as well side are crucial for moving the story forward and each one of them reaches a statisfying conclusion in the end with good enough character development.As I can assure you that some of the MDL reviews here are thinking too much critically of the plot which I think is due to most Kdrama watchers being casual viewer who love more good feel and unrealistic dramas but IMAO this drama is too realistic for their taste.Its a motivational revenge story with hint of revenge & social commentary.

Romance is there in this drama but not too much but , its unique in the sense that instead of displaying affection in crude and cringe ways as most of us are used to watching in other KDramas like forced flirting, stalking, kissing, one sided love of second male lead and stupid love triangle to take revenge from each other exes, this dramas portrays love in a different manner.Here, people who care for each other don't run behind each other carelessly and cringing the F out of the situation, instead they support each other and try their level best to make each other's dream come true so quite maturity is shown when it comes to potray how ambitious people pursue their love in contrast to teenagers & adolescents who are more emotional & impulsive.

This is a pitch perfect dramas for business aspirants and shows how greed can never replace loyalty and human friendship. DanBam team shows how with dedication & hardwork one can achieve success without compromising one own morals & principles and the bromance & sismance as well as the general camaraderie between the characters was funny as well as touching to watch.

Both the female leads were great Kwon Nara looked beautiful through out the drama and her character 's relationship with Jo Yi Seo who plays the lead character of DanBam manager is specially one of a kind as I have said before you may have never seen before in a Kdrama that girls who are love rivals are not pulling each other hair apart but helping each other grow! PSJ equation with both of the girls was refreshing to see and you will keep guessing who he will end up with till a certain episode. Both the villain characters were fabulous on making us hate them and it was always a balanced battle between PSJ & villain CEO which was entertaining and unpredictable to watch.

Rest of the supporting cast got good meaty roles and through them writer nim brought some attention to Koreans bias towards transgender, foreigners & ex-convicts who want to start fresh.Kim Dong Hee of ATeen was good at his role and I am looking forward to watch him in more mature roles as he seems like a good actor but not getting roles that he deserve so far in his career. At the end, I would like to say that Itaewon Class was robbed 'Drama of the year' nom at Baeksang Awards as it deserved so but none the less its OST 'Start over' sang by Gaho will be my OST for motivating me for rest of the year.Hope for more Webtoons getting Itaewon Class like adaptations.

Amazing coming of age story of a young entrepreneur with a desire for revenge against a system that screwed him. Soundtrack is incredible; I plan to listen to this for a long time. Acting is phenomenal, but sometimes ruined by the plot forcing the actors into awkward scenes. Romance was nice in the first two episodes, ok in episodes 3-14, and extremely cringe in the final episodes. The final part of the story with the gangsters really lost the incredible pacing of the previous episodes, and was not interesting at all.

I decided to write a review for this drama after talking with my friend about how I enjoyed the show but also got very annoyed while watching it.

Okay SO basically why I watched it? There's only one correct answer, you guessed it, Park Seo Joon.
Why did I finish watching it? Park Saeroyi, the only character who deserves rights.

Okay so the plot is I loved it. Instead of the normal ML becomes a CEO, and rich overnight the story gives us the little happiness of life, slowly but surely you win the race and that's exactly what ML did. Saeroyi is so strong and downright admirable I just wanna give bby a hug.

The romance was kinda meh tbh I really don't consider it an important factor of the drama. Both FL and SFL have flaws that make you want to pause and scream but you get over it. Some of the scenes were hilarious. Yi Seo out here being petty af, I live for a fearless FL. Where she's amazingly smart and talented, she does everything for ML success, shes still young, un-experienced and a lil narrowminded, at some points I wanted tape shut her mouth. But that her character, and she does get better and stats considering other people and their feelings. The most upsetting part you have a chance to kiss the park seo joon and you keep your mouth shut as if I super glued it together for you.

SFL was a wtf character like she knew what she wanted but at the same time she had no clue what she was missing out on so rip for her. The Support cast was amazing. I loveddddd Ma Hyunyi , Lee JooYoung is forever my girl crush queeennnn. Kyung Soo was also a cute. Cant forget Tony he deserved way better treaTment tbh. My Donghee soo was so cute and I'm so glad that his character Geunsoo didnt turn evil and he pulled through. A lil shout out forJang Geunwon I hated you so much you sexy psycho. He and his dad were a match made in heaven both totally crazy.


Overall except ML my fav thing about Itaewon Class has to be the unreal OSTs . Every single song a bop .
Taehyung's sweet night, imma cry bby sounds so good. Also The Rose's ost top qualtiy stuff. Through and through
Start will forever be an anthem.

Idek if my review if helpful or not. I might have either put you off completely or made you somewhat curious. WATCH IT. It may not be perfect but is a really good one and I would def recommend it as a good binge. Be prepared to fall for Saeroyi .


xoxo
rip my typos.

Well,I started watching this drama because I was too bored.But after watching the first episode I got a different kind of vibe which made be watch the whole drama with the same excitement.To be honest,I hated Soo-Ah from the moment I saw her I just wished her not to be the female lead.The story was right upto to my expectations.And Yi-Seo is right that badass kind of lead which I love.You will just love this series once you watch it.All the actors and actresses will amaze you.I recommend all of you to watch this...

I would have given this show a 10 if it wasn't for the romance that skewed the ending. The plot is great and the actors are all amazing to the point where you very clearly see each of their characters' flaws and come to dislike each of them. The main lead (and his father) were the only exceptions for that. The Jangga family had some powerful villainous acting and I looked forward to seeing them every week. The only issue I have is with the romance. This is one of those shows that didn't need romance, but unfortunately shows with 0 romance don't seem to exist anymore (or ever??). Even if the the chemistry between the leads was absolutely necessary, it happened wayy too quickly for anyone's liking. It was almost like PSJ did a complete 180. Now obviously they tried to give parts early on showing that he was warming up to her but I don't think they were not strong enough to warrant such a change in feelings. If the director had gone for the ""I need you"" thing more than the ""I suddenly love you"" thing this wouldn't have ended with a slightly sour taste in my mouth. However, the story itself is good enough of a reason to watch this show!

I don’t usually write reviews but this drama really deserved this attention. Indeed, it’s the best k-drama I’ve seen so far, it’s absolutely not a classical love story, there’s so much behind. The story is excellent as much as the acting crew this is seriously a masterpiece in the K-drama category ! Would totally recommend it and it’s ABSOLUTELY NOT a waste of time.
To be honest if I loved it so much it’s because I felt every second of it, I’ve never been bored once while watching it, every single episode surprised me, there’s always a new event that makes the story more complete and touching. I’ve felt a lot of emotions while watching it and it’s mostly thanks to the amazing actors and not only the main ones !

A drama with a beautiful message
""You can overcome any of life's difficulties, as long as you are alive""... My favorite quote from this beautiful drama about our human condition.

There are a lot of negative reviews about this drama and based on those negative reviews I was hesitant to watch this drama. Plus the title of the drama ""Itaewon class"" sounded like a high school drama.

After watching this drama, I gave it a perfect 10, simply because of the message this drama carries and that is to strive for that special way of being that speaks truth, integrity and honor. When one is being this ""higher"" self, the race , gender, sexuality, and greed don't really matter and is subject to interpretation. This drama addressed all these issues in a nice little story line (somewhat predictable), but very much needed in today's divided world. I applaud the Korean writers and the directors to address this touchy subject and bring forth light into the sometimes a dark world created by us human beings.

SaeRoYi was almost like Ghandi and a line mentioned in one of the episodes. Some other reviewers of this drama have critiqued that there was very little transformation with SaeRoYi . I beg to differ. There was a huge transformation and that was shown through his love life. He was living so much in anger that he was not in touch with his own feelings. From my point of view, it was very fitting that SaeRoYi was attracted to SooAh who had nothing much to offer. Her way of being was shallow and SaeRoYi was way out of her league. The only problem was SaeRoYi had not discovered his self-worth yet... His motivation was ""revenge"". Because of SaeRoYi darkness, he could not see the true love that was beside him all the time.. our glorious Jo Yi Seo. At one point Jo Yi Seo tells SooAh that ""I love him so much that I can put my life on line for him"". In other words, we tend to be attracted to that person who matches our own inner vibration.

SaeRoYi transformation began when he saw that he had been following the path Jang Dae Hee had been walking and SaeRoYi 's mind and heart were not aligned. And once his heart came alive there was nothing stopping SaeRoYi. He had realized his self-worth. What I loved about this drama that the realization of self-worth is nothing unless shared with his friends..... This is where I start to cry..... Imagine a world where we honor, love and respect each other without biases and judgement.!!! I also applaud the directors the producers for choosing Kim Da Mi to play the role of Jo Yi Seo. As compared to SooAh, she is not an attractive gal but given her stand and her ability to find a diamond in the rough, makes her an amazing, beautiful woman. Again, a point made by the writers of this drama when SaeRoYi comes into his own, it is a ""no wonder"" he chose Jo Yi Seo. Here, some other reviewers have critiqued that SaeRoYi realization about Jo Yi Seo was very quick and did not feel real. I personally believe that the whole drama was laying the foundation of their relationship and all was needed a little spark to set the bomb of love to explode for SaeRoYi . So I think it was just right amount of time spent for SaeRoYi to realize his love.. but his love as for himself as well as his friends.

Writers: May be it was not intentional on your part, but to me your message love and beauty to transform a person's heart was very poignant.

In Summary.. If you like self discovery, that idealistic way of being that transforms the society, I highly recommend this drama.

Thank you all those who helped to produce this drama.

For someone who is a pure romance drama lover, I really loved this show
it thought me a lot of things and so for some very odd reasons it made me hate a few things that people do. Like
in the drama, there is something the main character doesn't like to do and hates when people do it (when you watch it, you would find out what I do not like)
at first, the only reason I watched this was because of the lead male character and because it was under the category of romance dramas which was what I like.
I didn't want to continue watching the drama cause the romance in the show was really small but for some very odd reasons I found myself wanting to watch it more

Itaewon class = trivial storyline, but excellent performances. Often times I am impressed by series and films that make me think deeply and discover things I wouldn't have on my own and I believe this drama is one of them. Itaewon class centers around a man who believed in the importance of ideas and values costing him almost everything. throughout his life, his motto and drive were pushed by hate and the strife of revenge and on that path, he discovered something much more.

The storyline as mentioned earlier is quite trivial, I have watched dramas similar if not 98% followed in suit, but the joint work each character and the expression on the smallest performances were what made Itaewon class a very emotional experience. The depiction of first love and its innocence when lost to hardships of life, and how hard work pays off no matter the period in which the hardships are stretched. Small lessons like that made the impact of the drama heavier

Even with little things like the change of looks of the character but the constant physical appearance of Park Saeroyi over the span of 14years showed how everyone changed in character but little of his ideals and goals changed. These little things details made the drama so much more than it already was. A lot of reviews focus on the aspect of how the main lead was made to look good and how unimportant some roles were.

A protagonist is made to appeal to the hearts of viewers and what you take away is up to your palette, but the supporting characters really taught me a lot especially Kwon Nara and Kim Dong Hee who showed growth in character when faced with hardships and how many people prioritize different things In life. Even the characters that addressed a lot of issues that are faced in South Korea like racism and gender rights were also tackled in this film teaching a lot of people valuable lessons.

Not to mention the lovely soundtrack contributed by various artists and the interludes and instrumentals by composers who have a talent for days. I believe when I listen to the soundtrack of a drama of the basis of the context and internalize it, that piece of work is truly great. shout out to Kim Feel and studio curiosity for blessing my ears every day.

I personally learned a lot from this drama and it made me think about what I would have done if I was in any of their places and not to mention Park Bo Gum's cameo. Itaewon Class makes you reflect and have fun at the same time, watch it you won't regret it!

DEEP AND MEANINGFUL VIEWING IN MANY WAYS
Please be warned that this review contains spoilers. My focus in this article is primarily to consider the writing of Jo Kwang-jin. He is the author of the webtoon upon which ""Itaewon Class"" is based. He also wrote the script for the series.

Kwang-jin has done an exceptional job. I am full of admiration for him. The drama is intelligently written and sequenced with flair between main-story, back-story, side-story and parallel-story. A number of his characters are quirky and they enliven the entertainment. All the main characters come from a position of social weakness. For example: a black Korean who continually has to authenticate his nationality, two sons who are emotional casualties of a ruthless and domineering father, an illegitimate child, an orphan, etc.; even the billionaire villain was a starving street-child in his early years.

I was particularly impressed that Ma Hyun-yi, one of Kwang-jin’s characters was transgender and that Kwang-jin allows her to shine brightly in the sun. This is a major moment in Korean dramas given South Korea’s continuing reluctance to celebrate that, just like skin-colour or eye-colour or height (etc.), gender identity is a characteristic with which one is born and that ‘normal’ is a word that covers many possibilities. The events that culminated in Ma Hyun-yi’s coming-out as transgender on national television were riveting viewing, and the script and Lee Joo-young’s acting were superb. Anyone who watches this scene with a humane mindset will be emotionally touched by seeing what unconditional love looks like between genuine friends who sincerely care for one another and who see deeper than a person’s surface.

Park Seo-jun is one of my favourite actors and, in this role, he shows the depth and breadth of his abilities. As the lead actor, Park Seo-jun creates a Park Sae-ro-yi who is an uncomplicated man and who stays true his friends 100% of the time -- he never blames nor criticises them. This seems like a simple acting task on the face of it but as one follows Park Seo-jun from episode to episode, it is easy to appreciate that in acting Sae-ro-yi, Park Seo-jun has to dig deep. Sae-ro-yi wholeheartedly trusts those around him and he leads the cast when it comes to demonstrating unconditional love. Sae-ro-yi also never hesitates to accept responsibility however heavy that burden will be. Kwang-jin’s life-philosophies that are delivered to the audience via Sae-ro-yi are truly a gift to the world. In Park Sae-ro-yi, Kwang has created a template for what constitutes an immensely decent human being. It would be a wonderful world -- a really wonderful world, in fact -- if there were more people like Sae-ro-yi around.

In addition: the makeup is first class (watch how Jang Dae-hee ages and becomes increasingly ill); the soundtrack is exceptional and deserves special recognition; all actors create believable and authentic characters; the direction and the production are magnificent. I must also make mention of Ahn Bo-hyun’s acting. His performance as Jang Geun-won is incredible. I have never felt so sorry for the bad guy as I did for Geun-won. It is to Jo Kwang-jin’s writing-credit and Ahn’s acting that Geun-won comes to life as such a deeply flawed character with whom the audience can feel angry, sad and sorry. I never stopped hoping that he would see the error of his ways and change.

There is no doubt in my mind at all that any viewer who watches this show will we richly rewarded if they look beyond simple entertainment and straightforward romance. This is a memorable and outstanding drama. I anticipate that many awards will wander its way. I don't normally re-watch shows but I might make an exception for this one.

No drama can beat this drama! It shows that no one should ever give up even if it takes 5 years or 10 years, it’s all about believing yourself and that’s exactly what Park Saeroyi showed. Many people hate Jo Yiseo’s character because she’s a “baddie” and she’s “disrespectful” but that’s exactly why I love her character, they need to show that even girls can be strong. Even though he’d character was cocky I really liked how she believed that she would end up making Saeroyi fall in love with her, even when she was loosing confidence she still promised to be by his side. The fact that Saeroyi finally gave up his pride and went in his knees for Daehee after so many years just so he could save Yiseo from danger shows how much she means to him I really enjoyed their chemistry in the drama and the last few episodes made it even better! Jang Geun Won really annoyed me the most ? Like he’s so handsome but he doesn’t know when to give up. I also really am glad that Jang Daehee (the chairman) finally went on his knees even though Saeroyi did it first it’s worst for Daehee because he’s the chairman and he was asking for forgiveness after his company was failing! Enough with those character i’d like to mention Ma Hyeonyi!! She’s so freakin beautiful like how can someone look so stunning with short hair??? The drama did not just display about working hard but it showed how so many people are against transgender and her character just played a big role to how our society is! Over all I don’t know why people have this drama so much because I enjoyed every episode! It’s really worth the watch!

I was kind of hesitating whether I should watch this but here I am. It starts well and hopes it will end well. I've always liked the acting abilities of Park Seo Jung and wanted to see him in this type of drama as I loved him in Hwarang. But it wasn't what I thought it was. I did not like the ending! In my first review, I gave it an 8 but after I did my research and understood what this drama was about... I changed my review to a 10.

storyline: The storyline has its twists but it is continual in one thought. It's is not so much revenge or avenge but for a person to take responsibility for what one has done. I wished everyone even those in corporate or government to take responsibility for what it is intentional or not intentional. What I love about this is the diversity of actors and how it brings that diversity onto the screen. What I hate the most is discrimination of a person's skin tones, gender, age, disabilities, weight, height, the poor and middle class and religion. The awareness is in this drama! I understand a little more as I couldn't stop thinking about this drama. For a minute, I was angered because I thought Park Seo Joon was killed off. That's what I get for not watching Ep 15-16.

I didn't understand and asked myself why Itaewon? Was that all true what I was watching? I did a research and found this link on youtube. you should watch it which has changed my mind on how I rated it. I understand South Korea a little more. Itaewon is the only place in South Korea where you can feel Freedom and Diversity and that was explained in this drama but not as clear as I wanted. So here is the link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OutGsIwEg5o It's in English so no need for subtitles.

It always comes down to a triangle romance in these dramas but were no females fighting so that is a good thing. I wanted Park Seo Joon's character to end up with Oh Soo Ah. The chemistry was not there for Park Seo Joon and Kim Da Mi. The kiss was there for Park Seo Joon but I'm sorry not for Kim Da Mi.

Where do I even begin with this drama? How do I begin to describe how excellent it is? How it made me feel? There was no question that I had to give it a 10/10. Everything about it is perfect. There is nothing I would change. The plot is fantastic, the characters are amazing, and it has THE best OST literally ever (I mean c'mon The Rose and Kim Taehyung have songs for it so like how could it not be?)

The Plot: Perfectly executed. I usually hate time skips and this drama had a good amount of them but omg they used them perfectly. It all worked so well together. The story unfolded in an emotional incredible way. I was invested in every second, every word.

Characters: The acting on this drama was so incredible omg. They all created such incredible characters, Each and every character had immense depth, and development. Each one was incredibly portrayed and aged as the show progressed. I use the term ""aged"" only to mean they each changed. Changed, in incredible ways. Whether they learned through love, hardship, or mistakes, each character grew and developed and it was incredible to watch. Even the characters that we are meant to hate, I loved. I loved to hate them.

Representation: I have to bring this up because never before have I seen a Korean drama with such blatant representation. This show brought up things other series never dared to touch. Whether it be the taboo against LGBT persons in Korea, or the existence of racism that still exists, this drama covered it in such a bold and emotional way. This drama was so important for that fact alone. It made a bold and beautiful statement and did it beautifully.

Honestly this drama can be enjoyed by anyone. It's set up in such a way that you don't have to be a fan of anything in it. I have absolutely no interest in dramas about restaurants, or business, or revenge. None. But it didn't matter because this drama was so much more than that. Romance, humor, friendship, hardship, death, tragedy, loss, injustice, unrequited love, loyalty, growing up, perseverance, and love. This drama wasn't about business, or revenge, or romance. This was a portrayal or what it means to live.

I enjoyed watching this drama. Above anything else, it's about sticking to your values and yout own self. Friendship and loyalty. Which is good, and interesting to watch. Specially when you see the characters influencing each other's actions. Even though the male lead is presenting as this upstanding guy with amazing morals, there are times in which he moves things according to his endgoal, even if he knows deep down that it's probably hurting somebody (like how he kept coming back to the ex-cop or in a way took advantadge of a character's feelings for him to keep her by his side when she could've have better offers). And the opposite thing applies, one of the characters is cynical and more of in a gray area but learns from watching him and I like that they start to enjoy live and human interactions together. She says it in the final chapter, neither of them knew what human warmth was until they tried to built it together.
I liked that the drama talked about racism, transphobia, ageism and so on, but I find it was a little shallow on its approach. Things don't solve themselves by miracle and knowing how the world, specially Corea, is about those topics, I don't really believe for example in the scene in which a character can easily say she is trans and everybody cheers on her. It's difficult to find that scene realistic, but I want to believe that there'll be a time in which it won't matter. Like the show said, you don't have to prove yourself, your choices, and in my opinion you don't owe people an explanation. I also don't like how easily forgiven the character who outed her was. Like I wouldn't even do that to somebody I considered my enemy, even less to a friend and in a society like that, wtf.
Other issue I had is that I do like the endgame couple and I was sold in why they fell for each other. He broaded her worldview and made her want to live and have values to believe in and work to achieve them by watching him and then later on wanting to fight for him. And she was his pillar, he's always done everything by himself, putting barriers even among his friends, but little by little she became a part of himself without his notice. I understand that, so that's why I liked the pairing. I just would've liked more scenes of them in the 2020 timeline pre-kidnapping in which he catches himself having feelings for her he can't quite understand yet. I think the writers clun to the love square-sometimes pentagon for way longer than they should've have done so.
I wouldn't say this is the best drama I've ever watched, but it was worth watching and I'm glad they're starting to include social issues like the ones they did. I also understand that there might be limits as far of what the writers can say on tv, and that even having a trans character and a character with a darker skin tone it's already a step forward.

I can't believe it's over. I'm completely absorbed now. From now on I'm worried that a drama like this will be made.Acting and filming and all the scenes selected and the story were all great
This season was great, please make the second season
Kim Da mi and Park Seo Joon played really well
I love Kim Da mi so much she's so cute. I felt every single moment of good and bad. I think the Korean film industry is getting better and better than Europe
And finally good luck
Itaewon class team I wish you the best of luck
thanks for every thing.?

Fresh and Unique experience. Different from other dramas!
First of all, I'd like to say about how amazing the cast is. And I was swayed by the uniqueness of the theme in this story. From outside, it may seem as if it's a rom-com but to be honest, till way over the second half I was wondering who will Park Sae-royi end with, because it's that uncertain!

There are a lot of things that may seem 'obvious' but it still makes you want to keep watching and see how it goes. Alot of time it feels 'Ah?! I wonder how will he get there..' but the process is not disappointing at all!

The drama is fresh and unique because it's romance is not cliche and cringy. It's not rainbows and flowers and romance is not the very main focus of the drama, it's only the integral part that drives the characters, apart from Sae-royi who is only revenge-driven. The characters are not even remotely perfect and are full of flaws, yet they are surviving and co-existing as they interact with each other. It's not very distant from reality. Everyone here has there own values and beliefs, they make their own mistakes and stick to their principles, some fail alot, some are full of themselves and some become negative along the way while some don't change at all.

It deals with a lot of real life issues as well which I feel― in no way ― is over-exaggerated or too much. It touches the subject of transphobia and LGBT+ in a very mature and rather subtle way that would be socially accepted amongst the korean viewerbase as the subject of LGBT+ is a very sensitive one. This show also (rather first time I'm seeing and it was a little odd/out of place) subtly deals with racism. I came to love Toni, however his character was not properly placed or used so that's a bummer. Also ― realizing Sociopath is a mental condition though throughout the show, Yi-seo was hated because of that (even I did till the last few eps), but if only her condition would be properly evaluated, the viewers would have been able to sympathise a little with her behaviour. She's like a yandere out of anime, much like Gasai Yuno.

The OST is no doubt one of the best to exist! Whenever 'Start' played, I felt so happy. It was one of the reasons that kept me bound to the show. Also, if you relate, you'd see overly emotional OST in a lot of dramas that doesn't even fit well with the scenes but I can't say the same for Itaewon Class. The songs suited perfectly, were not so overly emotional or overly-emphasised, and kept the ambiance really perfect.

My favourite characters are Min-jung and Hyun-yi! And also the granny. Love them all too much <3

Overall, this drama is really cool. It's interesting and keeps you bound even when you feel as if you know what's going to happen. You just feel like 'how' will it happen, it's thrilling and also unpredictable at times. The real fun is in seeing how everything unrolls.

PS: Sweet Night <3

Live without regrets
Purpose. Meaning. Justice. Revenge. Loyalty. Betrayal. Pride. These are the themes of Itaewon all rolled into one. This series is not without faults, I agree that there are big plot holes here and there and the ending was not fully satisfying. Those however should not take away from the overall storyline and superb acting of the cast. The story is about how people choose to live their lives and how their choices somehow affects how others live theirs..

The FL’s story is the most interesting for me, she’s young and has everything she wanted at her fingertips, effortlessly it seemed, yet finds that life is such a chore to live. She didn’t see any purpose in living and would rather not have been born. She eventually found purpose upon meeting Saeroyi, Somehow this simple-minded, but determined, man ten years her senior warmed her cold heart and made her see the colours of life, They fell in love in the most convoluted way possible.

Overall I find this drama complicated at the best of times yet very real and honest. A little over the top at times but hey if I get to see Park Seo Joon’s rom-com antics then I’m all for it.

As we know it's about a young boy who is up against the no. 1 conglomerate in his country.
In the beginning episodes we are shown how he has some values and principles in life , and he is strong enough to achieve what he wants. The start is so promising that you know that the end is gonna be nothing less but epic.
We are shown the relationship that the main character Park Sae Ro Yi ( park seo joon) has with his father , which is beautifully shown and executed by the actors , and they make you believe , and you can invest in their relationship.
( Through out we feel the pain of his father's death and love they had , it is that good, we feel what the character feels how he felt the surge of revenge )
We also see Soo Ah ( kwon nara) as Ro Yi classmate, friend , and his first love, and its so cute( I was rooting for them till the end ) .
We are also introduced to the main protagonist Jang who looks and feels bad, you right away start hating him and we just know it's a great fight waiting for us.
Now the story moves forward 3 years and we still see the same Ro Yi strong , with a plan to take down Jangga co. which excites you more.
7 years of hard work and now he owns a pub at Itaewon his first step towards the end . We are introduced to some new characters like Jo Yi Seo ( also a love interest for park sea ro yi) who is young, strong , cleaver, mean and really smart. And wants to help Ro Yi to take his revenge cause she is madly in love with him. ( I enjoyed watching her in the beginning but towards the end it was more of an irritating experience) .
In future episodes we see the story moving forward and the character building and it is soo good , it's a rollercoaster ride and you're gonna enjoy it. Sae Ro Yi as strong and positive as ever and really inspiring, Soo Ah still cute who is working at jangga co. And struggling between jangga and Ro Yi. It is her character i relate and feel alive. Yi seo seemed nice, smart and psycho but i just couldn't like her. There are other supporting characters who have done a great job and you enjoy their part .
Upto the 13 episode the show was really good and i couldn't just get enough , but then some things went highway , like the main villen getting old and is not that strong anymore ( it somewhere killed the hype for the ending in me) , Kim Dong Hee turning into a confusing bad person and Yi Seo.
The last two episodes weren't satisfactory for me as we saw some major changes which we didn't see coming in Park Sae Ro Yi who had these values, principles and love for people , but now he is just another business man . We see Chairman Jang so week that he kneels befor Ro Yi who don't give a shit and i couldn't help but feel bad for the villen ( which should have been satisfying ) . We see Ro Yi falling for Yi Seo which was sudden and we had not built that in our minds through the journey.
Overall it was a good journey ( was not disappointing ) , the acting was good , story was good , OST were really good , the end wasn't great but it was worth watching and we also had PARK BO GUM with a cameo, which was lovely.
I would suggest everyone to go and watch it.

Let's start with the good stuff first.

The first half Itaewon Class is amazing! The acting is on point, the story line is great, and I think that you can truly feel the emotions of certain actors (*cough cough* Park Seo Joon) when they are on screen. Although I have watch many K-Dramas, I have never seen one with a black character (that wasn't an extra) or a transgender character. I think that was very refreshing. Another thing that was refreshing was that no matter what obstacle the IC/Danbam group went through, they always came back to support and comfort one another. I loved that so much. But for some reason things started changing half way through the show.

My biggest issue was Jang Geun Soo. His random change from being the nice innocent part of IC/Danbam group to being the antagonist was so weird and kind of annoying. I understand that he liked Yi Seo for a very a long time and was trying to win her heart, but does it make sense to destroy everything that she had worked for and think that she'll come running into your arms? Like, what? She even told him that she doesn't like him in the way he likes her but he still continues to pursue her because of something she literally said YEARS ago. Get a grip dude. His character became increasingly annoying because he made it clear that the only reason why he was doing all of these terrible things was to get Yi-Seo who had publicly said on multiple occasions that liked, no LOVED, someone else.

And then Oh Soo Ah. She was just an annoying and forgettable character also. She would do all of these things to hurt Danbam but then would go and apologize to Sae Ro Yi right after. Her apologies meant nothing to me, which made them even more irritating. I understand that the chairman was the one making her do all of that stuff but still, why did Sae Ro Yi continue to forgive her? There were some moments that I think that he was just way too nice. He should have dropped her earlier and stopped forgiving her. She is hurting him on purpose. There's nothing stopping her for leaving Janga and going to Danbam (I can almost guarantee that she would get a job there if she asked for one). Instead she just continues to hurt She Ro Yi and Danbam. And then out of no where, she is now just another pushover Janga employee when Geun Soo shows up? Huh?? She was the chairman's right hand woman for so long but since Geun Soo made a prediction that was wrong, she's not anymore? The show just started confusing her character at the half way point and now she is just as annoying as Geun Soo.

This is going to turn into a long rant if I continue.

I haven't finished the whole show yet, I am almost done. I don't hate it, but there are definitely some characters that are getting on my last nerve. They are just so annoying and random at times.

I'll leave another review once I finish the show, but so far I would recommend it to others. It's not on my top 10 K-Dramas list but it is pretty good.

Started out well but turned out annoying
the start of this drama I really loved the cast and the story and the whole aesthetic of the show, the character and issues brought to screen was done really well but towards the middle everything turned south, the story writer really messed up .....ahhhhh. What annoyed me the most was character development of pretty much all the characters, it could have been sooo much better instead they dragged the characters and story to be stuck in this cliché love triangle and the bright characters in the starting of the show are then shown as just jealous and pathetic losers. The story went from a group of these amazing young people working so hard to achieve a goal and how wanting to seek revenge can bring out all sorts of things from a person to this pathetic love story. eww. I love watching park see joon and he did a great job along with all the other actors but cannot believe how they thought the ending story line was good enough to bring to the audience, I just can not like this drama, I tried to finish it but I just can't continue watching it.

This drama is so progressive, that even as a Westerner, it surprised me because I wasn't used to seeing such diversity and inclusivity in even shows produced in the States/Canada/UK. It's a true gem that everyone should watch at least once.

The story apparently took a few detours from the original webtoon that it was based on, but this also makes it stand firmly on its own. The storyline was so well crafted, manipulating the audience into cheering for the heroes of this tale and despising the villains. This is a very typical hero vs. villain saga - Saeroyi is the underdog with firm, unwavering principles and that natural born leadership that will make you a loyal follower of his in no time and CEO Jang is that bastard big man who takes advantage of the power he has. Because of this approach, and the graphics used, it does seem very comic-book like. As someone who loves comic books with a burning passion, this made the show all the more entertaining to me. For those of you who do not, it may seem a little cartooney at times, but don't worry, if you hang in there I promise it's worth it.

There was remarkable consistency in the storyline, which I greatly appreciated. Heck, even the side characters all got justice in their own way. The writers tied up every single loose end, which made watching this drama through to the end all the more worthwhile. One thing I will say about the storyline is that it deals with some very unfortunate themes (imprisonment, crime, violence, death, privilege, etc). All of these themes are delivered to us through rose-tinted glass. They are very real and the characters definitely feel the force of them, but we as viewers have the pleasure of simply watching it all from our comfortable homes on our expensive laptops/TVs/phones.

Enough about the story - the acting.
With a cast as strong as this, you can expect strong results. Park Seo Joon particularly deserves a shoutout. I'm convinced at this point this man can literally act as anything and he will pull it off with perfect precision and consistency, which is exactly what he did in the drama. The rest of the cast was remarkable too, and even if you hated the character, you couldn't help but love the acting (which was the case with Ahn Bo Hyun with me, hated his character but damn did he do a good job!).

Areas to Improve: Yi Seo. Kim Da Mi's character. I'm certain other reviews have complained about her already but I think we need to drill this in a bit more. Though I appreciated that she was supposed to be the polar opposite of Saeroyi and provide some storyline tension that way, she was such an annoying character to watch that at times I wished she would just be removed from the drama altogether. As well, something that is introduced to us about her in the very first episode is that she is a sociopath. If you keep this in mind for the whole of the drama, it is bearable. BUT, this fact was only introduced at the beginning and I don't believe it is revisited. It also wasn't really brought up at the end either nor do we ever see her go to a counsellor ever again. Some consistency with the sociopath arch would've been nice to see.

As well, Yi Seo promotes a very unhealthy message about crushes. Try, try, try again and eventually they'll fall in love with you? She kept pestering Saeroyi to the point that it made him uncomfortable and kept shoving everyone else away in a very possessive and insensitive manner. I understand that it is part of her character traits, but still, an incredibly unhealthy and immature message. (Though keep in mind, many other dramas do the same with male leads instead...)

Finally, the love square. I really appreciated the fact that this drama didn't jump into the romance right away and kept it on the backburner as Saeroyi went about accomplishing his goals. It was pushed to the sidelines in the story because it also wasn't a priority for the main character. Makes sense, right? However, the love square that was constantly dangled in front of us was so tedious, predictable and annoying to watch. Frankly, I believe that it should've been pushed to the sidelines even more.

Don't let these things deter you from watching the drama however. It truly was a gem of a show and as a bonus, was the most diverse show that I have ever seen. It did feel a bit like checking boxes at one point (got an LGBTQ+ person? check. got a coloured person? check?) but still, there is no other drama so far doing it like Itaewon Class, so props to the entire cast for making inclusivity a priority. It truly is a good example for others to follow moving forward.

And finally, I'd be horribly amiss to not mention the visuals or the OST. I never once skipped the intro theme, partly because of the music but also because of the beautiful graphic art depicting all of the characters. The aesthetic of the pub and really the whole environment around them was beautiful (truly like seeing the world through rose-tinted glass!). The OST is INCREDIBLE. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT SO MUCH. So much so, that it is my new favourite drama OST of all time.

From the story to the acting to the visuals/OST, this drama despite its flaws is a revolutionary piece that deserves a watch immediately. Truly, a 21st century show.

Itaewon Class is a beautiful well drawn out drama. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect, but it still continue to be interesting and enjoyable.

Most people hate it because their hate stem from their dislike to the female lead. You will see despicable phrases to describe her, but don't worry it's not true or entirely true. They completely wiped out all other parts of her character as if those qualities don't exist. The writer is a pro. Now the writer may lack focused on other areas (nobody is perfect), but do you really believe the writer will make his FL so despicable? You see only a few people hate our female lead (if all the people who view this drama positively were to comment, not a single negative comment will be visible in succession). Don't worry about what they say about the FL, she is fine.

Anyway what do I like about this drama?
1. Story Flow. In the first episode, I already knew I was going to love this drama. Itaewon Class is well paced and keeps you interested.

2. Acting. Everyone in importance did super well. There's something about Park Seo Joon that's really captivating haha, I think the answer is he's so good at acting and at the same time maintain this air of charm. And thanks to this show, I get to see a new talented face: Kim Dami. She's pretty amazing. And of course our villains, they were awfully good at being evil.

3. Characters. We have a wide range of characters that reflect society to some degree. There are interesting leads with touching backstories/thoughts/actions that makes you care about them. Realistically, in life not everyone in a relationship are good saint like people. Even the people who had bad attitudes based on the environment they grew up in can eventually change and find love. All kinds of people exist in this world, and for Itaewon Class to show a quite opposite female lead was refreshing and interesting.

4. A bonus: Devoted Lover Character. We got FL who is devoted to the morally path ML. Who doesn't want a person who love them a lot (but will try to respect your values (assuming you are a moral person) as long as you say it)? And kinda cool, but there's like a direct opposite relationship. I guess you could say there's one other character A who is devoted to another character B, but character B is not morally path.

5. Cinematography. The shots are beautiful. You will be well fed.

6. Music. We got a lot. The musics are really good too and served their purpose well.

What I don't like about this drama?
1. Villains. I'm just not buying some of their characteristics that the author implanted to them because based on their history/achievements/orlackofachievements it just doesn't seem plausible. But I realized in the end there is a chance for the villain to become that way, it's just that it wasn't a high chance imo...so maybe if the chance was higher (by adding more compelling reasons or showing that a reason was compelling), I would accept it more.

2. Some weird meetings. character A meets character B, but if you think about it character B could have denied the invitation but why did character B accept the invitation or why was character B not notified of the invitation or be surprised???...idk so it's kinda like forced meeting by the writer.

3. That one plot device. The author made a certain event too easy to occurred, that it doesn't seem realistic. Without spoiling: at the end of episode 15.

However, I really like the drama overall, so I can overlook these things.

What I wished was included (but it does not affect my rating)?
1. expand the episodes to 18. The pacing will still be the same, with the ending of episode 16 occurring in episode 18, but I want more scenes of interactions between characters and of course between our leads. I believe in their character development, but adding more scenes will create a stronger foundation. And like I said about the villains, make a bit more scenes to explain why they're so twisted because I'm not really buying it. idk maybe I'm not supposed to understand the villain because their mind are twisted and that's why this don't affect my rating.

decided to watch this bc its famous
the headline says it all, that's why i've decided to watch it. i'm half of the episode one and yeah they talk about depression and things which made me interested since i also feel that way, maybe it could give me advice or some but when i'm like at the timestamp 30:00+ i realized that it's too long and boring. yeah, i dropped it that fast. some ppl said that they felt the same way so it's up to u if u will watch it or not. i think it eats too much of ur time tho. ANYWAY the good thing here is they also said that it's just like that so that u'll get the pov of each character but i just think its too long for me so i dropped it.

I came for Jung Hae In, and I stayed for the issues
This is just beautiful, like a walk in to some pretty cold waters from a beautiful beach, slowly getting deeper, and deeper, while the winds rise up to the perfect storm....

If you are looking for a comedy this is not the place to look, even if it does use quite a bit of humour this is certainly a drama dealing with some pretty heavy issues and will probably make you feel a whole lot of anger, sorrow and may even make you cry. The early episodes will probably make you laugh too but the further you get the deeper the issues and by the fifth episode you will have been close to tears, kept on your toes and angry at the world.

What I love about this drama, besides the obvious presence of Jung Hae In, is that they dare to show the complexity to the characters, how one thing leads to another and tackle important issues such as bullying, suicide, group mentality, domestic violence, poverty and the all important bystanders in a beautiful way by using all means available. Music, cinematography, lighting all work perfectly to set the mood and are just up my alley. So I rated it with ten stars. However you should know this is my type of drama and I am extremely bias towards Jung Hae In. But if you like me enjoy issues, dark humor and Jung Hae In this drama will leave you hoping for a second season, and thinking it was way to short , they should have given it at least 10 episodes instead of the short 6.

For fellow Jung Hae In fans his character here (as well as the drama ) are more like Prison playbook than the flirty guy in Something in the rain, and yes he does this role perfectly (like always)

All in all I definitely recommend this to those who are not afraid to dip in to some dark deep waters...

P.s I laughed every time Jun Ho repeated his name and rank... I hope you will too

Edit: make sure to stay all the way, the epilog in the end is really important and worth watching (even though jhi is not present)

Laughing through misery.
Saying it is a heavy watch would be an understatement. Not only will the show fuel you with anger, it will not help you calm down by the end.

Showing the grim reality of the broken military system, sprinkled with comedy, made this quite an emotional ride. We are shown how a few good people are not enough to fix the environment where bad behavior is rewarded.

While it was amazing to watch the main characters trying to make even small changes, at some point they've hit the wall and needed to face the reality of how powerless they are - how they are also part of the problem. We follow a patient and introverted Joon Ho and confident and street smart Ho Yul, as they try to find and bring back defectors. During their job they face a lot of issues ranging from external issues like unsupportive and corrupted superiors to internal struggles revolving around morality and their own principles.

Warning needed - D.P. is filled with abuse, both physical and emotional, and justice is usually not served. The drama shows how it is, without trying to make the topic more approachable and easy to digest. You will be left with building up frustration, and yet glad, you decided to watch it till the end.

The cast did an amazing job. Everyone delivered both the emotional and the comedic parts well. I laughed, I cried, I shouted with anger. Biggest props to Koo Kyo Hwan for his portrayal of Ho Yul. Outstanding performance that made me fall in love with the character.

The production and the writing left nothing to desire. Mixing the tragic aspects of reality with well fitted comedic bits was done in a good taste, not taking away from the serious topic tackled.

Overall, one of the best shorter dramas of 2021. Not an easy watch, might be too much for some people - was almost too much for me. It won't leave you on a hopeful note, but it is a story worth witnessing.

Action thriller + Comedy feat. Tragic ending
D. P. (Deserter Pursuit) is a short Netflix Korean Drama which basically is a action thriller accompanied by comedy and shades of military life, which illustrates truth and tragedy. With 6 episodes of 50 minutes, this drama surely creates some impact on millions of hearts by making us think again about the harsh reality that negligibly changes.

STORY & PLOT:
The drama is about D. P. Officers who are a group of specific personnels in the army assigned to go out of the bases to catch soldiers who have deserted or escaped from the training camps for various reasons.

The drama involves Ahn Joon Ho, a newly enlisted guy, serving his 2 years mandatory military service, who is appointed as a DP officer to replace someone and is then accompanied by Han Ho Yul, who partner each other to hunt down the absconding military personnels. Sergent Park Bum Goo is the section chief for DP dept. Captain Im Ji Sup is newly transfered trainer for the base.

Given that the drama is of only 6 episodes with short duration, it's difficult to narrate even the gist but I will try. So In the drama, Ahn Jun Ho and Han Ho Yul can be seen going out to catch deserting officers. They have to investigate and look for traces by of the soldiers by different means, even so they had to spend money. And after catching them, they come back to the base.

Along with it, their is a main plotline that continues simultaneously which is about Private Cho Suk Bong, who escapes more than once and even commits criminal offence. The drama ends with his case which was a tragic one.

CAST & ACTING:
Well, our favourite oppa Jung Hae In plays Ahn Jun Ho and obviously he's an great actor who did his job right. This character of him also similar to what he had played in Prison Playbook, to a great extent. He never responded to violence and injustice but is passionate about whatever he's given to do. With a bad relationship with his family, he thrives to live well.

Koo Kyo Hwan plays Han Ho Yul and I honestly fell in love with his acting and how he looked in here, especially his hairstyle and accent of dialogue delivery. He's someone who can't stand injustice either but since he can't directly object it, he tries to prevent things in his own way.

Sergent Park Bum Goo is played by Kim Sung Kyun, my personal favourite and a great actor. I usually prefer him in comedy roles but he can ace any character given. His character is a morally upright man who can go to lengths to do his job, but anyways in the right way. He might be strict with his underlings at workplaces, he cares for them to a great deal.

DIRECTION & WRITING:
Direction is cool. Everything has been well executed. They did a good job in organizing and synchronization of events. There is not much to sound editing as they go bland mostly, but those subtle thriller editings and upbeat background scores at suitable places were good enough to keep the thrill going.

Writing is nice as well. Story progression and plot development is quite good. The showcase of humanitarian values in between, was a great idea. The illustration of harsh things like bullying and abuse inside the military bases leading to desertion, hierarchical competitions between higher authorities, isolation & violation, senior complexity are very well done. Corruption and the idea of hiding truth are also touched.

CONCLUSION:
I feel the drama is not just meant for entertainment or thrilling, it also asks us to look behind the scenes and think how cruel it is to go through injustice and yet having no way to escape other than escaping from life. I'm sure it'll create some impacting by making the audience think how wrong it's to bully and abuse someone who is weak. It also demands the change in system and regulations in the military laws and to create a safer environment for not just people serving mandatory military service, also for the professional army personnels.

Overally a good drama and worth the one time watch.

Definition of military's reality
D.P. is a short drama but it still manages to be entertaining and bring up some real military life issues at the same time.


It has a lot of dark, raw, gore and emotional moments, thus it’s not a light drama. However, there are also action and some stress-relief scenes perfectly balanced which make the drama easier to watch without destroying the serious tone of it. As the episodes go by, the atmosphere gets heavier and heavier. The ground is being prepared for the most intense moment of the series: the finale.

The production is pretty decent and meticulous so D.P. is pleasant to watch. There are many nice sceneries, shots, scene transitions and also, the colors and filters of the drama have been selected carefully.

The main color is yellow, the color of madness, sickness, mental illness, egoism, betrayal and caution. The more serious and dark scenes have basically cool colors but in general, D.P. is full of vivid colors similar to a comic’s color palette. The colors, in combination with the old styled (mainly jazz) soundtrack of the series, give a retro vibe. It feels like an old comic is brought to life. Every scene is like a moving comic frame and every scene transition is like turning the page.

The acting is remarkable and almost all the characters are interesting and well-written. Every actor did a great job at portraying a different character of the military corps and all of them look quite realistic. The two main characters, Ahn Joon Ho, the newbie-robot soldier who is doing everything by the book, and Han Ho Yul, the warmhearted, social and funny person that everyone wants as a friend, created a very dynamic duo.

D.P. did actually a pretty good job at highlighting the raw reality of the military and the mental deterioration that causes to humans. Enlisting in the military is like entering another reality, the reality of war. There, public laws do not exist. Human rights do not exist, only the law of the superior, the law of the powerful. Military training tries to simulate the conditions of war by letting bullying and harassment be without punishment. Although this is limited now, it still remains, and this has to change.

Taking Away The Romanticism Of The South-Korean Militia…

Military enlistment is a topic which is often swept under the carpet in South-Korean culture, or romanticised in stories near the finale as part of the “ long wait” between lovers at the end of a drama storyline . ( The drama itself presenting a parody of this scene when a young woman causes a scene to promote her “ love” for her boyfriend enrolling only to present a stark contrast in the circumstances afterwards .)

PD and screenwriter Han Jun Hee as well as screenwriter Kim Bo Tong takes an anti-romantic ‘Fullmetal Jacket’ - style approach to the short series ‘ D.P’ The enlisted men alongside Jun Ho are viewed as nothing more that batch coded weapons and those who leave their side are viewed as merely loose-cannons without names or dignity . Yet the drama is unsurprisingly without director Han Jun Hee’s wry sense of comedy either- sardonic and satirical rather than sweet and slapstick, but woven well into the introduction of characters and the narrative.

The cast undeniably helped to make the storyline come to life. Actor Jung Jae In did a brilliant job ( like the rest of the cast) as main lead Jun Ho ( Jung Hae In). A troubled youth who shares his own conflicts and troubles before enlisting in the army and being forced into the military defect arrest team , Jun Ho becomes morally conflicted over the reasons why men leave the army for various personal reasons and the dire corruption of the authorities. From romantic heroism turned tragic to bittersweet realism, the duller and stark cinematography presents a harsher and prominent message to viewers about these stories shown per episode .

On a more critical note the drama isn’t without its flaws either. Whilst the messages are prominent as a criticism against the authorities and corruption ‘ D.P.’ began falling short especially after the 3/4 mark. The acting notably did degrade slightly as well as delivered line deliverances, and the pacing began to struggle Adding to the dilemma was defining more about Jun Ho’s calling of identity from given inferences in more vivid detail to explain his ideologies, as well as during the last few episodes. On the other hand the ending was certainly unexpected-profound and helping to define the key messages of the drama, but will likely leave viewers with their jaws dropping.

Overall a fairly good watch though admittedly not for the faint hearted . The pacing and more definitive character writing were sadly slight letdowns for this drama but ‘ D.P’ does make up for it with a profound and critique about the South-Korean military enlistment scheme, as well as using a catchy OST and moody cinematography to present these messages clearly .

One of the most impactful dramas I've seen in a while!
Note: It doesn't really contain spoilers of the story, but I wanted to list the trigger warnings (that may cover on various scenarios that happen) that might be important for someone to know before they jump into this series.

I don't generally write reviews much, as it's hard to find the time/passion lately! But when a series or movie manages to amaze me to the point I actually WANT to scream about how much I like it, then it's hard to resist writing about it just in case somebody might be wondering whether this drama is for them.

I won't deny, this is probably one of the heaviest series I've watched in a while, as it touches on some topics that can be quite hard to take in, so firstly, here's a list of trigger warnings of the themes you can expect before you decide to take the plunge; suicide, bullying, depression, excessive violence, gore, hazing, sexual harrassment, blood, abuse, genocide, kidnapping, torture... please let me know if there's any I missed out!

This short drama has fast became one of my favorites after I binged it in two days flat (everyone who knows me is aware I usually can't concentrate on more than one ep a day of something lmao). From the outset, the cinematography and the way it was filmed and directed was absolutely captivating. The opening scene alone is uncomfortable, and subsequently sets the tone for the rest of the drama throughout, one which leads to a two-part crescendo that just rendered me speechless by the closing scene of the final episode. This paired with the phenomenal acting that had me on the edge of my seat throughout made this drama one of the most gripping, intense and exciting experiences I've had watching something in some time. The various guest appearances round out an already fantastic cast of top-class actors, all of whom impressed me immensely and only added further to my great level of immersion.

Thankfully the drama is not all violence, blood and abuse, as between the heavy scenes there is also dashes of light humor to break the tension, for the most part thanks to Koo Kyo Hwan's character Han Ho Yeol, who buddies up with Jung Hae In's soft-hearted character Ahn Joon Ho in order to track down and bring back soldiers who have deserted the military for various reasons. And this is the majority of the structure it follows, with each episode focusing on their various expeditions all while it slowly and gradually builds to a fantastic yet shocking climax.

I have to admit that although 6 episodes is a perfect length for the story it told, I still do find myself hankering for more, especially after thoroughly enjoying the duo dynamic between both the main leads as well as their various hijinks. Personally I can hold out hoping for a spin-off or a second season, but even if that doesn't materialize, I am happy to have encountered such a well-written masterpiece, which I hope many other people will also be able to appreciate!

Legalized Abuse
Every episode of D.P. Dog is like a dagger to the heart; the issues it raises are dark but have depth, especially related to the abnormal practices the military service allows to continue. It's hard to take, let alone accept these practices actually translate into real life. Only when I read an article by director Han Jun Hee, who adapted Kim Bo Tong's webcomic with the same title, D.P. Dog Day, did I realize there was truth to the fiction. In the article, the director said he wanted to follow young men in their early 20s and depict what they go through while at the same time offering a drama that could resonate with audiences by laying out current underlying issues facing South Korean society.

I relate to this drama differently because my country, too, follows a conscripted military service system. I understand the need for mandatory service, especially when a country is at constant war with its neighbor; the need to be ready is that much more potent. But forced conscription where if one tries to skirt around it may affect their future not just legally but culturally that I don't understand. My country has indefinite forced conscription for both men and women who suffer intolerable psychological and physical aftermath -- the indignity of it all isolated and forced to adapt to the military’s hierarchical and disciplinary culture all while being treated so inhumanely, be it economically, mentally, or physically it's no wonder the service is viewed as a chore to escape rather than patriotic duty -- that is what's hard to stomach.

That Cho's (Jo Hyun Chul) incident comes straight from the headlines of a case of a sergeant in 2014 who went on a deadly shooting spree, reportedly as revenge for repeated bullying, makes it even that much more regrettable. Joon Ho (Jung Hae In) wailing at the end at the loss of a life whose only crime was trying to live his life to the best of his abilities with the threat of legalized abuse was sorrowing and harrowing at the same time. I admire, praise, and commend the whole cast, they all did an amazing job, and I've gained so much appreciation for their great acting abilities. The same goes for the scriptwriter for scripting such a compelling story and the director for bringing to life this raw gut-wrenching yet at the same time eye-opening drama. I hope it catalyzes the change both the civilian and military society in South Korea and other countries across this globe so desperately need. This drama will remain with me for a long time to come and is one I highly recommend.

Utilized everything they had with a great execution
Take this as an example of why shouldn't every k-drama end up in 16 episodes nor even extended to 20 episodes.

The plot is focusing on the main idea of the military life and I think it was consistent to carried it out in the whole 6 episodes. No pleasantries and pleonastic. Not revealing too many things and left some of the ideas and sentiments to the spectators. And as if you were drawn to adapt to be a part of them. It feels like we can see, hear, and feel the story as if those were ours to begin with. It felt so raw and violent but you can't stop watching because you want to know what would be next to happen. The misery and agony and also the irony of the military life is well conveyed and I think it has some connection in some way with some cases that truly happened in South Korea that changed the way it runs today. Though it may be a common secret that seniority is still prominent and conspicuous in that scope, D.P. succeeding in animadvert severely on the system and let it be known what is wrong with a scant of satire and insinuation. And evidently it works so well. It still felt so realistic without exaggerating some aspects of human daily life that might distorted the whole theme of military., like romance or unnecessary laughable moments.

And, I really like how it took such an ending. Blatant mockery by the media and the military to close the case in that way and also the surprising act of camaraderie. A great cinematography and acting also play their roles well that it almost taste so immaculate to the point I'm being hesitant on my own review if I might be so biased, but undoubtedly it really deserves all the praise.

Powerful, heavy message. Well balanced drama.
First off, this is not a comedy, so don't be fooled by some of the trailers. It's a drama that deals with very heavy issues, carrying a very serious message. There are comedic aspects that lead to lighthearted moments but the show is first and foremost raw, dark and saddening. It's hard-hitting from the get-go and doesn't pull any punches.

Its message is critical of the military and showcases some harsh truths, which was refreshing and wonderful to see. Most military-based media (in any country) is often so pro-military they happily sweeping away the darker truths hidden there whereas this storyline brought to light some very poignant issues. Very refreshing to see the military in a light that's not tainted with the usual romanticism and propaganda.

The whole drama is perfectly balanced. The comedic aspect (mainly provided by the character Han Ho Yul) gave a nice balance to offset the darker, more tragic storylines. He did a great job of being the comedic relief without it appearing disrespectful or out of place to the wider, more serious story and his acting transitions well to be more emotional when the comedic relief tapers out towards the end. Action/fighting scenes are thrown in to keep it exciting and fairly fast-paced. Yes, the drama is raw and gritty, at times the truths you're forced to acknowledge could be difficult to watch, but they've balanced the show perfectly so that you can easily do so. There is no pretty, happy ending tied up neatly in a ""drama-land"" bow - the events that eventually happen are fitting and realistic in the confines of the story.

The plot perfectly captures the issues surrounding all types of bullying, corruption and abuse of power. It didn't shy away from the truth that if you sit by and do nothing you are ultimately taking the side of the bully.

""If I want things to change, I should at least do something""
That ""something"" may not be the right answer, but to these soldiers, it felt like the only one.

D.P explores the bottom of the iceberg about the raw reality that exists inside these barracks. Not only is it a realistic portrayal of the bullying, superiority, and violence, but there's a very powerful message coming out of this drama—that not everything is black and white, but there are gray areas. Gray areas like the bystanders and the very system that enables the military to operate this way—the very reasons why these soldiers run away. However there are little cracks to that system, such as Son Seokku's character. Though it's barely scratching the surface, it gives us a sliver of hope that maybe things can change, just in a different way.

Overall, I like the way the story was set. We're introduced to Jung Haein's character, An Junho, a seemingly typical guy at first, but later proves his competence to take the position of D.P. But from the first episode, they hit us right away...and we realize that Junho is very flawed. He's not written as the usual perfect hero and I love it. He's clever but does not always make the right choices. Jung Haein did an amazing job with his role as did the rest of the cast.

By the end of the drama, I was crying buckets...even now I feel like crying again just thinking about that ending. This show is so emotionally gripping that I wanted to break down multiple times, it hurt so much how real it was. It's a show filled with subplots as we watch this journey of Junho carrying out his job, with an empathy he knows he shouldn't have, but he does. Because of this empathy, we're reminded that these deserters are not just deserters. They are human.

We're used to hearing the mentality: ""What happens, happened. Move on."" It's no different here, with soldiers experiencing some of the most horrid abuse but have to ""man up"" because that's what they're told. The ending is a bit open-ended, but we're left with this strong feeling that we can't just move on and we're responsible for change.

On another note, I really can't move on from this drama, it left a deep impression on me. The cinematography was incredible; it's so unique and did justice to the visuals in the scenes. I hope there's a season 2, because we're told that An Junho still has about 500 days in his service. Please watch it!

......ONE MORE THING: THE OSTS ARE JUST SO AMAZING. I seriously never skipped the intro/outro credits. Kudos to the music director, the discography is just perfect, perfect.

Gritty, Guttural, and Brutal
[ Not very obvious possible trigger warnings: Sexual harassment ]

Set in 2014, it's a short kdrama, 6 episodes at the time of writing this(season 1), though not ""sweet"" in any sense of the word. It's grim and depressing, which isn't a bad thing. I certainly enjoyed it, and it made me feel for the characters, not just the protagonist and deuteragonist but for a lot more than just them.

The main takeaway I want this review to impart is this; If you romanticise the military, this kdrama probably isn't for you. It's a look at abuse within the (South Korean) military, and its heavy history of hazing - a practice not limited to SK's military - and the very nature of the self-perpetuating cycle of abuse exacerbated by the system/its perpetrators' indifference and even encouragement of the power abuse. There's themes of toxic masculinity(as armies are typically known for in pop-culture), psychological damage, sexual harassment and the strange obsession with one's ""manhood""(genitalia), and general hopelessness. It's not the show pulling you aside and proclaiming, ""THIS is the reality, and it can't be changed!"". It's more of, ""This is the reality. Do with that knowledge what you will.""

The ending tore me apart, and I don't mean the ending where Jun-ho disobeys his superior and runs off into God knows where, but the one where you stay past the black screen. You'll catch a glimpse of ""Fat Ass"", a friend of the man you just watched shoot himself in front of Jun-ho. He's been bullied too, and it hits even harder taking into account one of the reasons he might've bonded with Suk-bong was because they both shared one thing: They were both treated like dogshit by everybody in their respective unit. After all, ""I should do something.""

The abuse, bullying, and harassment isn't immediate. It's clear from the progression of these episodes, and mirrors real life, that it is a bunch of acts in succession that pile atop one another until the victim's shoulders break from the crushing weight. The psychological, physical, and emotional trauma of it all mixed with hormones, heavy testosterone-drunk machoism of the military's environment, boils over into the amalgamation of consequences by end episode. Suk-bong's case is fictional and very extreme, yet it drives home the point. What does a frightened animal do when it's cornered? Only what it must. Protect itself.

For Suk-bong and his friend, that meant doing what they did. The kdrama doesn't justify that, but instead gives me this impression, ""Must we wait until things are taken to the extreme before appropriate action is taken?""

Interestingly, before storming the tunnel, SDT's commander responds to Sergeant Park's protests with the reminder of the shootings in one of the Units, later mirrored in the true ending. One of Hang-soo's lackeys was also, himself, a victim of the abuse(as was everybody) by Hwang-soo, and he instead chose to take it out on Suk-bong. This is present in both the macro- and micro-level of these relationships between everybody involved. There's a reason for everybody's actions in this kdrama without vilifying, romanticising, and/or justifying, and the cycle of trauma and abuse is clear. The attention to detail and empathy is astounding, in a positive way.

As someone who's a victim of abuse, though not to this drama's extent, Jun-ho and the others' experiences resonate with me thematically. I don't subscribe to the theory that Jun-ho ""snaps"" in the ""ending"" where he runs off, but instead a small act of rebellion against the system, and a refusal of passivity and the so-loved conformity. It is the little successes that build up to big things eventually, and that leaves the viewer with just the tiniest sliver of hope, in my opinion.

Spotlight on South Korean issues with the military
I'm gonna be honest upfront: D.P. is a very interesting and insightful drama but I am not as praising as the rest of the reviews. I rarely review, mostly because of lack of time, but I thought a little diversity in opinions wouldn't hurt. If you want to read the rest of this review, it is then up to you.

So, shall we?

D. P. is the first drama that leaves me with a very strange feeling both as I was watching it and when I finished watching. It's not about the chilling violence, both psychological and physical, these men endure, nor is it the disturbing truth about the south korean (and I'm sure, from other countries) military.

I suppose I should start with the good pointsI found in this drama :

- The drama's message is well (and painfully for the viewers) transcribed and delivered. Of course, the numerous explicit scenes of abuse shows you just that, but the silences, whether it's from the other soldiers, Jun Ho, Ho Yeol or other characters, also manage to convey another insidious form of violence. Add to that the ""Netflix production"" label and you have a drama that will be talked about by a large number of people (thanks to/because of the short format and its easy accessibility) and who will be praised for it's directing and photography.

- This is no light topic the drama is dealing with and it's very rare to find medium be this critical and this brutally honest of such a big part of the South Korean life. Even if I'm becoming wary of Netflix productions, I must admit that the streaming platform has allowed recent dramas to explore more and more themes that are usually taboo in SK (homosexuality in Move to Heaven and So Not Worth It notably comes to mind). So hats off for the whole team who developped this story (inspired by true events I read) who makes you feel for these young men and empathise with their pain while shedding a huge spotlight on an important issue.

- The acting of the main cast was good. My congratulations to Jung Hae In and Koo Kyo Hwan especially who did well to portray soldiers scarred and troubled by their experience, yet still brought a touch of light comedy with their antics. Jumping from Reply 1988 right into D. P. was kind of a shock when I saw Kim Sung Kyun in such a different role but it simply highlights he has many cards up his sleeves. Jo Hyun Chul was also very sincere in his portrayal of private Cho Seok Bong and showcased well the slow descent into hell of a once kind-hearted man.


Having said that, you would probably assume my grade for the drama would be ""good"" (meaning as up to the average grade) and that my opinion is similar to that of others singing D. P.'s praise. But this is where the problems arise, so to speak. As much as D. P. has qualities, it also has flaws and it simply fell short, for me, as regards my own taste and appreciation of medium. Once again, let's detail this a bit:

- I simply. Felt bored. As much as the drama unveils a heavy story with an impactful message, I found myself looking at the clock more often than once despite the episodes being shorter than your typical drama episode. I felt that the plot was repetitive with a ""deserter of the day"" kind of plot whose backgrounds (except for episode 3) were more or less the same. I suppose it's to show just how large this instutionalised abuse is but in the end, even for a 6-episode drama, it fell short in keeping me interested in the plot, especially after the first two episodes when the interest started to dwindle down the drain until a slight rise in the last 20mn of the drama. Even though I admire the acting of the main cast, I couldn't get attached to one character or another (not that there are many to get attached to to begin with) and this something that prevented me from being truly connected to the story.

- The violence felt at times like a simple device of cheap shock-value to the point that I felt some of the gruesome scene simply lacked... something because of how much violence is shown. There are many ways to put violence into a story and I felt that the production often opted for a visual, almost voyeuristic, representation of it. Implication, black screen and sound and such can also represent violence, sometimes in an even more bone-chilling way than the graphic one.

- The music wasn't anything remarkable except the opening credits song. One could argue that for such a heavy drama, music becomes secondary but even the background music wasn't exceptionnaly good or even well timed. Moreover, dramas are famous for their OSTs and using songs and musics as ""scene enhancers"" and it's a shame to notice that the Korean Netflix productions (Kingdom, Move to Heaven, So Not Worth It, D. P. and others) are not putting in the same investment/interest. This may sound trivial in reviewing a drama but I'm a person who puts emphasis on the music so this is something I pay close attention while watchings dramas, movies and any other type of media.


Overall D. P. is an interesting drama whose message should be heard because it is important and they did well conveying it. But it wasn't enough for me to think of it as the masterpiece everyone is saying it is.

Like the best of television, all I have after finishing it are feelings rather than thoughts.

Those feelings are deep and overwhelming and maybe one day I'll come back here and fill in this review properly with coherence. For now I'll just say - this is a dark and disturbing but powerful and compelling piece of television that you should absolutely watch. It's extraordinarily well crafted: the script, production and acting working together to create a grim tapestry that examines the hierarchical bullying and endemic violence of Korean society and how it has been given brutal form in its nation's military.

As young men are fed into the machine like grist to an unnecessarily violent mill, they do their best to survive in whatever way they can. Whether perpetrators, victims, or bystanders, no one is innocent and no one comes through unscathed.

D.P. is an unflinching look at the perpetuation and normalisation of violence and about what happens when people think they have no way out.

D.P. stands for Dumb People
Pretty good show, a little on the slower side at times, but with intriguing characters and situations. The two leads in the show do an excellent job playing their roles, and their chemistry together was one of the best parts of the show in my opinion.

Acting is great, story is good. This show will definitely make you angry, keep that in mind. There are so many characters who deserve severe punishment for how they treat others during service, but unfortunately not too many of them get what they deserve. Plenty of gruesome, humiliating, and downright infuriating bullying scenes with little payoff at the end in terms of change in behaviors or punishment for their actions. One of the things I hate the most in this world is when people think too highly of themselves and treat others poorly, and this show has a lot of that. This show is mostly just scenes of individuals who think they're better than others and abuse their power, only for the victim of the abuse to turn around and abuse the next person down the ladder. Almost like a domino effect.

Overall, a good show with a decent story and great acting. Just prepare to be very angry.

Not for anyone but definitely one of the best dramas of the year
First, D.P. is definitely not an easy drama to digest. For those who like happy endings or things well resolved in the end, D.P. will not be interesting. I believe that this show wanted to portray a more grotesque side of a reality where things will not always work out and it will take time for things to be resolved. Having said that, I really liked the plot of this drama. For me it was so interesting, different and well made. I especially liked how they showed a negative side of the SK army that although I can't say that all the things mentioned in this drama happens in real life, I honestly don't doubt that at least some are real. And was interesting as well especially because us, as viewers who are consuming content from korean artists, constantly see the SK army being put as something awesome and here we saw a different portray than usual so it was really interesting.

The cinematography was amazing and I enjoyed the OST as well. The actors was *chef kiss* AMAZING. All of them did an amazing job in their roles. The main characters had chemistry and completed each other. And the actor who was the “nerd” from the army was seriously amazing. I am extremely happy that Hae In agreed to be part of this drama because I was tired of seeing people saying that he was only a “melo/romance actor” and I think after that, he showed his good skills in acting and how he can act in different roles. I just wish they had at least closed the story about Joon Ho because I feel that the relationship with his mother was too important to be forgotten in the story especially him being the ML.

D.P. is an amazing drama which brings up sensitive issues and a different perspective of the SK army that we are not used to see. With captivating characters and an impeccable direction scene, we dive headfirst into this story and are entertained at every moment. The ending of Joon Ho maybe becoming a deserter or just showing that he's going to rebel against the army was perfect. As well as the scene of the other soldier shooting at others to show that ""something needed to be done"", because yes, there comes a time when they start to think that they can no longer count on anyone but themselves.

I really hope there is a sequel to at least tie up some things that were left open, but I’ll understand If this is the really end because as i said above, in reality, things are not resolved easily and many end up not really being. Recommend this 100%!

Toxic masculinity and accountability
D.P. mixes a cocktail of abuse, desperation and isolation. It's an extremely heavy subject and the production spares nothing to lighten the impact.

It's dark. Not just a portrayal of a dark side of human nature, but almost every scene is shot in some degree of darkness.

There's an extreme amount of violence, blood, blunt objects, knives and guns.

Jung Hae In is a private from a dysfunctional family that finds kindred souls in the deserters that he's been charged with bringing back to the military. Koo Kyo Hwan plays the reluctant but clever senior soldier that provides the little bit of warmth and lightness to the show. Both play their roles very well. Jung Hae In, despite his youthful appearance, is far more natural as an actor in this role than his filmography would suggest. There isn't a weak performance in the show although when a lot of the dialogue is reciting a soldier's rank and name over and over again, maybe it's not the most challenging material. One performance, albeit brief, however that is scintillating is Go Pyung Po in a guest role in the first episode.

The storyline is somewhat disconnected as each of the first few episodes are self-contained around the pursuit of a particular deserter. Each deserter is a victim. The soldiers of their units are the villains. The D.P. are out to bring back the deserter to help that soldier before he irreparably harms himself. Each story has its own twist but the fact that all fit the same profile does lessen the impact as the series wears on.

Rather than generate a novel backstory for a deserter, the storyline coalesces around a single soldier over the final two episodes that builds to a climactic showdown. The downside to the buildup is that it adds this element of action to what had, up to that point, been a raw and fairly powerful view of emotional scarring. It's a context that begs for less moving parts and more quiet. Instead, it's a series of unreasonably unlikely events (cops that inconceivably don't call for backup, characters surprised that their cell phones don't work when they're deep in a cave, three characters in a car accident and it's the one without a seatbelt that walks away unscathed, etc.) that lead to the final confrontation which ends in a manner that is entirely unsurprising. The quality of the dialogue and the acting dip here too as the characters become more cliche. It absolutely dampens the impact that the show had been building. Instead of humanity, we get spectacle.

Certainly it's an ambitious concept and points should be awarded for making a show that won't make friends with anyone that looks unkindly at any criticism of the military. It gets a recommendation but D.P. should have been better.

An Average Drama for me
Honestly i expected little different type of a drama. Dp was may be not my kind of a drama, Overall it was a pretty average dramatic experience for me. I saw so many people were praising this drama a lot, but i felt a different opinion apart from them. They started the drama really well and my expectations was on the highest level but after a few minutes from there, it going really dragging and was a repeated stuff which we seen so many time before. I mean the emotional connection didn't get.

Not a single excitement but i desperate to finish for jung hae in he was one my favourite hero. You can read from the plot that D.P people finding run away soldiers. Its really hard to see people who came to serve for the country has to go through all the bad bullying situations. The making was really amazing and its slow paced. But I can't connect so emotionally to so many scenes, emotional scenes were not that refreshing.. the story narration doesn't has anything to offer to you, to stay thrilled or interested.
They just showing that Korean Military experience was horrible.

The positive thing i find was the last episode looks very decent. I have to skip some scenes in the middle because i felt very bored. Even the comedy scenes doesn't look funny to me.. These all were my thoughts.. But its only has 6 Episode so its a feel free watchable drama.

Overall Average only for me

Training for mental toughness vs Abuse/Bullying - Amazing Acting
9/9/2021

I see Jung Hae In, and I am there! He's the main reason why I watch D.P., as such drama is usually not my cup of tea. Jung Hae In does not disappoint. His acting here might be his best yet. As much as I love seeing his adorable smile and his soft/romantic roles, I am happy that he's taking on more serious roles like this. I hate for such a talented actor to be typecasted only in romance dramas. We have seen a glimpse of him in a military uniform in ""Prison Playbook"" (I strongly recommend!) and our favorite second-lead syndrome police officer in ""While You Were Sleeping"". This role is more serious, more gritty, and raw. He did an amazing job, esp. in Ep 6.

However, the rest of the cast shines as well. Dare I say, at times, they outshine Jung Hae In. Every single actor/actress did an amazing job, no matter how big or small their role is. The acting in Ep 5 and 6 will stay with me for a while.

I don't know anything about Korean military service, and my knowledge all comes from watching K-drama. But it seems like issues depicted here are quite similar to what the US military deals with as well (knowledge from American shows/movies as well). What is the necessary training for soldiers to be mentally tough, so that they could fight in a war? What is going overboard with inhumane treatment and bullying? This drama tries to convey a more human side of the deserters stories. Aside from one deserter who left because of his grandmother, all others left due to mistreatment in the military. As they say in towards the end of the drama, someone got to do something about it.

One criticism - how could these guys be so beaten up and yet they don't die, and can get back up time and time again to run and chase? Isn't that a little too unrealistic? I guess they need to show all the violence and can't kill off anyone.

This drama is not for everyone. There is no romance. It's full of blood and hitting and abuse. But it's a great drama.

p.s. Oh.. don't miss out on the little epilogue in Ep 6, after the first song was played at the end.

Refreshing
If I had to describe this show in one word, it would be refreshing. I had recently gotten tired of watching most kdramas, and when I saw the reviews on this and the length, I decided to give it a try. Boy, am I glad I did.

This show really made me pause and think after each episode. I usually binge my shows, but this was well-paced and makes you reach for the pause button so you can truly process what happened. I would not recommend it for people with triggers of violence, depression, bullying, etc, but this show was point-blank in the issues it wanted to tackle.

It really made me think about the military draft in Korea. We often forget because most kdramas are focused on romances or families, but the draft is part of every Korean man's life, and I'm really glad we got one of the few shows that focuses on that, but on the other side. We've seen shows like Search and Descendants of the Sun, where it seems like the military is just a passive experience with a lot of action, but to see the fundamental problems that no one talks about, DP does it better than any I have yet to see.

If you want a poignant fast-paced drama unlike any others out there that really makes you reflect, look no further and press play on DP.

Ask not what your country can do for you!
The main plot revolves around Ahn Joon Ho, a high school graduate who decided to join the military after being fired from a food delivery job. During his service, he discovered his talent while tracking down a deserter within a military department called D.P. with his sidekick, Han Ho Yul. It's similar to Sherlock-Watson stories in that each series features a new deserter to apprehend using detective skills. The difficulty level rises with each series, reaching a climax in the fifth and sixth episodes.
I enjoy character development as a delivery worker, a fresh-faced soldier, the recruitment process to the D.P. Department, finding a partner, and honing the skill to be a good yet the best hunting wolf.

As I live in Singapore, a republic that requires adult men to serve in the National Military Service, I found this story to be relatable. I did not serve in the military, but this culture is dear to my heart. You must understand how it feels to prepare yourself to give up two years of your youth for your country; it is an honorable but daunting responsibility to forego the opportunity to get a job, meet your girlfriend, or do anything else. It is both good and bad, but I hope the government will take full responsibility to ensure that bad incidents do not occur. Yes, we must recognize that it is impossible to control everything in order to achieve perfection, and that sh** happens in Singapore as well.

This series does an excellent job of elaborating on military service culture, particularly bullying culture, which is understandably a gray area in the military command system; it is yes sir culture. There are a thousand reasons to avoid military service, but imagine how desperate the situation is for the young man who did it regardless of the severe punishment he may face.

All of the main characters are fantastic, as are the actors who play them! I don't see any filler characters who are present but provide no support to the story. Jung Hae In is outstanding in this drama, and while I don't usually like his dramas, I decided to give it a shot because of its high rating. His performance as a nobody delivery part-timer to a private officer hero fits the character well.

Koo Kyo Hwan is a new face for me in my drama land universe, but I must commend him on his performance as a sidekick joker. Kim Sung Kyun and Son Seok Koo, who play supporting roles, add cohesive dynamics to the main duo.

Is there Justice in the Cycle of Violence?
This drama impressed me far more than I could have imagined. Aligning with my expectations about military settings, I witnessed an abundance of male hierarchy and power plays. It is beyond unfortunate that such abuse/lateral violence occurred and, sadly, were sanctioned on some level through complacency and indifference. What I appreciated about this drama was that it was short (but not sweet!) as the portrayed violence can only be digested so much by the viewer before vicarious trauma becomes debilitating.

We see how the need to survive such intense environments results in the degradation of others. This is not new but once in awhile a drama like this comes along to remind us that every soldier has a story that warrants understanding and compassion. Even the bullies have their own stories that shaped them into perpetrators of violence. Violence begets violence. It has a beginning somewhere. At the same time, we are also reminded that aggression/violence is still a choice, as the ML, having witnessed domestic violence his whole life, chose a different way to cope.

The various stories were shared in a simple, linear fashion, culminating in one explosive ending. The OST was inserted at heartbreaking moments to amplify the stories. And, when kindness was shown, it was a triumph for the human spirit and gave hope to the dark moments.

Lastly, for the grandma in episode four, I want to hug her and tell her that somewhere flowers are blooming. With enough love and nurturance, we all can do our parts to keep the flowers blooming… Let’s remember to be kind to others. Be kind to ourselves. Thank you for this great drama.

Not what i expected
I watched this drama about 2 hours ago so it is still freah in my memory. I also found out about it today and thought it would be a fun watch and i was so wrong. From the first 3 minutes of the first episode i knew this was gonna be a heavy, gruelling, realistic show that will be stuck in my memory for a long time. I am gonna break down my review into parts.

Plot: 10/10
At first i was a little distant because this was only 6 episode with less than an hour for each but when i started i swear it felt like 10 hours when it took me 3-4 hours. I can count on my fingers the amount of shows that did this to me. It wasn't dragged out in the slightest. Infact everything that needed to be said was said.So i am gonna move on

Actors/Cast: 100/10
This is what carried of the drama. Each actor either made me hate or love them. It was that simple. I dont know alot about any of these actors but imma need to do some research. I fell in love with everyone, everyone.

Music: 10/10
There want much of it infact i dont remember it clearly but for somd reason i had to give this 10/10. Music might have ruined this masterpiece of how tragic tge story was.

Overall:10000000/10
This drama didn't make me skip one second not even the bloody or fighting parts. I replayed those scences over and over. Loved the bromance 100%. I knew the last scence of this entire drama was gonna turn out like that but i really wished that jerk died. Oh well. I beg of you with light hearts dont watch this unless you thicken your skin because this is not a fairy tale. I shed tears at the end and i rarely cry over a show. Watch it when you can chill out and just relax. I watched this from 10:00pm to 1:00am. Finally finished crying so i could write this long ass review. So better thank me and watch it! Ill go now Adiós.

Violence begets violence. Bullying begets bullying. And inflict enough torment, you can make a murderer out of a saint.

That theme is integral to D.P., which - unlike what the synopsis led me to believe - is critical of the inner workings of the military, a system of hierarchy that nurtures power imbalance inherent to abuse. It doesn't shy away from the subtle to the more explicit forms of harassment that every rank experiences. And that, most of the time, pushes the enlisted into deserting.

It ties neatly into Jun-Ho's life. Through each case of a deserter, he becomes more disillusioned with himself, and, finally, the military he's serving. And his last decision makes the story come full circle - how? I will leave that for the viewer. Then there's Ho-Yeol, who drew attention to himself as soon as he was introduced - his eccentricities made him a good D.P. officer (and a comic relief). However, the story was not theirs for long; the last deserter made it his, whose case was the consequence of continuous abuse, an impending tragedy borne of the deliberate ignorance of bystanders. His case was a warning, a question mark to the inaction of the spectating system which never countered the root of most desertions, a mishandling of a situation that could have been prevented.

The drama would not have been half as impactful if the acting was lukewarm. Hae In understands characters such as Jun-Ho, outwardly passive but drowning in emotion. Kyo Hwan brought Ho-Yeol to life without the crutch of a solid background story. And the supporting cast was remarkable, particularly the last deserter.

My one complaint would be the OST / music choice when the heavier scenes occurred in episode 6 (and one or two earlier episodes). It made the scenes rather self-indulgent and overdid the emotion which was already prominent, and better off, without it. However, I did enjoy the OST intro, mellow compared to the action, but a good way to break out of and into the topic of the episode.

Overall, the storytelling was pleasing, though the story itself was heavy (and disturbing at some points). It is one of the stronger productions in 2021. Watch it.

Classic case of people in power misusing it.
The series tackles the hardships of men going through mandatory military service and why some of them decide to run away. The show is filled with horror of bullying, abuse, rough language and dark themes of suicide yet the show never crosses the limit to show something to an extent where you just can't stomach it.

The humor is the show is subtle and effective making you feel a bit better otherwise you are just walking in a dark tunnel with endless fears.

The duo between Kyo Hwan and Jung Hae In was perfect and had great chemistry as collegues. The ensemble cast also is perfect in their roles.

Music, cinematography, action and thrill all were well done and keeps you hooked. Honestly, after watching this I want to see Jung Hae In a negative role, cuz he really can pull it off.

Lastly take a shot everytime Hae In says ""Private Ahn Jun Ho"" xd.

We need to ""sacrifice"" to bring changes !!
We have seen many Kdramas delivering school bullies. But DP brings us about the Korean Military bully.

The series is gritty, dark and violent. The first three episodes does have a comic relief (comedy within tragedy). But the last two episodes will make you go through a lot (sad/negative) emotions.

Cast/Acting — Perfect.

We have seen Jung Hae In as an military officer in Prison Playbook. Remember how he was falsely accused of beating up his fellows?? But here we will actually see what goes on inside the military. How the seniors harasses their juniors and how they got away because it is so called ""normal"" thing.

Just think how much of a person can change after getting into military. It went from ""Gandhi"" to ""terrorist"". That much it can change you.

Will you feel at ease after the show ends? NO.
You will boil with anger.

The main characters will try to bring changes in this corrupted system. To bring a change you need to sacrifice. But how many?

DP is filled with both physical and emotional abuse. Some viewers may find it disturbing because the camera focuses a lot to the ""beaten up faces"".

Overall one of the best short dramas of 2021.

ON POINT
I always loved Jung Hae In, he's one of those that don't need to exert too much effort to show his emotions. You know he's happy even without him being giddy, or sad, without crying, mad without needing to shout or kick you. And this is what you get from him in DP.

As Joon Ho, his acting is contained but very emotional. Even without saying a word, you can feel that he's burning up inside. I guess his partner Corporal Ho Yul knows this. He knows how he feels, what he thinks and as quirky as he is, he has this caring aspect in him, that enabled Joon Ho to finally talk to his mom. This also showed in one of the episodes when Ho Yul let go of one the deserters to enable him to bring his grandma to a sanitarium, You will love Ho Yul character here.

The story is on point. Didn't hide or sugar coat what's happening inside. It all boils down to mental torture. What else could it be when you know it will only be 24 month inside? Physical torture? They can't do that 24/7, but it will eventually damage your mental health. When you're out there, alone, with no family to turn to, you will always find yourself thinking why is this happening. I also appreciate that they showed how the higher ups have turned a blind eye to these situations and would only think of what is beneficial to them. Bum Go, who is DP's immediate supervisor, seems to be also sucked by the system, but eventually stood up for his soldiers.

The series is only 6 episodes. I wanted more and see what happens to Joon Ho, but I know the series is not about him. It's about doing the mandatory military service and why you have deserters. And that what the series will give you.

How to boil frogs alive?
Warning: This show has a lot of triggering content, including suicide, drug use, corporal punishment, abusive language, and sexual assault to name a few. If you have any trauma-specific triggers or cannot handle extreme violence, then tread lightly.

Violence breeds violence in this visceral, dark study of what it takes to break a person who is getting broken every day, over and over again, to the point of no return. The show connects violence in male-dominated environments to domestic abuse, to complacency and apathy in an ominous epic where heroism is nothing but the polished facade over a sick and rotting within.
This was such an unexpected watch for me. I wasn’t planning on watching this because I dislike military and everything connected to it (including fictional works about it) but it’s just 6 episodes and I like the main lead’s acting to I thought I should give it a watch and I was blown away (pun not intended). This was not at all what I had expected from a Korean show. They never hit as hard as Korean films do but this show is a visceral, horrifying watching experience. I can’t say I enjoyed watching it. It induces a lot of stress but I also couldn’t look away. The show tackles the military with a critical eye. It has a “lord of the flies” lens and it shows how the hierarchies in the military enable sociopathic, violent people with dark fantasies to do as they please without any consequence. It’s a system that sustains itself with gore, intimidation, humiliation, and mind-break. The show is almost too successful in exposing these and also connecting the issues of that environment to the hierarchies and toxicity existing in the society outside of the military compound.

You should watch this show if:
1. You hate the military like I do
2. Can handle violence and injustice (extreme)
3. Short format with no wasted moment
4. Subtle character developments
5. Realism with a touch of dramatization
6. Buddycop dynamic
7. Tragedies
8. Police procedural
9. Dark humor

Summary: The show follows Ahn Joon Ho, an apathetic young man with no prospects, no future, and no emotional attachments who joins the army for his mandatory 2-year service, seemingly on a whim. He survives the initiation process through his sheer will to feel nothing! Then his observation skills and sharp mind land him a job with the deserter pursuit unit and with every new case he follows, his icy veneer melts away as he starts to care. A bit too much, maybe.

Plot: This is a very sharply written show. There’s no one scene wasted on unimportant matters. The show is subtle with its character arcs and humor, which helps put the exaggerated and extreme violence in the show into stark focus, making it feel more jarring and uncomfortable. Foreshadowing, symbolism, and parallels are used with great cunning to help flesh out the world and the characters in it. I really like that detail about it. Aside from technicalities, this is an adrenaline-packed, mystery-solving, action story wrapped in trauma and social commentary. It’s an exhilarating watch that will hype you up while also draining your emotions. The format is more or less episodic with each episode following a case. This does dampen the show’s edginess a little bit, as all procedurals do, but thankfully it’s super short so it doesn’t get pedantic.

Acting: The acting was amazing! I already knew Jung Hae In was an amazing actor but I just couldn’t imagine him in a violent, macho military show. Turns out he’s not just good at dramatic acting and being an extremely ideal love interest. He’s also really good at throwing punches. But I have to say, the show benefits from his skills in delivering emotional punches (lol so many boxing puns!). With his naturally sad eyes and empathetic expressions, he raises the show above just being gratuitous violence. Koo Kyo Hwan plays his sardonic, eccentric character to PERFECTION. His humor is not slapstick and cheap and when the emotional moments come up, he keeps his performance steady and mature. He was amazing. Jo Hyun Chul deserves some sort of award for his performance. If he doesn’t get anything then the awards must be rigged. The ensemble was all good in their roles as well.

Music and Production: The music was fine and it worked well for the show. This was a very well-produced show. The camera work, details, sets, everything was done with great care. I guess it’s a Netflix show so it’s expected to deliver a certain level of professionality.

Rewatch value: No. It was too much. I can’t watch it again. I’ll watch a sequel, though.

Negatives: There is an overarching plot and there is character development and the whole show is a very in-your-face social commentary but the procedural format does redact a bit from it. When the plot really starts connecting from episode 4 to 6, it becomes a bit too melodramatic and certain parts are not as enjoyable as the very stylistic first episode that has you hooked. It survives though. There’s extreme violence and it can be argued that it kind of goes against its thesis by showing such over-the-top violence but I rarely see anyone critic compulsory military service so whatever, I’ll take it!

Overall: Definitely a good show. I would give it a 10 but that’s for shows I have fun. This was not exactly fun to watch. It was painful. Just the kind of pain that is worth getting through. One thing I loved about this show was that it has that ""get revenge from the bully"" situation but it manages to make you not enjoy the righteous violence despite the justice in it? At least for me, it was so. I’m curious to see if the show will get a second season because it has space to say more. As it stands, it could pack a harder punch. It does show the absurdity of the military so well and it almost makes fun of it but the humor is so dark that it’s almost no longer dark humor, just dark. I would like to see them explore the problematic structure of military a bit more. I won’t ask for justice or a journey of righting wrongs because it’ll be tacky but I want to see more of the show.

So how do you boil frogs alive? Well, how about not doing that, you sick sociopathic monster! Not every man has to be a killing machine. Some men like to plant flowers and draw comics and teach children that they are worth it and they deserve good things and you know what? They are more heroic than those who kick a person just because they can, because they have big muscles or a weapon and whatnot...anyway, don't boil frogs but if you do, just expect one to jump out and bite your head off.

Had the most enjoyable miserable time watching this
Let me just start by saying that I went into this expecting it to be an action-comedy that takes place in the military, but as soon as the first episode opened.....boy was I in for a rude awakening. The show was gripping from the start and as each episode passed by it became more disturbing, heart-wrenching, and frustrating. I found myself feeling the pain and anger that our main character was feeling as well as the hopelessness that continued to loom over most of the episodes.

The performances were incredible and it was nice to see Jung Hae-in play a role that was different from the usual sweet, reserved, and mellow character that he has been taking on in a lot of his recent works. Even the least important characters were great to watch and it was hard to peel my eyes away from the screen as no one bored me. No matter how much I disliked a character, I found them interesting and wanted to desperately know their motives, goals, and ambitions(which I will say is the only flaw with the show in my own personal opinion. I wish we knew more about our characters but I will cut them some slack since it was only 6 episodes).

Despite how dark and emotional the content of the show was, I absolutely adored how they were able to not only add comedic bits to it but that they were able to cleverly pick the best times to add in a joke rather than tossing it in at any given moment(this is especially important when it is a show that deals with such heavy topics like abuse, sexual harassment, bullying and so on). I loved Koo Kyo-hwan's performance and was delighted when I saw that he was not only able to create a lighter tone when needed but that he was able to act out serious moments and not have them feel awkward. His character felt complex and real and I loved whenever he came on to my screen.

I thought the pacing was perfect for a 6 episode season and not once did it feel rushed. Every scene went smoothly on to the next and because of that, I felt that watching in one sitting was anything but a chore. I am hoping that we get a second season because I've grown so attached to the characters, but I do wonder if there would be anything to add? Other than that, I recommend that anyone who is able to handle such dark subjects should give D.P. a watch because you will not be disappointed at all.

One of the best 2021 series on Netflix
D.P. (2021) has a good start and a great ending. Since there are only six episodes, I decided to review each. They're just short and, they're all here in MDL. The story, actors, music, direction, you name it, everything was well put together.

Anyway, I don't know what else to say except to encourage you to watch this series. It is worth your time. And whether or not there is a second season, this already speaks volumes.

Side note: We must do something, but we must exercise caution.

Came for Jung Hae In, stayed for everything else~
This drama did not receive the amount of attention it should have. Maybe it is because I find military movies and dramas very fascinating because of the absence of mandatory military enlistment in my country, but this feels slightly novel and brings to light a (not new but) slightly controversial topic.

Storyline was just how I liked it. It quickly introduces the main character and shows us his values in life through unrelated events. It then quickens up and introduces the second main character not long after. It is fast-paced and does not drag on. It introduces a new issues every one or two episodes. The only reason why this wasn't a 9 out of 10 was because I thought it was a shame that this drama only had 6 episodes.

I don't even think I have to evaluate the cast. Jung Hae In did not disappoint at all. Koo Kyo Hwan is a surprisingly more versatile than I expected after seeing his role in ""Peninsula."" I expect to see more of him around, and I expect great things.

Overall, I would RECCOMEND this drama.

Exceed My Expectations! Bravo!
Honestly, didn't expect it to be this good. The casts succeed in making my blood boiled gosh that was so inhuman. Totally enjoy all the soundtracks. I feel it really matched well with the vibe of this short drama. I didn't even skip the ending credits plenty of times. My heart totally ached wih the guy who stopped being a judo player cause he couln't hurt others. Never hurt a weak and kind hearted people. You might never know what your actions and words turn them into. In the end, I was speechless by the ending but I love how it was so awfully realistic. Power and justice. Those issues were never easy.

Must watch
Its too good for a short drama. I never knew that enlisting in military can also be this cruel. This drama gave me an idea of bullying even in military places. I have watched few dramas of jung hae in and his visual + acting is always perfect. Koo kyo hwan's acting was also perfect here. Among this harsh reality, cruelty, bullying, hardships etc the comedy was on point. I loved the plot of this drama and how perfectly it was executed. It was interesting to watch how both of them planned, dealt and handled things and people to catch the deserters.

Must Watch Drama!
The Dark reality behind the deserters and how they have been portrayed is commendable. An Jun-Ho has played an extremely dark role of being confused to finding himself. The series can be watched in 1 sitting as every episode hangs with a cliffhanger.

Overall the series was amazing and a right way to portray bulling and how it can change a mental state of a person. The raw reality has been portrayed superbly with a hint of comedy in between. There should be season 2 coming for the series as the series ended with a question mark.

Criticizing Hazing Phenomenon
“Every masculine gender of the Republic of Korea shall faithfully perform mandatory military service, as prescribed by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and this Act.” Those exact words taken from the ""Military Service Act"" Article 3 were shown at the beginning of every single episode of D.P. Derived from the law mentioned, every single man in South Korea are obligated to perform a mandatory military service (with exceptions) for an estimated 2 years in length. The law has been globally infamous along with the surge of Hallyu wave throughout the world. However, have non South Korean people ever think about the meticulous events happened during the service? Although D.P. is pretty much fictional, the series allowed viewers to have a glimpse of life that was rather under publicized during the service.

Within the span of only 6 episodes running from 45-55 minutes each, D.P. was mainly carried by the main duo: Ahn Junho and Han Hoyeol. Both of them showed an alluring bond despite their quite far off characters on each other. Junho was always portrayed as the serious, observant, and strategic one while Hoyeol topped him off by the goofy, open, and playful persona. Though with this short time span, the series doesn’t offer much characters yet some still left remarkable points: Sergeant Park’s upright nature, Captain Im’s comic persona, some harsh military seniors, and some struggling military juniors. However, the silver lining in D.P. was not coated in its characters. It was the plot that needed to be taken more earnestly.

Set in 2014, D.P. focused on deserted soldiers and the clues that might be left behind in order to brought them back. A detective-like mission has always been a point of interest in many types of series. Nevertheless, the Netflix series distinguishes itself among other kdramas due to its rattling back stories, centered in bullying/hierarchy system in the military. By deploying strong foregrounds, D.P. criticizes not only the South Korean military but also army in general. As a matter of fact, the ingrained seniority has always been an issue in any country’s military forces. Although, such matters never seen much light of day as they were continuously debunked in order to protect the country’s military reputation.

The bullying-centered stories may be vicariously triggering to the viewers as they depict rigorous stories realistically. Actually, the root of the problems are all based on the diverse humane characteristics. However, not everyone can tolerate them especially when it comes to an unaccommodating environment like the military. A loud sleeper, a geek by nature, or just being considered plainly new are some of the intolerable “red flags” according to D.P. Thus, making all of the victims getting consequences—being mentally or physically abused. The bullying took its toll, leading to pivotal character shifts (fleeing, going insane, and even led to suicidal). Though I would like to point out that in D.P., the act did not completely take its toll through physical abuse—compared to the real hazing death victims reported through several news outlet back through 2011-2017. The seniority/hierarchy system in D.P. did not just stop among the private/corporal/lower tier of the military but also the higher ups. The series convey an ironic decision-making situation toward the end that dispatched a disheartening message.

Departing from the daunting stories, D.P. also manages to offer a more humane foreground throughout the series. The episode “Monty Hall Problem” was cleverly written with a probabilistic/mathematics-related premise delivered with real-life implementation. Not only it provided a slight change of pace throughout the series, but also provided a new perspective on fleeing the military. On the other hand, it is also a human behavior to be irresponsible and just simply miss the feeling of being “liberated” — depicted on “That Woman” episode.

Altogether, human acted out on any aspects in life due to the consequences that are currently happening around them, including the men during conscriptions. It is undeniably true that hazing is still happening throughout the military community and beyond. Nevertheless, D.P. critiqued the phenomenon in a compact, cinematic, and epic path.

This review may contain spoilers
TLDR: This is a grim drama that sheds light on the negatives in the Korean military service. Although there a couple funny moments brought mainly by the chemistry of the two main leads, the drama does not shy away from difficult topics especially bullying and toxic masculinity.

We are introduced to An Jun Ho, which reminds me of Jung Hae In's character in Prison Playbook, an outwardly tough but deeply empathetic young soldier, who just wants to survive the 2 years and maybe even escape his family situation. The first scene begun with hazing/bullying of younger soldiers done by the senior soldiers. This foretold things to come in the latter episodes. As a way of survival, Jun Ho ended up in the D.P unit, where he is accompanied by an eccentric corporal Han Ho Yol, who I feel mainly provides the comic relief, and has great chemistry with Jun Ho. We are also introduced to the unit's haggard but tries-to-do-things-right sergeant. As the title and plot suggests, this drama dives into why people choose to desert their post during their service, which happens more often than not due to bullying. The last 2 episodes perhaps shows the worst possible scenario of when one is pushed to the verge of insanity as a result from the constant harassments. The series shows how corruption comes into play to prevent positive changes to the military and more importantly, toxic masculinity or obey-thy-senior culture perpetuates the bullying/hazing culture in the military. And at the end of the drama, one is left to wonder if real positive change can ever be implemented or how many more 'accidents' will it take to show the gravity of the situation.

*other things*: i really like the cinematography of the drama, having a 'blurred' look which i thought it meant how these soldiers wish it were like a dream, never truly existed. also, the soundtrack being mostly indie soft rock, especially the opening credits, felt very much like lost or wasted youth, which suits the theme of the drama. as much as i'd like another season mostly to dive deeper into the main leads, i do think the ending was good enough for a closure. lastly as a singaporean female who never went through military service, i do hope that nobody, at least in present times, have to go through such things.

Powerful, chilling, valuable
the most important thing to know before you watch this drama is to know you will laugh, smile, and feel uncomfortable. while it has its light moments and great bromance, it’s a story of being in the army and the horrors one may face. the root of this story looks at the cultural aspect of compulsory enlistment but then examines what that means. what does being in the military do to a man? what makes a man?

this story shows the extremes of toxic masculinity and how far anyone can be pushed. it’s a heavy watch. it goes from lighthearted to answering those questions some of us don’t have the answers to.

Refreshing to see Jung Hae-in in a new light
I watched it all in a day, that's how good it was. Although some parts may have been exaggerated, it was great to get an insight into the Korean compulsory army service. Jung Hae-in's character was amazing, as were all the others, but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him portray a different type of role to his usual characters. All the supporting characters were also really good. The drama portrayed how some people really do have no humanity left in them, and we as a society just have to accept that. Here's to hoping for a second season.

Thought provoking and heartwrenching critque on the military structure and cycle of power abuse
I've never written a review before, but D.P truly deserves one
Initially, I didn't think I'd be interested in this drama but I was proven wrong, if you're hesitant about watching this show don't be. I SWEAR I CAN'T RECOMMEND THE DRAMA MORE :)))

Plot
A insightful and thought-provoking drama that tackles many difficult themes such as social hierarchies within the military system, suicide, social class, abuse of power and sexual abuse I'm telling you when I finished I kind of felt empty but I wanted more, I felt so many different emotions whilst watching this drama but there wasn't a single moment were I felt bored.

Acting
I never knew Jung Hae-In could pull off such a different character, I'm so glas he took this role cause he did an amazing job. THE REST OF THE CAST FJGHS I LOVED THEM ALL idk what to say but let me just say the acting is impeccable
AND THE HUMOUR!!


OST
AHHHH I added every single song to my playlists, the songs chosen really fit the overall mood and are quite contrasting in a way. The intro song perfectly captures the atmosphere of this drama idk how to explain it but really all the songs involved in this production were brilliant


OVERALL PLEASE WATCH THIS SHOW :)))))))))

Excellent but Heartbreaking
Wow, this drama is intense. They do not flinch from portraying the brutality of mental and physical bullying in the South Korean military. It's based on a webtoon by Kim Bo Tong, who was a DP when he did his mandatory military service. It's only six episodes, and Jung Hae In and Koo Kyo Hwan were excellent as the DPs. Another phenomenal performance was given by Jo Hyun Chul (the brother of rapper Mad Clown), who played soldier Cho Seok Bong. Such a gut-wrenching, raw performance that had me reaching for the tissues. This drama and his character make me worry about the softer-hearted guys who have to serve, the ones who are not big and brawny and able to better protect themselves like a number of K-pop idols but also normal citizens who serve alongside them.

Gritty Yet Captivating
Stories of bullying in the Korean Military are not unheard of yet we never truly know the full extent of this problem. This drama gives us a visual of just how bad that bullying is, and depicts it in a way that is so raw and real to the point where it can be disturbing or hard to watch.

Every episode is intense and packed with a good balance of action, heart-wrenching moments, and comedy. I have to admit that I was not fully immersed until the third/fourth episode but that's not to say that the drama did not start out great. It did, however, the writing could be just a tad bit better (not sure if the webtoon writer is at fault or the drama writers). The drama just gets more captivating in the following episodes.

All the actors were phenomenal but Koo Kyo Hwan was definitely a scene-stealer. He deserves a special mention for providing that comic relief in this dark and heavy drama. He really was a breath of fresh air whenever a scene would get too intense.

I would imagine that this drama did a realistic portrayal of the dark side of the Korean Military as the original webtoon was based on the writer's real-life experience. This is not a drama that will let you breathe you a sigh of relief in the end. It stays true to its core - gritty and brutal. Overall, this is a thrilling series that will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. It may be short with only six episodes but it left me with lingering feelings and a heavy heart.

A Darker Role For Jung Hae In Ends In Success
I waited for this drama, excited for a new role for Jung Hae In, a darker role that isn't his usual melancholic nice guy that he is already so good at. Jung Hae In's acting in D.P. was superb and I'm so proud of him for challenging himself, I hope he keeps it up. Everyone else's acting was really something as well, they all really immersed you into the drama and it all felt so really. The topics that it dealt with are really important and can be sensitive to others so be careful before you watch it. It's obvious things like this have happened before and I'd bet they are still happening which upsets me, hopefully the drama will bring light to it. Every episode is very watchable and despite the bullying you actually find yourself enjoying it and can't wait to move onto the next episode. There are comedic moments that are a breathe of fresh air during the serious scenes. I really recommend you watch it because it's impressive and informative.

Warning: Don’t watch this if you’re depressed!
Kim Bo Tong, writer of D.P. was quoted as saying: “DP was created to fight the oblivious notion that the military is better now. I wish to help those fighting in the dark. I hope to make a better tomorrow for someone who might be crying alone even at this time.” What a praiseworthy and noble objective! I sincerely hope that the miniseries gets to achieve writer Bo Tong’s aspirations.

It is an action packed 6 episodes laden with heavy scenes that are shocking to see and difficult to digest if you are the overly sensitive and emotional type. Apparently, this is the grim reality that pervades the life of unfortunate junior personnel in the South Korean military, hence the deserters or runaways, and consequently, the need for DPs - those tasked to pursue and bring the deserters back to the barracks. The show resembles a social commentary on how a strict hierarchical society perpetuates and tolerates abuses then hides cowardly under the guise that it is intrinsically part of their culture’s DNA. It is what it is. Take it or leave it.

I appreciate how this show is raw, dark and honest as opposed to glossy, fanciful and pretentious. Director Han Jun Hee was not ashamed to show the dirty surroundings and the faulty system. He did not hesitate to show imperfections down to the minutest details such as the actors’ blemished complexion and rough skin texture.

The unlikely duo of an intensely serious Jung Hae In and an extremely goofy Koo Kyo Hwan was a match made in comedic heaven. Their solid partnership and suspenseful exploits were the victorious part of the story. What amazed me about their acting was how natural and spontaneous they delivered their lines as if there was no script to follow nor any cameras rolling in front of them.

My “D.P.” review in one sentence: Prolific acting, casting, directing, screenplay, production design and cinematography showcased in 6 episodes.

Heavy Drama, Not Lighthearted Comedy
D.P Dog Day is freaking heavy. I watched all 6 episodes today and it was not the happy-go-lucky buddy cop drama from the trailer. There were some comedic moments, but overall, not a light drama. If you’re watching it, warning for bullying, verbal and physical assault, and suicide.

It’s overall a good drama. It explored some serious issues within S.Korea military and was not afraid to get into the dark details nor does the drama sugarcoat it, which I guess why the tragic and sad ending makes sense.

I love the OST. Jung Hae In does an amazing job again and still looks good in a uniform; my whole reason for watching drama in the first place.

I would definitely recommend it, just be aware of how heavy the drama actually is.

Well written, well directed, well acted
First of all im a bit picky when giving ratings, but this drama is an easy 10/10 FOR ME

First of all i cant lie the reason why i watched this is because it has jung hae in and son sukku in it and i have a bug fat crush on them, but im glad i watch this because this is one of the best drama i have ever watched in my whole life.

The story: the story is about a ordinary military men who became a deserter pursuit (dp), they tell a story about how military life in the eyes of deserter. To be honest i dont find the first four eps as heavy, i mean they show bullying left and right but they have a lot of comical scenes too. The last two eps is indeed heavy and dark, it might even triggering to some people so please be mindful if you arent comfortable with bullying topic. The story is nothing extraordinary and kinda predictable too imo, but its very well written so i dont mind about it being predictable

Acting: the acting is brilliant. I love all the actors, i love how the actors portrayed the characters, from the main cast, supporting cast to the cameo. All the acting is solid, although i can say koo kyo hwan is the scene stealer throughout the series

Music: i love the ost!

Another thing that i love: i love the intro! I feel like the intro is trying to show us that everyone in the military is loved outside the military so they should be kind to them

Thought provoking story with great acting!!
I will keep the review very short and simple. If you want to watch a great thought provoking story about the society, if you want to feel the pain of the soldiers, if you want to see bullet proof acting from all the actors, if you want to listen some precise, not OTT music, yet very solid OST, if you want to watch a sweet bromance and maybe sometime laugh a little just go for this drama!!!

And lastly 'If you want to change something, you need to do something' this is my learning from D.P.

Despite all the dark, the light really shined through
Not a lot of dramas hook me the way this show did. As a total coincidence, I had a sick day the day this was released and I just thought ""oh why not"". Typically, I am a watcher of happy not-so-depressing shows so I didn't have high expectations, but this really was a genuinely amazing show.

I'll start on a brighter note. The two main characters are extremely lovely. The comedic moments that are sprinkled into this dark-ass show made it so enjoyable. The fact that this show made me laugh and cry and scream… everything was executed so perfectly. Even the music, oh my god, it was insane! I really sat (naively) with my Shazam open at the end of every episode, hoping something would pop up (which I then realized embarrassingly late that I need to wait for the OST).

Despite riding the Korean Wave for quite a few years now, I have always been very oblivious to how the military system works — the only thing I was knew was all men get drafted for about two years. This show really portrayed all the sad truths and dark stories that those two years could offer. A primitive society fueled by dominance and fear. Of course, the show is a work of fiction, but it leaves the viewer with a weird feeling in their gut that it was probably rooted in some truths.

This show is definitely for a more mature audience as it involves quite dark topics like abuse and death. It also has *a lot* of swearing. But it really is amazing. I loved every second of it.

An Insight of the military life!
This 6 episode journey was too short, but perfectly delivered, with a long lasting impact. Too many contents were thoroughly discussed in here. And ofcourse the glorious Jung HaeIn delivered his role with as perfection as his previous projects, but this time with the alliance of Koo KyoHwan, Kim Sungkyun and a cameo appearance by Lee Junyoung and Ko KyungPyo. Worth the hype and worth-watching.
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆
To be honest, as a Post-D.P-Viewer, this made me lowkey worry about all my favs who are enlisted/and soon enlisting, but I hope the people they interact with, are nice and kind and serve well!!

To be quite honest, I don't know why I even started watching this. My love for Jung Hae In? Not quite enough. I guess I just expected good humour in a dark setting, but not too much darkness, because the trailer made it seem like that. I definitely should have taken the ""dark"" tag more seriously. But once I started I couldn't stop. It's on the shorter side, so there are no fillings, or places for boredom, yet nothing seemed rushed.
The story is awful, dark, graphic, honest and nothing is sugar coated. You'd usually expect an ending on a somewhat hopeful note. There is nothing like that here. The ending was awful. (and I am still pondering about what it meant, when An Jun Ho began running... did he run away too?).
They showed us a system that is prone to harassment, abuse of all sorts and with seemingly no escape at all. There are the victims, that might become the perpetrator, hurt pride on which they act with aggression. It is truly awful.
You can still tell that the creators wanted to get a message across, wishing for a change. At the end it even felt like the characters were talking to the audience directly.
The first few episodes were fun, like really fun, even though the comedy is not in your face, but I had a blast, even with the dark moments, but towards the last two episodes. Like wow. I'll repeat ... it's awful. Also how they sneakily build up on to the last two eps makes my heart ache even more.
I don't know what I am writing, my thoughts are messy and so are my words.

Crying Through Inhumanity...if you laughed during this drama, just straight uninstall your brain.
The acting in this drama was very well done on all counts, especially the lead and his eventual partner. Whoever titled their drama review ""laughing through the misery"",,,or something similar to that....is a legit barbarian. This show was immensely depressing and raw, there might have been a few mildly funny moments from the lead's partner, but for the most part it just piles depressing circumstances upon depressing circumstances. I legit hate the things men do to each other in this drama. It's worse than a prison drama. The intense bullying, abuse, and violent depravity made me angry and disappointed, yet again, with the depths to which humanity will sink if allowed. Joy, humor, comradery...these were all dim candles ruthlessly snuffed out by the writer as the events unfolded.

The storytelling was very good, even if the subject was miserable. The pace of the episodes is perfect, the stories have sufficient detail and background to be meaningful even in such a short format by KDrama standards. The overarching theme, apart from commentary on the S.Korean military system, was essentially about the battle to retain some semblance of humanity in the middle of inhumane torment. In the end, the system they were stuck in gave them little opportunity to achieve that goal, and instead they were continuously losing battles in which honor and dignity were weak cards in a doomed hand that stood no chance against opportunistic torment.

I wouldn't watch this again. It was horrible to see the extent of the bullying and I'd rather just pretend people don't actually treat each other that way. I hope Kdramas like this, and all the ones about school bullying, eventually drive change so that people don't have to ever face situations like these. In watching the drama, I hope in some small way I add my one tiny voice to the litany of people screaming in outrage at a system that would allow even a fraction of this inhumanity. I think it's important for these stories to be told, and I think it's important that people are brave enough to tell them.

Why oh why did this finish so quickly
I just loved the series. Everything was spot on. The story line, the consequences of choices people make, the acting was just superb, the cinematography so for me it was a top notch series.
Was so into it that before I knew it I was watching the last one. Was really disappointed that there were so few episodes. So went looking to see when the next series was to be ready for this avid watcher to view it, only to find that there is no second series. Why Not??? If you do like this please ask for a second series.

It'll make you uncomfortable. Rightly so.
in actual shock because of d.p. it made me so uncomfortable, for all the right reasons. i want more of it, because of how honest and real it was... but i dont think i can see more of it, because of how honest and real it was. it made me feel so helpless. what a show.
also, very out of character for me, but i really appreciated how all the background stories of our main characters were just hinted and never truly, fully explored. in most cases, i'd think of it as wasted potential. but here, i liked it. the little they gave us showed us why the characters were the way they were, and why they behaved in certain situations the way they did. but they never took the focus away from what the show was truly about - the reality of a broken, and violence-driven system.

Hit my expectations out of the park
Again another gold series that does not get enough love.
When I saw the trailer I was excited. the roles that Jung Hae In take up are interesting, to say the least. Every performance of his has always left me with a lasting impression. I entered having high hopes and I was not disappointed.

The story itself is so risky. The plotline is not something you can pull off easily. As I sat watching this series I was surprised by how many issues they tackled. Honestly, I never thought much about the military system in SK but after this series it got me questioning it seriously. And not SK in particular but the military system as a whole.

There are people that willingly sign up for this but what about the ones who do not want to? What about the ones that cannot afford to? What about the ones who get away because of their connections? Just the absurd unfairness of it all is revolting.

I was aghast at the heights of cruelty humans can reach when given a little power. How humans can push each other to the brink until they break and still have no conscience about it.

This is an absolutely revelating and relevant series. Something that will knock the breath out of you, will make you want to shut your eyes yet you can't help but look on.

And the acting. OH MY GOD, THE CAST IS JUST RIGHT. I am not even kidding they absolutely nailed their roles. Ko Kyo Hwan was refreshing and comically adorable. Shin Seung Ho managed to bring out so much from his role. I won't even bother praising Jung Hae In because please boi we all know he was 101% freaking mad amazing.

I mad adored the cast of this series. I have no doubt that you will too.

I do not care much for the OSTs..were there any?? hehe...if there were, I didn't notice because I was enraptured with the scenes.

I would absolutely rewatch it. Maybe give it a few months but I will definitely revisit some scenes just to fully appreciate the gravity and intensity of it all.

CANNOT WAIT FOR S2.

ghosts/demons/zombies? they have NOTHING on this! serial killers? they are a laughing stock! this was so scary, so heartbreaking, so DEVASTATING!

I watched this after seeing my mdl friends' reaction and I was not disappointed, but I do regret this so much. will this change anything? or will people label it as a dramatic ""entertainment"" and move on?

I thought what would be the worse that could happen? Joon Ho dying? Han Ho Yul, the sweet little breath of fresh air in dramaland character? but no, it was much much worse, even if I thought Seok Bong dying would be horrible that scene! that extra ending scene?! the writer/director is CRUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

having my own mental struggles with life this did not help and I had to take a break but I made the mistake of going back and now I'm forever scared!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
after a while until around ep4 I thought the ending of ep1 was the worst one, that character who's name I can't even remember, sitting sadly regretting his choice but not finding another escape. that was heartbreaking but THAT ENDING SCENE! MY HEART BROKE
eps 5 and 6, agh those two eps were so cruel. bullying was heartbreaking and disgusting but to break a sweet gentle soul like that? to break all of those sweet innocent people? FOR WHAT! WHY! why were they like that? tradition? it gets passed over? WHY!

bullying ""less sever"" than what happened there is still heartbreaking. removing someone's smile is heartbreaking, like if there's someone who's excited about the silliest thing and yet they want to share that with you and you go ""that's your hobby? so silly/childish"" and it ruins that person's happiness and that's HEARTBREAKING yet that's so ""simple""
but to go and physically and mentally abuse people?WHY, why isn't it a crime! murder, thievery, BULLYING fits in those categories!









on a less dramatic side, the ost was so my style but dang it did not fit the heartbreaking mood, like I would listen to those songs if I didn't know about this drama

Deeply Powerful
Wow. Before this drama came along, I had trouble finding a drama to hold my interest, for so many suffered from problems I'm no more willing to tolerate (makjang, bad romance, overlong episodes, overlong season). However, D.P. is a perfection. At only 6 well-paced reasonably long episodes, I binged the whole drama in a day thanks to captivating, heart-pounding story that balances action with drama and some comedy, realism and great acting. The previews didn't do this any justice for they made it look like a buddy cop comedy, and while there's a great bromance with levity, the story is actually an unflinching look at bullying in the military that will make you positively disturbed.

I've seen speculation that this could get another season because of how it ended. However, while they could build from the ending, I thought it was well contained and that ""ambiguity"" was just symbolic. SPOILER I took it that the hero is running away from his mates because he symbolically doesn't want to be the part of the bullying and bullying cover-up cycle rather than that he actually deserted. After seeing that desertion didn't pay off nor change the system, it wouldn't make sense if he did. Moreover, we know that he saved the last deserter when he attempted to shoot himself cause TV host said he was in the hospital. And the ""fatty"" friend shooting his rifle was a warning shot cause you could see that he didn't aim at the side where other soldiers were gathering. So all of it is symbolic, like standing up.

Highly recommended.

Fluent in F Bombs
Don't let the short amount of eps fool you... this is binge watching gold! I was born in a military community and yeah half the corpse is just pricks. As we all know, it is mandatory for South Korean men to enlist, but we don't know the mental and physical abuse that goes on. Just like at school where everyone knows but no one does anything, this series highlights the darkness that is the military. I like when shows tell a different story with each episode and D.P. is no exception. Everything is tied together with plenty of bloody punches, heart wrenching moments and spunky comedy. There's enough action to satisfy even the most intense adrenalin junkie. There's also quite a few well known actors in this.
The ending had me a little lost but I think it's kinda an open ending BUT WAIT...
*hint: after the credits is another ending...much more brutal and sadly convincing of reality.
Enjoy...

Gritty and dark with bits of humor. Only 6 eps
Wow! Gritty, dark, funny, and foul....this short 6 ep drama sure packs an emotional punch! Inspired by Kim Bo tong's own experience of some cases in the D.P unit, this drama sheds light on the awful bullying and hazing that can occur in the military.

I thought the director did a fantastic job balancing the tone between heavy vs funny and keeping the pace tight. I didn't have to skip any scene. And the cast did an amazing job making their characters realistic. Jung Hae In delivered the right amount of good, dark, and toughness to his character. Koo Kyo Hwan continues to delight me with his unique color and flair that he brings to all his characters. His comic timing is spot on! The supporting cast also were all so believable in their roles.

While the bromance between Hae In and Kyo Hwan is fun to watch, the subject matter is very heavy and disturbing. They don't hold back on the violence, cursing, and trauma shown, but that's what I really liked about this drama. It's refreshing to see something so raw. It makes this drama more impactful by sending a clear message to the military. Changes need to be made. Hopefully Netflix will greenlight season 2 as I read the production team hasn't finished telling all their stories.

Absolutely incredible.
I was not expecting to love this series as much as I did. I find it difficult to keep watching when a show has loads of episodes that average over an hour per episode so when I saw that this only had 6 that were less than an hour I thought I’d give it a shot. This show has absolutely everything in my opinion: it looks at serious issues and handles them amazingly but also has the perfect amount of funny and wholesome moments. The characters are great and super interesting, I especially love the lead duo of Jun Ho and Ho Yeol. I really think I felt every emotion possible when watching this, I laughed, cried, felt angry and scared etc. D.P. has definitely become one of my new favourite shows, if not my favourite. I can’t recommend it enough and I’m super excited for the next season.

What a shame this got overshadowed by Squid Game
I think the whole concept for this drama was extremely interesting and unique to the k-drama scene. Instead of the typical soldiers that we see in blockbuster dramas like DOTS and CLOY, D.P. was based on an entirely different unit, one that isn't really depicted in dramas and movies all over the world.

This drama also had a good message and shed light on important issues that may or may not have been ongoing in South Korea's military. The OSTs weren't exactly memorable. I'm not sure if there were even any OSTs, but the background music that played during certain scenes throughout the drama were aptly placed.

I enjoyed the dynamics and chemistry among the three main characters. There was also a good balance between the two leads in terms of their characters' personalities and I felt that they complemented each other very well.

If I had to nitpick, the plot fillers eventually did get a bit repetitive, but I guess that's just because of the nature of the drama. I still enjoyed this thoroughly. It's a shame that this came out slightly before Squid Game and was completely overshadowed by it (not to discredit Squid Game).

In summary:
What i liked - cast chemistry, Jung Hae-in, plot, cameos
What i disliked - N.A.

Star of the show: An Jun-ho, played by Jung Hae-in

Rating: 8/10
Watch if you want to watch an unconventional style/genre of k-drama, or if you like Jung Hae-in

Grim story + high production quality + strong talent
I will admit to queuing this up solely on the basis of wanting to see Jung Hai In be something other than the best boyfriend, ever. He does not disappoint, inhabiting a soldier who is both highly intelligent and somewhat naive. This is a trauma-fest, and if you have trouble watching shows that feature bullying, sexual abuse, physical violence, etc, then I would skip it. But the terrible scenes are necessary to underscore the terrible situation in S Korea's military. There are plenty of news stories, if you want to google check the show's writers.

The first 4 episodes are 9-10s. No spoilers, but it gets a little wild at the end, with the last two eps being more like 7.5-8 in my opinion. The stories of the deserters are all gut-wrenching, but the show is produced so well it is hard to look away.

I'm looking forward to a second season.

Masterpiece Drama
As Military Enlistment is talked about quite often, especially with the news that X actor is enlisting. It all seems like a very heroic job but this drama shows the realities faced by those in the military.

Military practices are years old and the drama definitely pointed out that change is difficult. Quite a sad ending to the drama, it felt quite light at the beginning but as the story progress it took a dark turn.

I think the screenwriting, acting, cinematography. The drama portrays emotions beautifully within each arc. The message this drama left is very powerful and I hope this makes a difference in the places where there are issues in Korea.

must watch
I love everythig about D.P, from the story idea to the cast to the OST. It's very interesting and I like the different small stories of those deserted soldiers and how Ahn Joon Ho and Han Ho Yul are on their missions trying to track down those soldiers.
It's a mixture of seriousness, suspense and maybe a bit of sadness.
The vibes are really great overall. I haven't payed too much attention to the OST soundtrack while watching, but I started listen to the OST afterwards and I love the songs.
And I absolutely adore the cast members!! Can't wait for the second season!!

Compelling
If anyone watches this gritty and hard hitting drama without feeling some kind of emotion, they are not human. Mainly because its core lies in the realities (for possibly a few, but that's still too many) of military life (not just in S.Korea).
Fear, powerlessness, helplessness, abuse, bullying, trauma and cover ups, are all presented in a tight, excellently paced and acted drama.
I feel this series is quite brave, as it doesn't pussy-foot around so many of the wrongs Koreans know exist in both their national service and culture.
Excellently written and produced, with an OST that never did anything but compliment what I was watching.
All the darkness and hurt is tempered by sublimely introduced sarcasm, wit and affection.
So many characters are pit against one another, through no fault of their own and with no choice, in an environment where seniority holds all the power and with no easily accessible recourse. Cascading down from the top of command, all the main characters are subject to being humiliated and mistreated by their immediate superior.
The closing 2 episodes are shocking and heartbreaking, as that helplessness and despair bursts out in an explosive finale.
The dialogue and story of the Series 1 closing scenes, should really make the real-life powers that be wake up, feel ashamed and strive to clean up their house.
I am so needing S2. A must watch.

A beautiful, hurtful message
I don't know if the purpose of this drama was to put the light on the bullying and corruption in korean army, but it's what I saw in this.

Through the eyes of Junho, we learn how this army thing is working, and the dynamics there are. One thing prevail every other. You must respect your seniors. And there is a harsh bullying on the juniors.

It starts somehow slowly, with ""just"" humiliations and physical punishment, but the way it ends... There are no words to describe it.

I liked how pretty much each episode was focused on a different deserter, with each a different story. It shows not only the ones that couldn't stand the bullying, but also the ones that were on the other side.

The story itself was breathtaking, and the script was really well written.


Now, for the characters, I really liked Junho. Yeah, he was somehow emotionless, and impassive, but gosh his eyes were talking for him. Jung Haein did a freaking great job, and that's one thing I really like with his acting. His eyes, and the emotions we can see in him.

Hoyul was somehow showed as the funny, quirky guy, but I think there is more to his character, and I can't wait to see more of him. It was my first time seeing Koo Kyohwan act, and I really loved him.

Im Jisup and Park Bumgoo were, for me, somehow equivalents characters. Both ranked, both seeking for a promotion, but both with a moral and a duty sense. They really brought something to the story.

The supporting cast really did great. But one actor got my eyes more than the others. Lee Junyoung, as Jung Hyunmin, showed a great character, some great skills, and a freaking great acting. I'd love to see him in more roles like this.


The musics were insane too, the sceneries and camera work were amazing.

For me this was a huge hit. At first I regretted that it wasn't longer but it would've been repetitive through more episodes. I just wait for the second season now.

A must watch, but not if you want a light watch. Heavy emotions incoming.

a stark, one note exploration of the dark side of the miliary
dang it started off with a bang bro (that NAIL?)

alsooooo the military police trash they need a better protocol

it shocks me how often they resort to using their fists lol a glaringly obvious excuse to have fight action choreo (like a multitude of situations could have simply been resolved if they had used their words rather than their fists. the dude (ajh) crashed into the police and let the victim escape, like couldnt he communnicate

mb i didnt understand some shit since im sleep deprived, but i feel like some themes could have been explored better, developed better. For example, an joon hos relationship with his mom randomly got resolved for some reason, which is hella confusing. I don't get why he suddenly forgave his mom for not escaping his dad....

i have no qualms with the unhappy ending, reflective of reality where justice is rarely achieved (i think I'm cynical lol)

the ending of him literally breaking away and defying authority was a bit on the nose, if they wanted to show him literally breaking away from the military ideals/environment, which led to him to be a bystander.

some arcs felt so abrupt (that girl and her abusive bf? hello)
- I'm trying to think of the significance of that arc (her last parting words, don't pity too much. Perhaps it's a commentary on how people who are soft hearted in this world/military get screwed over)
- sometimes, it felt like suffering for the sake of suffering...or mb that was the purpose: just trying to shock its viewers into the idea that damn, the military be dark
- i think the issue is I felt like it was heavy handed. Lacked nuance? because this thing is basically exclaiming, MILITARY ACTUALLY BAD, in large caps, which is valid i guess (if it's a new concept...).
- it sort of got ridiculous at the end, i never really got a feel for the main characters i think. They were a little bit underdeveloped.

interesting:
- suffering begets suffering, bullying begets bullying ( basically everyone bullies each other)

Good Enough
Korean Drama ""D.P."" is an intense drama that takes its strength from the reality that it presents.

The drama follows the main character as he discovers along with the viewer the small cases that build up to the final one. That main character is presented more like a blank canvas, with few clues of who he is and what sets him apart from the rest. He is probably there to be the eyes and ears of the viewer and even his decisions are closer to the ones everyone would have opted to.

The other characters were more colorful and dominated the scenes in a more powerful way. Nevertheless, the actual story was pretty intense and emotional, being tragic because it felt and probably is close to reality.

Finally, the performances were all great and walked side long with a great script and well paced story.

So, overall, 8 out of 10.

One of the best series I've ever watched.
This made me cry. CRY cry. Like full on sobbing. The crying you do at someone's funeral. The only time I cried this much over a drama was when I watched Squid Game.
This was funny and sad at the same time. The ending proves that there will be another season so I'm really excited!
This really shows the things happening inside the military and it's really unique. I like the main character being heroic and selfless.
The acting was just, mwah. Perfect. I believe half of the crying was because of how good the actors were.
I really liked the music, definitely going into my playlist.
I would definitely rewatch this with my sister or someone else.

Overall, definitely watch this. If you're sensitive to blood and gore or dont want to cry, then this is NOT for you. If you want to hurt yourself mentally, then this is the perfect series.

Tragic-comedy
DP is a short drama series which covers life of a newly enlisted recruit in the Korean army. This show starts off at a slow pace but picks up from the second episode. It sets off the tone right in the beginning, you as a viewer are sure to expect something somber with a bit of humour ingrained. I think my favourite episodes would be second and third. The latter episodes got a little bit too dark for my liking. It was very sad that one nice character was ruined by bullying so much that there’s a monumental shift in his personality. It was a sad ending. Each episode deals with what kind of mindset a recruit might be in to take the decision that they do. Since it’s a short watch, you can binge it at a go or watch at your pace.

DIFFERENT JUNG HAE IN - DESERTER PURSUIT (D.P)
I came to watch this drama for Jung Hae-In, he's so adorable and the sweetest in 'Something in the Rain', the best boyfriend any girl can hope for but in this drama though he's transformed himself into a tough smart capable Private Ahn Joon-Ho. who go out on pursuit Deserters from the Korean Army with his partner Corporal Han Ho-yul (Koo Kyo-Hwan). Army deserters, young men under obligatory 2 years military service in South Korea who went through hell of being bully, abuse, harass, humiliate, ignore by their seniors in broken military system. By each case, it discovers how these bad things effect their mental health when they rather decide 'NO' other choice but to run from the Army and face the consequences. Bully is NEVER ok, Military is the place to toughen and train men/women up, to be ready in more harsh and tough condition in case of war. Many higher ranks use this form of reason, abusing their power or seniority that many become powerless and held contempt. Who's to blame? Officers that pretend not hear & seeing anything? The system that ignore the victims, encourage the abuses as form of group discipline.

Despite all that, Private Ahn Joon-Ho (Jung Hae-In), Corporal Han Ho-Yun (Koo Kyo-Hwan) and Sergeant First Class Park Bum-gu (Kim Sung-Kyun) come out as more compassionate and reasonable soldiers than the most. Corporal Han has more comedic side of him, taking his job funner with passionate approach to the problem, Private Ahn is the 'brainier' in finding deserters using logic and analysis although he did not go to collage and has a rough abusive upbringing, Sargent Park is their superior who gives orders - he sees reason behind every deserters. The story is great, the actors do amazing job, the supporting actors do nothing less than the main actors. When they chase - they really run, Hae-In really do boxing - his stance is perfect. Pack of emotion, comedy, action, smart dialog, great music (OST), no romance which is awesome. Although some of the scenes are gruesome...nothing I can find wrong to every episode, although it's only 6 episodes! End episode with shock, ehemm...what? This is the end???

I can see a mole in the corner of Jung Hae-In's lip (want to bite that), he's boxing and no smiling, tough exterior somehow doesn't erase his sweetness and charms of Seo Joon Hee (Something in the rain). I am looking forward for season 2 and hopefully it will be more than 6 episodes....oh can't wait!! I'd like to see more of Jung Hae-In in more manly impressive character instead of his brand as a romantic cute sweet lovable guy in romance drama. I like him here...a complex deep heartfelt man who has inner struggle, who wears baseball cap and a hoody than polished apparels, who doesn't smile to charm the ladies but seriousness like he's been through rough and witnessing sadness and disappointment in life.

Best of 2021
Wow, I finished this when it first came out but I couldn't put my thoughts into words; I just kept thinking about it.

Such a gritty and real show, so disturbing at times (the last scene had me sick for a while, and I'm usually alright with violence). So many times I had to close my eyes or look away, it really became so painfully real. The cast was phenomenal, which probably made it even more heart-wrenching because all their experiences felt so real. But, I have to mention Jung Haein. Wow. I've always loved his roles, acting, and his choice in projects but I feel like he outdid himself here. A character like Junho, so reserved and stoic yet, you could always see an unbridled anger underneath him, like it would erupt any moment. There are no sappy overdone emotional backstories, yet short but impactful glimpses of what Junho has experienced and what he is experiencing. His brief smiles and slow warming up to Hoyeol was so genuine, definitely one of my favourite duos ever. Koo Kyo‑hwan as Han Hoyeol was amazing as well,; a charismatic and eccentric character, yet would absolutely kill those emotional scenes. There is not one weak member of the cast: from the bullies, the victims, to the superiors, everyone nailed their roles.

The story itself was amazing, the opening credits really setting the question meant to explore in DP: if we all seem to have these human emotions, these universal experiences of growing up, why are we so cruel to one another? Why do we turn the blind eye to one another? The descending of Jo Sukbong into madness was so gradual yet so understandable, by the last episode it was shocking that it was the same person we had seen in the beginning.

Overall, I have nothing but praise. A difficult, yet rewarding watch. One of the best of 2021, if not the best.

Dark but well worth the time to watch.
I have to say this was a very dark show. I have seen the trailer and I had no idea what it was really about.

I gave it a re-watch value of 9 because it is so hard to watch at the end, but it was a great show. If they did another season I would go back and watch this one to remember.

I do however find myself hoping they continue with it. I did not realize it was only 6 episodes. I had figured we would see his entire military career.



A bit of a spoiler so do not read if you have not seen it. I am not giving details but if you have read other reviews you will understand what I am talking about.



I am glad I watched it but I will admit the last episode is really heart wrenching. You can feel the pain that Jun Ho is feeling, it tore at my heart to hear his pain, for that I give the director/writer and of course the actor 10 stars for that one scene alone.

“I should at least do something”
D.P. is one of the most frustrating, heart wrenching, and hilarious dramas I have ever seen. I was aware that abuse runs rampant, especially in the military, but I was not aware just how deep it runs. I was utterly disgusted with the system of violence that is held in place by the systematic oppression that exists. D.P. follows Ah Joon Ho, a new recruit to the military. Right from the start the audience is aware that abuse is normalized. Sometimes it is often rewarded. Joon Ho, like his comrades, is physical, emotionally, and psychologically abuse. But due to his attention to detail and quick thinking, he is recruited to work as the D.P. team (aka Deserter Pursuit). They are tasked with capturing deserters from the army. Although this drama does deal with heavy topics (such as suicide, abuse, sexual and assault) it manages to still be quite hilarious. It's very difficult to switch tone in dramas but D.P. handles it wonderfully. This is mainly because of Joon Ho's partner—Ho Yeol. Ho Yeol was introduced as this eccentric, weird, yet determined individual who is often in his own little world. He serves as a huge contrast to Joon Ho, who is riddled with grief and closed off. Slowly but surely, as the D.P. duo complete their missions the two guys form a close bond.

They played off of each other incredibly well—it didn't matter if it was a comedic or serious scene. The story of the D.P. duo is nowhere close to being finishing. These first six episodes were just setting everything up, which means in the next season we can hopefully dive into their backstory.

I don't want to give away any major spoilers though so I'm not going any deeper into the plot. The pacing was slow but it works with this kind of drama. Six episodes meant that things were not draggy, which I appreciated. Every scene had its purpose. The acting was phenomenal—from everyone—and it evoked so many emotions from me. Likewise the cinematography and OST matched the gritty-yet-comedic vibe of this drama. I cannot wait for the second season! This is hands down if only one of the best dramas of 2021 but it's also one of the best Netflix original dramas to date.

Jung Hae In's best acting yet
It's hard to watch in that it deals with difficult issues and doesn't shy away from the brutality. But it's also a beautifully told story from beginning to end. Everything from the dialouge to the cinematography to production is so finely crafted. The cast was excellent - especially Jung Hae In. Before this, I thought he does best in Romance/Romantic Comedy but he did such a fantastic job here. Without giving away too much ...there is a heart rending scene near the end that in the hands of a lesser actor, a more self-conscious actor would not have had the same impact. He threw himself in 100%. Cho Hyun Chul was also a standout as an abused soldier. His character arc played by less talented actor wouldn't be as believable.

I don't want this to be a long winded review and I don't want to give any spoilers away but this series isn't for the faint of heart. It is dark and gritty to the core, If this is something you can't handle then please don't watch.

I remember back in my high school days I had two years of JROTC. It's not the same as being in the military but you get a taste of what it's like. I was going to join the Marines but at that time women were having problems in the military and I have issues with people who were the same age as me getting in my face telling me what to do because their rank was higher than mine. I even had issues with the actual sergeant majors telling me what to do because they knew they could. I was dismissed from the platoon so many times. I quickly decided going into the military just wasn't for me.
Watching this series reminded me why I made that choice.

This series is mainly one toned but thankfully there were some comical elements to lighten up the atmosphere a little. I don't know if the series would've made it if Koo Kyo Hwan wasn't in it. Kim Sung Kyun threw me for a loop because I was just so use to seeing his demeanor in Fiery Priest that I forgot he can be serious and he was.

If you've ever been bullied or you were one then this may not be a thing to watch. I gave it a low rewatch value because this is something I can't watch twice. There were moments where I was glad that things happened the way it did but overall this is real and it does happen not only in the military but in the police force as well.

Shows the reality of SK's military as it is.
This was a really intense watch, but enjoyable nonetheless. I think the show did a fairly good job of portraying the reality of a broken military system. It definitely didn't shy away from showing all the abuse and brutality that takes place in the military. With only 6 episodes, the plot moves quite fast - things will go from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye, but I think the fast pace was perfect for this kind of show.
I especially appreciated the show's abundance of funny scenes to make up for the heavy bits. The comedy didn't try to downplay the serious topics but instead tried to lighten the atmosphere. So, kudos to the writers for balancing that mix well. That being said, D.P. is filled to the brim with many emotional and serious topics, so make sure to look into trigger/content warnings before you watch (i've listed some below).
As for the acting, I think everyone in the show did an amazing job portraying their characters. The development of Jung Hae-in and Koo Hyo-wan's friendship was done very well and I found myself feeling so cheerful watching their interactions. Koo Hyo-wan's character was probably my favourite part of this show.

Trigger Warnings for those interested in watching D.P.: bullying, sexual harassment, blood/mild-ish gore.

DARK TRUTH about the Military enlistment in Korea
It's a really good Korean drama. The first episode was so bloody good. I love the opening shots. I really love how the whole drama is so realistic in showing the military enlistment horror that every Korean man has to face. Go Kyung Pyo cameo in the first episode was unexpected but loved the cameo so much. I just love how the whole episode is so smooth and heading to a whole new level of craziness. The abuses and torture that most of the men have to suffer in the military enlistment were so well shown in this episode. I like how raw and natural this drama is. Koo Kyo Hwan (Han Ho Yul) definitely brightened up this episode.

Jung Hae In (Ahn Joon Ho) acting is so dammn brilliant. I have no words. He has this sad face. He looks like he has already given up on this world, but there is this burning anger inside him. His past memories tend to haunt him all the time. From the abuse, he saw in his family to all the abuses and injustice he is seeing in his military enlistment.

Overall, Loved this drama! The last episode, first episode and the ending of episode 5 was BOMBastic

Heartbreaking truth on bullying
Bullying is a prevalent problem in many countries and its the bigger problem lies with the fact its a problem that is swept under the carpet most of the time. This drama holds no barred from revealing the impact of bullying has on its victims. The violence and abused shown is acceptable for my end albeit still disturbing on your mind and it's needed to show us that bullying is never to be taken lightly. Jung Haein carries his role so convincingly and he is such a likeable character even though he is not your typical hero but he held his moral grounds where its needed and defend his dignity. Sergeant Park with his limited power did his best to do what is right even though the outcome might not favour him. Lets not forget the comical sidekick Corporal Han , he has the best chemistry with Private Ahn n i secretly wished they can continue on to police academy n become detective partners where they solve the crimes together. The ending surely breaks my heart n i cried over the death sokju, when he asked them what have you done to stop it (the abuses) it hits right to my heart because in real life how many of us choose to close a blind eye to unfairness, bullying n abuse, in a way all of us are guilty of becomimg the onlooker which is the finale episodes title. The ending is tragic but it is the more reason why it tells us change must take place

Love it a lottt!!! it really gives me a new view of military if that make sense. i at first don't know what d.p stands for so I thought it's going to be smtg about inside the military like the armys training and stuff. but it's not. it kinda like a shade to the harsh military life, and i love the stories for each deserter. like I love how they show they all have sufficient reason to desert and not for fun, well except for one as far as I remember. and bcs of their stories, it kinda depicts the social issues and how the society are as well. love it love it love it! oh and yes, acting are amazingggg especially of course jung hae in and koo gyo hwan. i cut some rating just bcs i find it hard to focus at times. but objectively speaking, it's amazing.

this was nice!! a story about soldiers, specifically about dp soldiers, which ive never heard of so this was very interesting for me. each story were goood and satisfying and has lessons that i learned from. the bullying and violence were quite intense so definitely not for the weak hearted hahah and although im not sure if the violence were exaggerated but i know for sure those kind of things exist among the military soldiers, so watching this drama felt fresh and new because of the soldier/military settings even if the issue is cliche. but the issues discussed were very serious though imo, like uh tahla the bullying culture shldnt be thought as smtg normal at all haih. and on the first ep i actually felt weird about the whole hue of the drama but then later find it super cool to make the whole cinematography liddat hahah the characters did amazinggg and i can empathise with them and music was great too!! overall its just a short one and i enjoyed ittt hihi

Not for everyone
Okay, so this is a super unpopular opinion it seems — but I did not enjoy Vincenzo. Yes, Song Joong-Ki is pretty. Yes, the cinematography was beautiful. I even came to like Hong Cha Young's extra behaviour at some point. But the plot??? The side characters???

My biggest gripe was with the story. So many parts simply made no sense at all. I understand that the over-the-top ridiculousness was part of the ""fun"" to some people. Personally, I hated how the show could go from sublime coolness (like the vineyard, ending of ep 4, or even the demise of our Wusang trio... talk about WOW) to bonkers slapstick moments. I can see how this contrast may add levity to a drama that might otherwise be too heavy, but it felt like a lot of bloated filler. It honestly ruined a lot of the immersion for me. The episodes could be so much tighter without so much time spent on the Geumga Plaza crew (who never became endearing to me, unfortunately). How plausible is it that they're all from such crazy athletic backgrounds too, and can take down professional goons so seamlessly? I could've also done completely without all the NIS stuff, zumba, etc. I didn't even like Inzaghi all that much, although I did like the symbolism related to him + Jang Han Seok at the end. At a higher level, I will give points to the broad direction of the story though. I am glad Vincenzo's character did not fundamentally change throughout the story though, and that the ending remained dark but neatly tied up. Vincenzo is an anti-hero through-and-through, and it's good that the writers stuck to their guns there. The ""corn salad"" joke was fairly endearing. Also, you have to give them some props for the horseback riding fan-service and the callback to it at the end. Hah!

Still, I will commend this show for its social commentary on corrupt structures in Korea and beyond. It does show the interplay between government / corporate / legal realms well. The OST was fitting and gorgeous, and varied enough to not give me PTSD like ""We All Lie"" from SKY Castle. And you can tell it was a high-budget production with great CGI and cinematography. Oh, and did I mention Song Joong-Ki is pretty yet? Worth reiterating in case you're willing to watch just for that.

Wasted Potential
Fair warning.. this is gonna be an unpopular take, but here’s my two cents.

The biggest flaw with the show is the story and how it progresses. The original concept for the show is good. A ruthless consigliere from Italy comes to Korea to reclaim a hidden vault of gold. The first episode is killer, and it’s what originally hooked me, but the entire plot quickly devolves into cheap thrills. The plot points are predictable and there is a complete lack of character motivation. The original character motivations that the show introduces fly out the window. There are so many character decisions that don’t make sense. The show depicts the characters to abide by a certain set of principles and suddenly those same characters renege on those same ideals. A small example if you will: Hong Cha-Yong was introduced to be greedy and with somewhat loose morals, yet she drew a hard line on violence. The moment she meets Vincenzo, violence is now suddenly justified in her eyes. In another instance, Vincenzo is shown to carefully and methodically think himself out of difficult traps. But when plot armor is needed, he suddenly becomes the dumb protagonist that barges in without a second thought.

Unfortunately, the show’s problems don’t end here...

In my eyes the most controversial aspect of the show is the comedy. It’s completely and utterly absurd. The comedy doesn’t feel natural at all. It’s as if the characters know they’re in a drama and are making gags at that fact. It’s incredibly hit or miss. I won’t lie and say nothing lands. Some of the jokes are solid and had me chuckling out loud, but out of the 20 episodes this was far and few in between. The general outline of the plot is pretty gritty and intense, and out of nowhere the comic relief kicks in and it falls flat so often. It’s incredibly jarring and pulls you out of the show immediately.

The casting is excellent. Song Joong-Gi is excellent in his role. His kinda scrawny stature had me questioning how ruthless he can appear, but he completely convinced me. A+ performance. Jeon Yeo-Bin is charming and does justice to her character. The real limitation is the writing for her character. I think she did as well as she could have given her script. Without revealing any plot points, there are side characters that had interesting potential that, unfortunately, was not realized.

Final thoughts:
At the time of me writing this review, the show is rated at 9/10. This is grossly over valued in my opinion. No chance this is the same quality as shows like Flower of Evil or Stranger. This show is best described as wasted potential. The writers went hard into slapstick comedy mixed with extremely intense crime drama, and the two genres did not mix.. at all. There were seriously good merits in sticking with either or, but the mix killed it for me. I watched this weekly so it was bearable. Not entirely sure how bingeworthy it is, but I can say I won’t be rewatching this.

AVERAGE & OVERHYPED
VINCENZO is like that new dish you had always wanted to try out but it's served to you extremely bland. Good story, superb plot development. BUT, plenty of unnecessary characters to fill in the unnecessarily lengthy drama, slow screenwriting, substandard screenplay editing and dragged as well as stretched scenes to the point that it becomes BORING as early as in 4th eps. Morever, so many ILLOGICAL happenings in the disguse of fiction like typical Indian show where people get killed without a second thought and the killers get away with everything easily. They did an amazing job in casting actors for the major characters but NAHH, it's not it!

Story-writing: NICEEEEE
Script-writing: MEHHHH
Story and script are 2 different things and one doesn't necessarily has to be good at writing both. The direction could have compromised it but the director's screenplay editing made it even more boring.

They have portrayed homophobia in a positive light here hence I deduct one point from it. It was horrible to sit throught how they made fun of someone's sexuality.

Totally overhyped by people who only fall for visuals. Unreasonably rated high by people who watch selective dramas just for entertainment. It is not that bad but it definitely is not one of the best. PLEASE.

The acting of the villain is *Chef's Kiss*
Now that I have watched the show completely, I really think I should go back and thoroughly revise my review accordingly. This is probably going to be a very controversial one, so prepare yourselves to hate me all you want.

First off, let's start with the good thing (yes as in singular word ""thing""! the only good thing!) about the show. I think we can all agree that this show wins the prize of the BEST VILLAIN OF THE CENTURY! In fact, I believe if someone's going to watch this show they're gonna wanna watch it for the sake of the villain's splendid acting skills. The actor does an amazing job of displaying controlled and uncontrolled rage and you will believe him to be a true devil. So when watching his scenes, get ready to have your mind blown away! Pay attention to his mimic and expressions and how smoothly yet drastically they change and you'll know what I'm talking about. Among all the characters in the show, he is the truest to the character and the most believable one as well. Now that I lay the only positive point about the show out there, off to the review:

Story:
The most buggy storyline I could have ever imagined for a show with such a strong concept! I mean, there are exaggerations flying all around the ML. The show tries too hard to depict him as a capable invincible vicious man and pushes it way too far to the point that logic falls apart and at the end of the show, everything seems stupid and out of pure luck instead of due to ML's capabilities. I mean, the scene with the birds helping him out, even if taken from a comedic point of view, has too much of an impact on the outcome to be brushed off and is too absurd to be acceptable. Also, how come every single person who joins forces with ML suddenly becomes the most capable person you could find in the whole country, but anyone on the villain's side seems not to have any brains? Even the villain's lawyer fails to think straight and prepare for a fight, to the point that the villain goes into a warzone with only 4-5 bullets in a gun he just randomly had to grab from his brother's belongings. The funny part is, people are only capable and smart as long as they are still with the ML. As soon as they betray him, they make the most stupid decisions and fail with anything they are planning to do. And WHAT IS UP with the plaza residents ALL being such an out-of-the-ordinarily usefully skilled bunch of people? I mean, every single one of them? Really? Why? Plus, the characters are way too far far away from being consistent (except for the villain and his lawyer), especially the FL! She is very strictly against violence even when she's seeking revenge on his father's death and yet she falls in love and keeps helping this vicious brutal really violent man who is never satisfied with just killing, but prefers to torture people mentally and physically before he kills them off. The FL is a 30-something-year-old lawyer. You would suppose she has more grounded personality traits. But that is so not the case.

Acting:
Well, I already talked about the villain. As for the rest of the main cast, I'm not sure if the actress is to blame or the character description was way too off, but she has the most unreal character among the main cast. I did not enjoy it at all. The ML on the other hand did pretty well, as Song Joong-ki usually does. However, compared to the loud character of the villain, the calm and relaxed character of the ML does not make much of an impression, even if the ML does throw his stunts and overcomes one challenge after another. I've never found myself rooting for the villain in a drama and I personally believe it's important to keep the drama focused on a strongly displayed lead role. It takes so much for a show to make me ignore the lead role and yet, this drama somehow managed to do that.

Music:
I'm probably being harsh on this one since I have a very particular taste in music, but none of the OSTs stood out for me.

Rewatch Value:
Nope! Not a chance I would go through 20 episodes of stupidity again! I wouldn't even recommend watching the show for the first time unless you already know you are up for a huge waste of time with draggy slow motions and scenes of the ML staring at walls and drinking wine while listening to music and you are willing to do so only to witness outstanding acting from the villain. Honestly, this is the only reason I did not drop the show, and do not regret watching it.

Final thoughts:
*****SPOILERS ALERT*****
I can not get over Ok Taecyeon's splendid acting. He is legit crazy and a perfect devil. I honestly didn't know he existed before Vincenzo aired since I'm not really into KPop and somehow I have managed to tiptoe around all his dramas over the past 15 years of me sweeping KDramas. At the same time, I really loved Song Joong-ki ever since Nice Guy aired, and even more so when Descendants of the Sun was released. But MAN! For me, Taecyeon's acting makes Song Joong-ki's role disappear in the background. He really killed it here.
I have to admit now after watching his previous dramas (notice that I loved his acting so much that I looked up his previous projects and watched them, even the ones from 2011) that he has made great progress with his acting skills. I can't wait to see more of him.

COULD'VE BEEN PERFECT
I was onboard the moment it was announced that Song Joong Ki will star, I was expecting a big serious action drama but i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually lighter in tone - something i didnt know I needed.

ACTING. 9.5. Song Joong Ki as Vincenzo was just phenomenal here. Oh Taecyeon as Jang Jung Woo was so terrifying and was a revelation. Jeon Yeo Been's quirky and smart Hong Cha Young was just the right amount. The pool of amazing support cast - Kwak Dong Yeon, Kim Yeo Jin, Jo Han Chul, Yoo Jae Myung, and all the Geumga Plaza residents were all top notch.

STORY and EXECUTION. 8.5. The premise is interesting - and the overarching idea of good vs evil or evil versus lesser evil is not original but executed well. The shift in tone when Vincenzo arrived in Korea and the touch of comedy was also somehow welcoming.

However, in the middle of the series I got tired of the chess-like moves each camp is making, that it became a little hard to take things seriously. I questioned whether Vincenzo was really a scary mafia that we were constantly reminded of, and whether Jang Jung Woo was really a baddy or just a a spoiled little twat. It didnt help that the main characters, despite being constantly faced with danger or threat remained alive, almost till the end. Somehow it felt like the story and the lifespan of the characters were extended because the number of episodes were extended. Also, the fact that everyone in the Geumga Plaza building were somehow hiding a secret identity just made the story telling convenient but not necessarily engaging.

The special effects were also amazing.

REWATCHEABILITY. 8.5. Id argue that you can watch it and mute the sounds and the show will still be watchable thanks to the visuals of Joong-Ki - this guy age so well. Okay in all seriousness, although there are some weak moments, the light tones sprinkled within the series made it easy to watch and re-watch. The characters are easy to love and the villains are so hateable that overall it is still entertaining.

OVERALL im giving this show a 9 out of 10.

DEXTER/GAME OF THRONES MEETS KDRAMA WORLD !!??
This show left me extremely frustrated and ultimately disappointed. A part of me does not understand the massive appeal and praise it is getting let alone the insane ratings on this website. Another part of me knows exactly why it has attracted the audience's attention or why it will be remembered for a long time. When I started this show I could see the vast potential it held, but bit by bit my hopes went down the drain as the season progressed. My analysis stems from personal preferences and conscious/subconscious biases, so I hope you keep that in mind as you read ahead (though I've tried to be as objective as possible). Before I get into with my criticisms let me highlight what I enjoyed about the show.

What Worked???

1) Interesting Characters: The show boasts of a huge cast. Various types of characters from all walks of life have been utilized to push ahead the larger plot. I particularly enjoyed the antagonists of the show. The uniqueness to them, their thought process, weaknesses, character profile and interests made the story worth watching.

2) Stylish Aesthetics: The makers definitely kept in mind all the style requirements of the script. Just like the Bond movies, this series required showcasing luxurious and sharp cinematic geography. Not only did they pay attention to the wardrobe requirements (especially of Song Joong Ki) but also celebrating the narrative spectacle. The makers did a good job of consistently visually enticing while making every facet of the story larger than life, which eventually made the show enjoyable (to some extent).

3) Fascinating Idea: The core concept of Vincezo rests on the idea that “only one shade of evil can sabotage the other shade of evil in the quest for justice”. This notion has been used in many movies or dramas across the world, especially in the context of vigilante justice. But what was interesting was a Kdrama flirting with the world of Italian mafia to execute this idea. Even though the story is primarily based on Seoul and on the nexus between corporate sector, politics, judiciary, criminals and law enforcing officers, it did borrow elements of mafia practices to enrich the story.

4) Quality Acting: As usual, kdramas seldom disappoint in this section. Everyone did an adequate job in portraying their characters. Song Joong Ki was able to skillfully steer the show based on his performance (considering the whole plot revolved around him). Jeon Yeo Bin was refreshing in her portrayal of a quirky yet intelligent lawyer. However as I said, the antagonists of the show were the ones that left a formidable impact on the viewers. Ok Taec Yeon was absolutely stellar as a sassy yet scarily eccentric psychopath (who would’ve thought he is capable to demonstrating such evilness with so much conviction). Kwak Dong Yeon has only been improving with every project he has undertaken, so I have huge hopes for his future. And finally, Kim Yeo Jin was brilliant at making me hate her character’s sheer guts to execute whatever she did in the show.

What did not work???

1) Genre Mix-Match Gone Wrong: Now we all know that kdramas are excellent at mixing various genres and presenting a hard hitting story without losing its essence. However, this was not the case in this show. The dark element of this show was higher than any average mainstream kdrama. Bloodshed and gruesome deaths were a key element of the story. But the constant jump between intense scenes and comic elements diluted this seriousness. Now of course this was a conscious decision to lighten the mood of the show for the audience, but honestly it did more damage to the narration and atmospherics. This cracked the illusion of the world the show was trying so hard to build. And the makers did this throughout the series. This deteriorated my interest in the story and I felt least invested in the fate of the characters. The romantic element was still bearable because it was between two mature adults and was not over done. Their chemistry was natural, believable and sat in tandem with their character growth.

2) Glorification of Vigilante Justice: Picking up arms, practicing violent means, breaking laws and challenging the system is the core element of vigilante justice themed movies/dramas. I am not a hard line critic of this genre however this depends on the shade of darkness the protagonist brings on the screen. If I have to simply put it, Vincezo Cassano is a man no normal person would want to be associated with, no matter what. His character reminded me of Dexter and to some extent the brutality seen in game of thrones (of course not as prevalent as GOT). As a protagonist he shocked me on various levels. Throughout the show I felt troubled to understand what I feel for him. His moral compass was highly questionable to say the least. But in the show the kind of respect and admiration he enjoyed made me uncomfortable. His principles that guided him into taking someone’s life were nothing more than self justification, which were unfortunately validated by people around him. But what was worse was that there was no sense of accountability or repentance seen in his actions once the whole chase ended. Vincezo was never held accountable for his actions whatsoever, which begs the question how is he lesser evil than the antagonists? If the villains portrayed a black spectrum then Vincezo was maybe charcoal coal grey at the risk of turning black. The line that differentiated him from these people was painfully very thin (or nonexistent by ep 20). These factors made me question him as the protagonist of this show and hence I was never able to cheer for him wholeheartedly.


3) Mockery of Logic: The world building in this show was almost juvenile. An entire intelligence organization overlooked a mafia member’s activity in the country especially when he has been very nosy in the business of the so called prominent people of the city. The one guy who was given the responsibility to look into this matter eventually ends up being his biggest fan boy. Furthermore, the chief of such a powerful agency becomes a pawn in his larger plan to bring the bad guys down. The Interpol was easily convinced by him to let him do what he wants because he has a knack of making offers that no one can refuse (pun intended). The justice system is a joke, as they can be easily toyed by Vincezo to get what he wants. There is no outsmarting him and every government organization with the best infrastructure, resources and communication network can be used by him for his goal or undermined by him to get what he wants. This was tad bit too much for me to swallow. I have seen many action movies/dramas where the protagonist has to be presented as a heroic crusader for justice. But the makers have to sell these facts convincingly. After a point everything seemed silly.

All in all Vincezo is memorable for frivolous factors like some punchy dialogues, glamorous wardrobe, visual appeal and beautiful aesthetics. But beyond that the show lost its core essence after first few episodes. It lacked depth and genuine insight into the purpose of their characters and their actions. According to me this is an overrated show which will continue to be popular and recommended to kdrama newbies for years. However it failed to woo me.

Did I miss something?
Okay, yet another unpopular opinion coming to this drama's reviews.

The Pros: It was a fun ride between episode 3-15. The characters of Geumga Plaza were entertaining to watch as they interacted and grew as people. The humor honestly gave me some good chuckles and, although the humor is one of the more highly contested parts of this show, I honestly found it fine overall. The action was also engaging and the cinematography was simply stunning. But none of this could hold together a show that otherwise completely lacked reason and soul.

The Cons: The first red flag for me was the villain. The “twist” of who the true villain was in the early episodes made me go “why?” and I was never (literally never) able to take him seriously. The cat and mouse game between Babel and Vincenzo was exhaustingly repetitive. After the first couple of major deaths, everyone also seems surprisingly nonchalant about the absolute abnormal amount of dead people and near-death experiences they were constantly encountering. Vincenzo literally shoved someone out of the Geumga Plaza when that was an unthinkable act to do in the first few episodes and no one blinked an eye (Where do these dead bodies go?? Where is the government??? Where are the concerned citizens?????) Perhaps this is my own bias coming through, because I appreciate character driven dramas and I felt like there was an amazing cast of characters to grow. Alas, all the heart in the middle of the series had extinguished by the end to make way for ""plot progression.""

What really did me in was episode 17. I had rated this show as a 9 until episode 17. Following this episode I quickly dropped my rating to a 6. The episode broke everything for me. Characters were already starting to act out of character, but I was truly appalled when they killed the stuntman with the bomb. The worse part wasn't his death, it was the fact that all those lovable people I had come to adore in the Geumga Plaza had assisted in this crime and the LITERAL KCSI AGENT didn't give two shits that Vincenzo just killed a personal (in an entirely unnecessary and gruesome way nonetheless). What??? My thoughts of the show never recovered from this episode.

I swear, if Vincenzo's cast wasn't star-studded and the cinematography was slightly less beautiful this show would have gone down in Kdrama history as one of the worst. With all the hype, I left this show feeling disappointed and asking myself “did I miss something?”

Vinchenjo Quassano is *chef's kiss* - [update: the drama is a cathartic experience you won't forget]
If you are looking for a comedic, thrilling, creative, and oddly-satisfying drama to brighten your weekend, then Vincenzo is it!

STORY: If you liked dramas like The Fiery Priest or Chief Kim, then you will love the plot, characters, action, dialogues, and style of story-telling here. It's absurd, wacky, funny, but also very serious in its themes of crime, corruption, revenge, and justice. There is a good-mix of lovable characters and crazy evil villains (the main bad-guy is perhaps the biggest surprise, definitely takes the crown for the most iconic villain reveal!). The plot twists, comedic timing, chemistry between characters, and anti-hero vibes are immaculate. Also, so many great one-liners!!

CAST: Song Joong Ki, Jeon Yeo Bin, Ok Taecyeon, need I say more? With such a star-studded main and supporting cast, I think that should be enough to urge you to watch! All the actors and actresses are perfect in their respective roles and bring the characters to life. Vincenzo and Hong Cha Young have chaotic energy as partners and I'm all for it (I also ship them so much!!). SJK's Italian rants leave you mesmerized and laughing, and JYB's unique take on the quirky, eccentric female lead will leave you dying for more! And Taecyeon's acting as a ditsy, lovable English-speaking intern is (almost*) the best thing ever!

MUSIC: Thrilling, catchy, exciting. I love the vibrancy of the OST and the Italian/opera-inspired music that plays whenever something funny happens (especially when poor Vincenzo is suffering LOL).

RE-WATCH: The drama isn't even over yet and I already rewatch episodes, so there you go!!

If you haven't started watching this yet, what are you doing?! This drama is the highlight of my weekend, and now that we're nearly half-way in, I've been itching to write a review. So far, I am loving every minute of the drama, so I had to share my thoughts!

EDIT 5/3/21: Just finished the drama and I stand by everything I said 6 weeks ago! Vincenzo is a masterpiece and I dig the message at the end. The cinematography and production quality are absolutely top-notch. The entire cast and crew were absolutely wonderful and let's just say... there are bad villains, and once in a while, there are good villains too. A special shoutout to my precious baby Jang Han Seo. Excuse me while I go cry and feel empty for days now that the drama is over. What a cathartic experience.

Pure satisfaction!!
It took me a while to savor the gist of this drama as the first few episodes were a bit complicated and boring for me, but as I continue watching, the plot just got better and better, and it reaches the climax in the last few episodes, that was EPIC! Although the episodes are longer than normal Kdramas and one episode is 80+ mins, but the story was pretty comprehensive! Not draggy and fast paced, especially in the second half!

Similar to Fiery Priest and Chief Kim (as they are from the same writer), it all presented in a dark comedy kind of series, with a righteous leader, great amount of fighting scenes, a storyline of corruption and some witty yet hilarious plot throughout. I really enjoyed all of these because it just had all the humour, emotional and thrill in a show, really exciting and fun to watch! This drama in some ways, blows my mind with the integration of mafia and allows all the killing and gun shooting. Well honestly it's kinda weird if you were to think how the male lead can ""lawfully"" kill and torture so many people, but in other way of thinking, these were the best parts of the show!! I don't know about the others, but I just find all the parts where the king of evil are dealing with the demons were so satisfying to watch! So, I just chose to savor it, don't care if it makes any sense, as long as it entertains!

Applaud to all the casts, they were all equivalently goooood! Song Joong Ki literally slayed the role and was really cool in all his fighting scenes! Not to say, it really gave me a great laugh whenever he was being ""harassed"" by numerous guys hahaha! Literally everyone in the show is treating him like a meat on the plate! XD Taecyeon was pretty good too, although I personally find him not so suitable for the role, his face just looks too kind for the role, doesn't look bad and scary at all, the starting part of him being a dumb innocent rookie suits him much better! But it was a great spinoff in his acting career, good for him! :) Dongyeon, as good as always, he always pulls off all kinds of characters, a cool one, a psycho or even a coward but kind-hearted little brother. Gosh, and why do his roles always make people wanna protect him so much?

I like the Geum-Ga squad too! I always enjoyed how they make random people come together to fight crimes, it's sooo satisfying, and when you thought they were just some gossiping neighbors, it turns out to have so many hidden experts within, just look at the pigeon and you’ll know HAHAHA!

Well, I would say maybe not all might enjoy this, but generally, YES! This doesn't have much love story (almost none?), it's more about a deep end conspiracy with a group of people led by a mafia lawyer to fight crime and save the day!!! So if you are looking for a good story, this is it!

Overrated : Plot and Character Inconsistencies with great Cinematography and good OST
I'm always fond of Mafia related stories, shows and movies and to say that I have great expectations for this series is definitely not an understatement. When I watched the trailer of this show, I was blown away with the acting and cinematography until I eventually watched the series and somehow my view of the show albeit slowly changed...

The Pros of the series are definitely the cinematography, acting and OST... The actors / actresses did their best in portraying their characters well.. The soundtracks are also good and I'm definitely loving the songs...

What really fell through for me was the plot and illogicality of the characters.

The story got really really REALLY draggy too.. There were a lot of scenes for me that were unnecessary like you know the feeling that you're just watching some fillers before you get to the main point of the story.. That's exactly what they did with Vincenzo.. For me, the show could have just ended with only 16 episodes or even 12 episodes because each episode has more than an hour of running time... The 20 episodes is just too much..

Aside from the plot, the villain in the story got downplayed... Like really downplayed..
After watching a lot of crime thriller kdramas that have psychopathic killers, Vincenzo has one of the most unique villain in all of the shows that I've watched and I'm sad as well as disappointed that they didn't use the full potential of the character. The villain in the story was described to be cunning as well as a genius with his eccentricity and someone who is SUPPOSED TO BE ON PAR with Vincenzo, yet they made his character underwhelming in a way that if I summed up all the scenes that the villain did, he didn't have any scenes that justified his character because Vincenzo always won and like everything seems to be pretty convenient for the main character etc... The show really favored the hero to the point that it had me questioning a lot about what was even the relevance of the villain being on par with Vincenzo but not even having a chance to shine.. This really frustrated me... If you're going to make a series with a premise like this, it should be balanced... The wasted potential of the villain's character got me facepalming to no end.. Even the main character (Vincenzo) had a lot of out of character moments... **sigh**
The female lead also has a sassy character but the way they introduced her was just so bad and it annoyed me... It felt like she was over reacting too much or trying too hard and it wasn't even funny.. Although, I'm glad that her character had some improvements in the end...

I also find the Geumga Plaza residents to be annoying.. I find some of their scenes to be irrelevant... This would probably the show which I will comment that it has too many side characters that the show definitely does not need.. While the Geumga Plaza residents are a source of comic relief, I find it to be awkward in this show.. Like it doesn't fit the whole Vincenzo thing...

Another thing is that I understand that this show is a slap stick comedy with a sprinkle of mafia.. but seriously though, the mafia thing here is just mehhh... Not even a MAFIA genre in all honesty.... They sugarcoated the mafia tag here and if you're looking for a serious show.. then this would be not your taste.. The comedy, action and seriousness of this show is not balanced well... Too much comedy in a show that started off in a serious and bad ass note...

And also, an important thing that we must also consider in the series is the fact that there were some scenes (the homophobia and misinterpretation of a gay character) that happened in the show that left a bad taste to the LGBT+ community. The fact that this issues weren't even addressed well disappointed me. In our society today where media is a powerful outlet, viewers can be easily influenced by what they see or hear and I find it to be disappointing that yes this show is popular however, it failed to address or give respect or even importance to the LGBT+ community.

There were a lot of questions that weren't even answered well.. I've always been curious of the past of the main character and although they used flashbacks for Vincenzo's past but it's technically not enough.. It would have been better if there was an episode or even 2 episodes in which we really got to see how he grew up in Italy, eventually meeting his ""father"", joining the Casanno family and becoming the legal adviser of the family...
Furthermore, it would have been better if they also showed the back story of the Babel Siblings - how Han Seok became an eccentric psychopath, how his brother put up with the expectations of the family and what did their father felt or do at that time. These would have been more interesting to see rather than those unnecessary or irrelevant scenes in the series...

In conclusion, Vincenzo had an epic beginning with the main character starting of the story in a bad ass way but in the end the inconsistencies of the plot and characters got the best of it.. This is entirely my opinion so I won't be discouraging people to watch it.. but I just want to say that kdrama writers should try to improve in writing their characters and plot.. We need female leads that are not just supporting characters.. We need main characters and plots that are consistent / logical... And lastly, we need villains that are on par with the hero because with that, it will leave an even deeper impact or impression with the audience / viewers..

P.S. I'm not hating the show.. This is just my opinion and I won't discourage people to watch this show..

When In Rome ( or Seoul), Take A Leaf Out Of Vincenzo’s Book...

Park Jae Bum’s ( The Fiery Priest, Chief Kim)screenwriting as well as director Kim Hee Won ( The Crowned Clown, Love You) did leave a distinct mark of their combined style by mixing heavy-hitting tension with lighthearted moments throughout the storyline .

Yet whilst the comedy is evidently prominent in the plot to relieve more vigorous themes, it is probably fair to say that typical of Jae Bum’s screenwriting, the comedy often felt slightly juvenile in parts and an unnecessary weight at times. ( In certain episodes, you’d go from having an incredibly intriguing and fierce revelation exposing the mafia’s dark roots, only to have a tiresome gag in the next such as a word play upon Vincenzo’s name in early episodes.)

Admittedly, there are several moments in the drama ( even by the main cast ) which may raise an eyebrow by questionable line deliverances. However, as far as acting is concerned, the main cast were absolutely brilliant as our main leads.Song Joong Ki and Ok Tae’s Yeon headline the drama by their high-profile acting careers, however, even fellow costars Jeon Yeo Bin and Kwan Dong Yeon will quickly win the hearts and affections of the viewers also.

The characterisation in the drama was honestly a mixed bag. Song Joong Ki’s character Vincenzo was undeniably an intriguing protagonist. Whilst initially falling into the trap of the romanticised ‘ good gangster’, it was intriguing to see screenwriter Jae Bum breaking this mould in order to develop Vincenzo with sentience and realistically questionable morality rather than merely being a "" hero who saves the day"". However, there was a lot which felt vacuous with Vincenzo’s character, not least never going into his actual reasons for joining the mafia as a consigliere ( which was always half-baked) , his bond or relationship with his adopted Italian parents and ultimately exploring the actual reasons why his birth mother gave him up in the first place.

Next, is our main female lead Hong Cha Young ( Jeon Yeo Bin). Cha Young did initially seem to go down the route or being a little irksome in the beginning of the drama, but, her unreserved assertions and loyalty towards Vincenzo soon become defining qualities about the character. For instance, Cha Young has long-held enmity throughout the show towards Kim Yeo Jin’s character Prosecutor Choi Myung Hee. (Or ‘ Zumba Snake’) which certainly was maintained . On the other hand, similar to Vincenzo , Cha-Young is not a flawless character. Sometimes, she struggled to be lifted from being anything more than one- dimensional such as her textbook-style, (rather than emotional) responses initially to the events around her father Hong Yoo Chan ( Yoo Jae Myung) in earlier episodes. ( Which after their initial use in the main storyline, were disregarded completely without Cha-Young even contemplating this significant factor again.)

As far as the relationship between Cha Young and Vincenzo is concerned, it was a fairly predictable formula. There was nothing inherently wrong with it per say and did present some essential bonding moments between the characters, however, it often felt a little enforced for the sake of plot when it was necessary , rather than developing this with the respected characters’ thoughts and feelings in mind.

Antagonists are an intriguing conversation to talk about in the drama. From the cliche cronies, law firm enthusiasts Choi Myung Hee ( arguably one of the most annoying villains in the show) , CEO of the rival law firm Woosang Han Seung Hyuk ( Jo Han Chul) and the "" dumb, but not so bad"" masqueraded CEO of ‘ Babel Group’( Kwan Dong Yeon), the show has an odd array of trope advisories .

However, finishing up assessing ' Vincenzo’ wouldn’t be completed without talking about the drama’s main villain Jang Jun Woo. This is because, Jun Woo is designed to be the "" ultimate twist villain"" and "" big bad"" early on in the series, but, he was often underplayed as a dead weight and minor threat until later events. This wouldn’t have been such a bad screenwriting decision, if the show had used some time to go into Jun Woo’s backstory ( apart from a couple of brief flashbacks) or sketched him out more than just a "" villain you’re supposed to hate"". Jun Woo is far from romanticised or glossed over and whilst later episodes enjoy going into a "" Sherlock Holmes And Moriarty"" rivalry between Vincenzo and Jun Woo, there was little sense of actual build or intrigue behind similarities (and even differences) between them. Of course, Jun Woo served his main purpose; a disturbing evildoer, but he could have certainly been so much more than a one-dimensional moustache twirling villain.

The ending did hold the drama in good-stead with a bittersweet cliffhanger which reflected the overall themes and genres of the show. Admittedly, there were a couple of things which could have been tied more concisely in the ending ( despite its long duration), but, it did bring an appropriate finale. With an odd balance between genres and screenwriting decisions, Vincenzo is attractive for viewers’ attention by its main premise and cast. Certainly enjoyable in parts and not unwatchable, but, a little overrated for what its worth.

Not what I expected... let down
Maybe I am too hard or too demanding but I expected more from this drama.
I am a fan of #mafia storylines book-addict for that matter... and after all the books and research about this topic that i have done I feel let down. I mean it was well performed for a korean because as an itilian mobster it was not accurate enough. They sugarcoated too much, the characters development was a huge mess on some of them like Hong Cha-young or Vincenzo himself. If a character was one way in the beginning why did you make it seem like they were abducted by aliens that perdormed a lobotomy on them, e.g. Mrs. Hong how someone so materialistic and cheap could suddenly undergo a complete personality transformation... her character was too annoying and too nosy which devaluated the storyline from my personal pov.
The best job was done by Taechyun, his interpretation was superb, like i really was scared in some of his scenes, a lot more than with Vincenzo (the ""mobster"").
The storyline was underdeveloped and too long for only a few interesting episodes, they dragged the end for too long and then the most interesting part was too rushed and sloppily closed.
Another thing that was a overdid was the neighbours from the Geumga Plaza, sometimes they focused too much on them for my liking and there wasn't anything interesting to see...
The romance was truly the worst part 📢📢
NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE ML AND FL!!!
Song Joon Ki had more chemistry with the other male leads and supporting cast than with Mrs. Jeon. Not trying to be anti or anything, I am just saying the truth from my personal perspective. There were a few awkward moments between them that they could have saved us from...
Summarising it, too much expectations that were not reached and too much melo for a ""thriller/crime"" drama.
Hope this review is helpful for you. 💕😝😊
P.S: Don't hate or impose over those with different opinions like myself in this case... let's all be respectful and mature.
P.S. II: Thanks for all the comments (goog ones, let's not leave bad comments, please).

Sorry I watched it
This is tagged as "" Comedy, Law, Romance, Crime, Drama"" and it was, initially. There was a rather uneasy blend of crime and comedy, but the humor was quirky and the soundtrack provided a lot of good laughs. I initially hadn't planned to watch it because I hate most Mafia dramas (I went to school with children of real Mafia bosses, so it's not a world I find amusing) and because I'm not very impressed with Song Joong Ki's acting (bring on the haters!). Song was better than I expected but still not great - he simply doesn't have the gravitas I expect from a consiglieri. And I never felt any romantic vibes between him and Jeon Yeo Bin; they were pretty cold fish until the hastily tacked on end scenes.
But he real issue is that it went from a nice hidden treasure drama to a vicious revenge drama with over-graphic hate and sadism. There was nothing likeable about Vincenzo, who showed himself to be a purely evil as the psychopath he was trying to bring down. And what happened to all the gold? Was anything worthwhile done with it, or were the tenants just sucked into Vincenzo's world of revenge and greed? In the end, he corrupted them all.
The star performance was, of course, was Ok Taec Yeon, who went from a bumbling office assistant to an evil psychopath seamlessly and believably. It was a great performance. In the end, I felt sorry for him, a clearly troubled defective human being, while I disliked Vincenzo immensely. If you enjoy cruelty and revenge, you might like this. But don't be deceived by the lighthearted moments in the beginning - this drama is nasty.

It's like watching cartoons (not in a good way)
There's a hero who saves the day and there's Vincenzo who fixes every problem/issue/injustice like a walk in the park 3 days before it even happens lol

Every episode ends on this major problem that they make seem like the end of the world with no way out. Yet on every next episode's first scene comes Vincenzo laughing in our faces like: SIKE!! I already knew about this and took my measures to prevent it!! Everything is great literally less than 10 minutes into the episode.

So Vincenzo knows everything about everyone and knows how the bad guys will think and act before they themselves know. Nothing (literally) is stopping him or slowing him down whatsoever. He's perfect and makes no mistakes. So why are we watching? It's incredibly unrealistic and unmotivating to watch someone who is good at everything. If I know that everything would magically work out for him anyway then what's the point?

The plot is a mess and I don't understand how it has a nearly 9 rate. Maybe people are seeing something I'm not but what I see is... A perfect mafia guy who killed lots of people and could never face problems, suddenly joins a bunch of random people's long fight against a huge corporation in a country he doesn't even know and swears to help them achieve ""justice for some reason that was never discussed.

The fl character is flat and two-dimensional although being funny and quirky and quite promising in the first few episodes which, if used properly, could've been a really good and fresh view of female leads in kdramas.

Vincenzo's character being in the mafia was also a fresh concept that I was excited about until they butchered it literally in the first half of the first episode. And for the rest of the drama cut the whole mafia storyline down to being too cool and too smart and too ahead of everyone plus a bunch of random quotes said in Italian.

and what with the dreams he always has of killing people? What even is the purpose of those?

Every episode is longer than an hour which is extremely long for the lack of events in each one. it got quite boring really fast and sometimes I had to increase playback speed because everything is just SO SLOW I don't know why.

I don't have a problem with ""easy to watch"" light dramas. I also love Song Joong-ki (I really really do. He's the only reason I continued the drama) But this drama isn't light it's just plain ridiculous and I'm genuinely sad to say that I regret watching it!

An unexpected drama that fell off halfway
When I read the summary for this drama, I really didn't wanna watch it but after seeing some rave reviews from my friends and also not having anything else to watch, I decided to give it a go.

Overall, there were some ""wtf"" moments in this drama; an example is the rooftop scene when the group of pigeons just coincidentally helped Vincenzo when he was at a disadvantage. LOL? And the way that all the tenants, who came from an athletic background and even won championships were stuck in a place like Geumga Plaza was just very... coincidentally placed? I was really sad when Cha Yong's dad and Han Seo died, even though we've only seen the dad for a few beginning episodes but he made a very huge impact. Han Seo had the most character development but was sacrificed for our two leads (wowdidntseethatcoming). Also, does anyone else cringe when Vincenzo starts saying some Italian lines? Most of the time, the characters would be conversing about something important and he would randomly quote something from Italian; which would throw me off. Choi Myung Hee's satoori was so annoying (sorry) that I almost dropped this drama (yes it was until that extent).

I didn't care much about the Geumga Plaza tenants; tbh they were rather annoying than funny to me. Also, I think this drama would have been way better without the romance plot. I love Vincenzo & Cha Yong as individuals but unlike others, I don't really see the spark between them and would have loved it even more if they were just business partners.

The OST was good. The acting were A+++++++. But, I wouldn't rewatch it cause the episodes are long and a bit over-the-top for me.

EXTREMELY OVERHYPED
i don't even know where to start. this drama is so overrated and people praise it too much that i felt the need to voice out my opinions about it.

BAD
1. the story
i am completely disappointed about how it turned out. when i first watched the trailer, i was like oh it's a mafia concept, this is gonna be interesting and new. i was expecting it to focus on vincenzo being a mafia, how the mafia works, or some storylines related to italy. i was expecting it to be unique and worth the watch because it's a new concept of kdramas. but instead, it turned out to be the usual good vs bad plot. it's SO CLICHÉ it had so much potential to have one of the best kdrama plots of the year yet it provided nothing new. those usual corrupt characters, lawyers against lawyers, gang fights, kidnapping, murdering bc they gonna ruin the plan, revenge etc. my mom and i literally predicted the whole main plot right on the first episodes (what happened to the dad, **** teaming up with vincenzo, **** switching sides etc) and even who's the real villain. the whole story is repetitive, bad does something bad > good tries to defeat the bad > bad loses > bad revenges to good > good loses then revenges and so on. it's just a series of tom and jerry episodes :/ people praised the plot too much saying it's smart, amazing, thrilling when it's not. could've added some emotional elements as well.

2. the whole essence of vincenzo being a mafia is USELESS
please, he's just the common male protagonist except that he has a gun and he's from italy. i don't get why they made him a mafia character when he's not really different from other male protagonists. the kdrama made him look smart and the viewers think he is overly smart, but no he's not. it's just that the other characters are stupid. there's nothing special about his character and it made me frustrated because i really looked forward to how they will portray a mafia character. i expected this already, but being a mafia is so romanticized in the story. well it's a fictional story after all.

3. a lot of useless fillers
i can handle lengthy dramas. i have even watched dramas with around 60 episodes. but i have not watched a lengthy drama that has so many useless fillers as this one. many episodes did not contribute to the story or the ending, many episodes did not have a permanent after effect. they never should've brought those episodes in, it won't even make the story different. when something happens, usually there's an aftermath that would give a shift or upgrade to the story. but in this one, after that particular part happens, they just move on as if nothing happened. there's no cause and effect, it's basically just in there to make the story longer. oh and please they should've added essence or purpose whenever there is a failed attempt by the good guys, like sure it's necessary that the protagonists don't succeed at first try. but atleast give a reason why that had to happen, give that part a purpose (e.g they met a new character, they discovered something etc). atp it's just a whole trial and error story. don't get me even started about how much they emphasized some things at the start but at the end was almost forgotten or wasn't really a big part of the plot.

4. it did not excel in any genre it could fit in
it could've been atleast outstanding on one genre, but it isn't. action? no. law? no. thriller? no, wasn't thrilled at all because it's predictable and nothing remarkable happens (could be because i've watched around 100 kdramas already but idk). black comedy? no. it fairly did well on black comedy, but half of the time cringey and there's no scene that really sticked on my head for a long time. i also had a problem with one specific episode that had the purpose of contributing to the black comedy, i will explain that later. on.

AVERAGE
1. acting
i am satisfied with the acting. every actor portrayed their role well and the actor that stood out the most was kwak dong yeon. here's an unpopular opinion, i feel like song joong ki wasnt the best choice for the role vincenzo. don't get me wrong, i love sjk and i know he did his best to portray his character and i am satisfied with his performance. but i personally think because the character is a mafia, the actor should've been manlier and more intimidating. and sjk is the total opposite of that, he has feminine (positive way) and soft visuals. he's not intimidating at all tbh, but since he did a great job, i don't want to complain too much about it. imo however, the role would've suited better for other particular actors. it's not the ""this role was made for him"" as everyone thinks it is.

GOOD
1. the ost
nothing more to explain about this. the osts were great and added impact to scenes that wouldn't have been impactful at all.

2. attracts kdrama newbies
probably because the genre is black comedy? kdrama newbies won't focus much on the quality of the story, if it has comedy and some good vs bad plot with some fairly good scenes, they'll automatically love and enjoy it. another thing is that it's song joong ki, he is a very famous actor internationally.

now about the specific episode i mentioned that had the purpose of black comedy, that episode really disturbed me. it was homophobic and as someone who is part of the lgbtq+ community, i loathed the way the portrayed those scenes. those type of characters rarely get portrayed in a kdrama, but they chose to portray a gay character as a disgusting criminal. (i will use they/them when pertaining to the gay character) and the way vincenzo was disgusted by their actions? it was utterly disturbing. oh and don't even make excuses that he's disgusted because they're a criminal, if that's the case, he would've been disgusted in the first place and not particularly when they do gay actions. besides, vincenzo is a mafia. he surely encountered way worse people and he's used to criminals.

to summarize it all, vincenzo is not a special drama and the story is cliche. it isn't worth to watch, there are a lot of better ones. if you think this is the best (or one of the best) kdrama of all time, then you're seriously missing out a lot. i can name more than 70 kdramas better than this. the fiery priest is a lot better (they're from the same writer and has similar genre), it has amazing action, amazing comedy, amazing characters especially protagonist, and the whole kdrama is really enjoyable. vincenzo and the fiery priest both has those cliche corrupt characters, but the fiery priest has better personal story of the protagonist and the protagonist itself is more charming and unique (i mean where tf can u see a handsome priest that **********). vincenzo is a 4/10, tfp is a 9/10. even tho tfp has one side of the kdrama where it's cliche, the rest is outstanding.

anyways, if you're just a starter, then vincenzo could be a good introduction to kdramas.

This is pure GOLD ;)
Strong partnership between leads✓ Friendship✓ Action✓ Perfect amount of suspense✓ Comedy✓ A sprinkle of Romance✓

Are you looking for a drama that'll have you hooked straight from the get go? Yes...? Well then sadly you'll be a bit disappointed, because the first few episodes are a little slow, but don't let that discourage you from watching more, I promise it'll eventually have you hooked. Besides that, are you looking for a drama that gets more and more addicting with every episode? Big cliffhanger endings? Plot twists? Smart main leads that make the best decisions, are perfect partners in crime and have great chemistry? Scenes you can't help but rewatch at least 50 times because of how cool or sweet they were? Well then you're in luck! This is the perfect drama for you!

Vincenzo will have you dying of laughter one minute and on the edge of your seat the next... It's so good and all the actors are perfect for their roles. And what I noticed was the fact that the suspense continues onto the next episode and doesn't just finish at the end of that previous one, it was refreshing and definitely gave me something to look forward to, as I knew it would be just as thrilling. I have never felt more alive while watching a drama holy moly!

However, one down side to Vincenzo is that there are so many brief and perhaps unnoticeable plot holes that I wished were explained or at least touched on in the end but sadly weren't. And keep in mind that it is very comic-like (villain vs villain, lots of revenge, over the top, etc.) So this may not be for everyone.

Song Joong Ki and Jeon Yeo Bin's companionship is just everything, they'll definitely become an iconic duo in the drama world. The whole time I'm just thinking 'CAN THESE TWO JUST GET MARRIED ALREADY!' And Ok Taec Yeon's acting is just incredible, his characters duality though?? Of course I can't forget to mention the plaza residents, I love how their bond grows stronger and stronger as the story unfolds. The Cassano Family (°◡°♡). I like the depth in each character and their relationships, they aren't just black and white, more like different shades of grey, you just don't know what to expect next. One of my favourite castings of both main and supporting characters - including Inzaghi.

To sum it up, Vincenzo is worth watching (or at least giving a try)!

How to ruin a good original story
Let’s start with some of the pros:
- Good original story. It certainly had a ton of potential and was a great idea for a show
- The villains, despite being cliche were well written and the actors playing them held true to their characters
- The main actor is very good looking, so that was certainly a plus for most viewers (including me!)
That’s all of the pros. Now for the reasons which made watching this show a huge mistake for me:
- The Italian. Seriously. If you have an experienced team creating a high budget drama, the least you could do was open “Italian for dummies”. That would’ve told the scriptwriter that mademoiselle is a French word and the main character’s repeated use of it on top of his already horrid pronunciation completely ruined any “Italian” vibe he could’ve had. He neither sounds nor acts as someone raised in Europe and the fact that the team is unaware of this shows how little they cared about researching another culture. If the situation was reversed and someone tried to pass off Japanese words as Korean, you bet all these viewers would be up in arms about it
- The main characters. All of them. These are some of the most poorly written characters I’ve ever seen in any drama. The female main’s over the top ridiculousness undermined her character as a smart, competent attorney. The male main (once you get over his looks) has terrible facial expressions. The supporting cast is mostly shallow and illogical
- The superhero complex in this show is out of control. Everyone, everywhere simply loves and is willing to give up their life for a magical man with extremely good fighting skills and perfectly manicured baby hands. Everyday people apparently have no issue with him murdering his way through a country which does not seem to have an actual justice system. By the end I genuinely couldn’t understand why they loved him so much
- The extremely lazy writing leaves so many plot holes it’s impossible to count them all but I’ll try. The guy they scammed as shamans runs the newspaper. In the earlier episodes, they showed a huge court case where the main couple arrived in a sports car and got tons of media attention. Does the owner never open one of his papers? Has no one seen these people on TV after they constantly posed for cameras?
That’s just one example of a circus full of low IQ characters getting away with senseless actions simply because the writer ‘said so’.
- Honourable mentions: Over the top comedy which ends up being unfunny, the ‘talented tenants’ plot line was just too convenient, the main villain’s reveal was underwhelming, the romance was forced and the mid episodes were slow/draggy where I almost gave up.
Despite all that, I watched till the end mainly for the story which could’ve been amazing without all the pointless comedic elements and moronic characters. And to remind myself to never trust a Kdrama’s rating since all these viewers are apparently 17 (at least mentally) and just wish to see a pretty oppa doing cool things in shiny clothes.

taecyeon playing a crazy CEO serial killer pretending to be a naïve lawyer is by far the best part of the show but I literally hated everything else. Vincenzo is a self impressed self righteous sum bag with thinks he's hot shit when he's just as bad as the villain's and not even half as fun. does terrible shit and facing no consequences for his actions and is honestly rewarded for all the bad things he does. the female leads and the tenants of the apartment building are all in a different show. the tine is all over the place. not fun the only thing I cared about was taecyeon and anything he was doing he's the only reason this was not dropped

Song Joonki is the only reason this show has done so well
I’ll start by adding that I don’t pay attention to music so I gave it a 5 because I can’t say if it’s above or below average.
Anyways.
So first, let’s talk about the plot. People praise it for having a strong plot line, but really there’s so many plot holes. Like why would the villains decide to kill his mom when they could’ve kidnapped her? What was going on in their brain to make them think he would just stop because his mom died and not be even more motivated to get revenge… That’s just one example, there’s plenty.
As for the comedy, which is supposed to be dark comedy but really the show is just a mix of action and forced funny moments, it’s very meh for me. Some moments I laughed at, but as I already mentioned, there’s also some parts that feel very forced. Also wtf was that scene where the pigeon saved him?? I mention it now because I assume it was meant to be a funny scene, but really it felt stupid.
As for the characters and the actors portraying them, I think it all could’ve been done better. For Vincenzo, they should’ve chose an older actor with a more mature/rough looking face. Song Joonki’s acting wasn’t bad but his face really didn’t fit the role. Also Vincenzo’s character was way too overpowering, like he always had a plan for everything and seemed to almost never listen. It took away from the suspense because you could always trust that he’d get out of the problem he’s in. As for the villains, they seemed to just be there for comedy, like a cartoon villain, which would be fine if not for how smart Vincenzo is. The female lawyer villain carried her team, it’s amazing how stupid everyone else (and even her at times) was. Like really, how hard can it be to kill one man? Even if he is a mafia, he still has a limit. As for the female lead, I don’t have a problem with how energetic she is, but she literally did nothing. Her only purpose seemed to be giving the two male characters (main villain and male lead) dimension. It was always Vincenzo’s plan, she never came up with a helpful or vital idea. It amazes me that she was a top lawyer defending such a problematic company and yet she acts so stupid when working with Vincenzo.
The pacing isn’t great either. It should’ve been a few episodes shorter, I think, because the first few episodes are really slow and the last episode was filled with villain deaths, which should’ve felt satisfying but there was no suspense to them so they felt empty.

Overall, not the worst thing to watch if you have nothing else to do, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch it or recommend it to someone trying to get into kdramas because it’s not that impressive (if anyone is trying to get into kdramas, I’d recommend Mr Sunshine, My Mister, Sky Castle, Hymn of Death, Hotel Del Luna, and Mr Queen).

I DON'T GET THE HYPE..... BUT I DO
As someone interested in the genre I was rlly excited to see VINCENZO.
I think almost everybody recommended it to me.
After the show I was utterly disappointed?.

The story was nothing but plot holes. (Nd I just can't bear plot holes ?)
The illogicality blew me away.

The acting was the only reason which stopped me from dropping it.

Initial episodes were ok, but then it went downhill. Again the show got a hold of itself in the midways nd wrapped it up terribly.

As the title say, I don't get the hype with such an awful story line ......... but i do ? (U KNOW WAT I MEAN RIGHT)

?NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL?
WATCH AT UR OWN RISK!!

Only for Kdrama newbies or it is wasted
I heard a lot about this drama, so I just decided to check it out. I completed it with great difficulty because of unnecessary dragging. It's not the worst I watch but it's not the best which everyone claims.

If you are a kdrama newbie, just watch it, it's an average drama with good entertainment. But if you are a regular watcher of classic thrillers like Stranger, Flower of Evil, Children of nobody, don't waste your 20 hours.

PROS -

Good Direction/Cinematography - The budget and thought both are present in each shot of this drama. Any shot of drama compel you to watch and attract you. This is type of direction which attract you to watch drama just from teaser or short clip in fmv

Music - Let's talk about music, each and every ost as well bgm just create magic on screen. Definitely in top of my list.

Acting - Acting is very good. Every actor give their best in margin and according to their character but only few get shine . Kwak dong yeon stood out for me with his subtle acting.

CONS -

Story - Bad vs Good - it's old, let's make it Bad vs Evil. Meh, what were they thinking. This story can get pretty decent if they ended drama in 16 episodes. There are unnecessary side characters, clashing of morals of characters, as well some annoying characters. Vincenzo can be a good character-driven plot as the title name suggest but sadly it is the action-driven plot. I can't connect to any of the characters, they just do action but I can't feel for them. It's the same with every character, giving an unnecessary dark past to characters does not make them vulnerable, you need to make the characters connected from the audience. Vincenzo character leaves no influence on me, no remembrance.

Comedy - There is suddenly a new trend in the kdrama industry to include comedy with every genre. They just stopped making dark thrillers. One or two puns were decent and I chuckled but comedy overall the place break the momentum for me

Mafia in Genre - Where? Just one question? Where is that element? The gun Vincenzo hold.

Acting - Acting have cons too, SJK is a pretty actor who has his class. Either it is character or acting, but he left no impact on me. There are few actors and main roles who leave left a longtime impact - Mo Tae gu of voice for example. Hence no character in drama can be termed as iconic. Female lead annoy the hell out of me, I don't want to disregard her acting, she did well with character but it's just OTT

Hype - This is not dramas cons but of audience. The audience hyped some dramas like it is the best thing ever which make people expectations high. But it went flat when you tune in to show ,when you realise there are better options to watch.

Overall, I am not telling you not to watch, if you have plenty of time, go watch it and enjoy the action. But if you have less time and you watch classic thrillers, please don't go ahead.

All spectacle, Less Substance.
This drama had an interesting premise. Not only that, it had a good star-studded cast. It's just that I felt that this drama was overrated.

Before I lay out the issues I had with this drama, I'm going to start with what I enjoyed. I enjoyed the cinematography of this drama from start to finish.

There were also episodes that spark creativity. One episode was when it opened with the painting of the French Revolution. Then, the whole episode was built around it and it comedically culminated in the characters of the drama doing a paint-me-a-picture of the said painting.

Now, I get down to the issues.

First is perhaps the most minute of them all. For me, Soong Joong Ki doesn't really strike me as a consigliere who experienced a lot from the mafia because he looks... too clean... and soft... This is just personal preference but hey.

Second was how it wanted to be serious and not serious at the same time. This leads to a very confusing mix of genres. As other reviewers have pointed out, these two elements didn't really work together. The comedy kills the seriousness that this drama has while the gory and violent scenes kills the comedy. When balanced well, it could lead to a good drama. In Vincenzo, the tone is a confusing mess.

The third problem I had was how shallowly written the characters in this drama were. This became more obvious when I watched the screenwriter's other work, the Fiery Priest which had better-written characters. Characterization was where a lot of the missed opportunities that this drama had.

First, is with Hong Cha Yeong, her father's death could've been an interesting point for her character to grow but she gets sidelined into sometimes an obnoxious FL as the focus has been on the titular ML. Knowing her character can be something more, this is why I am not buying into the fanservice thrown by the drama as I don't see the point of it story-wise despite it being eye-candy for the audience. For me, it feels forced.

The second one is with this show's villains. Taecyeon's character was introduced to be a cunning and cruel psychopath and it was good until he revealed himself. I was expecting for him to be an active villain but he was more of a passive, spoiled brat who doesn't take part in the scheming of bringing Vincenzo down and instead leaves it all on the female prosecutor-turned-attorney of Wusang and complain that when the schemes fail.

The fourth issue, while minor, I had with this drama is when they tried to lighten up Vincenzo's character when they tried to introduce an animal companion, the scenes end up cringey. Though, I kinda like how it got concluded though it seemed ridiculous.

If you want a popcorn drama that has little struggles to offer its protragonists, has spectacle, the actors that you like seeing onscreen without having to think deep into the plot, you might like this drama.

Okay first off SPOILERS AHEAD

Taecyeon - HOLY SHIT.


I mean I've never seen him like this, I just love me a hot psychopath and this guy is a total snack obviously soooo honestly I can't rate lower.

But let me tell you why I was frustrated despite enjoying it too.

It's basically the kind of show where serious stuff happens but then they make a joke so it ends up becoming an entertaining one which is what it should have been because the finale was absolutely one of the worst I've seen for such a drama.

It was all over the place, Taecyeon killed his brother and I felt sad but the way it was shot even, if you shoot two people and make Vincenzo try to save them, it was just cringe the way that and the preceding 'torture' was executed.

It was supposed to be edgy and dark, and it ends up being cringe or pretentious.

Now, I'm not the type to hate operas, Chinese or Italian, or whatever I love all that stuff so I had no problem with those parts. The problem was the way they handled the darkness. He's Psychometric has a way better story that keeps you guessing and the two brothers actually love each other so the eventual unlocking of the mystery makes you cry for them both. Even though Psychometric didn't handle the end with the brothers to my liking at least you see them struggling with their demons and loving each other. Psychometric despite it's faults actually has some good writing.

This is why I find Devil Judge so amazing because its not just solid direction but a fantastic script that has nuance.


That's what Sam and Dean do, you get so emotionally invested. The Lost Tomb has enough Bromance that becomes your favorite even if one person is a abusive.

The thing is either make it Stockholm syndrome or do something that makes them being brothers have a point - But there was nothing in this story. They could have been strangers and nothing would change.

The script was so basic. Another problem because just trying to look edgy is fine if you have solid writing. This one aaah it's all just a bunch of random, convenient stuff happening. Case in point - once Vincenzo was saved by .. wait for it ... A BUNCH OF FREAKING BIRDS. that's how random and convenient the stuff that happened was bro xd

But nothing disappointed me more than that brothers story because they didn't act like siblings and for 20 eps there was barely any explanation for them, barely a past established, you had no idea why either of them was behaving the way they did.

So honest I didn't hate or dislike the characters as much as I found them nothing special. Because like so much convenient stuff was going on, like a guy as RUTHLESS AND CUNNING as Taecyeon and all the prosecutors and officials, just how did they SO EASILY get duped AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN by taking place of their security detail and doing Carrie style blood throwing on the villain - Taecyeon lol


Seriously it started to get hilarious XD

But despite that Taecyeon every time he was on screen I was basically swooooning a hot badass villain ffs for this and for giving me a new ship I'll be grateful ;)

Ohh and also Kim Yeo Jin her character had depth mostly because of how she played it, Choi Myung hee being so loyal to Taecyeon right down to the end made me feel a little better at least, especially when he was dancing with her that was just so WHOLESOME

Song Joongki was Fine. Jeon Yeo Been was fine. Kwak Dong Yeon was fine, Jo Han Chul played a character I've seen him play several times so it was just fine too. But like I said apart from the first episode, the 'clever' ideas just became too strange and unrealistic. The torture scene in the finale was the most disappointing! Taecyeon supposedly had no humanity and so his attitude with his brother would make sense, he's killed people for less, but then CLEARLY forms a motherly bond with Choi Myung hee and stays loyal and faithful, those things are the exact opposite of each other. But like I said the script is so basic, there's no research, nothing. That's why that last torture scene doesn't make sense either because Taecyeon showed no emotions other than excitement and malice even when Vincenzo was holding a gun to his head, meaning his emotions must be off right, but then in the end he was all crying and begging HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. If instead of Googling a listicle with cool European ancient torture techniques (we've all done it lol) they should have worried about keeping the character of AT LEAST the main villain consistent like the first season of Voice with Kim Jaewook and Janghyuk, it would have been a much more promising story.

But okay, credit where its due - that finale scene where Song Joongki leaves Taecyeon to rot like I said the execution of the torture could have been done better but the scene where the crow comes to sit on Taecyeon and there's a sun flare - that got to me.

But you can't really make an impact with a scene like this if people are just going to go back to acting like they're in a Mafia rom com.

The action isn't bad either, its entertaining like I said just don't expect much and some bits get draggy and repetitive.

One of the Worst KDramas in history! Period!
I don't even understand where to start with! I honestly, on a very serious note, beg you to not get swayed away by these high ratings on MDL. After all these 26 hours of utter headache, I can very rightly say that all these are either paid or written by crazy, illogical, shallow Song-Joong Ki fangirls. And the entire show just seems to be a total SJK fan-service, and nothing else!

There are several reasons as why to this show piqued my frustrations levels, so let's get to the point with what went wrong with the drama.

WHAT WENT WRONG?

1) STORY/SCRIPTWRITING:
What the heck was with the story??? It merely felt like the show was written by a mere 16-17 year kid expecting the audience to get apalled by lame comedy, which can't even be called BLACK, just dumb lame. The ML just sitting blindly staring at his TV predicts every move of the villain from GOD knows what kind of premonitions. One skinny ken doll crippling an entire mob of gangsters? A middle aged guy stabbing thugs with scissors? The villain killing off all sorts of guys without even bringing a trace of doubt to the public? An international security service police fan-boying a Mafia? Lol even kids can write a better story than this! And don't even get me started on INZAGI!!! Like wtf!! Am I sitting here watching a cartoon in the name of black comedy? The entire point of Vincenzo coming to Korea to come and retrieve his Gold and ends up keeping it back in Korea as a bed for his lover? The main villain can kill off every damn person involved in his heinous deeds, but failed to harm an ant from the Geumgo Plaza? My goodness, it felt like I'm watching some illogical bollywood movie just earning in the name of a Hero!

2) ACTING:
The FL (X_X), I would've been really happy if she was the one killed off first instead of her father! Like honestly, how can you even look at yourself in the mirror after all those indigestible doses of overacting! Like you can call yourself a righteous competitive lawyer and can't even fight a single case with sincerity? All the slapstick comedies from the supporting actors were way too overdone and lame, I couldn't even bring myself to a chuckle, they were all plain annoying! The writer seemed to shock the public with innumerable deaths like some sort of a GOT genre, but failed to bring out even an ounce of emotional attachment for the deceased for such bad character developments! It was majorly Taecyon's and the Female villain's acting that desperately tried to save the show from churning to pieces, but in vain!

3) EXCESSIVE GLORIFICATION OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE:
If some people might be thinking that the core concept of the show was this, let me correct you, it is not. The main character was just an egoistic self righteous dickhead who just wanted to procure his belongings, but got stumbled upon nonetheless. Vigilant justice should be never be, at least in my opinion, ever be justified. There are layers and layers behind any sort of criminal case with loads of loopholes and connected people and it should always be dealt with sensitively with a lot of afterthought. Unlike here, where the law was turned into an entire state of mockery.

4) EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF QUEERBAITING/ HOMOPHOBIA:
The number of times the show portrayed really unnecessary uncomfortable queer-baiting scenes, with the ML being a total homophobe. Even the gay character was portrayed in such a cliché manner with such terrible portrayal of lgbt characters, as if South Korea doesn't have it's fair share of innate homophobia!

5) NO RESPECT FOR RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS:
There wasn't any direct attack on anyone's religious sentiments, but it wasn't even shown in a good light, but was instead portrayed as a mere comedic tool!

WHAT WORKED???
Well, I really tried to find it but couldn't! :( No hate here but there wasn't a single likeable element in the entire show that I felt so far. It was a total waste of my time!

I usually have really high expectations out of any KDrama, cause they have never actually ever let me down, at least not to this extent that this drama did, solely the reason that I pulled myself together to finish this hoping something might pull the strings! But Alas! If would've been my 2nd or 3rd Kdrama I would've totally stopped watching KDramas altogether XD! It is really disturbing to see to what extent people can go just to support and promote their favourite actor/idol, even if they make utter shit! Luckily I've chose my dramas list carefully and trusted my instincts! :P

Reasons why this show disappointed me in a way:
The first episode of the show was confusing because there were too many characters mentioned and you can't tell instantly what the plot is. Later on, as the episodes progressed, it created a big impact on me. I thought that this show was worth looking forward to because of how Vincenzo executes all of his plans. Adding to the fact that the main villain hasn't been revealed yet, the suspense really stayed in me. The people in Geumga plaza had too much screen time and their humor is really not up to my liking. Each episode should not be 1 hour and 20 minutes long, they kept adding scenes to the people in the plaza which really did not contribute much to the plot.When the main villain was revealed, I really had this expectation that he would act for himself. But that only happened in episode 20. He kept clinging to Wusang, he makes them do the dirty work for him and what's even funnier is that he kept sending bad men to pursue Vincenzo and all of them were easily beaten because it took them a while to fire their gun or attack him instantly? There were a lot of plot armor which do not seem realistic. He was also overly praised for being a consigliere. They created this suspense at the beginning and it vanished when they started adding some random scenes from side characters. Vincenzo also admitted that he could have taken down Hanseok at the beginning but didn't because he wanted to prolong their struggle.I'm giving it a score of 6.5 because Song Joong Ki and Jeon Yeobeen are great actors and their chemistry is great. The plot is so-so.

some good moments with so many problems
This is the first time I'm writing a review so I'm gonna keep it simple

Likes
- song joongki
- choi myunghee death scene (the filmography was absolutely gorgeous)
- symbolism in the show is used beautifully
- some of the twists are really good ideas (idk about the execution of them)
- concept
- kwak dongyeon's character was one of the only put together characters in the show
- same for kim yeojin

Negatives
- Taecyeon's acting genuinely got me riled up, maybe it's just not for me. The switches between English and Korean are jarring and he overreacts, I couldn't take him seriously at all.
- Cutting of the scenes? I feel like so much of the show is happening behind the screen, none of the actual action, the plotting is shown and when I want to see more in one scene, we jump to another scene in another setting. It's hard to feel any connection to this show.
- Heros are supposed to have highs and lows - the lows never really came for Vincenzo so it was hard to once again feel connected to his character. Yes, he's a mastermind but everything just came with no explanation
- I feel like I didn't know anything about hong cha young's character other than the fact that she was Vincenzo's love interest and just went along with everything he did
- the comedy tag on the show is super misleading, nothing is funny about this show and they used it so they can just stuff random nonsense into the plot which can be entertaining but not funny
- I really wish the writers fully fleshed out the characters because the main concept behind both Vincenzo and Hong Chayoung as well, is that they're anti-heroes and so much can be done with that but they make dumb decisions.
- randomly including the police in the last episode when all the characters have faced little to no legal reprecussions in the previous episodes
- there's so much more I could say but I forgot so

To conclude, I truly believe that this could've been a well-plotted out show with more (40 maybe?) episodes but the writers/directors would just stuff in random uncorrelated twists in the show.

Exited the hype bus but it was an alright ride
If you are on the algorithm for KDrama watchers on social media, you’ve probably already heard of Vincenzo and chances are you don’t really need another review telling you whether or not to watch this. You’ve already heard all the hot takes from the hype train to the “unpopular opinion but…” This drama got incredible attention during its weekly releases and for good reason. The first half of this show is nothing short of an edge-of-your-seat experience. On the other hand, viewers who don’t take well to this drama are not unjustified, and my guess is that this drama is not going to age very well. If, by some slim chance you’re actually reading this review while on the fence, then know that this show is more like The Sopranos meets Law and Order meets KDrama than some of the other comparisons I’ve seen. It’s good, but I’d question your taste if this made it into your all time favorites list.

The good: music and production
The OST of this drama is great. Every song hits hard when it needs to. KDrama OSTs are usually very long, but 67 tracks? That’s why nothing ever gets old- there was some real thought that went into having a song for every moment. Solar’s performance on Adrenaline is great- she’s got amazing control of her voice. The production was great too, but I would also say that it’s about what you’d expect for an $18 million KDrama in 2021, there’s nothing that’s novel.

The just alright: story and acting
The story progression of this drama is mostly this: a threat upon Vincenzo is made at the beginning of the episode and either by the end or halfway through the next, it is revealed that Vincenzo knew all along of what was coming and had a plan. Vincenzo always wins and the stakes get higher for the next threat. It’s not objectively a bad formula and this show does it very well at the beginning. Even though you know that Vincenzo will win, you still want to know how. Getting there is plenty rewarding at the beginning, and this show is not entirely without consequences, but by the end this formula gets tiring because it's less rewarding as time goes on, less and less character development happens, and Vincenzo fully reverts to being a cruel mafia member by the end. The world building is outrageous but not out of the ordinary for the genre. I never really fault KDramas for not being “believable” but if that’s not your thing, then you should skip this one.

The acting is just okay. Song Joong-Ki was good, but didn’t show a ton of range. The romance scenes never quite hit the way they were supposed to. Honestly the chemistry the two leads had as business partners was way more satisfying than as lovers.


The terrible: rewatch value
I think you know where this is going: the glorification of vigilante justice. There’s absolutely no sugar coating it because it’s so bad, and it just gets worse and worse. The way to beat the bad guys at first was to outsmart them, but this show gets progressively more violent as it goes on, and by episode 20 the writers are working overtime to convince you that the heinous acts being shown to you are okay because Vincenzo is doing them, he knows best so this must be the only solution.

Another crime was what was unexplored or undeveloped, like the flashbacks that Vincenzo kept getting at the beginning of his mafia days, or Vincenzo’s adoption story. This could have been such a good story. “Adopted Korean grows up in an Italian mafia as a consigliere, ends up back in South Korea and takes on the nation’s corrupt politicians and business leaders.” When I hear that, I picture a story that tells who he was in the past, how that changes throughout the series, and who he might be afterwards, but you don’t get any of that. We’re forced to believe he’s invincible and always has been because it’s what everyone in this show keeps telling you. He goes through absolutely no character development after episode 4. Vincenzo is never confronted with the consequences of his actions and he never has to because the point of the show is to constantly tell you that he is all knowing, all powerful. I feel the worst for all the other characters because by the end, they’re all worse people. They’re greedier and more needlessly violent. Honestly, I’m convinced that the studio commissioned this story and the writers bent over backwards to “just make it work” but had no direction as to how to do it.


Overall
I’d still say that this was entertaining to watch as long as you know how to suspend your disbelief and are familiar with the genre. The ratings of this are incredible across the board, and people all over are singing the praises of this drama. I really want to drive this point home though: it’s trendy, not a classic. People will talk about it all through 2021 because it ticks a lot of boxes for people, but it’s not here to stay as a “classic.” The writers were so concerned with being edgy and trendy that they forgot to be timeless.

This review is written for those hoping this drama is something special. (Only minor spoilers)
CHARACTERS: (8/10)
Vincenzo is hyped up to be a very tactful and vicious mafia consigliere. However, his methods ended up seeming more petty and successful due to luck and not plain skill. The female lead, Hong Cha Young was perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the show. She is introduced as a not-so-honest hotshot lawyer. However, for most of the drama, she is on the sidelines letting Vincenzo make all the moves and taking credit for achievements she had no hand in. I was expecting them to be more of an unconventional power couple, but what we ended up seeing was NOT even a mafia consigliere and his damsel-in-distress (albeit there was a DID moment) but a mafia consigliere and a pretty woman that just tags along and solely exists as a love interest. The most frustrating part has to be that it's clear Cha Young had the skills to be a powerful character in the show. She is intelligent, resilient, and had all the tools to really become a woman we all would want to cheer on. It just simply did not happen.

Aside from the two main characters. I have to applaud the villains. Choi Myung Hee was absolutely despicable. She was a good villain that I thoroughly enjoyed hating. I do, however, have to take note that her motive seemed a bit lackluster. I never really figured out why she put so much into helping the main villain. The main villain, [REDACTED], was impeccable on-screen. His reveal had me gasp aloud and he truly became unhinged as the show went on. It was quite entertaining.

The side characters were very enjoyable as well. They lightened the show. I especially have to give credit to Kwak Dong Yeon. I ended up adoring his pathetic character that eventually mustered up the courage to become someone we all cheered on. I will definitely be on the lookout for his future roles.

STORY: (6/10)
The story is quite honestly boring and drags a lot. The plot was essentially about a mafia consigliere versus a greedy business owner and his lawyers. A lot of the conflict happened but to the average watcher such as myself, the business doings were quite boring and hard to follow. This is not to say, that it was accurate to the business world. In fact, even an ignorant person such as myself could tell the plot points were horribly illogical. I pretty much skipped through all those parts.

MUSIC: (8/10)
The OST was nothing memorable that I would save on a playlist but it was quite fitting and enjoyable.

REWATCH VALUE: (5/10)
The drama dragged on too long. 20 episodes that were each about 1.5 hours long. This drama could've easily ended at 16 episodes, but it kept getting sidetracked with unnecessary side plots with so many characters that I couldn't even keep track of after a certain point. I don't think it has much rewatch value. However, it is a good show to use to fulfill a craving for a dark comedy involving a hot anti-hero.

OVERALL: (7/10)
If you're looking for an action-packed drama with morally ambiguous protagonists and a generous handful of humor, this drama will not disappoint. However, many aspects of this drama fell short of the set up in the first episode. I would recommend this show to any SJK fan or someone looking for a slightly above-average dark comedy with a pinch of romance.

Good potential marred by poor scripting and character development
WARNING: This review does contain a fair amount of spoilers, and is meant for people who have watched the drama and are here to commiserate.

First off, Vincenzo is not a bad drama. It is well produced, entertaining and the cast is sufficiently charismatic enough to make one feel invested. But it always feels like you’re waiting for that Great Plot Moment to happen, rather than actually getting said Great Plot Moment.

Make no mistake, this is not for lack of trying on the scriptwriter’s part. In fact, often it feels as though the drama is trying to serve up an entire buffet of iconic screen moments - a la romantic sit ups from Secret Garden that people will reference for years to come - rather than to tell an actual story. The basic bones of the plot has the potential to go quite deep, and being constantly offered this sort of shallow entertainment instead of something more substantial left the bad taste of dissatisfaction after every episode.

To begin with, we had an infallible hero pitted against a one-dimensional villain.

Vincenzo is a Mary-Sue. His plans never fail. He knows everyone who is anyone. Everybody loves him (except of course, the baddies). He always manages to light his iconic lighter on the first attempt. He also gets hit by a truck and makes a complete recovery, without so much as needing physiotherapy or even recovery time after waking up. He escapes an entire intelligence organisation (make that two intelligence organisations) continuously throughout the show, AND to top if off, he kills off side characters in the same offhand way as the villains but never ever faces any kind of consequence for it. Clearly, god's favour - that being the scriptwriter - rests on him.

On the other hand, poor Tacyeon received no such blessings. Jang Joon Woo is portrayed as an absolute villain. He is violent, self-serving and psychotic. He has no redeeming qualities, no deep motivations for his actions, no sad backstory to humanise him. He is simply there to be the villain. Even his cute puppy love for Hong Cha Young is ephemeral, serving no plot purpose except possibly comedy and 2PM fan service. It appears that Chaka-nim did not love him enough to make him an actual person. Chaka-nim used him simply to drive the plot forward and give the audience a 100% pure unadulterated evil character to hate.

Next, the themes of the drama were not properly developed.

With the hero and the villain being such polar opposites, there is no meaningful way to explore the theme of good and evil — a theme one would fully expect from a show such as this. Both Vincenzo and Jang Joon Woo are bad guys, so what makes us root for one over the other? What, exactly, is good and what is evil? These are the thoughts that the drama should have provoked in the audience. More deliberate side-by-side lining up of these two characters, muddying up the lines between them would have made for a more compelling story. Yes the drama does frequently drop reminders that Vincenzo is no angel, but still expects us to love and adore him all the same, as shown by the ensemble cast.

Similarly, so much more could have been done with Hong Cha Young. Her motivations and character development in the drama are vague, to say the least. She has no clear growth arc. She initially appears motivated by revenge, but her father’s death is quickly forgotten once it has served its purpose of bringing her and Vincenzo together. Does she change as the story progresses? Does she become more like those she is trying to destroy? Does she grow into fully inheriting her father’s legacy as the “Last Straw”? We don’t know because, like Jang Joon Woo, she is there merely to serve the plot and the romance. It is such a waste because she is perfectly positioned to explore how a person might become evil, sort of like a possible origin story suggesting how the male leads might have ended up being who they are. She would also have been a much more suitable adversary to Choi Myung Hee, driven as she is by personal revenge, as well as possibly being the younger version of Choi Myung Hee had the drama made use of that potential direction. Which, as with so many other opportunities, it didn’t.

Finally, a note about the drama’s presentation of violence.

Watching Vincenzo, I felt uncomfortable with the way the drama handled violence and gangsterism. It was not Jang Joon Woo’s rampage scenes that bothered me, even though those were graphic. Those were clearly portrayed as wrong and undesirable. It was the way the drama permitted its heroic couple to casually kill off side characters with no reprimand or consequence. Vincenzo and Hong Cha Young engage in their own share of violence, either directly or indirectly, killing off those they wish to seek vengeance on, who are in their way, or who have outlived their usefulness, but their position as heroes is never once questioned. They continue to enjoy the adulation of all the ‘good people’ in the drama and, by extension, that of the audience too. I understand that this is a show about pitting a lesser evil against a greater evil, and the writers wanted to highlight the morally ambiguous aspect of Vincenzo, but they definitely have double standards for Vincenzo and Jang Joon Woo’s equally criminal, and equally selfishly motivated acts, presenting Jang Joon Woo’s crimes as abominable while excusing Vincenzo’s deeds. This, more so than the actual violence itself, makes me feel that the drama fully deserves its M18 rating on Netflix.

Great cinematography....  but fell short of everything else
From the show page, I've  checked that Vincenzo currently has 159 user reviews and mine would be a review number 160. Why would I want to add another one on top of many ? Because I am hardworking like that and I like to spend my free time doing useless thingy like this. Also I have made a vow to do 1 review per year ,this might be it. So this is an unpopular opinion. My review will be brief and  in point form..

1) Cinematography and visual : Considering this was a high budget show *like TKEM* great visual is a must have . The show never disappoint in that department in fact Vincenzo excel with flying colours.

2) OST : I only like one song which is Adrenaline (Italian version) by Aalia which I wish we could hear it more in later episodes.

3) Acting of other than the main villain : The actors did the best with the materials they were given. Song Joong Ki looked dashing as usual ( like him in Innocent Man) Haa! Jeon Yeo Bin caught my eyes in this. She was stunning and I liked the point of her look, her lipstick. First time seeing her acting here and she was good.

4) Acting of the main villain : The reason I separated this with the others because I want to emphasize my view. I have issues with his acting. It was over the top like they want to make his character a caricature especially in the first 8 episodes. It was cringey like a cheesy pickup line and I hate this type of character :((( I could not take him seriously even when he did serious matter. Thanks god, this caricature acting was toned down in later episodes.

5) Storyline :  Nothing spectacular. Been there done that in countless drama I have seen.But I liked the idea behind the story. '' Solo il male può sconfiggere il male ''. Only evil can defeat evil. It was refreshing to see the evil got their commensurate punishments as it should be. While I low key think the punishment were a bit too much although the villains kinda deserved it ----< this is the angel in me writing.

6) Humor : I was indifferent to it. I found it to be lame and pretentious. Most of the time , it gave me a second-hand embarassment.

7) Just a thing worth to mention. I never know that I could get tired of the word mafia (read in korean slang) until I watch this show. It was like hearing Love is the moment song all over again.Could everyone please just stop.........

That's all. Thank you for reading.

Could have been better, but I am in for the BGM
The first 2 episodes can hook you up, however it did not make use the mafia properly, there are mafia story moments however due to culture differences story became the same political story from a person trying to get revenge but the villain has some connections with authorities, another thing is the editing.

The only thing that saved the series is the BGM, the male lead, and the supporting role,

For the story, the writer and the director could have used this opportunity to introduce a different story,
the series is good, but it is not rewatchable I gave it an overall score of 6. It could have been better.

Mixing genres did not work for this drama.
This could have been so much better if they didn't try so hard to be funny.

The comedy elements of the show don't work 80% of the time. I think this show would have been much better if they just focused on the serious elements. I found myself about halfway through skipping through the 'funny' parts. I just wanted to get to the action and the scenes that drove the story forward because these were so well done. Chang-young is not funny at all. Like not at all. Not even a little bit. The jokey torture scenes by the tenants don't work, the funny intelligence agent obsessed with Vincenzo doesn't work because it makes him come off as incompetent. And whenever they went for a blockbuster finish with slow motion and over-the-top music it came off as way too cheesy.

My favorite scene is the first time Myung hee gets threatened in the laundromat it's so real and so effective. Great directing, acting, and great momentum is built. Whenever they switched to the jokes they lost momentum built in these serious powerful scenes so I would be at the edge of my seat one moment and rolling my eyes hitting fast forward the next which made for unbalanced viewing. This drama had such high potential but it was ruined by an attempt to also be a comedy, it should have just been a drama about the gangster life of different members of society.

Song Joong-ki/ Vincenzo is the only reason I watched until the end. He is the only lead whose acting feels natural but he is backed into a corner by the terrible writing and story progression. Han Seo and Seung-hyuk were the only other believable characters in this mess.

lowkey dissapointed in how the writing turned out as the story progressed
lowkey dissapointed in how the writing turned out as the story progressed. I loved the beginning episodes and the writing kept the suspense up. it made me want to analyse vincenzo as a character and i wrote lots of comments here about his past and his motives, whether he believes he's a good person or not. but as the story progressed, everything i was curious about as a viewer was never addressed or weirdly brushed over. The characters stopped feeling ""real"" and became too comic-like, the ""revenge"" parts became really slow and lacked buildup or weren't timed in a dramatic way in the episodes. i also started questioning chayoungs character who's personality was written more and more sporadically in every episode. There were so many loose ends that were never tied up (and the funny thing is those loose ends were what everyone was interested in) Take the whole cassano family feud. everyone was so interested in seeing vin fight his brother or have the italian mafia come after him... that's what the story set up in the begining... but then all we got was this enslaught of korean politicians, businessmen, lawyers, that we knew nothing about and that were introduced to the story late. Another plotpoint. Vin's past. What actually happened back then. what are those flashbacks. him working out how he feels about himself. getting closure. why did none of this happen? Alot of the characters irritated me and it's because they were too comical but not in a good way and were just so unrealistic for a ""serious"" show (even tho i am aware vincenzo is more like a parody than a dead serious mafia drama) but i will say my props to the lame gangsters running the balloon store. they were the only funny people in the plaza: the whimpy gangster boss and his goth chick accountant were hilarious. Then shout out to taecyeon for our main villian. The way he acts with his eyes made me genuinely think he was having fun torture people. And his brother, what an interesting character and storyline. he was the most thought-out character in the show and WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT, he's also everyone's favourite..... just look at what good character writing does, it's no coincedence he's a crowd fav. Of course i think vincenzo was played very charismatically and he really is the most charming in a suit.

Slap stick and lame story line
The acting of the ML and FL are just so lame and bad acting. The skinny ML tries to act macho and intelligent which is not convincing at all. Tried to be asian James Bond, but not convicincing at all. The FL is just a annoying character and wish she should be killed right from the start. Cant imagine they are coming back with season 2...what a total waste of people's time .

The whole drama is a total flop and messy. Dont understand why people like this kind of bloody and no story line drama. Highly over rated and it is not appropriate to get such rating....I seriously cant understand why people like this drama.

A mafia guy who killed lots of people and could never face problems, like some super man. We are trying to make such a rotten character a hero? Every episode that I watched, I totally felt so pissed and wasted my time. I continued watching is to assess what is the big deal about this drama. There is total no story line...lame and silly !!!

Hard to watch
As much as this drama is filled w/ A list cast and A list supporting cast but the script itself its hard to like. The story started off intense with badass ML that even Italian Mafia can't mess with. Song Joong Ki's baby face wasn't exactly believable for the role but I still enjoy his acting. So as flames go up in ep 1 I am thinking K2 kind of drama coming up, hopefully he'll stop trying to speak Italian and just go into more action! Then came the over the top characters trying too hard to be funny. Most are just filler side characters that failed to be humorous at all. Maybe some people do enjoy this but the frequent switching back and forth between cool Vincenzo & idiotic forced humor really threw the whole drama off for me.

I love all the actors so I made myself watch through the drama however it was a struggle to be engaged in the drama. If they just stick to the story as an action drama instead of the absurd comedy nonsense it would've been a hit. My favorite part of the story is Jang Han Seo's character and the relationship developed between him & Vincenzo. Story deserves a redo!

Extremely overhyped
I was ready to drop this drama at ep 9 but the only reason why I finished it is because I wanted to know the reason why it was so hyped up. Even after finishing the drama, I do not understand the hype. The story is not as great as people are making it out to be. It is literally like a typical romcom with action and the only unique thing about this drama are its villains. There are numerous occasions where overacting is done by the people from Geumga plaza and other actors as well. Taecyeon and the actress who played Myunghee acted very well though so I'll give them that. Joongki's acting was good but there's many other actors who could've done a better job portraying Vincenzo and I also expected Joongki's acting to be way better than it actually was. Yes, that's an unpopular opinion but it's the truth. I personally think that Ji Changwook, Kim Soohyun, or Park Seojoon would've done a way better job playing the role of Vincenzo because it would suit them more. Joongki looked too innocent to seem like a mafia member. I could not take this drama seriously because the writers failed very miserably at mixing the comedy and dark theme of the drama. There were many good jokes in this drama but a good amount of the jokes weren't even funny and many comedy scenes seemed unnecessary. The fact that everyone claims that this drama is perfect is very funny to me because I can list multiple plot holes and dumb plot mistakes, which everyone seems to have just ignored simply because they were too focused on the eye candy that this show provided them with. I really wanted to like this drama and I was extremely excited to watch it but it was a big let down. Another thing I disliked was that, although the character is unique, Hanseok's character did not have depth at all. The writers simply labeled him as a ""psychopath"" and never bothered to give his character more depth. I wanted to know more about the character because he was an interesting character but they didn't do justice to him. Also, Hanseo didn't get justice because he didn't receive a funeral and no one seemed to care much about him after his death. Vincenzo was more worried about Chayoung the entire time and they literally just let Hanseo sacrifice himself without helping him in any way whatsoever. How big of a dumbass does Vincenzo have to be to show up to meet Hanseok without anything to defend himself with? Like he was very well aware of the fact that Hanseok wouldn't hesitate killing someone so he should've thought of something but NOPEEEEE.

At many occasions the story gets repetitive because it's just ""oh ok the villains set a trap which Vincenzo is going escape from within two seconds"". The episode endings didn't excite me because no matter what trap the villains set for Vincenzo he was out of it within minutes so thats just a way to waste time and mislead people. Also, if Vincenzo is sooooooo smart then why didn't he just set up a hearing device in Wusang because that definitely would've allowed him to figure out Hanseok's identity way earlier. Don't give excuses like ""it's not that easy setting up a device in the law firm cuz there's security"" because that man and woman from Geumga literally went into the Wusang CEO's office and wrote the letter C using pigs blood. I can go on and on about stuff like that but I would rather not waste my energy. The episodes should have been shorter and the show should've been 16 episodes long rather than 20. One last note, this show romanticized the mafia way too much.

This drama is average in all aspects. I wonder how much everyone would have loved this drama if the cast wasn't good looking.

This is so disappointing
I am a fan of Song Joong Ki and had really high hopes for this. The only thing that made me suspicious was the Comedy tag and Crime tag combined. I have seen amazing Italian Tv shows about the mafia and they are never funny because there isn't anything funny about it. Anyways I decided to give a chance to this. The start was promising. Song was playing his part very well and showed good Italian speaking ( even though he was speaking slowly to focus on pronunciation) I really liked how he handled the foreign language. Could not expect anything less from him :) Now let's focus on the part he went back to Korea and bammm the crime and dark scenario is ruined by some morons in a building and annoying FL. What was this all about? Grown-up people act as primary school students and that FL...no words to describe how I seriously hoped the scenario will get better and see something worthy ( apart from the amazing Song Joong Ki) in this drama. Unfortunately, it is that bad and I don't see any hope for this. I Dropped the drama and let's hope Song will act in a better project next time!

Ok here I am again with a second review for the drama- while I dropped the drama at ep 4 I decided to come back and watch another 3 episodes and since I noticed something positive in the drama i have to point it out to be fair in my judgment. First of all, I am going to start with the negative:
-- This drama is really bad. The court scenes are preposterous and not realistic at all
-- The FL again - horrible as ever
-- The plot is very predictable so far
Now the positive:
-- SOng Ki is great in his role but the one that shines more than him is the villain. I have not seen this actor before but he is great at portraying such psychopaths. His role is more difficult than the one of Vincenzo and he is truly giving us a great performance. I decided to watch the drama to the end ( mainly his scenes) because he is so good and his character is also very interesting. So far ep 7 was the most interesting and I hope they give more screen time to the villain. There is so much we don't know about him. Somehow i have a strange feeling that he has some kind of fondness for the FL. What are your thoughts about it?

PS: I forgot to mention that the villain has very good English pronunciation. Love his English phrases :P

Edit: I stay behind my words but I have to mention that since I watched the whole drama after all ( apart from the major problems of the Mafia representation) I have to give some positive feedback about the final 2 episodes because I think they were simply the best. I have to post the quote from the magnificent ending ( and yes, I did like the final episode and how was executed) and I definitely liked Vincenzo final words in the drama:
“Two days ago, I used three Luciano family members as manure for the vineyard and took over the olive plantations in Malta. I’m still a villain and couldn’t care less about justice. Justice is weak and empty. One cannot win against any villains with justice alone. If merciless justice exists, I am willing to yield to it. Even villains long to live in a peaceful world. However, since that’s impossible, I’ve taken up a new hobby. Getting rid of garbage. If I don’t do that, people will die buried underneath the garbage.

There’s one last thing I’d like to say from a villain’s perspective. Evil is prevalent and vehement”.

After a long time I watched a drama while it was airing! Vincenzo is a slow paced drama don't expect a lot of fighting scenes back to back. It's a mix of comedic element too.

The idea of the story was actually good. A mafia lawyer who come to Korea to take out the hidden gold but it ended up just like all other K-dramas talking about the corruption of the system. The creative ideas writer came up with each episode and those TOP TIER CLIFFHANGERS *Chef's kiss*. It is actually a unpredictable drama but but but Vincenzo was portrayed as so smart guy that he can't be beaten by anyone which I have never seen a drama where hero wins most of the time and this made the villain cheap indeed. And also made the drama way too boring *SIGH*

Song Joong ki did quite well in this. He got a lot better in Vincenzo I actually didn't like his acting much in DOTS but there were some scenes were I didn't actually felt his emotions .

Jang Han Seok the ""SUPPOSED VILLAIN"" was too relied on others that I never actually got to see his own potential. The female prosecutor is much more like a "" ACTUAL VILLAIN"".

The FL was annoying and her acting felt exaggerated a bit in the first 2 episodes a lot but later she got better too but yaa she definitely loud like that through out. She isn't a own strong independent FL but she listens to ML's plan and works according.

I didn't feel much bond between the tenants. The tenants were also selfish but they have a good character development in later episodes. And the BEST BOY Han Seo (Kwak Dong Yeon) That guy has so much potential but sadly he was just playing a support role :( After this drama he better get ML role.

The writer honestly wasted the potential of many characters(specifically villains) in the drama. The writer really did injustice to villains in this drama, they all were underestimated by writer.

The music is top notch to be honest. It really matches the vibe of the scene. It's catchy I really liked the music of this drama.

If you are looking for romance in this drama there isn't any actually much. The way they look at each other and them flirting AHH. You'll ship them so hard seeing those small things they do for each other. They developed a friendship while achieving there goals. It's actually a question if they had romantic feelings for each other. ROMANCE AIN'T THE MAIN FOCUS.

The duration of the drama was the biggest flaw here. This drama would have been good. If it was 20 Episodes with 1 hours duration or 16 Episodes with 1. 25 hours duration. Because a lot of scenes were filler indeed ( Mostly in Ep 18 & 19). But despite of those flaws it was a good watch for me!

If one day I suffer from amnesia I will watch this LOL just kidding. There were some moments and scenes definitely worth re watching .

Throw away the logic, let the pigeons in.
It was refreshing to see how they truly did not give a damn about realism and logic to such a ridiculous extent, but because of that, this drama had no business having 20 episodes, each 1 hour and 20 minutes long.

Realistically speaking, the whole plot would perfectly fit into a 2 hour movie. Instead, we’ve got around 28 hours of Vincenzo being cool finding a way to fight Babel, said “way” getting killed, Vincezno finding another way to fight Babel, that then gets killed… you get the idea. Strangely, even with this painful repetitiveness, I was not exactly bored for most of the watch time. True, I did watch the whole drama at 1.25x speed, but I enjoyed the experience quite a lot.

Surprisingly brutal, a few times reminding me more of a Saw movie, and not a k-drama comedy about a mafia. Not sure how, but this vicious take mixed well with the dumb jokes and plot points. The only time I felt like the show failed at mixing different moods was the way they handled Cha Young’s motivation to join the fight - that bit made me feel slightly uncomfortable and was not the best start to the series.

Song Joong Ki as Vincenzo Cassano was the selling point of the show, and for me, the performance was so strong, I did not even need more from the drama to keep watching. He is just really fine, and when he goes into full boss mode, I could not care less about the plot. Sometimes, this is all I need to keep me entertained.

Then we have Hong Cha Young played by Jeon Yeo Been. Love the actress, struggled with the character, especially in the first half. Her comedic vibe has been just too strong for me to like. Slowly she became less cartoonish, and more like a relatable human being - that’s when I started to appreciate her more.

I am truly not the biggest fan of Ok Taec Yeon as an actor. Has been a fan of his since his debut in 2PM, he is born to be an entertainer, but I was not even once convinced by his acting. Yet, I loved him as Jang Jun Woo. Don’t know if it’s just one lucky role for him, or he is starting to feel more comfortable in his acting, but I bought him as Jun Woo completely.

Some side characters and performances that caught my attention were: Kwak Dong Yeon as Jang Han Seo, Choi Deok Moon as Tak Hong Shik, Kim Yoon Hye as Seo Mi Ri and Im Chul Soo as Ahn Ki Seok. Not to forget Kim Sung Cheol for whom I have quite a soft spot.

I could feel all the money spent on the production leaking through my screen. Top notch might be an understatement. When you know the production team did not shy from spending money? When the soundtrack has 67 tracks - all of extremely high quality.

Still, the writing was just… empty? It serves amazing entertainment, and that’s it. There was no depth, no emotional attachment, no well developed plot. I’m still trying to figure out how the decision to make it into such a long drama was made. I can imagine the writer, director and the production team sitting in the bar, after quite a few bottles, brainstorming with ideas of a similar quality to “but imagine this: lizard people were behind it all along”. Some plot points were so outside of the box I was truly impressed with the creativity.

Overall, perfect brainless drama for some fun, light watch. Watching this as my neurons were being fried by Covid was a perfect choice and I don’t think any other drama could accompany me through that hell as well as Vincenzo did.

OVERRATED!
This drama was really popular with its ratings and this encouraged me to start watching this drama. I was also a Song joong ki fan from descendants of the sun. However this drama failed to impress me. There are a number of flaws but the main one for me was that it didn't need 20 episodes. The story didn't necessarily drag however a major portion of this drama was the main leads come up with a plan to take down the villain however the villain outsmarts and they come back to zero. I don't think it was until episode 17 they started to really take down the villain. This wouldn't have worked for a crime drama when they are investigating something but to be honest the main leads only had one goal to take down babel.

Also the story of an Korean-origin Italian mafia coming to take gold and fighting justice was great however their attempt to add humour failed miserably. The humour seemed forced most of the time and awkward. The people who stayed at the building also seemed unrealistic as they were all normal people but could take down professional fighters because they all had fighting backgrounds.

Acting wise, I liked Song joong ki's acting. He portrayed the role of an Italian mafia member with a soft side hidden perfectly. The female lead's acting was great but it seemed a little extra at times, I don't know if her character was supposed to be like that but if they were intending to add humour then it just came across as awkward. The rest of the cast were all great at playing their roles.

I don't remember any of the OSTs played so they were either not memorable or I didn't pay attention to them. The romance between the main leads was kept at a bare minimum for those who want to watch this for their chemistry, just a warning beforehand, we don't have a confession scene. After a certain point in the drama we assume that the main leads have progressed from friends to a couple. They are never straightforward until the very end.

Overall, this is an average drama to watch, don't watch this with false expectations.

If I could give it a 0 star rating I would!
The worst drama I have ever watched. Everything about it is just bad. The lead actress is really annoying and the villain felt like trying too hard. The lead actor is far from badass. If any Italian mafia saw this drama they would commit suicide. The comedy is so bad I felt like gauging my eyes out. The genre mixing just made it worse. One scene being a thriller and the next scene being a comedy doesn't make it a Dark Comedy. Dark comdey is a completely different genre. I don't know how in the world does this have a 9.0 ratings. That's just disrespect to other dramas. I specifically opened this account to give it a 1 star ratings. I can't even express in words how bad this drama was. This drama gave me such a bad experience that I have decided not to watch any dramas with these actors in the lead.

Started really good, but disappointing final quarter and a one dimensional male lead
I literally created this account just to put my thoughts about this drama, because it is really frustrating. First, imma start with good things about this drama(first half and third quarter)and what disappoints me about it. One are the villains, the villains of this drama are really unpredictable and intimidating, but as the story progress and reaches the final quarter, they become p**sier towards the male lead, especially Jun Woo. I really liked Jun Woo from first half of the story, he is so intimidating, but on the final quarter they made him so terrified towards the male lead and if you compare that to where his character started, he became really off character, I expected him to become Vincenzo's moral code breaker (more on that later, because that's the most disappointing part of this story). Two, the side characters and the female lead, the side characters(I'm talking about the Geumga plaza residents and that ISIA guy btw) they also started really good comedic aspects of the story. As for the female lead I really liked her, I think she is the only one who has a good character development, because at first she is really annoying and whiney(i don't hate her because of that btw) but as the story progress she became more likable. They all have a huge flaw, they all supports Vincenzo's killing, nobody even give a crap if he kills let alone they have government official on their side, and that leads to the most disappointing part of the story, Vincenzo himself. Vincenzo was a really likable guy I really loved how he was so unpredictable, but at the final quarter he became so frustrating, his character is so inconsistent, like you don't know who tf he is anymore. I really thought and expected that they will make his arc similar to Kenshin's character(Rurouni Kenshin anime), I thought they have the same premise because that made me wanna watch this drama, I expected it to be a story about an ex hitman who wants to change because murdering people is not actually what they wanted and it actually torments him by doing it, but wtf happened? Wtf is the point of Vincenzo's haunting nightmares about his past killing if he will going to kill a bunch of people at the final quarter of the story? On top of that the Geumga plaza residents and the female lead even praise him for killng, especially they literally have a f-ing high rank government official on their side and he doesn't give a damn if Vincenzo, a mafia murders people. I really really expected that Vincenzo's moral code(not killing anymore) will be the story's final conflict(and not that stupid and overused romance bs). We all know that Vincenzo is untouchable and unkillable they should've made Vincenzo's weakness is his moral code, and Jun Woo will be the one breaking it by making himself get killed by Vincenzo(like The dark knight's conflict). And also for the final note about Vincenzo's disappointing character he is one dimensional, he literally didn't change a bit, he started a murderer he ended up a murderer, he didn't clean or do anything good other than pleasing himself by killing people, and he even lied about changing after that final scene featuring that unnecessary kiss.

There's still some really good things that didn't disappoints me, but that is not enough to save this drama for me this. 5.5 out of 10 could be lower but whatever.

This rating will definitely go down
The style of this drama was refreshing and not something I'm used to or would like. It did keep me watching till the end, so it was an enjoyable watch. It definitely isn't a 9 rating for me though, many a times the events that take place are just too ""convenient"". I hate convenience plots. I'm not a fan of this style of comedy, the beginning scene had me thinking it would a really cool vibe of series but it focused much more on the comedy element. I didn't find it too funny, some of the comedy was kind of annoying and eye-rolling. I hated the villains and I loved the male lead so acting was on point. Overall, it is enjoyable and different but definitely not so high up on my favourite dramas list. I feel a lot of reviews have shared the same sentiment as me lately so I think this rating will definitely go down. If it doesn't, then these ratings aren't right.

A Writing Masterpiece that is fun to watch
From the moment this drama started I was hooked. Rarely do you find a series that will keep you glued to the screen for 20 episodes, but this one did just that. A drama, suspense, comedy and a touch of romance with superb acting. There were happy moments and extremely sad moments, but there was never a dull moment.

At times it was brutal so don’t watch it you’re squeamish over the sight of blood. A group of misfits come together as a family and stand against every evil you can think of. Don’t pick over the reality of it, don’t question the methods, just sit back and watch a writing masterpiece. It was entertaining and it was captivating so please enjoy what you are about to watch.

The acting was amazing. Song Yoong Ki did a fantastic job with his portrayal of Vincenzo Cassano a member of the Italian mafia. By the time the drama ends you will believe he is the true godfather. Jeon Yeo Bin was great as Hong Cha Young the wild and beautiful lawyer in the group. If you’ve never noticed her before you will after this drama. She was strong, beautiful and right beside Vincenzo with her constant support. On the evil side it will be hard to ever top the pair in this drama. Ok Taec Yeon just ruled as the master villain, the evil Chairman Jang Jun Woo. He changed moods, facial expressions and you never knew what he would do next. Kim Yeo Jin was brilliant in her portrayal of Choi Myung Hee the prosecutor/lawyer for the evil Chairman. I’ve seen her in so many shows but this one was a tribute to her years of acting. When I watched this drama I wasn’t sure which of the two were the most evil. All the support acting was good so there was never any empty time. The drama moves fast considering each episode is over an hour long.

Sometimes when I read other reviews I ask myself, did they watch the same drama? This drama is a masterful comedy mixed into the brutally of competing factions. It takes an amazing writer to pull this off. Watch it and let me know what you think.

Fast paced drama with great acting
I am going to start by raving about the anti-heroes. What is it about them lately!! First of all hats off to the team who has chosen them and then to the actors who have portrayed the characters. Ok Taec Yeon is amazing in his dual portrayal of the foolish apprentice and the evil CEO. His display of both personalities is amazing. One villain who is so likable and yet disliked at the same time. I want him to be with the heroine but at the same time, I want him to be tortured the way he tortures anyone who comes in his way.
His stepbrother, acted by Kwak Dong Yeon is again superb in his portrayal of the character of Jang Han Seo.

While Song Joong Ki is good, Jeon Yeo Bin as Hong Cha Young is FABULOUS. Her craziness, her laugh, her over-the-top reactions, her style, and her emotions are just unique to her. She brings her character alive with a vigor that is unmatched.

And what do I say about the residents of the mall! They are hilarious and adorable in their endeavors to help the team and in their effort to find the gold. The undercover guy from the intelligence security (Im Chul Soo as Ahn Ki Seok) is the best thing to happen to comic relief in this one. His expressions are to die for. That scene where he asks for a hug from Vincenzo is just tooooooooo funny. Such a melange of characters and each one with their unique personalities. Love it.

The plot has been brilliantly interlaced with a serious thread and apt moments of comic relief. Kudos to the writers and the director.

Finally the main character Vincenzo is unsurpassed in his acting by Song Joong Ki. He is the perfect blend of raw toughness and a kind heart. His relation with his mom progresses like his character. Tough on the outside and soft on the inside. His work ethics are very clear; that he is doing his job and he will have to get his hands dirty while doing so. When he leaves Italy to go to Korea we see a rational side of his which is what we see in the entire series actually but the foundation of his character has been written beautifully and of course portrayed brilliantly by Song Joong Ki. He is excellent in his portrayal of Vincenzo.

The background score is supreme too. It builds the right amount of suspense and I love the way the tempo changes whenever a particular scene is highlighted. I give a lot of importance to the background score, especially in thrillers. They add a lot of momentum and character to a scene.

And as a team the two leads are perfect. Their badass nature just compliments each other. Waiting to see if their chemistry culminates into something. And even if it doesn’t, there is so much going for them.

What I also like is that both the opposite sides are strong and their fight is not just one-sided.

I am just on episode 12 where the big reveal has happened and I couldn’t wait to write this review. Going to binge-watch the rest. Ciao!
( Watch this one. It’ll keep you on your toes and tickle your funny bones)

Finished watching it.....and it doesn't disappoint. Everybody will have their opinions on why someone was killed or why the end was the way it is. But if you look at it logically, it's the perfect end with the much-anticipated kiss.

JUST ONE WORD.....SUPER!!!!

A flawless K-drama that sets the bar for future black comedies
- no plot holes; even minor plot arcs are formally tied up, and you don't feel like they're forgetting anything at all. this is probably thanks to the extended 20 episode length -- they got everything that they wanted to in

- satisfying ending for all characters, again even for the minor supporting characters. everyone got their fair share of justice, and likewise their ending is satisfying and you build an emotional bond even to characters that were so minor due to the memorable writing that were perfectly played out by their actors

- brilliant acting; the ability of the main actors to turn from mischievous, to playful, to remorseful, to every single emotion in the book is second to none. i was super surprised to see that ok taecyeon play the main antagonist role (especially after watching him in save me, another great drama) -- but he exceeded my expectations and managed to make me despise his character and everything he did, even with that beautiful face!

- brilliant screenwriting -- the writers KNOW this plot is absurd, so they go full in and embrace it. this is the right way to approach these sorts of dramas; even when something happens that seems completely ridiculous, they've built the foundation of the characters so well that you think it's completely plausible they might do something despicable and or so stupid. you feel like you're apart of the family of protagonists, which is such a rare trait for dramas to have and is another testament to the screenwriter(s)' flawless storytelling.

- great use of special effects; EXPLOSIONS GO BOOM!!!

- memorable soundtrack (shoutout john park)

- memorable moments and gags (shoutout inzaghi and his pals)

literally a flawless kdrama

Overhyped at best
This is a comedy murder series where the protagonist is unkillable and ""imbalanced"".
They try hard to make the drama be series while it being a comedy, doesn't really work. Both genre's clashing just makes the whole vibe like it's a joke. The main leads have little chemistry, so thankfully there aren't many romance scenes. Only 1 side character was likeable for me. The plot of the whole series is pretty much of a conglomerate company bribing, and murdering people and getting away with it like it's nothing lmao. If you only watch dramas bc of the handsomeness of actors, this is the one for you; else, overrated.

Fun but overlong
I'll make the review short..
The majority of what is wrong with this show stems from the fact that that the show is too long for its own good. Each episode is almost 70 - 90 minutes in runtime. It being a netflix show, i dont know why they had to stretch each episode to reach this runtime. The series would have been much better if the episode count was reduced to 16 or the by reducing the episode length.
To fill the runtime there are many unnecessary jokes and setups for comedy which works sometimes but not nearly enough. Whatever emotional aspects or urgency the story tries to bring fizzles out in the end due to this..
I was on board with the romance aspect of the story, i think the charm of the characters and actors worked well and the chemistry was really good. The over the top nature of the story never bothered me (When was Korean Dramas not over the top?).
Story was not perfect dont get me wrong but still i was not bored by it but at the same time i wont be rewatching it any time soon...

unbelievable plotlines
I just can't give a high rate to this drama. the acting was great especially that of ok taec yeon, i think so far this is the best i've seen him act. non the less song joong ki's espressions were ""impeccabile"". it would have been more better if the plot wasn't as exaggerated as it was, the story was just over the top. i mean is great to see the main leads not losing all the time to the villians , but it just has little credibility like giving all the tenant special skills that were always usefull to the lead in every situation, being saved by pigeons from been killed for no reason, and the ML being able to in and out of any building on his own so freely without getting caught not even once on the cctv. but they always had proof of other people's actions.
Personally if i were to choose btw vincenzo and chief kim, i would go for chief kim. for the reasonable plotline and acting and choose vincenzo for the comedy line and goodlooking ML and taec yeon's acting. Mi dispiace.

average
it took me quite a few eps till i get really hooked to the story and wanted more of it. i think only until ep5 or so that i felt curious or cant wait to know more. it was a bit slow to me at first and the premise didnt really made me feel excited about the drama, i was only excited about how they are planning to make the drama interesting so thats why i stayed. cause it had potential ofc. and it did got better. although theres dragging and kelembapan, i still enjoyed it v much. but first of all, the plot twists. at first it was okay but then everythings predictable, hahah idk i was right everytime i guessed that there’d be a plot twist, just that i dont know what. but the plot twist ‘style’ gets repetitive. but although i did kinda expect the twist, it was still enjoyable to know the hows of it so yea. the main ML and FL didnt really stood out for me. the ML....i like him since i know from the start that he’d use dirty tricks so i liked that. but then throughout the whole case, he really uses the people around him a lot and there were a lot of coincidences that favoured him, so if it was only him.....id say he would be helpless without any of those characters. but yea i know its still part of his ways so i admit it. the FL....aaaa iknow most really enjoyed her humour and everything but i uh meh and i cant really relate with her sometimes. the villain...onthe other hand, did an amazingggggg job!! he managed to make me feel soooo annoyed hahah his performance was exceptional. the jang brothers in here are my favs, they really did an amazing job with their characters. i enjoyed them sooo much. another thing bout the storyline, it wouldve been better and more interesting if the writer/director made team villain clever too. i mean, why would the good guys always gets the upper hand? the bad guys team were so capable though. aaa idk these are just my opinion. this drama couldve been better. the ending was okayla~~ i appreciate the effort put in this drama, the cgi, cinematography and the italian and all. the ost hm i only noticed one but thats good so okayla. overall, its an okay and average one, a bit too long and draggy to my likings

watching this because of Song Joong Ki.
Why I even bother with this drama. Song Joong Ki Rise to fame again and back on the map In Hallyu Status thanks to this drama And I'm as a fan feels gratefull to this drama. . I expecting it since the writers is really good generated buzz in his 2 previous drama and Plus It's Song Joong Ki. Though I admit, I didn't expected to generated this much buzz to the point it's one of the most watched on netflix. But because of this, It might be Along wait again until he reach 40 when he pick something more substance. Gosh the struggle being a fan of him is real.

The humor is enjoyable for me. And fit with my tastes. But there is no depth when the lightheart comedy take the center of the plot. And i really confuse in the middle of this drama what it's all about? At first I think this drama is all about a gold and it's connect to the WUsang and Babel group and waiting for the climax to happen. But It's not after all??? And then I though this drama is all about revenge to Babel group, but they switch the topic again, and its about the gold, and then next, it's about Babel Group again. Like They freakin confuse, let alone me. It's so disjointed

The main character has a hint to their past so we can connect to their struggle, past story, but it's nothing, it's just a tease. They seems like invisible character which we can hardly grasp and understand, always one step ahead despite they think they are always at disavantaged, but because they have vincenzo, they almost always win or either lucky.

Funnily, the writers seems write the villain more human and like they are main character by showing their struggle, and dynamics against vincenzo. I end up rooting for them to win. But they are supposed has to take down by our anti hero after all. So who is the main villain here?

disappointed
I was actually so hyped about this drama because everyone kept talking about it. So I thought this one would be definitely something special. Oh how wrong I was...

The storyline could be actually really interesting. An lawyer who worked for the Italian mafia flees back to Korea and after some incidents he starts to work with another lawyer to win a case against a conglomerate called Babel Group. Sounds pretty good, right? However, they somehow managed to make it a little bit draggy and illogical. Starting with the most annoying thing, the reveal of the villain. I mean yeah, every villain has to be revealed, but here they just made it too soon. I was pretty shocked but after knowing who the real villain was, the whole story started to repeat itself. It was always the fight between the bad ones and the good ones. Then there was one thing I asked myself so often: Where the hell was the government? Like excuse me but it was a drama revolving around law and rights, but the only lawyers, prosecutors,... were people from the firm which was working with the Babel Group and the main leads. Even the police worked with the Babel Group and were shown very incompetent in the drama. Argh, a lot of things just didn't make any sense. Last thing which got really on my nerves was the lack of romance between the main leads. The chemistry was there, I can't deny it, but the poor writing just made the love story between them look so unrealistic. And before I forget, 20 episodes were way too long, I think only 16 would have been better. This drama is full of wasted potential. They could have do something really special out of it.

To the characters... there are a lot. It's not a Penthouse-like drama where all the characters have their own story and are interesting to the viewers because they have to do something with the main plot. No, many of the characters were unnecessary. Especially the people who lived in the plaza resident. There were to many and all of them had exaggerated and/or unrealistic characters. There were also some ""bad"" guys who wanted the plaza resident acting always really weird. It felt like they've been just there to make things funnier. Then many lawyers, policemen or prosecutors seemed like they hadn't more then three brain cells. Seriously, so many stupid characters were involved in the main plot. The only person who showed how capable he was, was the villain. Omg, I never saw such a villain before. He was such a psychopath and it suited such a drama perfectly! The actor nailed this role. Sadly the drama tried to make things funnier (and I'm not gonna lie some scenes were really funny) but because of this overused comedy the story seemed too unrealistic. The main characters were also wasted potential, especially the main male lead. VC (male lead) is a lawyer who worked for the MAFIA but I never really felt like he was someone dangerous. At the beginning his character was shown as some ruthless guy who flees to his homeland, but later this feeling just disappeared. HCY (female lead) had a pretty interesting character, I don't think I ever saw someone like her, she was a real crackhead. Sometimes it was just too much where the secondhand embarrassment slowly started to show itself, but overall her character was really interesting to watch.

The music wasn't something special for me. I can't even remember the soundtracks.

Overall, the drama was okay. I actually started it because I wanted to watch something more serious, but laughed mostly at the ridiculous scenes. I wouldn't rewatch this drama again, it just didn't left an good impression on me like other dramas.

This series is bonkers on so many levels, and I love it so damn much for it.
I don't usually write reviews but I felt like I really needed to here because this show has earned itself a special place in my heart. And amidst all the weirdly negative reviews I just want to sing it some praises because rarely has a drama ever brought me this much joy and excitement. So do take my review with a grain of salt, if you want to. It's hard to fully sum up all the reasons why this drama is dear to me but I'll try. This will probably be long.

***

Vincenzo is a fast-paced dark comedy that is a rollercoaster ride of a K-drama, and if I say that, believe me, because it will have you at the edge of your seat either anticipating or dreading what's next to come, crying of laughter (or tragedy), or wanting to simply applaud at the sheer audacity of its plot (this will happen a lot).
There is lots of corruption, betrayal, some bloodiness and breaking bones here and there, but also a good chunk (a very large one, actually!) of comedy, lightheartedness, romance, and just the right amount of emotional depth, which in my opinion is one of the reasons why this show has stayed in my mind for so long (and it still lives there rent-free) after it ended. Add to the mix gripping cliffhangers that always leave you wanting for more after each episode. Seriously, the cliffhangers are insane (!!!).
Contrary to what most people say, I didn't think the first few episodes were slow at all, though I can see why some might think that way. It's true that the real fun begins in episode 4 and it's also where the plot truly starts to pick up, but in no way did the previous episodes seem slow or boring to me. They're still fun to watch and are important in setting up the characters; Hong Yu-Chan is a central character in laying the foundation for Vincenzo's and Cha-Young's motivation to take on the fight against Babel. After that– the show is pure entertainment. The big reveal in episode 4 is one of the best plot twists I've seen so far (I guarantee you won't see it coming). The ending, to keep it spoiler-free, is nothing short of the definition of ""cathartic"" and shows once again that this drama, no matter its funny exterior, is not afraid to go skin-crawlingly dark with its approach on retribution and justice. Warning, you might find yourself genuinely questioning your own morals.
Overall the show really just constantly keeps you on your toes with plenty of stuff that happens in every episode, there's barely a dull moment and lots of twists and turns that keep it interesting. You just can't wait to find out whatever shenanigans the characters will be up to next, and when you do find out, it's a joy to watch. A lot of the schemes that Vincenzo, Cha-Young and the tenants pull against Babel range from absolute tomfoolery to well-thought-out, meticulous plans. The over the top scenarios are, yes over the top, but at the same time ironically believable and more importantly, fun! You can tell how much fun the writer and production team had with this show; there's this current of wild abandon running beneath the creative choices and I'm pretty sure it's the secret to what makes Vincenzo such an entertaining show.
It's just that kind of show, where you'd try and guess what happens and come to certain conclusions but then stop and re-think ""Hmm, no, the writer wouldn't do that."" to which they reply ""Bold of you to assume I wouldn't do this.""

I feel like many people who didn't like this drama sort of fail to understand it for what it essentially is and thus just kind of miss the whole point of it. I've seen lots of people say it was bad due to its absurdist comedy which, obviously isn't everyone's cup of tea but that doesn't make it a ""bad"" drama, rather a matter of preference. You can go watch countless other dramas that are solely gritty and dark if you're looking for something like that. But without its campiness in the midst of thriller and serious crime, Vincenzo wouldn't be what it's supposed to be. It's a parody and a love letter to K-Drama, gangster movies, and action comedies alike. It can be funny, satirical, but also sophisticated and cool. And while it is very blatant with how it employs multiple genres, it proves through its engaging script and characters that it's not really a parody, after all. And it's very good in making you realize that. It's refreshingly self-aware in the way that, at face value, it sees itself simply as fun entertainment - but one look behind the flashy facade and you'll come to love it for many more reasons. I think it just ticks a lot of boxes, not only for me but for a lot of other people, and that's why it was one of the most loved dramas of 2021, that's undeniable.
I mean we have:
- an anti-hero take on fighting corruption aka ""fighting evil with evil"" (and I loved the way PJB executed Vincenzo's character arc in that aspect so much, I could write a whole review on that alone)
- a colorful and quirky cast of characters with a found family dynamic, Geumga Plaza my beloved <3
- unapologetically evil villains that you'll love to hate
- some of the most satisfying moments in any drama I've seen
- AND scorching hot chemistry between its main leads.
So what's not to like?

Additionally, there's an iconic (almost cinematic tbh) OST that definitely deserves to be fully listened to at least once (please play ""un diavolo scaccia l'altro at my funeral or something) and great directing that compliments it in every aspect. There are also countless clever quips and allusions to Italian stereotypes and mafia movies, and hearing Song Joong-Ki speak Italian surprisingly well was delightful. I absolutely didn't want to learn italian after watching this show. No, not me!
But I think the series is most convincing simply because of its characters and the interactions between them, especially our main leads.
Not only does Song Joong-Ki master his title role with flying colors and impeccable comedic timing (and immense swag, let's be real), Jeon Yeo-Been as Hong Cha-Young is /such/ a breath of fresh air in a world that deems many women like her ""too out there"" or ""too much"" and she looks past such criticisms with but a glance and blows you a kiss while donning expensive sunglasses. You can fight me at 3 am in a parking lot about this, but she's an amazing female lead. Both of them are two morally ambiguous, complex and layered protagonists that don't fall prey to cliché tropes at all and instead shine through a healthy, respectful relationship that will be my favorite one for probably years to come. Their camaraderie and connection runs so deep, you could practically see the love seeping out of their eyes whenever they looked at each other. The'yre the best example of ""soulmates"" I have seen in a drama. And in a show that doesn't focus on its romance all too much, this speaks volumes. Also, they're just SO fun to watch on screen together!
Them and the rest of the cast, special mention to Ok Taec-Yeon, Kim Yeo Jin and Kwak Dong-Yeon who really knocked it out of the park, also know how to appear believable in their roles in even the most incredulous situations, which is another reason why I love this show so much: I love that while it can be very farcical and over the top at times, it still manages to stay grounded in the way its characters react emotionally and accordingly to their goals and motivations. And so you cannot help other than to just cheer along with (or against) them as they go through all of these ridiculous and unbelievable things.
That, to me, was why by the end of the show I've become so attached to it that I just sat there in disbelief as the credits were running and when ""The end"" finally showed up on the screen, I really didn't want to believe it was actually over. There's got to be more, right? ...Right? And I'm sure I was not the only one who felt like this. Like any good story that is ending, you just don't want to let it go, want to spend more time in that world, with those characters, but are instead left with a good old dose of post-drama-depression. And a big dose it was. It left a giant, bloody (30m diameter, to quote Mr. Nam) hole in my heart, but in the end that's just par for the course for a drama like this, isn't it?

Everyone's got that one drama that leaves a big impression on them after watching it, for some it may be CLOY, for others Reply 1988 or My Mister, but for me, it was this comedy drama about a Korean-Italian Mafia lawyer. Yeah, I didn't really expect that either.

***

To sum it up, ""Vincenzo"" has a lot to offer for those who want to be fully engrossed by a show, without having to sacrifice one genre for the other. But in no way does it play it safe, on the contrary, it 100% goes all in. And if you know how to have fun with TV, then it's definitely something you shouldn't miss.

Finished watching in 5 days instead of my regular 2 days
Likable
1. Ok Taec-yeon as Villain
2. Death Scenes of Hong Yoo-chan, Jang Han-seok & Choi Myung-hee
3. Park Joo-hyung as Vincenzo
4. Modern day relationship dynamics influenced by past instances & regret after losing loved one's (Hong Cha-Young relationship with her father & Vincenzo's resentment towards his mother)
5. Jang Han-seo character development. The only character that actually developed or improved with time according to me.

Dislikable
1. Entire Save Geumga Plaza Fiasco-Didn't like ""over-the-top"" sacrifices for Vincenzo. All tenants except monks & hacker were useless.
2. Over-Exaggeration of Consigliere & his Powers on other side Babel & power it holds.
3. Too many side-characters, divergence from main-plot, cassano family & filler comedy scenes.
4. Vincenzo's veiled past, Cha-Young's role from manipulative-smart lawyer being reduced to Vincezo's devotee. Reason behind Cha-Young's mother committing suicide & more shades of her character could be explored.
5. Jang Han-seok despite of being the mastermind relying too much on Choi Myung-hee for executing his plans & protecting himself.

Above Average-Neither too Good nor too Bad-Watchable after skipping filler scenes.

I got an account just for this!

I finished watching the last episode a few minutes ago and honestly, I just need to talk about this drama so .... here we are.
it took me a few episodes to actually get into vincenzo. I even stopped three episodes in and took a one week break ;I just could not see what everyone was raving about... but after picking it up again...well .. here we are. opening accounts and all.

I'll keep it short.
this are a few of the best parts of vincenzo...at least for me;
1.The characters are consistent and their arches feel plausible. plus the acting is solid . especially after the third ish episode
when the story gets going, you can feel them settle into their roles and just pop.
2.the writing is lethal . it pulls no punches. its one of the few dramas that actually delivers on a promise and doesn't just play it safe (up to the point of making me uncomfortable, but in the best way, I promise.)... like i said , it takes a bit for the story to get going but when it does, it DOES NOT STOP. it really does not. from the action to the emotion it just does not stop.
3. i don't know why its classed as a romcom but it so much more than that honestly ,and that appealed to me. it can be silly and funny the switch up and become very dark, very fast and somehow not feel like unmatched puzzle pieces. it just fits . somehow
4. last but not least...that has to be one of the most memorable last episodes i have watched in a while. this is because of the first two reasons i gave, solid consistent characters and ruthless writing. What a ride. If i was in a theater I'd stand and clap, i really would. If for no other reason .... watch it for the finale

all in all... a story with badassery, heart, laughs and tears( or screams, depending on how you vent... i nearly lost my voice this last hour. ( I'm not over it!!!! i mean they just.. they just... I'm trying so hard not to spoil! Do watch to understand my devastation))

PAINFUL
I am a native Italian. I lived in Milan for 18 years. My family happened to be involved in politics and law. One of my aunts, a judge, was a NON-CORRUPTED member that fought and almost got killed because of her involvement in Berlusconi's trial. I do not know who you are or where you are from, but I travel extensively and I know EACH COUNTRY have crime organizations with local names. My country organizational crime is called MAFIA. Now, my blood almost exploded out of my veins when I saw baby face Song Joong Ki acting as mafia lawyer .My biggest fear became reality when girls and young women are raving about Mafia guys with pride and honor. NO SUCH THING. From The Godfather, to the Soprano , ending with Korea....enough is enough. Korea has MASSIVE crime in the form of loan sharks, due to the extreme nepotism and corrupt government. So I watched all these show and though we were very similar. ONE BIG DIFFERENCE: mafia is a PRODOTTO ITALIANO, made in Italy, so don't export slavery, pedophiles, drug dealers and pimps. Korea is producing such high quality shoes: Flower of evil, my mister, Hyena.....Awaken...I mean, I think you can use Mafia only to make fun of it, or to fight it. Not as a show. Grazie.

Just...what?
I know this show was super popular and let be start with the good stuff:

Amazing acting. Seriously...all the actors/actresses are great in their roles and some are playing very different characters than we have seen them in before so that is impressive all on it's own.

The Look - This snow looks amazing and was filmed really well.

The not so good stuff:

Story - Interesting at first, but then got super violent and hard to take at times. Started out great, but got really over the top and cheezy a lot of the time. Also it was very hard to watch the villians be so awful. I mean, I know you are supposed to dislike them, but it's really just too much and instead of wanting justice for their crimes, I just didn't care about seeing them at all. And the violence...it's way way too much. Especially in the last episode. That was just a horror show that did not need to be seen. It was awful.

Characters - Disliked literally every character. Even though they were well acted, it was hard to root for the ""good guys/gals"" and even the side characters were just too over the top most of the time. My friend and I watched this show together and we decided the only ""good"" character is the pigeon. So there is that. I mean it's hard to cheer for even the ""heroes"" when they are willing to murder and be awful humans as well. Some of the characters started out likable, but by the end, I was ready to be done with all of them...except the pigeon. Him we could see more of. :-)

So, I can't recommend this drama. It's just extremely violent and hard to take.

A DISAPPOINTMENT
Yet another drama for the masses demanding panem et circenses. I bet the majority of viewers will LOVE it and write rave reviews. Let my review be different.

Is it a great drama? Yes, without a doubt.
Is it an excellent drama that I will remember even after five years? Definitely no.

So, what is my beef with this drama?

1. The plot is a total cliche. For those who are just getting into kdrama and kmovie industry it might be interesting but I have watched way too many ""they will threaten to demolish the building but then some heroic namja will show up and save the entire neighborhood plus he will win the girl's heart."" Alternatively, the hero might die but he will put up a good fight before he goes. Sorry, but I watched those dramas by the dozen. BO-O-O-O-RING.

2. The plot is driven by action only. It means the character development will be non-existent and the overall outcome totally predictable. He will remain the hero and get the girl in the end. Do I want to see how it is going to play out? The next several episodes will most likely be interesting and then slowly but surely it will go downhill from there. There will be tons of fights and a bloody culmination before the grand finale. At some point, he will probably find out who his real parents were. Hope it's not the tokkpokki restaurant owner.

3. Song Joong-Ki. Well, I hope he learned his lesson that being romantic in a drama leads to a huge dopamine spike but doesn't mean you can spend the rest of your life with the person you kiss on the set. So there won't be any more couple statues. I am not his fan but he plays well.

Just my two cents.
.............................................

UPDATE: I am dropping it. It is not worth my time.

Not your favourite review. (Boring show)
I can never fully grasp why the rating is so damn high. So many people praise this drama and im sorry but this show aint for me.
Firstly, im okay with illogicality in general. But the plot in this show is just too much. No cases were really being seen solved completely and its just shallow. Not a good delivery on each topic. The only reason i manage to watch it up to 15 ep is bcs of the undercover police officer and the assistant lawyer. Others are just overacting. The storyline is also slow and boring. Repetitive turn of events throughout the show. The only scene that enticed me is the appearance of truck-kun.
Apart from that, action and cinematography is great. But thats just it. Having predictable scene is just fine but this show lacks something that can keep me to be on the edge everytime something happened. I am also grateful for them to not include too much lovey dovey scene. Props to them for that. Then again, sorry for this review but i honestly dont think it should have those high ratings.

Vincenzo
I'm not sure what all the hype was about in this drama. It has high review and was recommended to me from a friend. Still, I don't find it as great as others. Some parts are very exciting and fast pace while other scenes are dragging and shouldn't even be included. I found myself rolling my eyes and groaning in disappointment in certain scenes.

No doubt Vincenzo Cassano is a tough mafia who will get the job done. However, there are many scenes where he's not like a mafia. He's like a clumsy, funny typical rom-com Korean protagonist. He could have been funny and normal without the extreme jumping and falling down, or extreme surprise stupefied facial expression at certain episodes. There are many 'wtf' moments, ie, when a whole flocks of birds came to rescue him. I actually screamed and laughed out loud in disbelief.
And it's not a good laugh either. There are many, many over the top acting from all characters. Many many OOC taking place in the drama. I understand some of the those were for comical relief but it's not working for me. They're too over the top.

I don't like the force romance between the two main leads. They both have a great friendship and working relationship. But I don't see a romance relationship between them. Whenever it appears, it seems force and out of place to me. I also don't find the people in the Geumga Plaza pleasant to watch. It's such a ""coincidence"" that they all have some kind of fighting background. It's so weird that they all come together and help one another like that without worrying about the consequence. And non of them fear the mafia, Vincenzo, a man who could torture and kill without blinking an eye. The Geumga Plaza residents are silly and I guess they provide a comical aspect to the show.

I still did find this drama watchable. I cried when a few of the characters died. I like and feel sorry for Jang Han-seo. He started out silly and stupid but end up being someone who showed growth and able to redeem himself at the end.

I like the revenge plot. I like the an eye for an eye approach. If you did Vincenzo wrong, he would take revenge and make sure you feel every single pain for it. The cat and mouse game he plays with Jan-Han-seok and Cha-Young was a joy to watch. Overall, it was an okay drama but I would not watch it ago.

""Vincenzo"" and Moral Deception: Violence and Murder are Okay if it’s for a Good Cause
They're not.

While I wholly support those who fight for freedom and defend themselves, murder and such violent acts are different. It is about intention. I also recognize that the argument of this show is that Vincenzo is a lesser evil than the main villain and is fighting against evil. However, (and the show notes this) it is still evil against evil which ultimately ruins all the good it builds up at the beginning.

These crucial elements of morality come into play more seriously at the end of the show. Rather than just being simple “Ocean's Eleven” fun and games, the series still puts the anti hero in the spotlight, his actions fully supported by the other ""good"" players in the show.

In terms of the comedic and often lighter tone of the show, this is comparable to Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite.” The difference, however, is satire. The audience in “Parasite” is meant to recognize the evil we face in reality and the wrongness of the situation while still depicting it in humorous ways. By the end of “Vincenzo,"" on the other hand, it is clear that the show is genuine in its attitude on moral grayness.

As a side note, one of the reasons I enjoyed last year's “The Good Detective” so much is because it emphasizes the importance of the law and morality despite the challenges of each.

What is good? What is evil? Where is the line?

""Vincenzo"" only scratches the surface of these broad questions. In my opinion, it is because there is no real line drawn here. Perhaps I speak for myself, but I never felt as though Vincenzo was the villain even as he claims to be one. His very being the protagonist affects the viewer’s perspective on the protagonist’s actions, confusing the morality of the show further. The better question then is, “What wouldn’t Vincenzo do for his perceived justice and revenge?”

By the end, it becomes a show where the “good guys” find pleasure in their enemies’ pain. Their enemies certainly needed to pay, but it feels as though the show glorifies such vengeance, turning it into good when, at the end of the day, it is still evil.

The charm the show begins with does not persevere as the later episodes and ending reveal the seriousness of our “good characters’” actions. What could have been used as a shock ploy to persuade viewers and other characters in the show of such seriousness and evil is only accepted and continued to the end of the show. And I will just tell you, many of our main characters have some shocking acts.

This is an interesting point to note because we see do, in fact, see this moral struggle in Vincenzo's character through his nightmares and in Cha Young through her physical aversion to such violence (as opposed to her verbal consent). Had the show then gone the route of exploring these insecurities and drawing a moral line, a powerful lesson could have been found in the story. And, as with the way Vincenzo works, it would have come with a splendid snap and boom.

CONCLUSION

Despite the supposed morally grey characters (whom I argue are still making evil decisions with regards to murder and such cruelty), there is a great deal of meaning to still be found in the show. It is full of strong and richly created characters with believable weaknesses. Plot twists don’t appear out of nowhere and come seamlessly as the show progresses. Comedy and tragedy work in harmony to build this incredible series.

The last couple episodes are outliers for my final grade on the show because I disliked them so much as all my hopes for a meaningful conclusion were wasted. However, with such an enjoyable beginning and middle of the drama, I decided to rest on a well-deserved 8/10.

I would say that it was worth watching because of its clever fun, but if such moral deceptiveness bothers you in a show, I would not recommend it to you. As always, my rewatch value is based on my entertainment value and my music also includes sound. Rarely is it that I give out 10s for sound—the sound and music here was stupendous. I appreciate all the hard work that went into the making of this show and hope this was helpful to someone! Cheers!

Very good one time watch
Minor Spoilers Ahead.

Could it have been better? Yes
Is it over the top? Very much
Did i like it? Yes

Know what you're going in for before you start watching. It's just your regular hero saves the day kind of drama. But it's entertaining and that's what i wanted.

Story could have been so much better. Had a lot of scope to make the title character a cold blooded killer. They did show some shades of it at the end. But if they'd dived into that part a bit more i would have liked it. Kind of like Dexter.

Overall it's a good drama and deserves a watch. 8.5/10

Warning: Unpopular Opinion Ahead. Read At Own Risk.
Unpopular Opinion - People are only rating this drama high, because SJK is in it, and he's a popular actor in Korea and internationally, so anything that he's in will get hyped up. He's like the BTS of K-Dramas.

Now, I will say that SJK's acting was amazing, and of course I was drooling over him like everyone else. But let's not lie to ourselves by saying that this is a masterpiece of a K-Drama, with an amazing never-seen-before mind-blowing story, the best one that came out in 2021. Yes, there's people that say stuff like this. Why not just admit we're enjoying it because SJK is hot as fuck? I can see how people might like some elements that I don't enjoy. But saying that the story is amazing is just a lie.

The things that I personally disliked that other people might find endearing are:
The Story - To me, it wasn't original in any way, shape or form, it just wasn't unique. There were no crazy plot-twists that would leave my jaw on the floor (the only one was the revelation of the real Chairman). At the beginning, it seemed like Vincenzo was going to follow a totally different structure from the other K-Dramas we see nowadays, but the structure of the story quickly became repetitive and predictable. It was pretty much just: Conflict happens. Vincenzo solves it. Humour. Conflict happens. Vincenzo solves it. Humour. And then it just pretty much follows the same formula, except maybe sometimes there's a death of someone that throws off this formula, but not for long. There's not much struggle for the characters, or a sense of urgency, or suspense, which makes it boring for me to watch. If there is some conflict, it either gets solved in the same episode, or in the next episode, which makes you feel like there are no stakes for the characters. Like, what's the point of introducing this conflict if it will be resolved right away? Another thing that threw me off was some funny moments that just felt misplaced at some points. I didn't hate all of them, but some of those just felt like unnecessary filler, which -again- made me feel bored. All in all, the pacing wasn't the best.

The Main Character - I know. I'm horrible. Although I liked the acting (and the visuals of SJK), the way Vincenzo was written just wasn't in my style. In my humble opinion, Vincenzo represents a Gary Stu. If you don't know what that is, here's a definition: ""A male version of a Mary Sue. Seemingly perfect character with no flaws, or who always overpowers other characters."" Again, people might disagree, but I feel like Vincenzo fits this description well. He's too OP, always solves everything, and never struggles, unless it's convenient for the plot. For example, throughout the whole drama, Vincenzo is this guy who's so smart and conniving, who always finds the most creative ways to destroy his opponent, which I wouldn't even dream of, he always ends up surprising us with his clever ideas to get out of bad situations. He's always ten steps ahead. But, when the writer wants to kill off Jang Han Seo, all of a sudden, Vincenzo turns into a coward who wants to run away. He always has these crazy ideas to win, but when the villain is lying on the floor, with the gun out of his hands, he fails to do the most simple thing - which is take the gun, beat him up, and capture him. Vincenzo doesn't struggle much throughout the story, and when he does, it's done in a way that doesn't make sense for his character. It would be fine if he was a side character, but because he's a main lead, it means we have to follow him around. It's not endearing at all. I like following characters that struggle, and that have weaknesses, because that makes them more likeable. If they have flaws, weaknesses, struggles, and end up failing from time-to-time, it makes them more realistic, which makes them more relatable, which makes them more sympathetic. Not to mention, if a main character starts out practically perfect, it means there's no room for character development. That's Vincenzo. He's smart, witty, strong, handsome, and creative. And when he does have a bad trait, it's a trait that ends up not changing. As a result, Vincenzo ends up being the exact same person in the first and last episode. It's something others seemed to like, but as someone who's a sucker for good character development, I wasn't impressed. Personally, I didn't have a problem with any other characters. Some I was okay with, some I even liked. Because Vincenzo played the biggest part of the story though (obviously), that's probably why I ended up feeling bored most of the time.

The Humour - I actually didn't hate this. I have mixed feelings about this. There were times where I appreciated it, and times where it felt forced, unnatural, and it ruined my immersion. In those moments, the humour felt unbearable. Especially during moments I didn't find funny, I would cringe, or just want the story to move on. I also know a lot of people liked the not-realistic aspects and that K-Dramas aren't supposed to be realistic. But for me, some of the things that happened were too much, even for K-Drama logic. There were some moments that just felt like an obvious filler, and I just couldn't get over some moments how a character would die in one scene, and then straight afterwards, we would have them acting all silly. Sometimes, it just didn't fit the mood, and there were moments where I wished they would of let the dread and suspense linger, because it would make the humorous moments more impactful, in my opinion.

That being said, I didn't hate everything. That's why I didn't give it one star. The things I did like:
Cinematography - I loved the camerawork, and how they shot certain moments. You can see the high budget reflected in the drama, when you watch it. Of course, the amazing cinematography captured SJK's beauty well. I also like the symbolism behind some shots.

Acting - I think they chose great actors, who portrayed their roles perfectly. There was not one actor I've seen in this drama, which I would find to not do well. The heroes, villains, and anti-heroes all showed great range of emotions.

Antagonist - I noticed that a lot of people don't like Jung Woo being the real chairman, because he's too silly and cartoonish, and because he dances around and acts like a fool. But that's exactly why I liked him. Because he has a personality other than the fact that he's evil. People think that he's not a scary villain, because of this, but that's exactly what's scary about him. The fact that he can manipulate people like that without batting an eye, and change his personality. People also complained that he's not smart enough, but not all bad guys have to be smart and meticulous. I found him interesting, because he was so short-tempered, vengeful, and totally insane.

The Humour - Like I said, I had mixed feelings about it. Although it felt out of place sometimes, I did appreciate it. Because I found the story boring, as well as the main character we followed, the humour ended up being the thing to keep me entertained, as well as some interesting characters. I especially liked the more subtle humour.

Character relationships - I liked some relationships between the characters. For example, the development of Vincenzo's relationship with the Plaza tenants, and how they started liking him the more they got to know him. I also like the slow development of Vincenzo's and Hong Cha Young's relationship. It felt realistic, and endearing, how they got closer to each other the more they've been through together. Everyone who interacted with each other at some point, ended up having visible chemistry, which is something I could enjoy.

Writing - Although the story felt recycled, I really liked the writing. It made each character's personality stand out. I especially enjoyed the metaphors and proverbs they would sprinkle in, at certain situations. It felt rewarding to be able to destroy the bad guy by being witty, and turning the script on them. The dialogue was clever, with quite a few call-backs, which I appreciated, as well as some entertaining references.

Overall, though, all the good points didn't save the drama for me. I just didn't find myself enjoying it like everyone else did and couldn't understand why everyone felt like this drama was so revolutionary (but now I think I know). It just feels like one of those moments where a basic drama gets over-hyped by everyone, and actual amazing and creative dramas will get overlooked, and will be underrated, because they don't have famous actors in it. Maybe I expected too much, because of how much praise this drama got, but I left disappointed. In 2021, I watched dramas with similar genres and tags to Vincenzo, which did way better in everything that Vincenzo lacked in. In the end, it was nothing special.

Horrible Overrated
I constantly see this show being hyped up but honestly I don’t think it’s that good?
The female lead is underdeveloped, she’s supposedly a top lawyer defending a company with plenty of dirt to be dug up (meaning you’d have to be very good at your job to keep them from losing the case), and yet she’s constantly relying on Vincenzo. Everything being done is all Vincenzo Vincenzo Vincenzo. Who made the plan? Vincenzo. Who is the key player for said plan? Vincenzo. Etc. She should’ve been given more opportunities to actually do something because she was a useless character that didn’t live up to her background. Not to mention she’s honestly a questionable character. Like she knew what Babel was doing and yet she didn’t care to do shit until it affected her personally (her dad being killed). Like…?
Moving on from her, the main enemies (Vincenzo and Jun Woo) are not at all an even match. Vincenzo overpowers the villains wayyy too much. He’s constantly planning ahead and is seemingly immortal (literally how is it that hard to kill a single person) while the villains are set up to be so tough and yet they’re really not all that? Honestly they’re stupid. For example, Vincenzo’s mom. They see that Vincenzo, who has yet to be really personally affected by them but is still set on destroying them, is a real threat and that he has a weak old mom who he loves. And what do they do? They killed her, giving him even more motivation to destroy them. The smart move would’ve been to have kidnapped her and controlled him using her. And despite how obviously weaker they are compared to Vincenzo it still took him so long to destroy them. Like??? Realistically it really should’ve taken him a week, max. Especially given he wasnt even going in accordance to the law, he just ended up killing them which he could’ve easily done before.
As for the side characters, I get that they’re for comedic purposes but they’re so useless and unrealistic. Useless because they served no purpose to the plot that couldn’t have easily been given to a different character who already has purpose. And unrealistic because what are the chances that a bunch of secretly amazing fighters just happen to live together?
And as for Han Seo, I have no particular problem with his character, if anything he’s probably the best written one, but his death was so cheap. Like I get you want something with an emotional impact to make the show more memorable, but you could at least make his death useful. His death served no purpose to the plot, could’ve been easily avoided, and created a hole in Vincenzo’s character (as in, he’s supposedly some mastermind and yet instead of grabbing the gun and shooting Jun Woo, which would’ve saved Han Seo, he goes to Cha Young which was useless).
But that’s just my opinion, feel free to disagree.

This drama is not getting enough hype. Cannot believe it didn’t get more noms for awards. (Only best actor nom). The MUSIC ! The DIRECTION! The special way some scenes are shot. ? Un freakin believable. What a roller coaster ride this show is ??? AND what a great comedic actress Jeon Yeo-been is. Oh My God! She is brilliant. I will watch this drama over and over again. I am begging for a complete soundtrack❗️ ALL THE MUSIC. Not just the main songs but music even from scenes that the songs have no words and it’s just playing behind the scene

I came out feeling somewhat satisfied.
After watching the trailer and teasers, I was very excited. I get a mafia/legal crime drama with not only Song Joongki (SJK) but there is also Ok Taeckyeon (OTY) [SIGN ME UP!!!] You kind of get what your expecting but then some curve balls are thrown in. The story overall was somewhat predictable but still holds your interest. Some of the plot twists just come out of left field and it is glorious. There is a lot more comedic relief than one (one meaning I) would have expected. A lot of the characters have complex backgrounds and developments which is really nice. Netflix has a record for only giving few characters depth and I am glad more of them were incorporated . Acting was good overall. I know times that its not always the acting is bad but its the way the characters are written and directed. If there were cases of bad acting then it was the production/writing time this time. I have seen the main leads acting before , so I can tell the difference. When the comedy parts come in , the secondary characters/actors steal the show.

The music was good. I liked it more than I thought I would. Now that I am trying to remember any of the songs that were played , I can't really do it. Some songs were really good but sadly not really rememberable .

Overall, Vincenzo was a good watch and I don't have any regrets watching it. That being said, I have several problems with the show. Some could be just because tropes or flaws of the written characters. I for one like the violence (fight scenes, torture, etc.) especially if it was JK and TY. It is a ""watch only once ""type of drama. I may watch the last episode again if there is a another season just to refresh but not otherwise.

Things I didn't like (possible spoilers not sure):

(1)What I didn't like was the need to make the main leads into a couple (love interests). I would have like a platonic relationship between the two. They didn't have a couple chemistry but they did work well with each other. The writers wrote in several ...and I mean SEVERAL cases of bisexuality but used them for comedic humor. I would have made sense if Vincenzo was written as a bisexual character. And if not bisexual, maybe bi-curious at the least. The only verified lgbtq+ representation was in the ""closest"" and an serial assaulter. Yeah, that's a no for me.

(2) Some of the comedic relief scenes where just plain dumb and over kill.

(3) For me, the female lead was so annoying closer to the middle. The character had so much potential but they decided to make her a cliché. How do you start out so annoying yet badass to just plain annoying. I saw development in her but it was an overnight flip of the switch type of development. One to were it hits you how quick her selective moral change. They tried to make her intimating but that fell through because she was used for too much of the comedic relief before hand. She was going to be one of my fave characters but they ruined it.

(4) Why did the fact that Vincenzo being in the mafia become a public thing. there were scene where they would openly talk about him being in the mafia in public places (stores, bars, restaurants, the damn street). FOR WHY!!!!?

(5) There is one more thing but I can't explain why it irritates me without giving more spoilers. So I'll stop here.

Vincenzo might not be the first noire drama out there, but it sure went full throttle with the genre, what with Mafia, deep state corruption, torture, revenge, murder and everything in between. But other than the usual noire that mixes in a pinch of drama, and a dash of romance, it mixed quite a large dollop of comedy. Whether the recipe works or not, depends on each viewer, so while some might have found the dose of comedy a tad too much, others found it was just the right amount and loved the drama all the more for it. I for one, could have appreciated a more balanced recipe, but I still enjoyed it all in all.

From the drama's kickoff, you become attracted to the original premise, the fast paced plot and the sleek execution. An Italian mafia family's consigliere of Korean origin heads back to Korea to retrieve a vault full of gold.
The first few episodes while a little slow paced served well to introduce the characters and pave the ground for the story, and during that phase the comedy was just to the right level and served its purpose, to show the sudden shift in the hero's life and the jarring difference between his background in Italy and what he finds himself thrown into in Korea. I was laughing with tears at vincenzo's demise upon arriving at Korea, and enjoyed the comedic relief in the simple interactions with the side characters and even simple moments like our mighty hero begging a pigeon to shut up so that he can go to sleep, only to have the pigeon raid his bedroom.
The start of the drama was craftly done to show the gap between our hero's true identity and past, and how his move to a different environment surrounded with simple common people affected his demeanour, state of mind and even somehow his priorities. The more he dived deeper into the lives and struggles of the simple plaza tenants, the more he drifted a little further from his dark mafia background, though eventually he relied on his mafia expertise but this time for nobler causes.

As I said, earlier on in the show the comedy served a purpose and was to a degree well-balanced, giving the right amount at the right time. For example, I was LOLing at the scenes where the undercover NIS agent with a Mafia-mania spying on Vincenzo always seemed to see things from an angle that made him mistake vicenzo for an angel in disguise, a mafia with a huge soul and a good conscience.
But the more the drama progressed, the more I guess the writers wanted to stay true to their forte or something, and slapstick comedy started to hit in huge doses. I have no problem with mixing comedy with other genres however serious and heavy they might be, but the right formula depends on the type, amount and timing of the said comedy. In Vincenzo's case, the comedy scenes were sometimes so sudden and ridiculous they kind of felt like a hit in the face especially if they came right after a tragic and intense scene, it left me sometimes with an urge to rub my eyes in disbelief. Comedic relief is one thing, but it should never be so sudden and so slapstick that it totally takes you out of the mood of the drama and pulls you away from the story. (Side mention, the excessive PPL as usual was extra distractive. ugh!!!!)

Putting the comedy aside, like any thriller the main plot relies on a series of confrontations, of attacks and counterattacks. The antagonists plot a scheme, and the protagonist hits back. This format is expected, but unfortunately in vincenzo's case it eventually caused a certain sense of repititiveness. The more the plot progressed, and the more complicated and elaborate the attacks became, the more it relied on unexpected twists and fake cliffhangers, where it essentially became a loope of ""the bad guys plot against vincenzo > a cliffhanger shows vincenzo in a pinch > flashbacks in the first few minutes of the following episode show that vincenzo was informed or expected the bad guy's plot and was well prepared and that the whole thing was a ruse and he comes out without bearing even one scratch"". While the first few times it felt cool and smart, the more such gotcha moments increased the more it started to feel annoying, repetitive and strangely and ironically predictive. Having our all-mighty anti-hero always conquering and ending up having the upper hand does feel good, but having it happen in that manner most of the time could end up dampening the suspence and killing the thrill, as if the writers start a huge fire only to dump water on it after mere seconds before it even reached a point of being thrilling. You're left watching not worried whether or not he will come out fine, but rather wondering what he has up his sleeves this time.

The acting overall takes a 7, a special shoutout goes to Taecyon for his marvelous performance, hands down the strongest out of all the cast. SJK as usual gave a very solid performance, though at times a little monotone, which I think was mostly due to the writing than anything. The FL's performance was my least favourite among the the main cast (more on that later), first drama for her and I am no fan.

In terms of characters;
First, Vincenzo was a very well written anti-hero and SJK was perfect in the role. He was charismatic, cunning, smart, mysterious and strong-willed, The perfect villain to fight off villains, though to be honest I would have preferred it if the writers had toned down his invincibility level a bit, he doesn't have to lose the fight, but at least show him with a more serious injury than a little scratch every once and a while you know. the background story of his birth and upbringing while very brief, still helped flesh out his character and give it more depth. In terms of character development, under layers and layers of endless charisma and coollness, SJK was able to portray the slighest hints of change of heart nothing major to call development though, and eventually the drama stuck to the point and chose no major redemption, which personally I found more convincing and believable.

The FL on the other hand I had mixed emotions concerning her. I started off hating her and not because of how intially she was ambivalent to justice and rude to her father, but simply because her whole personna felt obnoxious and her nonchalant attitude was sometimes over the top and annoying. The actress' comedy portrayal felt somewhat theatrical and ridiculous, she was supposed to be a smart, strong and competent lawyer, but she sometimes came out as naïve, noisy and spoilt brat. There were moments early in the drama where I genuinely doubted if the actress was doing an impersonation of Jun Ji Hyun in Legend of the Blue Sea, that'show much comical her acting was, she felt like a mermaid out of sea ?. I did eventually manage to come around and accept her only to start questioning her principles in aiding vincenzo's agenda wholeheartedly the way she did, no matter how brutal and lawless it became.
But unfortunately one impression that never changed when it came to the main leads.... was the lack of chemistry between them. I never truely felt a spark between the two of them, but it might just be me, cause he acted so cool and composed all the time, and she was so over the top with her reactions and expressions, that I felt he surely must be annoyed by her as much as I am (LOL), also I never bought the fact he developed romantic feelings for her, it felt kind of forced. And although It is always a downer not to feel enough chemistry to be rooting for an OTP, but thank God this is not a rom-com and romance was never the center plot here. The first kiss scene was pretty good though I gotta admit :)

The side characters (Geumga Plaza tenants) were mostly endearing and I was especially grateful that the writer chose not to delve too much deep and give each of them an episode with a detailed story like other dramas choose to do. Above all they served as a catalyst to Vincenzo's purpose in staying in Korea, helped give him a certain sense of beloging and taught him the meaning of trust, and later became sorta his secret sidekicks, which might have been fun at first but later I found was a bit of a stretch and overdone on the writers side, like others pointed out here in the reviews, having all these people with hidden fighting abilities somehow gathered under one roof by chance was too farfetched!!

Last but not least, the villains (since the show had its fair share of those, 80% of the characters were evil for God's sake) some of them were portrayed too evil and too much lacking a conscience to a degree that was hard to swallow, but they still somehow came out believable, and thankfully they never felt as incompetent like in other shows, which was a great feat considering vincenzo was literraly undefeated all the time lol.
Though personally I would have preferred a bit of an origin story for lawyer Choi, other than being a weird ajumma who dances zumba in public, since imo she was the most worthy adversary to vincenzo. And considering the fact that the drama already had its share of bornt-psychopath main villain, not being provided with any background knowledge of what turned lawyer choi to the path of evil (to a murderous degree at that) made it feel like we had two murderous psychopaths that just happened to cross paths and join hands.

The OST (mostly instrumental) had a bunch of cool tracks, and some were very well utilized to enhance the comedy scenes.

Vincenzo was a drama loaded with originality in terms of premise, interesting characters, and an overall thrilling vibe. although it suffered from minor issues with the plot, the pace and the balance of the comedy, I still have to admit I appreciated its originality and high end production, and overall enjoyed watching it, flaws and all.
I apologise for the lengthy review.

It is always fun when any form of media completely surprises you and sweeps you of your feet, and just exceeds all your expectations. With Vincenzo I was expecting something very melodramatic, boring and quite typical legal drama that I would stop watching for a few episodes because I was dying of boredom but what I got was the exact opposite of that. It was so off-kilter.

The drama actually sounds as crazy as it sounds on paper and yet I don’t think the description does it justice. Usually, I do not like such makjang type dramas or over the top soap opera style shows, but here it is done with so much humor and skill so instead of getting on my nerves I got this weird mix of soap opera, thriller, and comedy and then a group of weird, flawed and morally gray characters. It is a weird mix, but it works surprisingly well together. There is a good balance between all these different factors, and it makes quite a cohesive story.

Despite all the laughs and the absurdity that the drama throws at us, it never seems as if it is mocking the story or this soap opera world that is had crafted around it. It’s more playing with it and really take advantage of it. The show takes itself quite seriously with it tone, and yet it does not because it’s main goal seems to be making the most entertaining story, and achieving that is not easy. It’s shows a certain strength within the story and the vision the people behind it had. And that shines quite clearly within the story and makes Vincenzo quite stylish.

The story goes in circles a bit. Sometimes things just seem to happen just because the story needs them to happen just for it to move forward. Some things feel too convenient but the show seems to be very aware of it that you kinda don’t question it too much. It feels wonderfully self-aware of it’s genre, which also helps you suspend your disbelief and keeps you thoroughly entertained while even the most convenient plot points are happening. The story sort of manages to be logical within this small world it has created.

It plays with the soap opera formula and the clichés that comes with those stories and tales of the mafia, to take the story and comedy to another level, making things more exciting, crazier, without making fun of it. It has all done to entertain us or to provoke sort of reaction out of the audience.

But I think it is the characters that really make this show what it is. They are just so fun or interesting! Every single character, whether they are supporting characters or not, have their own quirks and darker sides, although to varying degrees. They are all quite ridiculous and complex in their own way.

Our hero Vincenzo is more of an anti-hero and even the antagonist gets some nuances and quirks that even if you sort of hated them you also enjoyed watching them. I have personally not enjoyed a villain in a kdrama this much for quite some time. They brought so much tension, drama, and comedy into the show that I was almost more excited to see what they would do more than our protagonist.

The same goes with the supporting cast. I enjoyed every scene, every little side-plot that they had going on, which does not always happen. Sometimes they feel like fillers to extend the story for no good reason, but here the supporting characters get to control both the humor of the episodes but also the heart of the show. They all felt important, flawed, and interesting in their own way. They are not just comic-relief,

The romance in Vincenzo is slow and never takes over much of the story itself, although it is very often lingering in the background and the drama is always alluding to it. However, it is never the center of the drama. It is not the main story or focus, and I have to say for my part I am usually fonder of a slow-burning romance and that really worked well here with everything else going on. I love some good pining and longing because the character does not want to admit that they are in love or have not realized it. And there was more than enough of that in Vincenzo. Both are learning to trust others and become good people. Although no one is really a good person in this show.

Do I feel like the drama could gave allowed Chae Young to save herself a little more instead of always having Vincenzo come and save the day and the drama itself had a tendency to rely a little too much on the charm and the visuals of Song Joongki for my taste. It became a bit too repetitive after a while.

Vincenzo is a style of kdrama that I rarely see. And although it contains many basics of soap opera storytelling and other types of kdramas out there, I feel it does stand out because I have never quite seen this mixture before. No matter what the drama did it was always exciting to see what happened next and it always kept me surprised even though I thought the story went in some circles and brushed over certain things along the way. I never felt like they truly ran out of ideas to entertain me and entertain me it certainly did. It never really dealt all its cards.

Vincenzo is not flawless, but it is a hell of a good time. There is always this tension within it, you kept on wondering what would happen next, what these characters would do. You have no know what is going to happen. There is always a lot going on and so much high drama, such high stakes, yet still always so filled with humor. It was a real roller coaster ride from start to finish.

Vincenzo grabbed me completely and did not want to let me go until the very end. I have not enjoyed a kdrama and the discussions that took place around this much it for some time now. And that is what I will take from it; it was just pure fun. It was pure entertainment for me.

FINALLY! A DRAMA WORTH TO WATCH A MILLION TIMES!!!
This is what you called MASTERPIECE. Everything is perfect. Cast, Plot, Characters, OST's, Side Characters, everything is perfect! Definitely my favorite kdrama now out of all the kdrama's I've watched before, this really stands out seriously. Some says it's boring, eh? I wonder what's their favorite kdrama though. LOL. It has a lot of humor and wisdoms you can really enjoy and reflect to. It's great because you can really learn a lot of important things here especially, the reality of villains, the true story of politicians and media. I gained a lot from this, especially the one that's about regrets and how the two leads got to learned from it. I swear this is so funny, not just drama, not just an action or violence, this is a whole package, definitely not boring. I am actually kindof picky when it comes to a story or plot of a movie or drama's because I get so bored when it's just about romance or slice of life genre. That's why I got to love this because it covers many different kinds of genres like action, comedy, drama, violence, with a touch of a little bit romance. This is also why I love the characters, especially the female lead character,she's not the kind of toxic female characters who gets so boring and iritating that always want to change the male lead characters the ways they want to. However, the case of Hong Chayoung, she never change Vincenzo but she supported him in everything even though there are times that she thinks it's too much, she never judge him or his job or everything about him. They have completely different personalities, they're like a yin yang, they fit for each other. The mischievousness of Hong Chayoung and the seriousness of Vincenzo. There's so much more in this drama so much more characters you can really enjoy and have a good laugh. Highly recommended. I am hoping for season 2, the ending is a cliff hanger which makes it more interesting and got the viewers curious. All in all, perfection. Masterpiece.

Perfect Score because it's Perfect for me.
""Vincenzo"" is my ideal drama. It is suspenseful and ridiculous. It is a revenge thriller, a comedy, a romance, filled with action and touching moments, and some of the most literally mouth-open-shocking moments I've ever seen in a drama. It's actual LOLing and cheering moments. It's plot twists I could have never guessed. It's a cast full of characters I can never forget. I didn't even hesitate to give this all 10s. From beginning to the end Vincenzo did not disappoint and even exceeded all of my expectations. I was hooked from the start.

The cast is amazing, but Song Joong Ki as Vincezo is pretty iconic. He's so cool and nonchalant with his signature gold lighter that I totally bought into the Mafia consigliere plot from the very first scene... even with what is probably not the greatest Italian ever spoken (lol) I was sold. I love villains with depth and this drama is filled to the brim with them. Vincenzo, even with his mostly unbothered attitude, was such a nuanced character. Joong Ki with just a subtle facial expression would reveal so much. I loved this about him since ""Sungkyunkwan Scandal"". He is matched with Jeon Yeo Bin as Hong Cha Young, a lawyer of questionable morals, who I also instantly loved. She is strong and smart and completely goofy and can keep up with Vincenzo without crossing the moral line. Their chemistry is incredible, you can feel it through the way they just looked at each other, and although romance is never exactly the center of this drama the way their connection grows from beginning to the end makes it one of the things that made me love watching so much. They are a dream team - an ideal partnership. Think of any romance in this drama as growing love and respect more than cute moments, although there are a few replay-worthy classic romance scenes. Rounding out the leads is Ok Taec Yeon who is also brilliant and I was surprised I loved him so much in this. Is this a love triangle situation? In many ways yes, but definitely not in the way you probably expect. This is definitely a breakout role for him. Just the way he would call Ms. Hong ""Sunbae"" is an example of the subtle things that he did so well. All three of these characters have moments that are over the top ridiculous, super intense, as well as more intimate and emotional, and they each showed so much range. I was extremely impressed with all 3.

The rest of the cast is equally amazing. Again, many of these characters are super over the top but they still manage to add layers to make them feel care-worthy and relatable and not just characters to REALLY hate or comic filler. The villains are satisfyingly and even frighteningly evil. The heroes are unexpected and hilarious (think Kung Fu Hustle). I wish I could give every single character specific praise but that would lead to spoilers and the less you know when watching the better. This cast has absolutely no weak links. Not one.

That brings me to the writing and directing which I applaud for keeping me excited for every single episode. 20 episodes later, with each episode over an hour-long, I still wasn't ready for it to end. Normally I'm not that interested in business corruption plots but because it was so character-driven I couldn't help but care. There was a perfect balance of scenes that made me cry and laugh and gasp. The ending was also well done and so satisfying without making things too happy or too depressing. If you're looking for a realistic story just remember this is campy as much as it's suspenseful so some scenes are unbelievable in the most entertaining way. There are tropes but they are done so well it reminds me why those tropes work. The pace made every episode fly by. The cliffhangers at the end of each episode made the time until the next episode drag. I was anticipating how certain characters would get what they deserved and I loved how creative the revenge was. Those who get to just binge it all now are super lucky. Speaking of binging...

Would I watch this again? I already did. lol. Once I got super hooked I decided to rewatch older episodes during the week while waiting for the new ones. Yes, I was that obsessed. Yes, It was still good the second time, and some moments were even better when already knowing what was to come. I can see myself easily watching this multiple times.

I thought the soundtrack complemented this drama perfectly too. Whether pumping up the action sequences or the sweet and sentimental ""Is this love"" song or the music to end each cliffhanger or the monks' wedding song... I thought the music always worked so well with the story and was enjoyable but never too distracting.

My only complaint, and it's a minor one, are the ridiculous product placements. The show is so campy that it almost felt like a wink to the audience, but there really are so many obvious product spotlight moments. I say this even as I purposely made myself a cup of maxim coffee (yes the yellow packet) to watch the finale. Lol. I also had Makgeolli several times while watching. Con-grat-u-laaaaa-tions, they totally got me!

Overall, this is the most fun drama I've watched in a loooooong time. Please note that when I say fun I don't necessarily mean cute or light but rather exciting and thrilling. At its core, this is still very much a revenge thriller with lots of violence, action, and brutal deaths. If you're squeamish the violence is never too gratuitous but it isn't tame either. Also, If you like action and fight scenes there are lots. Even what looked like a nod to Bruce Lee that I appreciated.

Three strong themes that impacted me...
1. It takes a devil to take on a devil.
2. Things are rarely what they seem to be on the surface.
3. The importance of family.

The last part really got to me. I caught on pretty early that a show focused on a Mafia anti-hero would probably be about family but this theme, even in its silliest moments, really touched me. If you can handle rooting for a not-so-good guy, and the violence (which isn't too excessive but definitely the kind you should expect from a Mafia revenge story) this is a must-see drama. Without a doubt, ""Vincenzo"" is one of my new drama favorite dramas of all time. I think I even love corn salad after watching this! ""Vicenzo"" definitely lives up to the hype. I would be extra hyped if there were plans for a 2nd season, but even though I already miss it, and the ending certainly leaves room for one, that's probably overkill and I would also hate to ruin such a good thing. As it stands now this is a drama that ends on a high entertainment note and gets a standing ovation and multiple ""Bravos"" from me!

A Unique Watching Experience
I started watching ""Vincenzo"" when only 6 episodes were out, and I believe the weekly wait for new content helped raise my opinion of this drama. The build-up towards a new episode grew my excitement, and I was fully engaged in the story.

""Vincenzo"" started out strong - the vineyard scene and the accompanying classical music (which is still my favourite one from the whole OST) gave a good taste of what the series is going to be like - dramatic, pompous, shocking, humorous and dark. The production was truly high-quality - the camera work, the lighting, the cinematography, the sets - everything combined made ""Vincenzo"" seem refined and revolutionary.

Of course, the 180 change happened rather quickly, but unlike many other viewers, I loved it. The Geumga Plaza tenants were a charming cast of characters, and our main hero got duality - Vincenzo was very good at winning and intimidating others, but he was also awkward and a fish out of water in Korea. However, the heart of the drama for me was the FL Cha Young. Her manners, the way she talked and walked, how loud she was - we rarely see such women on screen. She was truly powerful and dynamic, and it's a damn shame that the show-runners decided to abandon her development when they started focusing on Han Seo's story. There was a place for both of them.

The story was well-developed, too. I never saw the twists coming, but they were amazing and thought-out, and I loved seeing our ""heroes"" triumph over the villains time and time again - it made sense because they were both competent and also it was plain entertaining. Like, yes, finally, I get to enjoy some sort of satisfaction every episode. Sadly, after the one-week hiatus, it seemed like a dreadful rewrite happened.

Let's get the worst one out of the way: Cha Young was basically benched for the last 4 episodes, and especially during the finale. This was her time to shine! She spent 16 episodes letting Vincenzo plan and execute everything! Her contribution to the final fight was absolutely zero, Han Seo did more in his condition :).

Episode 20 felt really out of touch with the rest of the story. Compared to the wonderful sequence of events in episodes 9-12 (all of them I rated 10/10) this was a big ~meeeh. Vincenzo left, as expected, for Malta. But the fact that he has no intentions of returning, even though he wanted to get the gold and retire (neither of these plot points was followed through), and instead he chooses to become the new Italian boss of the Cassano family??? I am convinced this was added last minute because angst is a requirement for a ""sensible"" ending. You had A PIGEON save the hero from the mafia, I think you can have him secretly fly back to Korea on a Bye-Bye Balloon.

Anyway, 9.5 is for the good memories, emotions and everything else I got in 19 episodes of this show. Oh, and for all the deaths of villains in the finale :))) I enjoyed watching them immensely.

To each their own, I suppose
Vincenzo is the type of drama that just isn’t for everyone. Funny story - I wasn’t actually going to watch this drama for a long while despite hearing amazing things about it on the internet (I’m not very interested in law/crime/mystery dramas), but I used that fancy new “watch something” button on Netflix, and it started playing Vincenzo. So I guess I just continued watching it after that. Despite being better than the other primarily law and crime focused dramas I watched previously, I ran into the same problem with Vincenzo that I had with all the other dramas of its genre. Because so much of the story is action-packed and has to be focused on the plot, the character development fell to the sidelines as usual. I’m the type of person who watches dramas more for the characters rather than the plot itself, which is why I rarely enjoy this genre. My reasoning is that if I don’t care about the characters, then I don’t really care about what happens to them either. Now, that is not to say I didn’t shed a tear while watching this drama - I totally did. I just believe I would have enjoyed Vincenzo a lot more had it been more character than action focused (not the drama’s fault - mine). On top of that, I never really got into the humor of this drama (okay fine, it was pretty funny a few times) nor did I appreciate the drama’s slow pace. I watched the majority of Vincenzo at 2x speed (never doubt my subtitle reading skills lmao) and struggled to remain focused watching the drama at its regular pace. I honestly really expected more from the drama’s action part of the plot, since it was so dominant in this drama. Instead, I got cliche scenes where the characters somehow couldn’t kill each other despite the thousands of chances they had to do so. There were quite a few cliche action sequences and the plot itself felt repetitive and a bit all over the place, especially toward the end. Vincenzo himself also felt unrealistically perfect with his ability to take down a group of 20 guards with nothing but his bare fists. All in all, it’s generally hard to impress me with a good action drama, but Vincenzo did leave me with a pretty good impression despite the shortcomings. I actually grew to like the characters and really appreciated the amazing cinematography and music. I can definitely see why someone would enjoy this type of drama - it just wasn’t entirely for me. Side note - why are we mad at the ending? I literally thought it was just fine.

Entertaining and fun to watch!
I enjoyed the drama quite a bit and give it a solid 8. I definitely think people should watch it. There were lots of things to love about it: the acting/cast, humor, action/fighting scenes, and thrilling main plot was fantastic.

However, I did detract some stars as there were a few things I would change. I think the beginning and middle was stronger than the end, as around episode 16 the pacing and side plots/characters went from tight and potent to loose and spaghetti like which detracted from the satisfying end. I felt like instead of fleshing out so many new pointless side characters (like the campaign guy towards the end) that it should have fleshed out already involved characters more and tied up some of the previous loose ends from earlier episodes in a neater way instead of just in the last episode during that montage to show that time had passed. It also seemed like the female main character disappeared in the last couple of episodes until the climax and was instead turned into a plot device. It was like the writer didn't want her character to know all of what VC did as they didn't make her character able to condone that level of revenge.

Also, I thought the villain reveal wasn't that iconic and was super obvious from the beginning and I thought was meant to be obvious for the audience as they didn't try to mask it at all and revealed it fairly early on in addition to the obvious clues. I was kind of hoping that a different character (the one related to the villain) was the true villain all along and was going to unusual suspects us at the end, I was disappointed that wasn't the case.

Though as I said, the show overall is really great, and the characters are unique and fun to watch. Give it a shot!

The best dumb fun I have ever had
The second I saw the trailer I knew, that I would love this series. And I do, I honestly and truly love Vincenzo. It's been a while since I have had this much fun with a drama. But I am not going to sit here and pretend like this isn't an incredibly dumb show.

Vincenzo is an experience that is kind of hard to put into words. At first, I had problems connecting with this drama. I wasn't sure what to make of it. The first few scenes promised a high-stake thriller with a sinister feel. Then it suddenly turned into an off-beat comedy just like two scenes later. But Vincenzo is both of these things and neither. It's too gory to be a comedy and way too silly to be a genuine action thriller. The tone of this show is all over the place. But weirdly enough it sort of works.
As I fell in love with the quirky cast of this drama, I caught myself forgiving all of Vinceno's shortcomings. Those shortcomings include: A completely nonsensical plot with countless plotholes, cheesy dialogue, an overpowered lead, rushed plotlines, and confusing character arcs. This might all sound harsh but all my critique doesn't change the fact that I was incredibly entertained throughout the entire series. At times I laughed at the show, at times I laughed with it, but in the end, I always laughed, so who am I to complain.

Yes, this show has some fundamental problems. I have said before that it is riddled with plot holes but a big one is Vincenzo himself. The show is so scared of letting Vincezos fail at anything, that the incredibly high-stake premise starts to feel a bit pointless at some points because you always know that Vincenzo has the upper hand anyway. All attempts by our villains to bring him down get destroyed, oftentimes in the very same episode or even just ten minutes later. That makes Vincenzo feel less and less like an actual character and more like a Mafia version of Superman, a hyper-competent, invincible, supernatural being, everyone, and I mean absolutely everyone in the show, is in love with (the homo-eroticism in this drama is undeniable). I also wish we could have seen more bad-ass Hong Cha-young moments. She's supposed to be this super successful smart lawyer but 80% of the time, Vincenzo does all the work . I know that it's just one of the tropes that come with a Korean romance drama but watching her having to get saved by him time and time again did get a bit old.
While I love this huge and entertaining cast, it did feel like this show bit off a bit more than it could chew, which honestly is kind of amazing because it is so long and it still didn't really get the chance to develop each character. Some plot-lines here did feel a bit rushed as a result of that. This sadly also was the case with the romance between the two leads, which is a shame because I think they definitely had chemistry. I felt like their dynamic could have been explored more but unfortunately, the drama had more than enough on its plate already.

Still, while this show does get pretty dumb, there is a lot I sincerely like about it. I think the villain in this, while he is comically evil, is super fun and you can't say that the actor didn't give it his all. His over-acting is part of the charm here, to be honest. I thought Choi Myung-he was also a really fascinating, three-dimensional character and I enjoyed every scene with her. I also love a good redemption arc and a lovable himbo and this show offered both in one. The cast in general was really fun and different and there were many lovable characters to root for. The last few episodes were especially satisfying to watch and the finale didn't let me down either. While I have argued that Vincenzo's character was ridiculously overpowered, it would be a lie if I claimed I didn't love just watching him toy with the bad guys. And last but not least, I have never really gotten Korean humor, but in this show most of the time it worked for me. Others referring to Vincenzo as ""corn salad"" instead of consigliere will always crack me up.
While remarkable cinematography or editing isn't the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this show, it still looks pretty cool and most shots get the point across while looking stylish, without feeling too showoff-y. The editing often adds to the humor and quirkiness of the show and the action scenes are also very well-cut.
The actors were great, of course. Vincenzo's actor really did try his best with his Italian lines so I gotta give credit where credit's due. I have already mentioned the villain's performance but his acting especially stood out to me and I just loved watching everything he did, no matter how insane it was.
I should probably say something about the OST as well but I honestly can't remember a single song from this show so I assume it was neither particularly great nor bad.

After I finished this drama I just sat down and asked myself: ""Would I recommend this show?"". And the answer is kind of. But you need to know what you're getting into. Don't come to Vincenzo and expect any realism. Don't expect anything believable or particularly meaningful from this show, otherwise, you will be disappointed. Just embrace it for its wackiness. Vincenzo promises an absolutely insane premise. And it delivers. The setup is insane. The characters are insane. The villain especially is insane. Everything about it is so over-the-top and off-beat, I don't think it's possible to not have at least a tiny bit of fun with this. But you gotta meet the show where it's at. Don't question anything. I am serious. Turn your brain off for those 20 episodes or your head will hurt.

I enjoyed Vincenzo the most when it leaned into its insanity. I couldn't really bring myself to care about all the times it tried to be depressing or deep. I had the most fun when it was just trying to entertain.
I feel like oftentimes films and TV shows are so dead-set on being edgy and clever, that they forget to be fun. Sometimes, after a long sad day, I don't want to see something witty and award-winning. I don't want to be out-smarted. I want to watch a Korean man try really hard to convince me that he knows Italian. I don't like that we measure art by how contrived it is. There's a time and space for dark, realistic, gritty stuff, obviously, but there should also be a time and place for a silly action show like this.

Han Seo's character development
The movie was great to watch especially Han Seo's character development. Even though he was evil at the beginning as the story progressed you get to understand how he was the way he is. Deep down he just wanted a family (which i think he never experienced because of his psychopath brother), friends, someone to deepened on and care about him. In conclusion I think he was just a child force to grow up and abused by his family to take up responsibility he did not like. I think some people might relate to his character. Even though it was almost certain he will die i hoped he would have lived the life he wanted. People saying Han Seo was evil, just no, NO one in the story was innocent. Each character had something to achieve leading them to use any means and ways to achieve them. The story i personally love was Han Seo and Vincenzo's bromance even though it was short. The story was good, actors great and everything else was good. I will definitely recommend you to watch it.

Definitely unique
I just finished Vincenzo and going in, I definitely didn't know what I was getting myself into. This drama, for one, is a dark comedy and I didn't even realize that until I started watching. It's a mixture of seriousness with over the top comedy to balance it out. I really liked the cinematography and of course, the visuals of Song Joong Ki and Ok Taec Yeon. Initially, I didn't like Hong Cha Young but she grew on me, she was a fierce independent woman with so much sass and attitude, I loved it! The only about this drama is that it ran long and it had so much to set up so it actually took me a while to get through these episodes. Even though it was entertaining, it didn't hold my attention so much that I would have to binge every episode. I found myself pausing a lot and just doing other stuff. Overall, it's a good, entertaining watch and Song Joong Ki was absolutely gorgeous in it but definitely not one of my top favorite dramas.

An epic kdrama unlike any other! Mix of comedy, courtroom drama, suspense and excitement!
To start off, Vincenzo was definitely not what I'd expected it to be. When u google 'Vincenzo', the first thing that comes up is 'Dark Comedy' as its genre. Let me be very clear; Vincenzo is not dark comedy.
While dark comedy would mean subtle hints of comedy within a serious plot (more like Breaking bad or Suits), Vincenzo is more like Comedy + Dark / serious plot, which means sometimes you will find extremely serious plot, while other times it will be very comedic in nature. It is a clear mix of both genres, and sometimes you might also find other genres like tragedy, suspence, romance etc. Also, it is nothing like the Godfather (if you are expecting it after reading the word mafia), it is more of a courtroom drama in my opinion (barring a few episodes). However, that does not change the fact that it's ABSOLUTELY ENTERTAINING!!

I will agree to what most reviews state that this is unlike any other kdrama out there. From its cinematography, to the actors and the music (OMG THE MUSIC!) everything is phenomenal. Ofcourse it does have the usual tropes, but it doesn't drag on it too much, and most of it gets a satisfactory end. And it definitely has some jaw dropping moments that will take you by surprise and leave u gasping!

My only disappointment was the main villain's role.(DISCLAIMER: LIGHT SPOILERS)
When it started off, I was absolutely in love with how the villan was being plotted out; from the grand reveal, to his background story.. everything seemed perfect to the point that I was convinced he would be my favourite villan of all time! However, sadly it didn't live upto my expectations in the later episodes. I was expecting a very strong villan, who wasn't just a psychopath, but a mastermind too. However, he eventually lost that luster. There were no more mind games or exciting moves from his side, it was just Vincenzo stealing the spotlight.

Apart from that however, Vincenzo is an absolute treat. The acting is amazing, the drama is intense and the comedy although silly, will give you a good laugh. For anyone who is looking out for a good quality drama, and doesn't mind a mix of all genres, Vincenzo is highly recommended!

P.S. : First 3 episodes are very slow, but don't drop it there. Wait till the end of episode 4 and trust me, you will keep watching! ;)

Il cattivo perfetto (Vincenzo Cassano)
I have just loved the show. Some People may not like it because of the ending . But I think those who didn't like it they didn't understand the meaning. It was supposed to end like this. It's not a romantic drama that can satisfy the mind of romantic weeb . I personally enjoyed the drama very much. How can you not love this drama ! I enjoyed the death of Choi Myung Hee more than Jang Han-Seok. Yes you can say some the parts were unnecessary . But come on that is it's drama. The character development and the story build up was really enjoyable. In the end I have to say it will take quite some time to find something like this masterpiece .

DEF RECOMMEND TO WATCH! THIS DRAMA IS AMAZING
When this drama was released I was always up and watching no matter what time it was. Dark-comedy might not be the ideal genre for some people but I believe that this drama will change all their minds. The romance in Vincenzo isn't too deep and cringy but at the same time it isn't way too shallow and unrealistic. Plus, can I mention that Song Joong-ki is hotter and cuter than EVER in this drama? His mafia wear and the hilarious moments when he first arrives in Korea are so classy and funny. Lots of people say that fan reviews and the ratings are all bought and people were paid to write these good reviews, but in my opinion, there really isn't a point in doing that since its good enough for people who weren't paid to do that already. I mean, look at me. Anyways, I really recommend Vincenzo as a drama to watch and I guarantee that once you start watching you won't be able to stop. All your studies and classes won't be as important as watching Vincenzo. I promise that you will absolutely fall in LOVE with this drama. Whether you have a bad impression on Song Joong-ki (that's impossible but what if?) or any of the other characters this drama will totally melt your heart and change your opinion. What are you waiting for? Go log onto your Netflix right now and start Vincenzo!

Every bite. Same taste.
Food analogy: Well garnished Jajjangmyeon, where every slurp is equal. From start to end, (might not like the first bite due to improper mixing, thats upto ur taste)

I have a problem within myself, i tend to be
disappointed with endings. If we notice the flow of energy, they didn't leave us on high...showing Vincenzo n Hong cha young's kids or leave us on low, showing the yearning to meet Vincenzo.. It left us on a neutral note, Showing his life will go on and we can't guess how it will be. So, I couldn't ask for more.

Despite having first 3 slow episode, this drama will keep you hooked and at the edge of your seat. Bored in lockdown? Watch Vincenzo. Now that it is complete you can binge and forget about ur problems for a day or two.

Vincenzo -- Another TvN drama that doesn't really land the ending
Hi everyone,
This is my first kdrama review on this site, so please be nice!
Vincenzo is the kind of drama that I find to be a pattern with TvN shows -- it promises a lot but it doesn't deliver what it says it will. The writer does a great job of building the hype, but kills it on their own with a few mistakes. I'd like to emphasize that these weren't a dealbreaker for me necessarily since I finished the entire series, but they did definitely make the show a drag.

Downsides to this Drama: (Only 3 y'all, don't wanna bore you! ?)
[1] The rich man with an infinite amount of money
A classic K-drama stereotype. The heroine in need of money and the hot, rich guy who has a bottomless bank account and they're madly in love. This is one of those tropes that is funny at first because of how ridiculous it is, but in Vincenzo, it's pretty much the driving force behind the plot. In almost every episode, Vincenzo is showing off his wealth and yes the actor does make it look cool at first, it gets boring to watch towards the end. Love the actor, not a fan of this character.

[2] Villians that never change their evil-doing patterns
This is a less commonly seen trope in kdramas, which I normally find exciting and fun. The bad guy tries something, he fails in front of the hero, so he comes up with something even more sinister that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In Vincenzo, there's an attempt to do that but it often falls short. Vincenzo gives the villian a run for his money, something pretty cool to watch, but not as fun when a single character is basically driving the plot alone.

[3] Romance is subtext
Now, I know I'll get some bad rep for this one. Yes, I know the main point of this show isn't romance, but I mean, the writer was being rather stingy with his romantic moments here. I mean, even a little bit more would've been good by me. It's really cute in some parts, but so many things get left unsaid that you just keep wishing they'd added a little more to the dialouge in the emotional scenes. Not the worst, but I'll live.

Upsides to this Drama:
[1] Side characters that live in your head rent free.
This show is one of those where you get attached to the side characters without meaning to. You laugh more when they're on screen, and you really want to see them get their happy ending. The writer does a great job at creating this fuzzy feeling of family among people who really couldn't be more different. Awesome.

[2] No goody-two-shoes good guys here.
Vincenzo isn't afraid to break some rules, and neither is Chae-young. They're tough, they play dirty when they know they're going to lose, but they do it with elegance. Not to mention, a badass power couple fighting crime together? Sign me up!

[3] Revenge is a dish best served cold.
Every villian in this show gets what they deserve twofold, part of a somewhat gruesome but also weirdly satisfying ending. It's a bit much, but at the same time fits the vibe of the show. It'll surprise you for sure, I know it surprised me.

Overall:
Vincenzo is definitely a show with its flaws, but I wouldn't say it's an awful one so it's a 7/10 from me. The music gets a 7, the acting gets an 8 (because of the good chemistry). If you're okay with some very in-your-face and over the top cliches, like rich-man-with-infinite-amount-of-money, go right ahead. Just let yourself laugh it off, even when the show's being a bit much. It's not the most serious show, but it will make a statement. That being said, I'm more of a romance woman myself, so rewatch value is gotta be a 6/10 for me.

Hope this helps someone! Have a great day y'all.

VINCENZO or Un diavolo scaccia l'altro
""Un diavolo scaccia l'altro""

This is the best way to describe this amazing dark anti hero drama with writer Park Jae Bum emblematic dark humor that makes it so deliciously good and witty....
Start by saying that this became my favorite drama of Song Joong Ki and that he really gave life and soul to Vincenzo, that i can see no other than him play him...
Now into the story,it doesn't shy from the ugly and evil side of humans and shows us what greed does to one...Also doesn't shy from great villians in this case Prosecutor turned Lawyer Choi Myung Hee (Kim Yeo Jin) who we could very much say was the true evil of this story and Jang Jun Woo (Taec) who is a more typical villain that still has it's layers...Like mentioned,i truly consider Choi Myung Hee as the true villain of our story as every action were of her own free will and i like that the writer didn't try to excuse her behaviour with the usual tragic past ,she was evil because she choosed it.

This show gave us a anti hero who was smart,elegant,creative,who had his own principales and beliefs and abided by them while he also was a lonely soul who was tormented by his own demons and actions. You will still root for Vincenzo from start to end and even love him as you could laugh a minute and be scared the next.But be aware,Vincenzo already has a lot of fans and a fanclub ""Oh My Consigliere"" so do join in, the President aka Ahn Ki Seok more than sure will welcome you!

This is why I like Vincenzo. It is funny but dark, it is full of satire & sarcasm, it is full of reality and poetic justice. It is heavy at times, light on the other. The writing is very clever. The cast has been superb.
The BGM's and Italian/opera-inspired music mixed well in each scene meant to elevate it.

This is a story from the get go about morally grey people were some are worse than others yet still sprinkled with kindness even among it showing the effect of one fighting in what he believes and for those he cares.
Must say that the Director really knows how to keep one on the edge and wanting more with it's clifhangers

A must kdrama to watch
From the beginning i loved this drama and till the end.

A good storyline ,very well write, i liked each aspect . (especially mafia thing)

The main character was a interesting, different from the mostly characters. A character who was played by SONG JOON KI who was perfect for this character. It a must watch for his visual also.

JEON YEO BIN is also a excelent actress she played her character very well. I discover her in this drama and i am happy that i did it, i am very interesed in her future works.(i recommend to watch night in paradise)

All the cast is very good actors , especially the four(OK TAEC YEON, KIM YEO JIN , JO HAN CHUL , KWAK DONG YEON)
The last thing i want to say that i recommand you to watch that drama without hesitation.
I LOVE VINCHA!! ITS THE PERFECT COUPLE I HAVE SEEN IN A DRAMA IN MY LIFE.
ALL the episode was make you to want to came weekend early to see what will happen.

Must watch
Love this drama so far. The cast we’re a perfect fit. Who doesn’t love a drama with action, suspense, comedy and I sense some romance on the horizon. I read a comment on a platform that said the series was a little dark but who doesn’t like a drama that pops from the start. From when he was in Italy to when he arrived in Korea. I was a little disappointed he didn’t get revenge with the guys, who robed him when he first landed but they did give him an idea to play in another episode. I hope there is a second season. Now i can say I am a fan of Soon Joon-Ki and John Yeo-been. I really like Ann Gi-Seok, he was hilarious but you still took him serious. I just wished he could fight that would be a added plus.

Another huge plus is all the tenants collaborated and brought their own talent to the table and shined. Lastly, everyone loves a mafia story. And in this case a very cunning, creative, handsome and cocky when needed mafia lawyer.

What i wasn’t a fan of how they killed her father, then how he lost is mom. Granted she was on her death bed but that was too much.

This review may contain spoilers
this is my 1. drama this year
yes this contains spoilers so read with your own caution
and this is a long rant hahaha i love this sm

there's so much i can say about this drama but i don't have all that much time to tell EVERYTHING

this was so perfect
the only minus was the amount of slow motion used, they could've made the episodes
a bit shorter... the length is the only thing holding me back from rewatching and rewatching it

- i like how there was a bit of romance but it was not the main part of the series

- the action scenes are everything, they are so well made

- and the humor is spectacular hahaha

- it was so good that i even watched it with my dad (it was his first kdrama and he liked it)

- this drama has a good teaching: ""only the evil can beat the evil"" as vincenzo in the drama refers himself as a scumbag who cleans other scumbags.

- chayoung is portrayed as literally the perfect image i have of a strong woman.

the jang brothers are literally my fav characters in this:
1. jang hanseok, i love me a hot psychopath (IN DRAMAS NOT IRL PLEASE), yes please.

also i love taecyeon sm. he did SUCH A GOOD JOB acting as a psychopath. i will NEVER shut up about how well he portrayed jang hanseok. because that's how psychopaths are, well mannered and seem normal on the outside but on the inside they can be real monsters.

do i even need to explain, during the first eps i already fell in love with the
cute intern junwoo and his quirky personality and random uses of english, we stan
(tbh i saw a edit of him and it kinda spoiled me but i didn't see much of the scenes of him being crazy but enough to realise he was the bad guy and basically i kinda
started watching it just because of him... yes i'm shameless)

the hockey stick scene,,, the scene where he choked hanseo,,, i literally watched those(and the others,, all the crazy scenes)while my heart was beating fast and i was in shock
and also i automatically whispered ""he's so hot""WHEN HE WAS BEATING A PERSON TO
DEATH WITH A HOCKEY STICK
i am broken please help me

2. jang hanseo had such good character developement and he deserved so much better,,,
i literally cried my eyes out when i first watched the last eps
only during the time i was rewatching i realised the small bits about his character that made
me so in love
i could see he really cared for vincenzo and saw him as his real brother
he had gone through a lot of abuse and suffered so much during his life, he was willing to

sacrifice himself to save vincenzo and chayoung
and thus he finally died, in the arms of his abuser
i'm left wondering if his dad had just gotten help for him and reported hanseok for his crimes (uh yeah killing his freaking classmates) could've he lived a happy life?

still he died as a hero and he made it as my favorite character in the whole series. and he stole my heart<3 hanseo best boi

I thought the first half was uneven and could be substantially cut, making a 16 ep series. I thought the second half was as good as any Korean series. I stayed with it because of the fabulous cast—terrific on all levels—and was rewarded. The ending was satisfying even if graphic, but hey, don’t mess with a mobster’s mom, you twits. I loved the sweet pigeon bromance and pigeon onslaught, and the masterful reverse image of the raven. That was revoltingly satisfying as well. And yes there is even romance and a great kiss, too. All in all, Vincenzo is worth the time spent.

it could have been so much more than the convoluted mess we got
this drama could have been so good if everything was like the first 15 minutes. The tone and atmopshere is very uneven, jumping to somewhat dark to lame slapstick comedy (that feels a tad too juvenile at times). Here's the thing, I don't give af about the tenants of the building, and their over the top acting pisses me off lmao just throw them all away. Everyone is raving about the chemistry, but the characters aren't developed enough for the relationship to really feel meaningful. I mean I still got to episode 15 and will still keep watching for those little bits of potential I can see that are hidden under layers of unnecessary comedic filler. I think the ml carried this lmao, he was impeccable and I would have been fine if he just yeeted out of Korea and spent the whole drama in Italy cuz that's where shit goes down. Also did I mention he was hot? Because that's also a huge reason I keep watching. I guess a dark noir mafia drama was too much to ask for huh. Basically, like dude should kick ass but he doesn't which pisses me off

OMG EP 16 ROCKED. DUDE this is the scene I have been waiting for dude. OMLOMLLMOMLL. Serious Kaz Brekker vibes and I'm loving it. Okay, the ending was lit and dark, As the show went on, I think I begrudging accepted that this juvenile exaggerated comedy is here to stay (unfortunately), doesn't mean I have to like it though! I remained disinterested in the tenants' storyline to the end. I would have liked to see Vincenzo been challenged more, because he basically never is, and plus that cliche move of making Hong Chayeong a damsel in distress was just not the move bro.

I'm very grateful they didn't shy away from vincenzo's moral greyness though, and didn't try to reform him, so there's that. Also, most people liked Hanseo, I personally find him a bit one-dimensional. Or mb I just don't dig his character lol, Idk anymore. Honestly I feel like there was weak characterization all around, and I didn't feel the chemistry between Vincenzo and Chayeong at all, especially near the end. Ughhh, there's this weird exaggerated tone that the drama has that just throws the whole thing off, which makes the drama feel very cartoony (sitcom-esque), and undermines the somber tone and themes they are trying to establish. It really doesn't mesh well.

I think I can sum this whole drama to two words: wasted potential. Like Peaky blinders was fab can we have more of that in kdramas? Basically, this drama is trying to be two things: a lame ass comedy and an edgy mafia thriller, and fails miserably at both. I mean, I did tune in for this drama each week, so I guess that's sometthing (they are really good with cliffhangers lol, like the whole episode will be filler and in the last 5 mins, something interesting happens and you're like oh shit i need to pay attention now). This is the first k drama I've watched as it aired, and I must say, it's great cuz I haven't lost any sleep over this, on the bright side.

The plot
Netflix's latest k-drama ‘Vincenzo’ takes the viewer on a tumultuous ride from the first episode of Italian mafia games to later episodes of dark undercurrents of South Korea’s own real estate mafia. Adopted into the Cassano family, our k-drama lead Song Joong-ki is a formidable lawyer with a bloody past & a dormant but deviant streak of ruthlessness. Repurcussions of family wars in Italy see Vincenzo heading over to his home country where he gets entangled with a snarky law firm and a rag-tag bunch of small business owners fighting to save, of all things…a mall. 'Vincenzo' starts off on a dark note but quickly dovetails into comic-thriller-meets-revenge-drama. Adding to the multiple plot lines, Vincenzo Cassano has his own “mission” - to find his gold.

What works?
'Vincenzo' revels in startling all k-drama enthusiasts with its slick shots, tight storytelling and visionary casting. The series starts off with glimpses into our dark hero’s journey back to his motherland while subtly weaving in each of Geumga Plaza’s characters until they form the black-suit-and-sunglasses clad “Cassano family” halfway through the series. Jeon Yeo-bin shines as Vincenzo Cassano's partner-in-crime, and her evolution from an amoral lawyer to a fighter for justice ticks all the right boxes.

Song Joong-Ki as the consigliere-turned-saviour is mesmerising to watch. As Vincenzo Cassano, Song Joong-Ki effortlessly showcases the anti-hero, a far cry from his cute & loveable acts in the wildly popular k-drama classics 'Descendents of the Sun' & 'Sungkyunkwan Scandal'. Ok Taecyeon’s descent into darkness is deliciously unexpected, and somewhere along the way the viewer can be forgiven for completely forgetting Ok Taecyeon’s winsome portrayal in ‘Hey Ghost, Let's Fight’! The budding bromance between Vincenzo Cassano and Jang Han Seo is also heartwarming to watch.

What doesn’t work?
Song Joong-Ki aka Vincenzo Cassano showcasing his “human” side, including the comic touch of his relationship with the pigeon Ansagi occasionally dents the black aura of an Italian-returned mafia leader. The soundtrack though pleasant, becomes predictably repetitive invoking a mismatched sense of déjà vu from the previous episodes of the series. There’s also a blatant disregard for the legal system; court proceedings & lawyer arguments look frivolous, demoting the overall gravity of the plot line. This seems almost intentional, the screenwriters exercising their creative license by showcasing a flexible judicial system. Barring this particular storytelling ploy, for the most parts, 'Vincenzo' is quite grounded as k-dramas go.

Last thoughts and verdict
In a nutshell, ‘Vincenzo’ doesn’t follow k-dramas’ well-known tropes. The writing is fairly “real” while twists & turns are logically explained away. As the viewer sinks further into the series, each character’s dealings & their importance to Vincenzo Cassano is effortlessly peeled away. The Netflix series named after Song Joong-Ki’s titular character actually involves all of Geumga Plaza’s residents. 'Vincenzo' is a story of revenge, slow-burn romance and a smidge of gang violence. Stunning visuals, top-notch production and a stellar cast only make this a captivating watch.

JUST WOW. Cannot get over this show and it's characters and mature romance!!!!
Acting 10/10: This is only the second Song Joong Ki drama I've seen. But Song Joong Ki's character is so beautifully still in this show, he never fidgets, never gets startled, never loses control of his body movements, and it's a very strong character mentally as well. It's an absolute delight to watch all the episodes again and notice minute changes in his expression to the events around him, and he really manages to exude a natural intelligence and air of authority. His character gradually learns to love, and also accept that he is worthy of receiving love, and his actions show that clearly towards the end. In the beginning he is arrogant and distant without being mean in any way, and towards the end he is loving and caring without being suffocating in every way. The perfect character development. Also his deep voice is so hypnotic at many points of time, I'm convinced that's the main reason I unexpectedly loved his character from start to finish. I have become a fan of Song Joong Ki's acting after this show.

Jeon Yeo Been, MY QUEEN, is the BEST female character ever written, ever performed, ever shown on screen. She is fiery, sassy, bright, sexy, logical, brave, quick-witted, savage, sharp tongued, and beautiful beyond compare. She matches wit with everyone around her, is funny as all hell, her voice is SO hot. She never hesitates to express what she's feeling, and loves her dad despite what happened in her past. She is protective of those around her, and willing to go to any length to achieve her goals. I am IN LOVE with Hong Cha Young and Jeon Yeo Been and this is the main reason I gave the show a 10/10.

Their relationship is EXACTLY what I want in my life. They are best friends, so honest with each other, soft around each other, support each other, communicate so damn well, they TRUST each other, believe in each other, take care of each other without it being toxic in any way, and there is NO malice, NO games, NO hidden agendas anywhere between them. They also tease each other, and never fail to bicker endlessly.
In the simplest sense, it's the PINNACLE of romance, because every single glance and touch and dialogue leaves you to BEG for more. It's pining but also SO satisfying because I cherish every smile, every action that tells everyone around them that they are a unit, a team, a couple. It's realistic because they are both logical and understanding of their circumstances, and you can clearly see the struggle they both have with their feelings, one wants to love but is afraid that the other person has to leave, the other wants to love but is afraid he will have to leave.
The ending was quite satisfactory according to me.

Other factors I want to note:
Cinematography 10/10 Just WOW. The fashion, the shots, the bars/cafes they meet in, all beautiful.
OST 10/10 I have been listening to the ost on repeat even while working, just IN LOVE with it.
Story 9/10 The zig-zag storyline was great to watch, but could've been slightly better if less background character involvement was there.
Cast 10/10 Each and every single actor did their best, and their chemistry was off the charts, insanely good.
Background characters 10/10 Most of the side-characters are interesting and fun to watch. Villains did an awesome job.
Neo-Noir vibe was on POINT. Loved the ode to black and white gangster films, I think SJK nailed that part too.

OVERALL 10/10. I have already seen this show two times.

Sooooo freakin good
Let me start off by saying the writers and actors for Vincenzo worked their a$$# off!! Such a good story! To sum it up in a few words: If The Godfather had a baby with a k-drama, it would be christened Vincenzo. With this show, you get all the action, crime, and violence of a typical mobster film mixed with the outrageous humor of a romance drama.

Each episode had me on my seat..Keep in mind, the first 1-4 episodes are a bit slow while they set up the story, background, characters etc. Be patient. It gets better! This show is definitely worth the watch with unexpected plot twists waiting on every corner.

Side note: I was very impressed by the quality and range of acting by Song Joong-ki and Ok Taecyeon. All of the actors did a fine job, but I was struck by their performances the most. I won’t give away any spoilers, but I would highly suggest you give it a watch!!

LITERALLY THE BEST!
this is the first review i ever wrote in my whole life bc this drama deserves it.
if you are reading this, this is your official confirmation to watch this. you will NOT regret it. for me the 1st half of the 1st episode had me intrigued and then it go hard to watch for the 2nd and most of ep 3, but near the end of ep 3 it got literally amazing and started picking up.

it has absolutely everything, a bad ass male lead(my fave type) , a great fl, and interesting villain, plotwists with a bit of romance, comedy and AMAZING hyped up fight scenes. you will not regret i promise, and i am extremely picky with dramas an tv shows i watch. you will smile so hard at some scenes and have tears in the others. the visuals to OMG are fabulous. i usually do not care about OSTs but oh my god i absolutely love the music, especially the Italian mafia instrumental music during serious scenes.

there is a hole in my heart now that this show is finished :((
the only thing i is is that the ending was more solid, but the ending is still very good.

Glamorous to a fault
Extremely good looking lawyers, fancy cars, shady people, cheesy dialogue against a hue of dramatic music - no this isn't the American show Suits. This is however, a show that favours style over substance. That perhaps should have been clear to me when I saw it was rated 15, meaning the dialogue and action scenes would sometimes be a little more embellished than necessary. Quite often I was cringing whilst watching some scenes. There's a lack of suspense and tension because our lead protagonist, by being a member of the Italian mafia, is endowed with a level of skill and access to fortune that makes you believe he can overcome problems in any scene by the end of that scene. The show rarely builds up conflicts that aren't resolved within that immediate episode. Every bit of tension is quickly fixed with an unexplained resolution or a random character suddenly displaying a new set of skills that were never hinted at before. As the lead female character remarked during one episode, ""is everyone here a hidden genius?"" it's a funny line that poked at the show's main problems. For all its glamour and sparkle, there was a crippling shallowness to its writing.

The story premise itself is interesting and there are some character dynamics that deserved far greater focus. Every character has some interest family backgrounds and motivations that, had they been fleshed out, would have made the show more enjoyable to watch. When the show did focus on these angles, the storylines were generally of high quality. In particular, episodes 14 to 16 were brilliant because the show knew what to focus on. Mostly this didn't happen for too much of the show. As it was, the show did keep you going through the leading acting duo's chemistry and skills on screen. I thought that Vincenzo Cassano was an excellent character even if it was difficult to believe he was ever in any real danger.

Overall, this show is good to watch but you won't get much out of it. The interesting, and potentially heart-tugging arcs that it had never received enough attention to make the show very memorable.

How to enjoy it? Be blind about the plot writing
Contain indirect minor spoiler.

I was watching this drama when everyone raved about it, so it was prolly more entertaining back then because of the euphoria around this. But still, there were few mistakes in terms of storytelling I can't see past, 1) it tried so hard to convince me that the main villain was THAT bad psychopathic bitch, with all random fun killing + taking trophy from it when he was young, but he was so helpless (most of the times) in front of our protagonists, 2) which led to low stake, it was hard to sympathize with our male protagonist bcs he was doing just fine, except that one time in the hospital, 3) the 5 minutes cliffhanger that would be solved within 10 minutes of the next ep is lazy writing, I hardly cared about the consequences or felt tense after few eps. I finished this for Song Joongki and Song Joongki only, (I lie, I also love Hanseo).

So my advice to all of you who wanna watch this, don't look too much into the storytelling side, especially if you expect intricate character development or mystery. This is, as it said, a dark comedy action. They have great casts, good comedy and action, and wonderful cinematography, simply enjoy the action scene and laugh with the characters.

Bcs, if you love the kind of slapstick comedy, the characters are overall great, even the minor role of Geumga Plaza. They pulled surprises throughout the series which drove few moments into an unpredictable fun one. The connection grew, you would not care for lots of them at first, and our Vincenzo didn't care either, but as time goes, they became a good team who shared foods and jokes. Our villain team was great too, God, I was so SO in love when Myunghee and Hanseok were having a dance after their killing, *chef's kiss*. Also Jang Hanseo, adorable and lovely, he has the biggest growth!!

Love inzaghi too lol, my fav character besides Hanseo. And the ending, was nice seeing Vincenzo didn't change that much.

p.s. I'm still bitter about what they did to Hanseo, so that's one more pet peeve.

highly recommended
It is an amazing drama . i never comment on a drama but i cannot stop myself from telling that everyone should watch this masterpiece. i just don't want it to end song joong-ki acting is mind blowing. i highly recommend it if i can give it 100 stars i wil give. i just cannot describe in words how amazing this drama.
it's 10/10 for me and it climbed up my top few favourites of dramas. it's literally worth sacrificing my studies to binge watch this because it was so good. I didn't watch this initially when it first aired but after a lot of my friends recommended and persuaded me to watch, I finally succumbed to it and watch and I would say I 100% did not regret watching this!!

first of all, ever since descendants of the sun where song Joong ki acted as the main lead, I have never watched any dramas related to him so I forgot how charming he is. he never disappoints, in this drama, he came back x10 hotter and x10 cuter than he already is in dots. he acts like an Italian mafia in this show and he acted really well. he manages to execute his moves so well. He slays this character man oh my god. his gaze, his actions and everything he does just makes me feel so "" wow"" AHHA sorry can't describe but this drama is also filled with many funny scenes that you could never imagine HAHA ( will say it at the bottom with a spoiler alert so those who haven't watch can anticipate while those who have already watched can reminisce those scenes with me aaa)

the scriptwriter did a great job writing the whole plot with a really good plot twist and also different character development. Not only did the main character was portrayed well, but those second lead were all very good like Taecyeon was portrayed as both a good and bad guy very well as well as dong yeon!! it surprised me how his character development is the best in the whole drama. of course, the prosecutors and all as well as those people living in geumga plaza hehe. furthermore, i like how there need not be many romantic scenes in this drama to make the romance nice. i used to like romance kdrama alot but after watching this drama, i understood that they do not have to necessarily keep having kiss scenes or hug scenes that make your heart flutter. they work together and their chemistry just makes their relationship so wholesome. it's amazing how some things need not be portrayed directly but it still makes you go uWU!


Through this drama, it also made me understand how cute it is to have a bonded group of friends/neighbours who are living together. from them doubting Vincenzo, to them loving him, appreciating his presence and working together with him. it is heartwarming to see these scenes.

Characterwise, the mains are way too eccentric
(Watched it around 2 months ago, but i still remember the impression) || I actually liked the overall story but what I couldn't stand from this drama is the female lead. I know comedy is one of this drama's genre but the TOO eccentric characteristic of the main leads (SJK and JYB) sometimes made me cringe and failed to feel the drama. From what i saw, the comics seemed to be forced ESPECIALLY the FL. She's a good actress, i know, but maybe the writer didnt do good at creating the character that it had flaws here and there. Taecyeon is for sure another eccentric lead too, but to me he made it better than the two, and it suits him (all the rages and comics, i just loved itt). To sum it up, to me it needs more seriousness(?). I gave the acting an 8 thanks to Tacyeon, I could've given a 6.5 if he didnt do good there. || They did a great job for the cinematography, plot, etc tho, but it lacked characteristic creation that i could say it's kinda o V e R r A t E d. 이상입니다.

Sequel Needed
Outstanding mafia drama! Korea just created its own version of Al Pacino's Godfather with Vincenzo. Yes, you heard me right. I think Song Joong-ki has the right balance of good and evil in his Vincenzo character to create a mafia trilogy. What I enjoy about Korean productions is the overall story value and how it ebbs and flows. I look at the big picture. This had it all. Good vs. evil, with good prevailing, but just enough bad to take the sugary edge off, suspense, comedy, romance, characters you hated, characters you wanted to have a beer with, and those you want to see more of in future dramas. I don't live in Korea so I didn't succumb to the hype of this drama, so I didn't have any expectations going into it other than it was on a list of recommended dramas. I was blown away. I thought this was a superb production. As a foreigner, I kept pausing the drama and googling Seoul locations for filming different scenes. I know so much more about Seoul now than before, and have come away from these explorations with a respect for this great city. The actors were versatile and multi-dimensional, and I've added several to my list of favorite Korean actors. I hope there will be a sequel.

No matter what I say my words won't do justice to this wonderful series
The production was amazing and the casting was more than perfect. I found myself; feeling sentimental, crying, being angry, emotional, happy and tired of laughing. The drama was absolutely perfect and I already found myself wanting to re watch certain parts when I wasn't even finished. The music was over the top and flawlessly added to the atmosphere. The only one thing why I gave the story 9.0/10 is because Vincenzo's father was never discussed and we only ever got to see his mother and the other is that we never truly get to know about Cha-young's mother except when we see her shouting at her father and blaming him. Like I said my words can not do this series justice so you should just go and watch it, trust me if you haven't watched this you're missing.

THE SHOW THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE-My first ever review
This is my first ever review on this website, because I just can't help how much in love I am with this drama.
I have already left essay worthy comments on this drama, but I feel it also deserves a stellar review, so here goes:

Acting 10/10: This is only the second Song Joong Ki drama I've seen. But Song Joong Ki's character is so beautifully still in this show, he never fidgets, never gets startled, never loses control of his body movements, and it's a very strong character mentally as well. It's an absolute delight to watch all the episodes again and notice minute changes in his expression to the events around him, and he really manages to exude a natural intelligence and air of authority. His character gradually learns to love, and also accept that he is worthy of receiving love, and his actions show that clearly towards the end. In the beginning he is arrogant and distant without being mean in any way, and towards the end he is loving and caring without being suffocating in every way. The perfect character development. Also his deep voice is so hypnotic at many points of time, I'm convinced that's the main reason I unexpectedly loved his character from start to finish. I have become a fan of Song Joong Ki's acting after this show.

Jeon Yeo Been, MY QUEEN, is the BEST female character ever written, ever performed, ever shown on screen. She is fiery, sassy, bright, sexy, logical, brave, quick-witted, savage, sharp tongued, and beautiful beyond compare. She matches wit with everyone around her, is funny as all hell, her voice is SO hot. She never hesitates to express what she's feeling, and loves her dad despite what happened in her past. She is protective of those around her, and willing to go to any length to achieve her goals. I am IN LOVE with Hong Cha Young and Jeon Yeo Been and this is the main reason I gave the show a 10/10.

Their relationship is EXACTLY what I want in my life. They are best friends, so honest with each other, soft around each other, support each other, communicate so damn well, they TRUST each other, believe in each other, take care of each other without it being toxic in any way, and there is NO malice, NO games, NO hidden agendas anywhere between them. They also tease each other, and never fail to bicker endlessly.
In the simplest sense, it's the PINNACLE of romance, because every single glance and touch and dialogue leaves you to BEG for more. It's pining but also SO satisfying because I cherish every smile, every action that tells everyone around them that they are a unit, a team, a couple. It's realistic because they are both logical and understanding of their circumstances, and you can clearly see the struggle they both have with their feelings, one wants to love but is afraid that the other person has to leave, the other wants to love but is afraid he will have to leave.
The ending was quite satisfactory according to me.

Other factors I want to note:
Cinematography 10/10 Just WOW. The fashion, the shots, the bars/cafes they meet in, all beautiful.
OST 10/10 I have been listening to the ost on repeat even while working, just IN LOVE with it.
Story 9/10 The zig-zag storyline was great to watch, but could've been slightly better if less background character involvement was there.
Cast 10/10 Each and every single actor did their best, and their chemistry was off the charts, insanely good.
Background characters 10/10 Most of the side-characters are interesting and fun to watch. Villains did an awesome job.
Neo-Noir vibe was on POINT. Loved the ode to black and white gangster films, I think SJK nailed that part too.

OVERALL 10/10. I have already seen this show two times.

I loved it
Im writing this right after finishing the series, still overwhelmed and thrilled.
I started Vincenzo hesitant cause im not a fan of mafia content since i already see enough on my daily life since i live in italy, anyways it was quick since i was dragged into the story and couldn't stop watching it.
I loved the plot although it had some things thrown in and never explained, like the relationship with paolo or the other family thrown towards the end, yet it was so full of events that it didn't matter much.
I was amazed, i loved the villain, i loved the dynamics, the strategy. I fell in love with side characters, main cast, everyone. I loved the way the whole thing was put on.
It's definitely not for everyone since it might be a lil too gruesome for someone not used to all that blood, and also it might simply not be gour genre.
I loved how slow burn the romance was, although i wish we saw more of their relationship after the ending, yk?
Keep in mind that it's not only lawyer stuff  but a lot of revenge is involved.

I'm not a fan of the OST but it was good compared to others i have heard.

The cast was amazing at conveying emotions, i loved it till the end.

I cried, i laughed, i was at the edge of the seat, so I'll definitely rewatch it. Im happy i changed my mind about it in the end.

Also side note, besides the whole mafia part, Vincenzo is probably one of the closest representations of (still stereotyped) italians i have seen jn a while, idk if it's bc how the western media portrays us or jusy this refreshing view, but i enjoyed it.

2021's SOURCE OF HAPPINESS, YET AN AVERAGE ONE!
I won't misguide to those who have not watched the drama yet and are planning to dive into it. This is your average drama with good action, acting and yes of course The BROMANTIC ROMANCE.

Is this overhyped? Yes this is. Viewers and fans had lot of expectations from this one cause of the star studded cast and dot dot dot... This became one of the reason that this has got overflowing criticism and all....acting wise this was good, I won't say it is very good...

Ok taec Yeon nailed it? Nahhh...he was another dumb......a typical psycho which he ofc was not, is what I expected. They just made him nothing but A Weirdo!
That is it. I won't curse this any more... let's move on to the good ones....

SJK as VC, he nailed his character but he was way too much perfect yet dumbly showed...I mean he was like everyone would be afraid of which is not bad for the supporting roles but Ok taec Yeon? No he is not easily supposed to be afraid of him ... Cause he is antagonist plus psychopath
If not for SJK and the family this would have been another piece of shit.

JYB...oh my Bullshit! I love her and ofc her character but the director made her character act like BullShit! She is supposed to hold a vengeance against Ok teac Yeon and be smart ass too but wow! That's it.

I liked their BROMANTIC ROMANCE...their interactions and all it was sweet and deep. And The plaza family! wohhhh! They are just good...NO. more than just a good! From their acting to chatting making this drama more exciting! Is exactly what they did.........that is why this has become my 2021's SOURCE OF HAPPINESS....
Yes I am disappointed in some of the things...but just because I am doesn't mean this is bad. It is a very good enjoyable one, iff you are not bothered by the things I have mentioned above..... If you ask me if I wasted my time my answer would be NO. Yes it is overrated and overhyped but you should not judge it because of what others say? Don't be bothered by criticism and fascinated by ratings....GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO FEEL IT.
I am quite happy cause of the Vincenzo family...and I hope you enjoy too...

I liked it (yes, past tense)
I watched this for Taecyeon. I already knew that he is gonna be the main villain because I saw an article about his role before it got edited. And I'll have to be honest, I really looked forward to it after knowing what the story is about, and seeing that the writer was the one who also wrote Chief Kim (which is one of my favorite dramas) I had high hopes for it, high enough for me to open up naver every morning to check for news about the drama. And honestly? I liked it... at first.

The first few episodes were pretty good. I enjoyed the comedic scenes, and the story build up was pretty nice too. The ending of episode 4? I wasn't surprised about the reveal of him being the villain, but I was pretty surprised at the timing. Revealing the big bad in episode 4? Well, I guess... It's not a complaint though, because seeing Taecyeon's duality, playing innocent as Jang Junwoo but showing his true deadly colors as Jang Hanseok was creepy and cool at the same time. I'm not gonna lie, when I watched the drama on going, I kept rewatching the episodes throughout the week, and it was all mostly because of him. At least, that was what I did in the early episodes until the episode where his identity was fully revealed to public. After that, he felt kinda... tamed. Sure, Jang Hanseok was ordering people to do the dirty work for him as he always did. But I felt that was all he did in the later episodes, and it just felt so... boring. And I understand it was probably because of his public image. But at the same time I can't help but think about other villains that still did the killing themselves. Around this time, I don't rewatch, and honestly, my motivation to continue the drama decreased.

Next, the Jang brothers. I absolutely love both of their characters. When I heard Dongyeon is gonna be in Vincenzo and saw that his character's name have the same surname as Taecyeon's character, I couldn't help getting my hopes up for a supervillain duo brothers. And of course that didn't go well as their backstory gets revealed one by one. Though, I still have quite a lot of questions left about them that didn't get unanswered. It was a bit disappointing that there wasn't any more backstory on them, but I understand. This is the same complaint I have with Chief Kim, where I also have a lot of questions about Seo Yul and how his character became like that. But compared to Seo Yul who is still questionable and vague, I think Jang brothers had quite a lot of their story told, at least for a drama that's titled for the main character. Though I guess as a person who's an overthinker and imaginative, I appreciate them leaving some blank spaces for me to fill in with my own story and narrative.

I guess this part is my biggest complaint and question that I will never unerstand no matter how many times anyone tries to justify it. I STILL don't understand how Chayoung is so easy to side with Vincenzo. Like... When I think about it, it just doesn't make sense. Was it because Vincenzo was close to her dad? Because if I try to look into everything else, Junwoo was the only answer. She knew Junwoo longer than she knew Vincenzo. Especially at the part where Cenzo told Chayoung that Junwoo was the main villain, Hanseok. I still don't understand how she just believes him over her loyal friend who worked for her before. Was it because he's a mafia and he can easily get any information on anyone if he wants? I can't understand at all. There really wasn't a scene where Chayoung was questioning it or defend Junwoo. Come to think of it, I felt like she ALWAYS sided with Vincenzo and never for her intern. Was it because Junwoo was still working at Wusang? I don't know, honestly. Thinking of how their relationship developed made my head hurt more. Good for them ig.

Oh, and I also felt like 20 episodes were too much. Since it's from the same writer, I can't help compare it to Chief Kim. For me, Chief Kim felt perfect with 20 episodes, but for Vincenzo which I think the story felt off for me around episode 12, it felt dragged on for so long. Honestly, I think maybe if they had 16 episodes it would be much better, or at least slightly better.

But, through all my complaints and questions, I do have one compliment.... I think the OSTs are very good. Well, the ones with vocals are good, but I honestly prefer the just instrumental ones. They're really cool. But other than that, in conclusion, the OSTs are pretty good, the casts is also pretty good, I think that the story is very good in the first few episodes, up until around episode 12? where it just went.... wrong. I honestly thought it had the potential to be one of my favorite dramas that I would be able to rewatch, but I was wrong. After it ended, I tried to rewatch it at least a few weeks or months later, but I couldn't, I guess after knowing how the story developed and ended, it put me in a bad mood.

Not for everyone, but definitely for me!
I really enjoyed my time with this show! It was one of those dramas that was a little bit slow to start, but from episode 4 onward I was really completely hooked! I never found myself bored, despite the slightly long episode lengths. My one and only problem with the show is a certain romance plot that comes to be. I don't have a problem with the romance itself, because the characters have good chemistry, but to me it didn't align with the direction the characters growth went. It felt like the further apart the characters grew in the moral point of views, the more they were into each other? Which I didn't quite understand. That doesn't happen until the very back half of the show though. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed all other aspects of the show! It was a very thrilling watch with a very entertaining cast of characters that you grow to love!!

this was just wow
I'm a big fan of crime/mystery and comedy dramas and this drama was just the perfect amount of each genre. This drama made me fall in love with all the characters, especially Vincenzo. His character was so attractive personality and appearance-wise. I think they picked the best actor for the character because Song Joong-Ki really brought Vincenzo to life. And I had the biggest crush on Hong Cha-Yeong because she is just so, amazing. Personally, Han Seo was my favorite. His background was so sad it touched me. I usually never cry watching a drama but I cried at the ending of Vincenzo. The villains did amazing & the story was chef's kiss.

I knew this drama was super hyped but, for whatever reason, couldn't bring myself to watch it. However, after struggling to find something to watch (and also hearing from friends personally about how amazing it was), I decided to give it a go. Honestly, cannot complain when you have such beautiful leads on your screen. As this is no rom-com, each episode left me on edge as to what was going to happen next or how things would work out. Also, I could have sworn I read somewhere that people didn't think Taecyeon was a good actor, but watch this drama and you will 100% change your mind!

The one thing I didn't like about the drama was that things always seemed to work out for the protagonists even when they didn't make sense.

-- SPOILER --

The scene I hated the most was when Vincenzo was cornered by a group of men trying to kill him but somehow, he was miraculously saved because the pigeon that normally sits outside his window sent a swarm of other pigeons to attack those who were going against him. That literally ... makes no sense. If it was going to take such an impossible scenario to get our ML out of a bad situation, then perhaps it should have just been left out entirely.

-- END SPOILER --

There is also an element of comedy that may not be everyone's cup of tea, particularly around the residents of Geumga Plaza who give off the typical 'odd neighbors' kind of vibe. Personally, I did not mind it as it eased the tension of each episode, but my dad found it to be odd and he didn't really understand the necessity of it being included.

All in all, I found this to be an intriguing watch with a beautiful and talented cast as well as just overall gorgeous graphics. There's no mushy gushy romance but a plot that keeps you wondering what's next. For me personally, I rated the rewatch value lower since the drama is quite lengthy and knowing how things end, I'm not as inclined to watch it through once again.

A fun drama with one flaw I had to overlook to rate it this high
(Spoilers regarding one character in Ep 8 specifically)

I went and watched it! It was as grand and ridiculous as I thought it would be: Amazing cinematography, epic music, great atmosphere, excellent acting, fun villains, a plot that is always moving forward in interesting ways, convenient solutions that know they're convenient, slow-mo shots that go on too long on purpose, constant murders, a badass pigeon, a FL that doesn't exist to be a love interest, and a cool Italian-speaking ML that is always one step ahead. It was an incredibly fun and bloody drama that heavily leaned into Mafia stereotypes that had jokes that made me lose my mind laughing. What's not to love?

Well, there's one thing.

Regarding Representation: Okay. The elephant in the room. The representation (Ep 8). Hwang Min Sung, CEO of Shinkwang Bank, is Gay. He has physically abused his exes in the past but wasn't punished because they were afraid of being outed. His character is very over-the-top but I had no problem with them leaning into that. It's the style of the show and all the characters are oddballs, villains and protagonists alike. That wasn't what I found problematic.

What I Did find problematic was Vincenzo's behavior. He has to pretend to be interested in Min Sung and reacts Very negatively to the prospect. The very idea of pretending to be interested in a man makes him shudder. And he freaks out multiple times while going on dates with him. He is not called out for this nor is it addressed in any way.

They did that for comedic purposes, which really upset me. That, and it doesn't even fit with the way his character normally is. Unless it's something that offends his ""Italian sensibilities,"" he doesn't really care and will pretend and do whatever it takes. This tells us, the audience, that the writers really wanted to include this joke about his disgust/horror at pretending to be Gay.

In summary, we got a Gay SML here. But, we were treated to some problematic behavior on the part of our ML in regards to that SML. I'm disappointed. Not to mention, the jokes about any male affection continued from then on.

Unexpected
Before I started watching I had no idea the plot. From the trailers I was looking to watch and all out mafia war series. However, this was not that and after the first couple of episodes and I wrapped my head around the fact that is was a comedy of errors and absurdity with the brutality of mob justice I just went with it.

Things I loved:

Song Joon Ki - Didn't who he was and this was the fierst thing I've seen him in. Excellent as Vincezo. By now anyone whose read my reviews know I love a pretty man and he is gorgeous but it wasn't just his looks he really did pull off the oh so cool mafia consigliere type.

Ok Taec Yoen - Didn't know who he was either and this is the first thing I saw him in. Really good as the psycho villian and his cruelty knew no bounds. I was impressed.

Kwak Dong Yeon - Very good young actor. You really did start to feel for him.

There was some really great lines uttered by Vincenzo and there were some really great scenes.

The OST was excellent. One of the best I've heard and listened too in a long time.

Things I hated:

Jeon Yeo Bin - The character just realluy got on my nerves. Super annoyong FL and all the bouncing around and jerky actions too much!! I never wanted her with Vincenso even though that's were the series was going.

Kim Yeo Jin - I don't know if this woman was suited for the role but I hated her face, her eating scenes and never hated a character so much. Never wished for someones death as much as I wished for her characters death. It was very satisfying in the end.

I don't really hate the tenants of Guegma Plaza but they really were extremely annoyong. Way too many side characters and I did not find them endearing. I also hated the fcat that knew too much and were in on a lot the the plans. I did however enjoy epiosde 19 when they explained each tenants past life. It was just a great scene for what its worth.

Overall: I gave the show an 8. It was almost a 10 b/c I was really enjoying the emotional roller coaster and the out right ridiculousness of it all but the last 2 episodes left much to be desired.

Not you ordinary mafia show
Sick of reading people’s comments about it is too comical to be a mafia show. that is what’s interesting about it, its not your average mafia show. I read a comment saying that you dont get emotional attachment to vincenzo and you cant tell what is in his mind, that is the whole point! Vincenzo’s character lack emotions and more rationally unemotional, everything is calculated and it gets interesting when he is caught off guard because you tjink did he know its gonna happen or did he expect that to happen kinda as because he doesnt show you much emotion, til... episode 16, thats what it wants you to feel, in the beginning of the series that there are hints that he wants out of the mafia life and always believes that you pay for your sins, he treats his enemies accordingly. People need to understand that the mafia is not just about brutal murders and killings, they have a code they have to follow, only when it is broken that shit happens hence what you see on media’s portrayal of mafia. Now after episode 16 i cant wait how this progresses. Vincenzo’s group has very good chemistry and kinda makes you feel like a little family, it is like he unconsciously made a korean mafia in the plaza! The villains are perfect, the acting is superb, their facial expressions says a lot, i really commend song joong ki how his eyes, little facial movements tries to say a lot and not at the same time as he is meant to portray a unemotional character.

Something really special about this drama!!! Must watch!!
Ok, wow just finished it...I am in shock mostly. This was an incredible drama in so many ways! It was incredible from start to finish, and there were just so many moments where I was in genuine shock and literally had ""jaw-drop"" moments! The story, characters, and overall feel of the drama was out of this world! Every moment of the drama felt thrilling, and not once was there a slow moment or anything that felt unnecessary. Overall, I want more!! I definitely want more of Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo!!! Hong Cha Young is my queen, one of the strongest female leads I have ever seen and I want to be just like her when I grow up! I absolutely love her and adore Jeon Yeo Bin's portrayal of her! I want more of all the tenants --> all of whom I love dearly!! Omg, this kdrama was something else! I think the chemistry of the entire cast and production staff was really good and is what made the drama so freaking good! I absolutely love every single character, the good and the bad, and the actors that played them did an absolutely incredible job!! I feel like I'm still in shock, I haven't processed everything that's happened. Still, though I love this drama. A LOT. It's something special! (I need more VinCha romance and babies though!!) Also, the soundtrack of this show was *chef's kiss --> so so good!!! 'I'm Always By Your Side' by John Park is the embodiment of what a love song should be, it is an OST that deserves awards! Ahhh, I love Vincenzo so much!!

It's a masterpiece worth watching!! ^_^
Instead of showing the stereotypical concept of ""angel fighting the evil"", I love how diligently the writer constructed a grey personality of the main lead (Vincenzo) and also of the rest of the characters to some extend. Looking at the summary I was very reluctant to watch this drama in the beginning but I must say, watching this drama has been worthy of every single moment! The storyline of this drama has been written, directed and presented so meticulously that it I can't simply emphasis in mere words. The casting, visuals, costumes, dialogues and acting were marvelous and very detail oriented and the OST????? THEY HAD THE BEST OST OF ALL TIME!!! The music were just on spot and it resonated so well with the excitement and emotions that you'll just fall in love with all the OST at the end of the day *_*

Honestly speaking, after watching plenty of k-drama, the storyline of this drama felt more inclined towards the concurrent realistic scenario of the world and somewhat a realistic ""open end"" conclusion as well compared to other dramas. I really enjoyed the strategic counterattacks of each groups (mainly Vincenzo's :P) and the nuanced metaphors and quotes used in their dialogues <3

The comedies would make you burst into laughter every single time, the serious and action scenes would make your adrenaline go wild and the emotional moments would well your eyes :') The story advances wildly from the beginning till the 15th episode and it slows down a little due to excessive plots and twists towards the end but all in all, I am absolutely delighted to watch Vincenzo :) The drama is a complete package and definitely ""must-watch"" worthy ^_^

Perfection
While I began watching Vincenzo largely because it was something the men in my family may be more apt to enjoy, I soon became the most fervent of viewers in my household. However, my guys were pretty invested in this too.

Not only is this drama incredibly well acted, the story is captivating as well. The intricacies of Babel vs. the plaza family and the injustices faced by the Babel workers were interesting and the relationship between the leads was just the cherry on top. I like how the writers/producers weren't afraid to delve into some dark and uncomfortable places as they explored where this story took us. Very clever indeed.

I cannot recommend this drama enough. Bravo...so glad I delved into something different.

this drama is just perfection...
I was hooked to this drama from episode 1, I loved the villain aspect and how the main character isn't perfect how has to kill people because he has no choice. This story is about a man you kills and punishes the worst of worst, those who even the police can't catch, those who are worse than the Mafia. Starring Song Joong Ki you will be able to see how versatile he is – from being the badass lawyer to the cutest foreigner to the coolest lawyer from Italy. Every part of his scene is way too hilarious. Not to mention that his visuals are totally overflowing in this drama! His Italian speaking skills seem to be very attractive, too!
Song Joong Ki may be one of the main characters of this series, but let’s not forget about the other main leads and supporting actors. All of the actors in Vincenzo are really performing well in every episode which makes the drama more interesting and more humorous! I can’t clearly remember but I am certain that I laughed countless times while I was watching this drama. I couldn’t even stop being amazed at every part of the scene. Moreover, I totally got hooked on this drama.
Apart from Song Joong Ki, you will definitely love watching some of the familiar actors in this series such as Taecyeon (Jang Joon-Woo), Jeong Yeo-Bin (Hong Cha-Young), Kwak Dong-Yeon (Chairman Jang Han-Seo), Yoo Jae-Myung (Hong Yu-Chan), and many more! Vincenzo has definitely got a lot of great actors portraying their characters so well.
Vincezo is not just your typical love story – a badass guy who falls in love with a good lady. It is more of an action, humorous, and exhilarating drama! Every part of the scene is overwhelming and captivating! One good thing about the drama is its love interest doesn’t seem to drag the story itself. The drama seems to be very natural and it becomes more entertaining as it moves on to the next episode. Obviously, there are a lot of unpredictable scenes in its storyline and there might be more surprising scenes that we must expect from this drama.


The ending of episode 19 made so happy that I waited for episode 20 because the way it left us was just cruel. I mean Hong Cha-Young getting shot?! And things didn't get better when the final episode began, everything just got from terrible to absolutely to sh*t!!! I just have to say how much I loved the character development of Jang Han-Seo , I just love his relationship with Vinzenco and how they are like actual brothers. I cried so much when Han-Seo stood up to his brother and he shot him. When he was saying how thankful he was to Vincenzo who was there for him like nobody in his life ever was, I was balling ??? and when Vincenzo told him how he deserved to be his little brother, my heart shattered ?. Now episode 20, so many things happened, so much action, so much death. I loved how Vincenzo finally put an end to Jun Woo and Choi Myung Hee!!! I hated them so much, but I guess that mean that the actors did an fantastic job pertaining these characters. Also the time jump, 1 year later. I knew that they had to show us a Vincenczo and Cha-Young scene and what we got was just...more than anything I could have hoped for. The KISS was just everything I was so happy ???Also Vincenzo's final monologue was just phenomenal ?

Fabulous
Loved everything about this drama even when it was slow in parts and I knew what was going to happen next. The cast was stellar from the smallest role to the ML and FL. I’m more in love with Song Joon Ki than ever. I thought the last episode was perfect except for the violence which the psychos deserved. Han Seo’s death was so sad but I know where the writer was going with him since several episodes ago. He deserves a leading role...his character development was the best in the drama. I will definitely rewatch.

Master Piece
This is that one drama that no one should ever hesitate to watch! The perfect amount of comedy, suspense, thrills, and chemistry between the main leads. Like hats of to the writer, the director, the actors and the crew. They worked incredibly hard and I have to say... it is what made Vincenzo a true piece of art. It takes 4 episodes to be completely in love with it and by 8, you are hooked like never before. I suggested this to over 30 friends and every one of them loved it more and more! The story is incredibly well written, the acting is on point and I already rewatched it 8 times (well ongoing 8 times as I keep rewatch with my friends the previous episodes). Once again... a Beautiful drama and a well-deserved rating.

Not my cup of tea !
I didn't like how story progressed ! Sometimes it was fun but absurd ! Inzaghi saving Vinshenzo ? WTF! I was skipping many scenes ,because each time it became quite draggy and boring .

Sincerely I had high expectations for Song's new drama after watching him in Arthdal Chronicles,(I need season 2 T-T ) but I didn't feel that attraction for his character, like when you say wow he's great! It didn't happen to me!

Instead I was more shocked by how they portrayed the villain, the president of Babel, the actor did a good job and his step brother was charismatic ~ I expected a better ending for him because we did see his growth through the drama :c

I'm the only one who thinks that the romance was unnecessary ???? I mean their relationship as an ""avengers team "" was enough. I didn't feel chemistry between them as a couple !

Satisfying revenge. ""Villains can deal with villains""
A drama with a ""bad guy"" protagonist isn't something new, but it's still refreshing to watch than watching a lot of dramas with a typical ""moral, righteous, persistent, strong hero"". Vincenzo makes it very clear throughout the drama that he doesn't care about virtues or justice.

I think all the actors/actresses did a great job in their roles. In the start I did find HCY's (the FL) character a bit unusual. It sometimes did feel cringe at the start. However, it didn't take much time for me to get used to her character and like her. She isn't one of those annoying FL characters. In the end, her weird expressions & gestures didn't even bother me. I personally liked the supporting characters (the people of Geumga Plaza). I know some didn't like them, but I felt without them the drama wouldn't be the same. I do wish the supporting characters had a little bit of more background story added into them. We were given subtle hints about most of them but some of them were unexpected. It would also make sense why they were behaving in a certain way in the present as well if we knew their story in the past.
The same I would say for Vincenzo. I wish his background with the Italian Mafia would be expanded on. It's not really important but it would clear up the minor questions I had about his character. (For example, I thought he had PTSD with those flashbacks in the start, but I turned out to be wrong. Then I took another meaning out of those nightmares.)

As for the writing/story, I'd say there are a few flaws in there. There are some things that I felt logically wouldn't make sense, but I didn't really mind it that much as it wasn't something significant to keep me away from enjoying the drama overall. l did feel towards the end it may have been slightly rushed. I also think that certain actions& decisions by the characters went out of character. But I will say the writer did a great job of not having me bored at all throughout the drama. Some dramas tend to drag out and become boring, but it wasn't the case here. They did a decent job of leaving majority of the episodes in a cliffhanger.

As for the comedy, I didn't really find the drama to be that funny. I did laugh but it was a few times. There were some scenes I understood that it was intended to be funny, but they didn't make me laugh.

This drama did have me question my morality at some times. I was rooting for the ML with his way of taking revenge and thinking the villains deserve what they get. It felt satisfying to watch the villains suffer for the crimes they committed against innocent people. It's the satisfaction that you don't always get in a typical drama with a hero with morals where justice is eventually delivered.

The only reason I decided not to give it a 10, is because I felt it was less impactful. I won't be thinking about this drama for hours/days (even if I was satisfied and enjoyed watching it). I can easily move onto another drama without thinking about this drama and its end. (Plus a little disappointed cause I couldn't really enjoy the comedy aspect)

not what I expected...
I don't usually write reviews but I had to for this one. I've heard a lot of people calling this wasted potential and I have to agree...

The show started off great with the first episode. It had this cool but quirky vibe to it that had me immediately hooked. I looked forward to the next episode every week (watched it while it was ongoing). The cast seemed great as well. Joongi and Yeobeen as well as the villains, played their characters very well. I obviously had high expectations bc of this.

I think my main problem has to do with the progression of the plot. Halfway through the plot starts feeling rushed and repetitive. I believe this is why the characters didn't have any room to develop either. A lot of what was happening felt kinda forced or ""out of place"". The initial purpose of the story felt lost as well.

Things I especially wish they would've done differently:
1. Chayoung's story
I think they moved on a little too fast with her overall story. Her relationship with her father and her morally questionable choices as a lawyer is what made her feel super refreshing (specially as a female character). I feel like we didn't get to properly see her mourn over her father or how that transitioned into her seeking revenge. I also expected to see more of the ""enemies to lovers"" trope between her and Vincenzo.

2. Hanseo and Vincenzo
I thought them teaming up was actually perfect but the timing was kinda off (which happens a lot throughout the show). We didn't get to see them develop a PROPER brother-like love, which is why it felt somewhat forced. It's a shame considering how much bigger the emotional impact would've been.

Despite the disappointment, the show still had some great things. I think Vincenzo himself was a great character and his dilemma with the mafia and killing people was portrayed well.
I also loved Choi Myunghee as a villain. Instead of making up a redemption story they chose to show that she did what she did bc she was simply evil and greedy.

I think I had too high expectations and watching it while it was ongoing made me analyze it a little more than I probably should have. So I would still recommend it to people who are just looking for something fun to watch!!

wow.

I started watching this show shortly after it aired, but i stopped watching because i was very busy at the time. BIG MISTAKE. I should have completed it all then because this show is definitely worth it.

The acting is on point, the music is perfect and the story couldn't be better.

The chemistry between the maincharacters and the cute moments they have are amazing. The male lead actor was the best choice, he played his villain part very good and it was very convincing. The female lead was also amazing.

My feeling througout this show were very mixed. One moment i was laughing, the next crying and then on the edge of my seat. It's multiple genres in one show, but i love it.

The story and the plot was so good. Every episode had plottwists and betrayals that you didn't expect. Plus the final two episodes were *cheffs kiss*

The only reason i gave the rewatch value a bit less is because this show was so good because of all the plottwists and how you felt when these happened. If i watch it again i know all these twists already which would make it a bit less exciting.

So to end this review, i would just like to say: WATCH IT :)

I love vigilante show
I like this show. Initially, I don’t want to write the review but i read some of the reviews here and I’m gonna defend this show. Well the story is about evil vs evil, so you don’t need to expect the main character to be pure hearted like super hero, even the female lead is also savage. This is what i like about this show. No bullshit. Some people said they are out of character or they are too much in punishing the criminals, I don’t think so. For criminals who bribed the whole government to do evil deeds, they cannot punish them in the normal ways coz justice doesn’t work for them, in fact the whole justice system has been serving their evil deed.

While the show is not perfect, it doesn’t deserve a 5 or a 6. The show is really funny, i enjoyed watching it, it’s rare for me to enjoy kdrama show right now, as i am bored with the same formula and tbh i am in my kdrama block right now. So this show is quite surprising that it’s still fresh and funny for a total of 20 episodes. Definitely a keeper!

I am glad that I didn't dropped it
So it took me 5 days to finish the first 9 episodes and 2 days for the last 11 episodes. It was pretty good drama. At first I didn't like it. I didn't understand what was going on. So I was gonna drop it after watching 3 episodes. But somehow I didn't dropped it and kept watching. Then again when I was in the 10th episode I thought that let's not drop it just put it in hold, take a break and start watching it again after few days. But OMG. From the 10th episode the story became so much amazing and enjoyable. It kept getting better and better with every episode. As I said I finished the last 11 episodes in 2 days. The story seems so slow in the first and it keeps getting better as the show goes on. There was so good action/fighting scenes. I also laughed very much watching the show. Some scenes was so well thought. I didn't like the comedic approach from the characters to be honest. But some people might like it. So overall it is an drama that's definitely worth watching. But you need to have patience as the story is kinda boring in the first. And there was some unwanted scenes just to make the drama longer. You can skip some scenes if you don't like it. And the drama is usually longer than other dramas. Each episode is longer than 80 minutes. So yeah as I said you need to have patience in the first few episodes only after that you will love watching it.

Good story and cast but wayyy to long
At first when I start watching this drama, I felt this was just pure hype. A mafia guy, fear by the all country (Italy) was being played like I child when arrives in Korea. I thought the rest of the cast annoying, basically I disliked everything but gave a second chance and end up loving all the cast.

Positives: The people fo plaza made this drama for me. They all so friendly and funny, I laught like a mad woman in all their scenes, I like that they start helping Vincenzo on his revenge plans.
The acting of Taecyong was amazing, he improved so much I was so suprised.


Negatives: This drama is wayyyy to long. 20 episodes, each 1h25 min is too much. I usually love drama with long episodes but the story line here dragged ALOT. Everythinng could have end in 16 episodes and I dare to day even 13 episodes would be enough. I see people saying this drama dosen't feel too long when watching when it airs and I totally agree. Is near impossible to bringe watch this in one go, i sjust the same plot all over again.
The romance.... why inclued romance in this? KDRAMAS writers never learn. Just because this is a drama, we don't need a romance between the leads. They would be perfect as friends but no they added romance for no reason and gave us only 2 kisses and an open ending.. JUST WHY?

Overall: 7
Watch this if you want to have a good time, the plot start moving around episode 17 everything else is just fillers.

For me, to discover...
This is a quality drama. Of course, it will not please everyone, and I understand that completely. But for my part, I just loved it...

Basic crime drama, it's actually a nice melting pot of many genres. It was a real emotional lift for me: I laughed, cried, was under tension, flabbergasted... In short, I went through every possible and unimaginable stage. The first 10 episodes, we adhere, the last 10 we don't breathe anymore, each end of episode leaving us in a terrible questioning about what will happen in the next episode.

For sure, that some people won't like this mix of genres. But I found, personally, that it was very well made. Also, I liked to switch from one genre to another, and experience all kinds of emotions in one drama.

The downside for me: Categorized as ""Romance"" as well, if you're like me, a die-hard romantic, you'll be a bit disappointed... The charming story between the two leads will remain, despite everything, very far in the background, and we'll only taste a few small crumbs. Which sometimes leaves you a little hungry...

Out of this, the main couple works wonderfully, the actors are top notch: Song Joong Ki, carries his role wonderfully, and I loved the ambivalence of his character: He has a dark side, he knows it, and tries to shape it into something ""good"". And on the other hand, he has a heart, and gets touchingly attached to all the secondary characters around him, or in his relationship with his mother. One of his best roles for me. Sure, he's a villain, but he also represents a terrible reality of today's world. And he carried it off masterfully.

As for Jeon Yeo Bin, in her role as a slightly crazy lawyer, she holds her own, and once the surprise was over, managed to take me into her world with pleasure.

Their duet is a magnificent relationship full of complicity and friendship.
The secondary roles, ditto, once the surprise of this slightly ""crazy"" side is over, it is a real pleasure to see them evolve, and help each other, and become an ""extension"" of Vincenzo CASSANO. They are all great, each in their own character.

As for Ok Taec Yeon, he is just amazing in his role as a psychopath, Hats off...

Some will not like this glorification of Vincenzo, and it doesn't excuse all the crimes he committed, indeed. But all this complex side of the character, was in my opinion, magnificently worked and interpreted.

In short, you will have understood, except for the romance, I was satisfied on all other levels. For now, one of my best 2021 dramas without hesitation.

Not so much Dark Action Series
When you going to watch the drak action crime based series then you already prepared for longer series with good episode length and accepting the fact that story will reveal slowly as it goes. Vincenzo has great story with great cast but there is something which lacks and it is the way story reveals.

I love this drama it has great actors, music, has some comedy, great action and great music. But it has flaws which we can see not do many but have.

I can re-watch this drama it is good and best for binge watching. You cannot relax until you completed.

Also I love the ending

Process of 'Vincenzo': Hm, BOOM. BOOM, Boom, Hmm..., Hmm!
Point of Story: Gold
Gradually Shifted Focus: Babel
This is not noir or a gritty drama.
Actually, much of the drama is about being 'cool', and then it becomes dark(er).

Advice in Advance: Show should not be taken seriously.
If I had to simplify everything my review says below:
The worst part about this show is the plot, because there are later frequent loopholes and because the first couple episodes aren't interesting. Show does not take itself seriously. The takeaway I had was that the show's focus is not on the plot, but the message it sends out. Themes and characters are worth pondering, and the story discusses corruption and evil through comedy and cool scenes. In fact, comedy distracts some of the illogicalities/inconsistencies of the show due to overblown scenes, so it milds down some loopholes (comedy acts as a somewhat separate scope of logic). Mafia persona should not be taken seriously until three-quarters of the series. However, I rated it a 9 overall still because of the feelings it gave me, and for defying K-Drama relationship tropes. If logically rating it, I would give it a 7.5-8.0. Flaws are all listed above, but to be honest, I really liked this drama despite its faults.

In-Depth Review:

There are two ways I rate a drama: through critical analysis and the feeling while watching.
The feeling of watching it is great if you stick to the scope of its logic.

Not a heist drama (for those wondering about the gold), and not a 'dark comedy' (totally misleading). It is a show about rampant corruption within the ranks of prosecutors, court cases, lawyers, corporations, and so on, and mixed with a hefty amount of slapstick comedic relief. Comedic relief is a break in between and does not affect the plot, serving as its own universe.

The change (especially from dark to comedy) of Italy to Korea is unnerving, but thankfully it's a very short while IF you know this. The focus is on Korea, NOT Italy. This I later found very pleasant because it would be foreign to write about a Korean-Italian mafia member in Italy as it a foreign topic and seems like its structure is fantasized. In fact, the Mafia persona is already the most fantasy-structured part, if you don't count the humor.
Many came for the Mafia persona, so here's a hint: His mafia persona acts as a background introduction until about the middle of the series, where his characterization is looked more deeply into. It's not The Godfather. This is all in K-Drama style.

The first three episodes are not so gripping. I personally don't like it when people tell me to wait until a show gets good, so it's up to you to stick around or not. For me, it was unexpectedly worth it.
At its fourth, it picks up the pace and goes on a huge exponential growth of anticipation and excitement until around the middle, and then it goes through a kind of confusing period and then, I would say a satisfactory ending.
(Hence the title of this review)

Here are the best things about this drama: Unfaltering characterization consistency and an independent female lead. It also does not goes back on its themes and many lines in this drama are worth pondering on.

The drama has about two episodes worth of filler in its run towards the end, but I would argue the ending is a good end. It wraps up every single plotline and unanswered question. However, there are definitely plot and logical loopholes, though you are able to rationalize this with character motivations. Still, if you took out the supporting cast's comedy, then it could be broken down into even fewer episodes. Still, the comedy does fill in errors, and the significant moments don't work if the drama is gritty.

The soundtrack is definitely a selling point and never misses. The acting is on point (minus the comedy, because I didn't find it funny), and the chemistry between the two leads is great in the workplace. Romance is a slow burn, not front and center, and doesn't affect the plot.

The ending is kind of open, in the sense that you can imagine what's going to happen, but wraps up everything. The drama is also a great exploration into different themes and definitely has the most brutal blood-type scenes I have seen in a K-Drama (it's not that brutal, just so considering the scope of violence in K-Dramas).

I would especially say that I really never considered SJK to portray a mafia member because his image didn't stick it out to me. I still can see that point, but his acting definitely pulled through and made it believable. I also think his blend of comfortable humor and dark acting worked very well. Speaking of humor, slapstick (typical K-Drama style) is a large part of the drama, though not very important, so you can skip some of it, mostly serving as a distraction or breather from the plot. I personally am not so fond of the cast, because I saw them as mainly as fill-ins, but many like them gradually. Still, humor worked the best when it was under the working relationship of the leads because it was a simple integration within the story.

Do give it a try. I might have been disappointed with some parts but not utterly shocked and dismayed by it, and I still recommend this no matter what. I left the drama with a light and fulfilled heart.
Ah, that sentence is a little underwhelming.
It is the drama I enjoyed the most thus far in 2021.
I joined MDL to participate in its discussions.

If not, we can sure agree to disagree. Hope this helps.

Missed potential in beautiful package

I think that no drama this year gave me so mixed feelings than Vincenzo. I’ve changed my mind about it multiple times while watching it and I’m still not entirely sure what exactly to think about it. For me this drama was just so uneven that it’s hard to give it just one score. But I’ll go point by point with this and hopefully at the end I’ll have my mind set.

The goodies:

Production
A while ago I’ve said that It’s Okay to Not Be Okay was the most aesthetically pleasing drama that I’ve watched this year. But after a bit of thought, I think that it should be ex aequo with Vincenzo on the first spot. While in It’s Okay to Not Be Okay more care was put towards scenography and costumes, in Vincenzo production itself was top notch. Photography and the way some scenes were shot was just so good that I think it could easily compete with western hight budget series in this category. And let’s talk about scenes that took place in Italy. Because you know what? They weren’t actually shot in Italy or anywhere near Europe. All of them were actually shot on green screen and even some actors weren’t in the same place, but were put together in post production. Which makes those scenes even more impressive.
For those interested, here’s material published by Netflix on their YouTube channel, mind blown, am I right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eQz7orIi8Q


Acting
I mean, with a cast like that I wouldn’t expect anything less than perfect. And I have to say, all actors deliver. Song Joong Ki had a particular hard job with his character talking a lot of Italian but it worked out better than I thought. I mean, I don’t speak Italian, I’ve watched some analysis of his language skills made by actual Italians and they had rather good opinions of it. And for my ear it actually sounds better than his English from Descendants of the Sun where it sounded like he just got the text written phonetically to memorise. This time it sounds more natural at least on the first glance.
Amongst others I’d have to highlight performances by Ok Taec Yeon (obviously, but I have to say that he’ve done a hell of a job with a character that could otherwise be absolutely ridiculous and exaggerated) and Kim Yeo Jin (the same as with character played by Ok Tae Yeon. I’d say that this drama served a bit too close to comical relief with it’s characters, but was saved by top acting).


Comic relief
About comic relief, but this time the intended one. At some point I was really confused of what this drama is trying to be. Because amongst all those pretty intense mafia scenes we have those little hidden gems of comic relief scenes and characters that actually, after some time, fit perfectly as a bit of pressure valve after some emotional or just simply intensive scenes. I’d say that my favourite comic relief were the tenants of Geumga Plaza, they’re such an amazing blend of personalities that comedic scenes with them were a pure gold for me.

Characters (esp. villain)
There’s a lot of them, which not always is a good thing (about it later) but I have to admit that all characters in this series are very well developed and thought through. There’s basically no weak link here.
And let’s talk about the villain, because that was hands down the best played character here. Ok Taec Yeon done such an amazing job portraying Jang Jun Woo that he basically saved this character that otherwise could be unintended comic relief here. But the way this character progressed being more and more psychopathic was a masterpiece. That ladies and gentlemen is how villains should be written. The way that we know what they could do without them showing it it’s just enough to make us shudder.
About Vincenzo himself. At first I’ve seen him as a bit exaggerated with the notion of him being basically more Italian than pizza itself. But it kind grew on me and the way the character was developed made him more believable with each episode. Finally we have what was promised, a cold blooded mafia guy who’s not afraid to use cruel methods on people who crossed the line, at the same time being composed lawyer choosing peaceful (or semi peaceful) methods first.

Baddies

Pacing
And here we have first problem and the thing that I was most angry about it because it spoiled my fun from watching this series. Pacing. It’s really bad in some episodes. Somewhere in the middle we have situation when in episode we have 90% of nothing happening and one really amazing scene that made me not drop this drama. I’m used to filler episodes, but here they were really bad, especially that there was no point in having them, since we were basically always in the middle of the action. Maybe it was because Vincenzo has 20 episodes, maybe with 16 it would be much better. Luckily, this 10%, this one really amazing scene kind of rewarded us for waiting remaining hour filled with monotonous dialogues.

Plot
Plot was the thing that I’m the most unsure about whether I liked it or not. I think it’s still linked to pacing of the show but at one point I felt that too many things are happening. We had so many side plots that it was hard to tell what’s happening with the main problem. It made the drama look pretty chaotic and watered down. Especially with this amount of characters. Even tough well written the abundance of them made it pretty hard to follow who’s who and what is he/she doing.


So to somehow bring it all together. For me Vincenzo was a bit of wasted potential of being really amazing series. A bit of it was lost because of really slow paced plot but the good things remain underneath it. So maybe it’s not for everyone, maybe you just need patience for it.

Episode 1: Chess Mafia Analogy
After breaking out of jail, SpongeBob seizes the opportunity to eat corndogs instead of Krabby patties. Cinderella also likes wood shoes as snow white likes snot shoes now. Because of this, they want to launch a new store. A nunchuck store with a weenie detector for all those weenies out there. Wreck-it Ralph also launched a new candy store filled with lots of doves. They love to do things publicly: like even looking at each other's bottoms to see that wonderful hole for reproduction. And you might be saying, what is this about the movie [VINCENZO]? Well the movie, I suppose to say series or episodes are good and I highly recommend you to watch it.

After flip flopping back and forth on what this show was (it's a classic farce, it's an operetta), I've now ended squarely on it being a huge, sweeping over-the-top, nonsensical Opera designed for its spectacle: there to entertain, not to teach. There are those who take issue with the fact that it was ultimately not about anything but you don't spend four hours at the Opera for thematic consistency or the plot. You do it for the spectacle.

Vincenzo was 20 hours of pure, unadulterated entertainment with characters we enjoyed watching and the titillation of bloody revenge and the hint of romance. VINCENZO himself was a Mafioso from beginning to end: someone who cared only about his family and who, once that was taken away, built a new one to protect. This was a Korean mafia tale, a Chaebol Godfather, where there is no good or evil. There's just your side and my side and no limits to protecting what's yours.

However, the show isn't perfect and had two major flaws that need mentions. The first is that it has one episode that is unbelievably homophobic to the point that I nearly dropped it over it. This has to be mentioned - episode 8 is a gross mess of offensive stereotypes and gay shock jokes. In fact, you could just skip it completely. Secondly, there's a whole conversation to have here as to whether the show degenerated into glorifying violence for the sake of violence - and in my opinion it did . But the writers never stood back from telling us who VINCENZO was. A Mafioso fighting a Mafia war that happened to be set in Korea.

And in terms of sweeping grandeur and consistent eye for detail down to the most minor of characters, it was a fantastic and enjoyable ride that I personally loved.

Ambitious 'buddy cop'/mafia plot weighed down by its own ambitions . .

There are some truly creative, cinematic and eccentric scenes that will linger. But, the episodes are long, and the core theme repeats over and over. Eventually, I came to the point where watching caused boredom or needless tension from emotional whiplash between the absurd comedy and the violence. It was time to stop.

In our modern era of corruption, narcissism, greed and nihilism perhaps only death and destruction can change things around. Vincenzo is an intriguing character with an innocent surface, hiding an ease with violence and revenge. Cha-Young (female sidekick) is along for the ride experiencing the vicarious thrill of well-deserved retribution in action.

Music fits the mood, would not rewatch.

I grade on other criteria as well:

Complex Themes: 8.5
Psychopathic 'dark triad/tetrad' individuals and their enablers cause wide-spread destruction and havoc on society, violence may be the only effective answer. Some people are beyond redemption. Courage can be found in unlikely places.

Character Growth: 4
At least 3/4 the way through there really wasn’t any for Vincenzo or Cha-Young.

Complex women/Relationships: 5.5
Here we have a full blown female villain and a female co-hero with barely any romance elements. I liked that the female villain’s clothing, demeanour and temperament was dowdy and unassuming and how it could change in a split moment into something more sinister. Note: low points for not having much substantive interactions between women.

Cinematography/Production Values: 9.0
Really top notch, shooting in different styles, different angles. Lots of changing of scenery. Great fight scenes.

brilliantly captivating
vincenzo is one of my top dramas and if you check my watchlist, youll see ive combed through many of kdramaland's best and worst dramas.

to start, people that give vincenzo low ratings mustve dropped it early on. even from an objective point of view, this drama is nearly perfect by any standard. i admit the FL took some time to get used to and the story needed to catch its footing, but when it did, it hit the ground running. firstly, the writing is spectacular. each episode has the perfect balance of action and recovery, in which we see our characters throw a punch, compose themselves, and get ready for their next course of action. even if an episode has a slower pace than the previous episode, nothing is ever dull or boring. the conversations are organic and each character is well written. everyone in this drama has their place and meaning, no character or action is a filler.

what makes this drama spectacular is how well thought out everything is. youd have to watch each episode multiple times to catch each fleeting glance, each allegory or parallel. each episode has a focus and goal, and we watch the characters grow with each conversation. thats what makes this drama feel so real despite its fantastical and unreachable plot: the world building, the well written dialogue where we witness the weaknesses and strengths of our characters, the highs and lows of our leads, how they deal with their traumas. the writer has developed the characters to the point where we can confidently say what our leads are thinking or how they may be spending their time when theyre not gracefully fighting crime. and the pacing of the plot has been more consistent than a majority of dramas ive seen, there are no massive time jumps, no miscommunications, no unnecessary subplots. in fact any trope that vincenzo uses, it makes fun of itself before we get a chance to do so. thats how well thought out the writing is.

the balance of crime, mystery, action, comedy, and romance is unraveled. you get your fill but the end always leaves you wanting more. the slow burn especially has to be the best ive seen. relationship wise, we watch our characters go from enemies to friends, learning to appreciate and lean on each other. crime wise, we get an interesting and maniacal set of villains that successfully make you shiver in your seat. vincenzo's comedy also lands really well most of the time, making the most of their comical side cast and cameos and references.

as for our ML, song joongki is doing a spectacular job. he eloquently delivers what-on paper- looks like a brutal mafia member as a loyal, enigmatic man with unresolved trauma. he has an air of elegance and intelligence, and unlike his cold appearance he genuinely cares for and wants to do right by those around him. song joongki is also incredible at controlling his facial expressions and micromovements, allowing us to see his internal struggle with his developing feelings.

our FL, played by jeon yeobeen is a little offputting at first. perhaps JYB needed time to really get into her character or this type of character isnt her strong suit. regardless, after 5 or so episodes she really grows into the role of spunky and flamboyant chayoung who has trauma of her own. this drama would not be as splendid as it is if we didnt have such an atypical FL that i am so happy to see on my screen. she is strong willed, intelligent, outspoken, stubborn, and always true to herself. there is so much to her personality and she is a magnificent foil to our ML vincenzo who often has a stern face and cold aura. the chemistry between the two leads is electric, and watching them heal through their friendship is really heartwarming.

overall, this drama is spectacular in every aspect. if you pay close attention you can see the meaning between the lines or catch an allegory hidden in a seemingly casual interaction. the build up of the plot is intense and well worth the wait, and the character development is nearly swoon worthy. what im saying is, watch this drama. prepare to be mindblown. this is the kind of drama youd pay to be able to watch again for the first time.

Slow paced drama with okayish acting , average light revenge drama
9 episodes down and I felt Vincenzo is nothing more than an average watch.The storyline is becoming more predictable lacking serious twists and they add all unnecessary details making it so slow paced. Its not easy to get a attachment to characters and doesn't offer a compelling watch.

a)Vincenzo uses a lot of forced comedy scenes which can be really enjoyed by some people but for some it hardly gave any laugh.Coming to episode 5 and 6,the comedy scenes itself became so predictable and then almost the humour tone turns into a substandard one.
b) Some ideas to tackle enemy were brilliant but the show don't show any specific revenge fire,no clever twists.
c) At the same time, some ideas looks really silly like tonsil scenes, a judge who doesn't wipes his after something sticky falls on his face( I think suit was enough to sting )- just for creating comedy.
Tat flower plot scenes was so predictable from the first look.
d) FL acting is average and has got a lot of room for improvement. She started strong but now she turned into an assistant role to hero, total mismatch to her topdog character of a famous law firm- kdrama cliche.

e) Some show off scenes of Song are really good but he is not that good in a dark hero role. Even now, viewers don't know what is in his mind. No emotional attachment.
f) Almost all father daughter scenes were poor and not emotionally or atleast comically involving.
g) FL walking style and dance - really funny
h)I think negative characters are performing good especially the villain and we can easily get that negative vibes from them.
i) Great potential for love angle.
j) leads chemistry also good.

“Annoying Slapstick”
Some described this series as a “dark comedy” but I beg to disagree. By proper definition, a dark comedy is one that makes light of a subject matter that is generally considered taboo or painful to discuss. There was nothing of that sort in this painful to watch drama that was full of annoying slapstick and exaggerated actions specially by the female lead who was supposed to portray a respectable and dignified lawyer. The rest of the cast members were as clumsy and absurd which made it all the more irritating. As for the main man - Song Joong Ki as crime boss adviser Vincenzo - his youthful, good boy appearance was not the sensible representation of someone belonging to the fearsome Mafia hierarchy. Nothing seemed to make sense. A ridiculous waste of $18M budget as well as a regretful waste of 20 hours of my time.

Overrated BUT a good drama!
pros:
- the acting: wow. the whole cast did an AMAZING job. I can't fault their acting at all. They all had brilliant chemistry with one another and I felt every emotion they wanted to portray. Bravo to the whole cast!
- the comedy next to the gore: on the contrary to what most have said about the comedy being out of place with the violence, I actually really enjoyed the stark contrast. Big fan of dark comedy lol kept things light enough to make the series not to feel too draining and gave everyone some depth in their personalities.
- fun villains! and I fell in love with some of the side characters because they were so charming.
- wowee, the ROMANCE!!!: Vincenzo did best was the romance. SJK and JYB have sizzling insane chemistry. Their romance reminded me of my fave anime, City Hunter, where they fall in love while working together and then becoming the cutest dream team ever. It was a mature romance where they mutually supported each other in healthy ways. If it weren't for the romance, I would have dropped this episode 4.
- a snazzy FL!

cons:
- plot was weak: with the rating and raging reviews, I was expecting an explosive plot but instead, the backseat romance storyline saved the drama imo. The plot was typical, predictable and overall meh.
- draggy: should have been a 16 episode drama. skipped loadsssssss from episode 10-19. I finished it so quickly bc i skipped so much lol i i get that it was meant to be slow-paced, slow burn or whatever but with a drama about mafia, it would have been better if it was punchy and to the point.
- ik this was not meant to be a romance drama, but it should have been. i would have rated this a 10 if they let the romance develop a bit more. they had two strong characters and actors with such chemistry and plenty leeway to make something more happen than what did. I don't think it would have taken away from the plot which i already lost interest in episode 4, but would have gave it more stability and would have made the ML seem more... human lol instead, a lot of screentime was wasted on god knows what on random characters (loved the side characters but didn't need to see them THAT much). idm the ML being super OP and perfect, but felt it was too extreme bc they didnt flesh out the more 'human' side of him, like loving others. which would have been interesting since ppl in the mafia are meant to be heartless.
- the ending was disappointing. they could have wrapped up the story so much better, like seeing the FL actually on his island. it just felt wishy washy that they threw in a kiss to a romance they hadn't even bothered to develop.

overall, 7.5/10. it was a good drama, no doubt. but not as good as it was hyped up to be. haven't watched kdramas in a while so this was nice first one in a while. do i recommend? a tentative yes. just go in with lower expectations. looking forward to the casts' future projects!

Almost perfect, if it wasn’t for one episode
I went into this show with high expectations - I had heard that this was the best show of 2021 - and for the most part I wasn’t disappointed. The acting, plot and music all go together perfectly and the show doesn’t get boring.

However, I was hugely disappointed by episode 8. I felt like they wanted to have lgbt representation but it came off slightly h*mophobic. The whole thing of manipulating the gay ceo and then using his phobia against him seemed too cruel just for a plot point that doesn’t get mentioned after that much. If it wasn’t for that episode i would have no complaints

Overall, it was an enjoyable series :)

If you go in expecting seriousness, violence and a thrill - then you'll be disappointed.
Contrary to all the mediocre reviews on here which are written around the time of the show's release (and hype) - I'm writing from when the hype is long dead and I'm now watching it a few months on.

I do think if I watched this during the hype, it would have been disappointing, but having gone into the show with no expectations - I thoroughly enjoyed it very much. I also wasn't an SJK fangirl before watching the show, having seen him in Descendants of the Sun (and didn't fall in love with him during that time like everyone else lol) - I can safely say that after watching this I am very impressed with his acting and can see why he is popular not just because of his looks.

If you go in expecting seriousness, violence and a thrill - then you'll be disappointed.
It's a show that's serious but with a funny undertone, where the undertone sometimes overpowers the seriousness (?) I loved that they took the Mafia genre known for being dark/violent- and flipped it on it's head by injecting some good old K-Drama cliches, tropes and humour which I loved. Yet at the same time retaining the violence and Vincenzo's anti-hero character throughout the show.

To some, the sudden gag moments may be jarring, though I found them laugh out loud funny and didn't find them jarring at all, but well timed. The absolute fan-service story-writing does undermine the seriousness, but if anything it made me love the show even more. As a long time KDrama viewer, I actually found these cliches comforting. Can I join the consigliere fanclub too?

This does all come from a place of glorifying the Mafia/violence, which can be problematic to younger viewers however.

Were there plot holes? Yes. Could the characters be written and explored better? Yes.
But only yes if you're taking the show too seriously with high expectations, rather than a typical K-Drama (and from the trailer I can see why they may have overhyped it too much as something else). That's not to say K-Dramas can't be of quality writing and there sure are plenty out there. However, it seems to me that the writers wrote it as a timeless K-Drama piece to be enjoyed whenever and wherever, rather than some next-level disruptive show with some deep meaning. They wrote it knowing and intending it for the international K-Drama lovers - who specifically watch K-Dramas for their cliches and tropes across time.

Loved all the many easter eggs, Taecyeon's acting was fantastic. The quality of shooting , editing and cinematics are very impressive. I am a SJK fan convert and I can see why he is daddy now.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT
There is not one thing about this I did not like. Story of a Korean boy adopted by an Italian mafia family. The ML is perfect for the role. When he speaks Italian (which I read is his voice) it will make you swoon. The FL is gorgeous, funny and quirky. The tenants in the building Vincenzo is trying to save are very interesting and also very funny. The ML bad guy is pure evil and he and Vincenzo make for evenly matched adversaries. Even my husband enjoyed watching it and is the only K drama he watched to the end. The ending makes a Season 2 look possible. Please have a Season 2!!!!!!!!

I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH
ok well where do i start..

story:
the story is intense, keeps you on your toes, but also has so many funny moments that just make you laugh out loud. the chemistry between the 2 main leads is INSANE. i binged this whole show in like 2 days because it was so hard to stop watching. every episode had like a cliffhanger of some sort. when i first started it, i didn't know what to expect because the introduction mentioned ""italian mafia"", but as i was getting into the 3rd episode that's when i was like holy shit this is so good. the main character is vincenzo cassano (빈센조) and he's from the italian mafia, but he goes to korea to do some things and he meets the residents of geuma plaza (idk if i spelt that right).

acting cast:
as i mentioned, the main leads' chemistry with eachother is amazing, they're both hella attractive and amazing at acting. the actors playing villains were also super super talented!

music:
tbh i didn't pay that much attention to the music, but the music rly made some scenes more intense or funny.

rewatch value:
since i just finished watching it, it'll be a couple months before i want to watch it again, but i probably will in the future! there are some scenes where i had to look away for a couple seconds tho lol

overall:
amazing drama, i hope there is a season 2. this is the 1 from the 3 dramas that i have put 10 stars for, and i've watched a tonn of dramas :)

*Crazy, funny, dark, best of revenge !*
It had a lot more humor than I'd expected. The poster looks perfect, a really good choice to my taste but don't let it fool you.

What I liked the most ...
* romance it's not all over the place. It could ruin the show but it's nothing like that
* side characters are strong. You'll be surprised in each episode (Jang Han Seo, you'll have a special place in my memory)
* If you are willing to see, there are a few important life lessons. Like unity from strength, choices you made kind of thing etc. Which raises its rewatch value for me
*It is dark and humurous at the same time. One episode you want to rip your hair (or that character's lol) the next you have a huge smile on your face
* OST. IS. SO. COOL.

What could be more...
* a season 2 please!

[insert italian music here] mamma mia, what a boring watch!
This show had a great premise: an anti-hero, a female lead who isn't all pure and innocent, bad guys who are actually badder than bad and straight up evil and an adorable pool of side characters around the anti-hero who bring out his good side and his bad side.

Now, notice how I said the show had a great premise? Well, it's a shame that they fumbled the bag.

The show suffers from being too long; in a world of kdramas that are 17 episodes, Vincenzo decided to be quirky and do 20 episodes. 20 long, drawn out, draining episodes this show consisted of. The middle suffers the worst with this, the constant rinse and repeated cycled of bad guys plotting, Vincenzo finds out, he stops their plotting and they get mad and decide to plot more to get back at him, so on and so forth. It felt like I was watching the same episode four times with how often they repeated this cycle over and over again. You can have too much of something and Vincenzo really kept adding to the plate even though I said I was stuffed and didn't want anymore.

The obvious problems with the show:

- How comically evil the main bad guy was. He was a hidden bad guy but then he was revealed and he was just so comically evil. Killing people left right and centre, greedy and it's stated he was diagnosed as a psychopath at 16 after killing four classmates. Like, uh obviously, we didn't need a diagnosis to know that. I don't even know what his actual goals are for being so evil; does he want more money? Does he want to quash the backlash his company is facing? Or does he just hate Vincenzo that much he would do anything to stop him? I don't know. I mean, I guess it's all three? But they're just so shallow. The end was satisfying at least but it just got to a point where I wanted him gone not because I hated him, but because I was so bored of him.

- The 20 episodes. They dragged out a lot of storylines that didn't need to be dragged out. Fighting the case against Babel, trying to get the gold, avenging the death of a character - it just drags on SO much. Like, I'm not kidding, they have 20 episodes of the same thing of them trying to bring down Babel and they barely succeed time and time again. I'm just as exhausted as the characters watching them try to bring down the company. The pacing of the show was all over the place and completely destroyed my enjoyment of the show.

- The characters. Now, they weren't BAD per se but as i said before, comically evil bad guys who really do go above and beyond to be bad, and then Vincenzo just seems this completely untouchable anti-hero. He's always one step ahead and he's unbeatable. I do, however, like how they never completely redeemed Vincenzo - in fact, I would say that there's a moment where he's on the path to redemption and you notice it in his appearance in how he is adopting a more South Korean style with his hair and wearing lighter suits as well. Then an event happens that makes Vincenzo revert right back and you see it in his wardrobe, he's back to wearing the black and white suits and his hair is back to it's usual brushed back style. I loved this little detail and I've not seen anyone notice it but I just loved the fact they never made Vincenzo a good guy - he's not evil, he's done terrible, bad things but he's not evil. But if that's the case, then that means he's never had any character development either. He's the exact same as he was at the start of the show and he's made no progress except from the fact he's accepted that this is just his nature and he can't change.

What I liked:
-Han-seo. That's it. That's the tweet. I love him and I would die for him and I would tear apart the entire world for him to protect him. Han-seo is the most tragic character in the entire show and Dong-yeon was fantastic in portraying just how much of a broken person Han-seo is. Han-seo grew up under his tyrannical and abusive older brother whose abuse towards his younger brother got so bad it resulted in Han-seo's parents having to drug Han-seo to the point he could not remember the abuse, eventually affecting his own mental state. He's not the brightest crayon in the box but there's also the fact that most of it is an act. He plays up to the fact everyone thinks he's an idiot because he knows it's the only way to protect himself.

Just watching Han-seo is so heartbreaking because he continues to be a pawn to his older brother's machinations and is still being abused to this day but he doesn't fight back because his brother is all that he has and you then realise Han-seo's ultimate goal: he just wants an older brother and he wants to be safe from the abuse he has continued to endure since birth. God, I'm even tearing up writing about this because of how tragic of a character he is. The only reason he is on the side of the bad guys is because he's afraid and he was always afraid of his brother because he knows his brother is a psychopath and would not hesitate to kill Han-seo.

What makes Han-seo more tragic is that he does get what he wants: he finds that brotherly love he's always wanted in Vincenzo who, while initially not really caring for Han-seo, begins to care for him and even calls him his dongsaeng while letting Han-seo call him Vin-hyung. Han-seo sees Vincenzo as the ultimate big brother and says he knows Vincenzo can and will protect him and Vincenzo tries, God knows Vincenzo tries so hard, and Lord I'm tearing up typing this because this is literally the most tragic thing in Vincenzo. It just hurts even thinking about it because Han-seo was only ever a victim of circumstances and never gets to get out of that, he never gets to stop being a victim.

I can barely see through my tears right now what with writing about Han-seo, so I'm going to leave it here.

To round up:
I love Han-seo and he's the only reason i kept watching the show. If you like Mafia intrigue, a side of barely there romance and to see bad guys actually commit horrendous crimes instead of just plotting, then I guess this is the show for you.

Oh yeah, I forgot about the romance. Well, it's there, kinda. Yeah.

Anyways, it wasn't the worst thing to watch, nor was it the best. I will never rewatch this show even though I do love Han-seo and Dong-yeon. I watched this show over the span of two/three months instead of binge watching it. Glad I didn't waste sleep binge watching.

Oh my god, this was so good
What can I say, this drama was extremely good. The plot was really intriguing and the characters were super well crafted. This show gave us one scary villain, I mean that dude made me anxious anytime he was on screen. I hated him but he was also super cute so I couldn't help but ogle at him. He didn't beat Vincenzo though, that dude is hot as heck. Especially in turtlenecks might I add. Anyway, let me get on to the actual review.
Story, 10/10:
I really enjoyed the plot of this show, I found it really unique and unlike anything I'd seen before. It was quite violent so those with faint hearts shouldn't watch but I didn't mind too much. I skipped the scenes I thought would be too graphic but for the most part, it was fine. The gold plotline was really fun to watch unfold and the main plot was really gripping so I was never not hooked. My favorite character was definitely Cha-Young but I liked Vincenzo almost the same amount so I'd call it a tie. I do have one gripe with this and that is the decision to kill Vincenzo's mother. Surely Han-Seok was smart enough to know not to mess with the family of a person in the mafia but he did and then seemed surprised when Vincenzo got upset and the whole incident happened. It seemed too dumb of a decision for a man of his intelligence to make but who knows.
Acting, 10/10:
I think the acting in this is fantastic. The most impressive acting in my eyes came from the guy who played Jang Han-Seok. He portrayed this monster of a man so believably I felt genuinely frightened of him. I would've been more frightened if he wasn't so darn attractive but that isn't the point. The actors who played Cha-Young and Vincenzo also gave very excellent performances.
The soundtrack, 9/10:
I think the music in this was pretty good but it wasn't the best I've heard. However, it fit the show so well that I could excuse that.
Rewatchiblity,3/10:
I enjoyed this show a lot but it isn't one I think can be rewatched. It has too many twists and turns that I think rewatching it wouldn't be as fun. But that is only my opinion.
Overall,10/10:
I think this show is amazing and I highly recommend you watch it. It is quite violent so I think it's not for everyone but if you can handle that stuff then you should watch this.

Have you ever had a crazy dream you've never wanted to wake up from?
I've read some of the reviews to this series, but depending on your taste on things you like to watch than you'll know if you will enjoy this series or not. For example: if you enjoy movies like True Lies, MCU (both series and movies), Fast and Furious, James Bond movies, Treadstone, John Wick, Star Wars, etc., than you'll enjoy this series. Personally, I like to watch things that help me escape from my very hectic and stressful life, so shows and movies like Vincenzo, W, Memories of Alhambra, and the movies and shows already mentioned above really hit the spot. Plus, as a teacher, aunt, a niece, a cousin, a daughter, a sister and especially a mother, you don't want kids thinking things like this happen in real life. Nowadays, the graphics on these shows make things seem plausible. Not everyone, as well, are responsible and watch things first before allowing their kids to see things (or if it's suitable for their age) to take a moment after watching shows like this and explain things for them. For example: when the 1st movie of Fast and Furious came out there is a scene where Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), and Vince (Matt Schulze) leave to rob a truck driver. In that scene, the car Letty is in (which if I'm remembering correctly) is a Honda. I, myself, being a daughter of a truck driver and being Puerto Rican (which lots of us have or have had own a Honda/Toyota/Mazda/Nissan) automatically knew it's not possible. Nevertheless, after the movie was released in theaters, I'm listening to the news and the anchors are reporting that some teens tried to imitate that scene. Since then, there has been a disclaimer to the Fast and Furious movies. FYI: Still to this day, my baby boy, who turned 20 this past September, when I see something, whether it's a commercial, show, movie, or anime I go to him and tell him ""you know...this doesn't happen in real life, right?"" He'll roll his eyes and tell me, ""yes mom, I'm highly aware"" and lets out a big sigh. And if it's a movie/show, like the Titanic that the event happened, but the storyline is fake, I let him know as well. The point to all this is that even though Vincenzo is a movie, the graphics are great, the actors, whether they the main characters, supporting characters, or just had minor scenes, they ALL did a Fantastic job. Plus, they didn't write the script, they are just performing it. Nevertheless, it's always good to get lost from reality for a bit. Whether you do it by going to church, reading a good book, going to the beach, going for a massage or spa day, or by turning on the television and enjoying the TV for a few. In this aspect, I believe Vincenzo is a MUST WATCH.

Friendship
This is my first kdrama so it will always have a special place in my life. It came on my Netflix suggestions and I finally decided one day to give it a shot. I was so excited and overwhelmed from the first episode itself. It has a good story, an amazing cast and the antagonist does get on your nerve. The thing I loved most about this drama is how they portrayed developed friendships. Vincenzo came to live in this quite nit community. At first he was not welcome but due to his helping nature and inner purpose he helped the community and became each member’s close friend. Since it based on a mafia environment. It has a proper blend of stealth, heists, action and suspense. It also teaches you lessons about life and behavior. The antagonist wasn’t raised properly and neglected by his family. Still it doesn’t give him the excuse to harm others. Whereas the protagonist was raised in a Mafia family. He still had morals and didn’t harm innocent lives. So, I recommend you watch this show to explore a story about friendship & morality.

This is on my top list of best dramas
1. I came expecting nothing, a mafia concierge born in Korea and coming back to korea
2. No romance but a couple fighting crime
3. Didn't know any of Jeon Yeo Bin dramas, and wasnt a fan of Song Joon Ki because I couldn't bear watching DOS
4. comedy, thriller, drama, mafia genres
5. like 2% of romance

Let me tell you
1. The plot is not all that, is more far and beyond
2. Never been a fance of thriller, crimes etc. but romance but I enjoyed every single interaction of the main leads like I was watching a romance drama.
3. After Vincenzo one year later, I still can't let go of my love for this drama and the main leads I became instantly a fan of both Jeonki together or in separate projects (but deep inside i want them to reunite in another project)
4. I never knew they could blend all these genres and make a beautiful drama that will be in my memory forever, they blended all this elements that one minute I was laughing my a..off then i was scared then I was mad Ohh my Gosh all the feelings, I would wake up every Saturday and Monday to watch 1.20 hrs of episode which took me like 3 hours because of the rewatch value, never happened before ever.
5. Yes romance is like very soft, slow born and minimal but every single scene is about them being together sparkling enormous chemistry.

So yes, even me been biased because I love everything about this drama, please don't get fooled by episode 1, I did get hooked since episode one but Ive hear many of my fellow Vincenzo fans took until episode to really kick off on them so yeah give it a try will not dissapoint.

OST-wise they don't have many songs but the few they have are in my mind 24/7 my ringtone is Ill always be by your side and I change it eventually to Adrenaline.

Rewatchable value 100%

BTW, I never give reviews but I thought I needed to for future viewers not that the drama doesn't have a high rating but because is well deserved direction and writing is phenomenal plus the acting of every support cast. Give it a try you won't get dissapointed.

It’s exciting but it definitely have flaws
I have to say that Vincenzo can be an awesome drama if you don't think too much and I understand the hype as the drama do have some good things. But Vincenzo was slow to captivate me, I only started to really like the drama after episode 6/7 and altought I do think it's a good drama, it does have some serious flaws.

First, the concept of mafia, revenge, corruption and ""only evil people can fight evil people"" are very interesting but mixing these heavy themes with comedy was TERRIBLE. Of course this is my person opinion and for some people it may have made the drama easier to watch but for me the themes in Vincenzo doesn't match with comedy. The ""funny"" scenes was too much sometimes and even made some things look inappropriate. For example, how could they make an episode with an LGBT character so stereotyped? If we analyze the whole situation with the character, everything was seen as pure comedy, including his ""romantic"" scenes with Vincenzo. I honestly found it quite how they portrayed the character in such a stereotypical and comical way, and Vincenzo's reactions to everything didn't help either. I can totally understand if the LGBT+ community felt disrespected. The scene with the pigeon saving Vincenzo was too cringe too and it was like I was watching a cringe comedy drama or something lol Besides the comedy, this drama have another problem: Vincenzo is smart most of the time, except when the script needed him to be dumb. The way they make Vincenzo look invincible but suddenly become dumb or impotent makes the plot loose credibility and it doesn't make sense to everything they created about the character.

Other thing I didn't like was the sound effects. I understand that its necessary to have some sound effects to make some scenes look more impacting but they use this TOO MUCH in Vincenzo, its unreal. You don't need to use sound effects ALL THE TIME to make the scene look impactful. The way the characters act, the characters lines, or even the actors acting could already do that. This frequent use of sound effects in Vincenzo pissed me off a lot and was one of the things I hated most about the drama. Sometimes it made it seem like the drama was a cartoon and If the scenes did looked impactful was thankfully to the ACTORS good acting.

Talking now about the characters, I have mixed opinions. Vincenzo was too invincible. Sure, his fighting scenes with the bad guys was really great and exciting but sometimes it looked unreal because it was like everyone else was too weak for him (except, like I said, when the plot needed him to be weak). Joo Won for example, he's a great villain but that is only because Taecyeon made happen because talking as a character, compared to Vincenzo, Joo Woon was complete powerless. But I cannot lie, besides that, I did enjoy Vincenzo, he's charming and I think Song Joongki really did a great job here. (I just wished he wasn't that powerful all the time and the whole episode with the LGBT character didn't happened). Joon Woo was an exciting character as well. Sometimes I thought that the acting was too much but most of the time Taecyeon was fenomenal and portrayed the character really well. His scenes with Han Seo was SO POWERFUL, I loved to hate him. But altought I liked his scenes and thought the character was exciting, the character decline a little in half of the drama. In the beginning, Joon Woo looked like a cold psychopath but then later he looked like a spoiled child. We had 20 episodes so I think we could had some episodes to show a little more about him. Not to mention that as I said, although he's a villain, the character was completely powerless compared to Vincenzo so I wish they had made a villain more at the level of the main lead. And omg it doesn't make sense for Joon Woo not have any good security to protect him. The guy has to go to prison because he can't escape Vincenzo (a one man) and a few other guys chasing him. Han Seo was a cute character and I hated his ending so much omg NOTHING in that scene made sense, it was like the screenwriter just wanted to kill the character out of nowhere, my baby deserved more :( Chayoung was REALLY ANNOYING for me, her reactions was too much. I don't think is Yeo Bin`s fault as I know she can act its just the character is too forced sometimes. She does get better later and I started to like her a little bit but she could have been more great and in the end, they lost an opportunity to make a badass and more important character, she was there just to be Vincenzo`s partner. The other prosecutor was annoying for me as well.

Some people didn't liked the couple but personally I didn't have problem with it, some scenes was cute to me. I do think we didn't need a couple in this drama but as romance isn't the main plot it's not like we had a real couple with real romantic scenes. Actually both main lead acted more like partners most of the time and their feelings was just showed to each other in the end. (maybe for fanservice? who knows lol)

Everything said, Vincenzo do have some good things like the cinematography, OST, the characters are good looking and some of them, charming, the dark concept is interesting, the acting is great and for people who always like couples in everything, they also have it. I was really immersed in the last episodes and If you watch Vincenzo without thinking and analyzing too much it can be a good drama. The references used in some episodes were very interesting too. But the bad construction of the plot the heavy themes mixed with comedy, the characters losing sustainability in some episodes and the damn sound effect in EVERY SCENE made the drama least impactful. It's sad because this drama could easily been a 10/10 for me if wasn't these problems. After all, I think Vincenzo will be one of the dramas that will become necessary for every kdrama addicted to watch, whether they love it, hate it, or think it's so-so.

A Power-packed Drama which may not please everyone but personally loved it as a whole!!
At first I must say that this drama is not everyone's cup of tea. This is my first review as I saw many reviews bashing it and that could be misleading, at least for someone like me who could love everything about this.

From my POV, it is neither overrated nor underrated. The actors did their part perfectly. Song joong ki and Taecyeon is not just about looks as we all know. Jeon yeo been may seem extra for some but I loved her her character, beautiful, bold and ""careless"" about other's backbiting which I appreciate a lot. The plaza people were annoying at times, but I loved them a lot in the last episodes. Kim yeo Jin who played the role of prosecutor Choi has made me hate her a lot because of her acting which was unbelievably perfect. Kwak dong Yeon who played Han Seo became everyone's sweetheart at last.

Vincenzo's Italian was so accurate and I really liked it. It has a lot of slow motions which some people may not like, but I did like it. The story is quite new to me as I haven't watched any dramas like this before. A mafia fighting for justice despite the bloody laws in the world was quite new. But the story was predictable at times. Every episode ends with a cliffhanger and I watched it in a one go. I still regret being not able to watch it as ongoing because of my exams. The thrill could have been of another level for the ones who watched it ongoing. I am so jealous of them.

Many may not like the drama cause even if they are lawyers, Vincenzo's character is a mafia, an antihero who does not abide the law in many ways. But it was convincing compared to the current law system which depend on the conglomerates. This story is about a man who was an evil punishing another Evil and yeah, some people can't take the fact. We could see ""logic-less "" scenes which are common in kdramas. This drama is of course not for people who love romance genre as it includes very less romantic cliche`s and skin ships. It could be viewed as a thrilling, yet comedy at many levels. TBH, I laughed with excitement while watching this rather than the comedies. Many scenes were hilarious while others didn't make me laugh at all. The Corn Salad and Vincenzo fan club was quite funny for me. I really loved the Cassano Family who played a great part in comedies.

Finally, I should say that the villains were really amazing. Their acting has made me even hate them for real. Taecyeon and the prosecutor Choi did their role perfectly. I was amazed by their character transformation. The final episodes was exciting, heartbreaking, and really thrilling.
An unsatisfactory drama won't achieve the excellent kdrama award and a 2 digit rating in Korea, right?

To Summarise, I really really really liked it. Recommend it for everyone who like thrilling dark comedy series.

Thrilling, funny and emotional.
I absolutely loved the drama, it had everything you needed in a great show. Comedic scenes, thrilling scenes, romance, brutal scenes, a perfect all round drama. Definitely recommend watching as it will not disappoint and I loved the direction too. Vincenzo is the best anti-hero in kdrama history, an amazingly well written character, despite his evils, he will still make you love him and Song Joongki absolutely outperformed the role, his acting was top tier. All roles were acted perfectly, will definitely miss my fave weekend drama!

Best drama i've ever seen, just watch it.
truly awesome, must watch just watch it.It is the best one for me.It is one of those special we only get to see in a very long time. All the actors are great, all character are great , ost is superb, fighting scenes are great story ,just seeing the initial 5 min i felt it was going to be awesome, and it was way greater than my expectation. Superb comedy main leads are good looking and have good chemistry. It is the first one i'm writing a review for. Don't know when i will be able to something great as this. It was great combination of comedy , action, a little bit of romance , have mafia, mind battles etc. Just put it at priority , stop watching currect series if watching any just watch it.

This is a story about the lesser of two evils.
I came to this drama, about a year later, it's been on my Netflix main page staring at me for a while, and since I need something to distract myself after the university exams, I decided to give it a try. So I went somewhat blindly. I didn't read any reviews, which for what i can see are very mix, with people liking it and other people totally despising it, and I get it, this drama isn't for everyone, I think is an acquired taste.

This drama starts slow, but eventually it picks up the pace, and then you are hooked up, and watching the next episode. Because something this drama does well is cliffhangers.

This drama follows main character Vincenzo Cassano, an Italian mafia consigliere, and just by that description we can tell he is not a good guy, not even close, he is an anti-hero though-and-through and i love the writers for sticking to their guns and keep him like this to the very end. Then, we have the counterpart, Hong Cha-Young, that is someone who is willing to go to any length to win a case, even if that means less legal stuff. And with this, we have the killer duo together to fight their common enemy Babel Group. Next, we have the ""villains"" of the show. I liked the whole concept they created for the main villain, but i think the execution wasn't the best as he relied a lot on other people to do his dirty work, and I feel that consequently that was his down fall. For me Choi Myung-Hee, at times felt more like the real thing, she felt more like the actual villain, but i guess she was only doing what she was told too.

This drama is a commentary on corruption and the web of bribes, favors and money that basically controls it all, even justice. This drama, to me, in a way, serves as catharsis, someone came and gave the bad guys what they deserved, he did what normal people can't do and sometimes want to, make the evil people pay for their sins. Vincenzo isn't a good guy, and he never claimed to be, he is the lesser of two evils, he is the devil fighting another devil.

In a lighter note, this drama is also filled with quirky comedy, and a cast of surprisingly entertaining people, like the tenants of Geumga Plaza. I think they were endearing and fun to watch, and without them half of the things that happened wouldn't have happen.

There's a very buried romance subplot with the main characters, that only comes to some fruition at the end, and honestly never did I feel so frustrated with a couple before, they acted almost like they were married, but only in the last minutes, of the last episode is that they finally admitted it. But, for a drama that isn't about romance, this couple his one of the heathiest non-toxic relationships I've ever seen in a drama.

This story is full of twists and turns, some predictable, some unpredictable and others straight out ridiculous, but I think that's what makes this drama good. Sometimes my predictions for what happens next were right, and other times they were wrong, because cliché isn't necessarily bad, and when well done can be as good as something unpredictable.

Acting/Cast: I need to congratulate the casting director because he nailed it, I honestly can't see anyone else playing this characters, from the main one to the side ones. Song Joong-Ki was great in is role, i love the
duality he had, one moment he looked adorable and innocent, and in the next one a cold-blood killer, and honestly this man's eyes tell all the story alone, I could tell what he was feeling by just looking at his eyes. Jeon Yeo-Been was also great, i found her over the top acting a bit annoying in the beginning, but as time went by I start finding it quite funny nad adorable. Kwak Dong-Yeon, I’ve seen in dramas before and I really like him, and honestly, he stole my heart in this drama, and even made me cry (and that's something, as i rarely cry watching anything), I think he's acting was superb. Kim Yeo-Jin was amazing, she really made me hate Myung-Hee with all my heart and honestly, it's been a while since I despised a character this much. The rest of cast were also great in their roles and made me love every single one of their characters. And last but not least, we have to talk about Ok Taecyeon, he stole the show with is acting, principally because of how much he improved from the last drama I saw with him, he was brilliant in this role and deserves an award, and i won't say more cause i don't want to spoil anything.

As for the cinematography, was good, nothing out of this world, but it did the job well. The OST was also fitting, and i really enjoyed some of the songs, and they are now part of my playlist.

Side note, i really applaud Song Joon-Ki for his effort on trying to speak Italian as best has he could, I’m totally sure it wasn't easy, as Korean as nothing to do with Italian, and as someone who’s first language is a Latin one and still finds Italian hard, Joon-Ki was incredibly good, and was also funny to hear him curse in Italian.

Will I watch this drama again? I don't know, I'm not the type to rewatch dramas, principally those who have plot twists, as the second time around isn't as enjoyable, so it's more a no then a yes, but we will see. Do I recommend it? Yes, if you like dark comedy, very light romance and moral greyness. I think this drama is not for everyone, and that some people won't like it and that’s okay. To me it was a good drama that I enjoyed every single moment of. I think if you can get through the first couple of episodes and get use to the style, you will like it, and by the last couple of episodes you'll be in the edge of your seat. Overall, I think this drama it's a dark but fun watch.

So much potential, but it wasn't used.....
I waited until after the show finished airing to watch it, because honestly, I like to binge watch tv, instead of waiting each week to watch one new episode. Honestly, I somewhat think that I should have made an exception for this. Not because I thought the show was so amazingly good that I could have stuck it out, but because I saw so many good things about it on social media, and when I finally got around to watching it, I went in with such high expectations and I am quite sad that it did not meet them. So maybe my opinion would have different, but now we will never know.

Plot: When looking at a basic synopsis of the show, you are given so little to what the show is actually about. One could argue that the main goal of the show is about finding the gold and getting it out or not. It seemed to be the only reason Vincenzo would flee to Korea in the first place. The show starts with that being the main goal, but very quickly that is pretty much put on the sidelines. At one point or another, I honestly forgot why Vincenzo was even there in the first place, it seemed like he was destined to help the FL bring down the bad guys. Then you are randomly brought back to why he was actually there in the first place, finding the gold, stealing it, fleeing, and becoming rich. The audience gets used to the plot being helping fight bad guys in Korea instead of just getting gold and leaving again. Which would have been fine, but randomly throwing in times when people from Vincenzo’s mafia life in Italia, made those moments seem random. Other than when the antagonists purposely used the Mafia members in hopes of killing Vincenzo, the random bits of Mafia members showing up, I thought did not really add to the story itself.

Character Development: I wish I was shown more character development, in this type of show, where there is very much good vs evil, there would be room for characters to develop and become “mature”, but it was lacking. We are shown small bits of character development, just by certain people changing their actions, but then realizing that they were just faking it all to begin with. Jang Han-Seo, I felt was the only character that had a general change of mind and heart, but he was so wishy-washy about it all. Every time I felt that maybe he had finally grown, he would do something that proved it wrong. If Han-Seo had held all that anger and hatred towards his brother, like he said multiple times, then why was it always back and forth? Why wouldn’t he have realized what he actually wanted earlier on? How many more people had to die, before Han-Seo made his choice? As well as maybe I am looking at it a bit too realistically but look at the people who lived in the Plaza. Before Vincenzo showed up, these people were depicted as normal people just trying to make a living to survive and people not wanting to give up their home for redevelopment in town. How is it that these “normal citizens” are not phased at all when any crime happening in the plaza? Within the very first episodes of the show, Vincenzo throws someone through a window and no questions were asked, no comments made, it was almost as if that sort of thing happens in normal day life. Where was the hesitation from these “normal people”? Wouldn’t have these people called the police or at the very least at least question the whole thing??

FL & ML: Initially, I did not care if the FL & ML had a relationship or not. Of course, the chemistry between the two was present, but the show made it seem like some random thing to throw in, in the mist of all this violence. I was honestly rather thrown off by how easily Hong Cha-Young started to develop feelings for Vincenzo. I say this partly because of their differences in lifestyle, not that someone cannot go out with a member of the Mafia, more what they spoke about before so much violence occurred. The two had a conversation about what it is Vincenzo did when he was in the Mafia fully, whether he had killed people and if he was going to kill people going forward. Vincenzo lied and told her that he had not killed people previously and would not kill people going forward. We are shown dreams/nightmares of the ML killing in the past and then after this conversation, the killing begins. I was generally surprised by how easily Cha-Young was okay with all the killing and torture that Vincenzo used throughout the show. Cha-Young is depicted as a strong independent woman, the type that would not stand down, but very quickly she had a change of mind about the violence.

The Bad Guys: Now we are getting to the villains, Jang Jun-Woo and Choi Myung Hee. These two did a phenomenal job at playing the villains of the show. Honestly, I found myself getting so into the show because of how heated I was at these two. Every time I thought that maybe Vincenzo and team would have things go easily, these two threw something in their path to throw them off. But these were still never good enough to beat Vincenzo, they kept blaming it on the fact that Vincenzo was in the Mafia, but I don’t think that was it. Ultimately, I think that even though they were depicted as evil, strong, and willing to do anything, they were still just weak. Personally, I thought that former prosecutor Choi Myung Hee was more of a villain than Jun-Woo, I hated her character even more than the real head of Babel. She was so self-conceited even more than the psychopath that was the “ultimate” villain. When we learn finally about Jang Jun-Woo’s past, that was the moment I finally started to take him seriously. Before this, he was just some ridiculously angry kid and Myung Hee in her own was telling him what to do, even if he did not notice it. After hearing the past, he was not just some stupid kid, he was a literal psychopath, which in the end added to his character.

Final/e Thoughts: All I wanted for the end was not for them to find the gold or the guillotine file or even for the FL and ML lead to live happily ever after. I wanted the villains to get what they deserved, because at that point justice wasn’t shit, all that mattered was that they would painfully die and that it would hopefully replace all the pain we had gained previously. The one and only character I was sad to see die was Han-Seo, he had finally shown his true colors, but was killed before he even had a chance to be free.

Dramedy with a good share of blood and slapstick humour
Although I was a longtime Song Joong Ki fan (since Sungkyunkwan Scandal), I wasn't initially drawn to watch Vincenzo. I thought the premise was a bit ridiculous, a Korean in the Italian mafia?

However, I decided to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed. I found the mix of comedy (albeit more slapstick than wit), drama, action, and melodrama (the bits with the parents of the main characters in particular), a very refreshing addition to the K-drama universe. I am honestly very tired of the usual K-drama tropes and melodramatic romantic stuff that has been seducing audiences for years, and continue to do so, while now masked into different time periods or mixing it up with the military or fantasy genres.

Cast and Acting
The entire cast was STELLAR, to say the least. I do agree there are many missed opportunities to develop the two main characters (I honestly really wanted Vincenzo's Korean/Italian childhood storyline to take off), however, I think they made up with the very solid performances of all of the support cast. I was endeared to most, if not, all of them, at certain points of the series, and each support character had a great contribution to the plot. They each brought a unique flair to their character, and I found myself chuckling quite a fair bit at the interactions they had with each other.

The main cast, however, tried their best with what little they had to work with. Nevertheless, I think the noteworthy performance by Song Joong Ki is during the scene where he threatened the Babel group after his mother got murdered. Ok Tacyeon deserves a lot of credit for managing the two personality extremes, though I much prefer his evil side. Jeon Yeo Bin's best performances were in the first half of the series; I think she fell a bit flat in the second half just because of how the storyline progressed. As for the romance portion, I was very satisfied with the lack of focus on this; it is somewhat forced into the storyline just because, but I think it makes sense that the two leads endeared to each other because of all the trauma they experienced together. I disagree that the acting fell short here: Vincenzo was already someone who kept his feelings to himself and is not someone who displays emotions easily, Song managed to capture this and expressed a lot of the subtle displays of affection quite well. As for Hong Cha-young, come on, who wouldn't fall in love with an invincible, intelligent, wealthy man, who supported her emotionally throughout, and with a cute face like that, seriously?

Storyline
Generally enjoyed the cat-and-mouse game between Babel and Jipuragi, but I felt the absurd number of deaths attributed to Babel too unbelievable. But then again, being the dramedy that it is, I don't expect all things to make sense. There's a lot of wacky comedy weaved into the serious topics of corruption in the business and legal worlds, justice and morality, and grief and death. I did not feel this was done in bad taste, though it might appear slipshod to some folks. Episodes were about 80-90 minutes, and this is the first time I've felt they were not too long. Perhaps it might be because there were so many characters and plots involved that I could not get enough of them. I really liked how this show presents us with the challenge to re-think what justice and morality ought to be (the juxtaposition between Hong senior and Vincenzo, Hong junior and Vincenzo, etc.). I am generally a Hong Yu Chan type, rosy-eyed and idealistic, and this drama helped me to explore different motivations that others might have in life. Pacing of the drama was an interesting mix of fast (for the action and comedy) and slow (for the sentimental parts).

Production
Cinematography and editing was another hit for me. I think the production team was experimenting a lot of the camera angles, and they were mostly successful in their attempts. Some individual shots of Vincenzo thinking or sleeping were questionable to me, but with the addition of the BGM, they didn't bother me as such. The CGI team really did a good job as well.

Music
The OST was commendable, and I actually went ahead and bought it on iTunes. There's a wider variety of musical genres in this OST, compared to most K-dramas (which feature mostly ballads). I particularly enjoyed Questo edificio è mio, Aalia's version of Adrenaline, and Holy Anger.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Vincenzo, and I am currently re-watching it. It might not be on par with the greatest black comedies ever made, but I think it does well enough. I actually prefer this series to Parasite (the movie). My personal favourite is Keeping Mum (2005) with Rowan Atkinson. Oh well, to each her (his) own.

Leverage
If you enjoyed the American show Leverage then this will more than satisfy yopur viewing needs. After reading all the bad reviews I decided top give it a shot anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The acting was good and the plot has more than enough twists to keep you interested until the very end. The second lead was evil personified I love Taceyeon anyway but seeing him as a villian like this was the first time for me. I highly recommend that you ignore the bad reviews and judge for yourself. The female lead can be a bit annoying but she does provide great comedic relief in tense situations JUst watch it okay and you will not be disappointed.

Funny, dark and bitter sweet.
Well! Where to start?
This drama honestly has it all. It wasn't quite what I was expecting either.
There's edge of your seat threat, violence, manipulation, deceit, blackmail, bullying and murder. That's balanced by laugh out loud humour, trust, loyalty, friendships and a bitter sweet plot.
Copious amounts of retribution are divinely dished out too.
Some truly awful characters and many I loved.
I wasn't keen on the lead female character (played by Jeon Yeo Bin) at first, but she quickly grew on me, with her quirky antics. SJK was sublime as Vincenzo and I loved Kwak Dong-yeon in this; he really made Han Seo come to life. A very different role for Ok Taecyeon too, so well portrayed.
The entire cast, who seem made to work so well together, were perfectly matched to their roles.
Clever story with twists, turns and some shocking moments. I also shed a few tears.
A superb watch.

Ok Taecyeon and Kim Yeojin steal the show
This drama, to be fair to it, is entertaining, funny, a bit over the top, but overall a good watch. Will definitely recommened to someone who wants a breezy chill watch after a particularly dark and exhausting drama.
BUT OMG I HAVE TO SAY OK TAECYEON IS BRILLIANT.!! KIM YEOJIN IS JUST A WHOLE REVELATION. I've never seen either of their works before so this was my first seeing them onscreen and I was not disappointed! The menace these 2 exude, and that too with CLASS.
I have to say, these 2 outshone everyone else in the show, in my opinion. After I finished the show I went and watched the Behind the scene videos, the whiplash is REAL. Ok Taecyeon is basically a puppy irl, but such a villain in the drama??? I will genuinely re-watch it just for him.
When their characters died, I felt immense satisfaction because I hated those characters so much!! That's a huge testament to any villain role actor
Great job, Kim Yeojin and Ok Taecyeon

Refreshing
Vincenzo is really a refreshing drama. The base story is actually quite used in dramas. A corapted company uses everyone and everything to be on top and a team tries to bring them down. But the way they use it and the whole plot is really new. Everyone more or less is a villain, this isn't a battle between the wrong and right. It is a battle between the wrong and the wronger (I don't even know if this words exists...). And it isn't dark, it is actually a comedy. I won't speak about the ethics or the morallity or the message this drama leaves behind, I saw a lot of people speaking about that in others reviews/comments. Even if I don't agree with the way things work on the drama, I don't think this is important. It isn't the type of series in which the viewer look to the meaning of life and the morals, at least for me there is series I watch for the messege and series I watch because they are refreshing, new and interesting ( like come on, everyone watched Game of Thrones and no one cared about the nonexisting morals or the violence -much worse than Vincenzo and people justified Ramsay-, everyone loved Daenerys and she burned everyone in the end). Moreover, the concept ""bad coglomerate/good lawyer with morals and fighting the evil in the right way"" is overused in k-dramas, no one would care about it. They had to do something different. And for me, fortunately they did it...

Vincenzo isn't a hero, not even an anti-hero, He is a villain, he knows it, we know it and he doesn't want or care to be nothing more. And I really like that and, even if sometimes a good redemption arc is really nice, Vincenzo doesn't need it. Or better, if he had one of those, he would be totally out of character. The only heroes is the residents of Geumga Plaza. Even Hong Cha Young is an anti-heroine. One more point of the plot, was the great characterization of women, Hong Cha Young, Choi Myung Hee, the women of Geumga plaza. Strong yet sensitive, memorable and interesting. It is really rare to watch a k-drama and love the FML. Overall, the only thing I personally didn't like was the end of Choi Myung Hee and Jang Han Seok, the plot as well the cinematography and the shots of the scenes was a bit too much and they weren't necessary.

Also, I have to speak about the cast. Everyone was really, really great, and I mean literally everyone. But I believe Ok Taecyeon and Kim Yeo Jin was fenomenal. They were psychos and I loved them.

Last but not least, aesthetically pleasing and amazing shots. I am an architect and this means a looot to me (completely symetrical shots with Song Joon Ki in the middle and amazing lights...). And of course, really good music and music themes. They were the perfect choice for every scene (The scene in the first episode with Vincenzo, the fire and this music is what made me think, Oh God, I love this.)

(English isn't my first language, so I am sorry for any mistakes.)

This is Dark Comedy guys!
The series description itself says this is “dark comedy”
Seeing most of the reviews saying the drama is overrated and it lacks the point, telling 10 rated comments didnt make sense...
Well I wanted to clear this out by pointing some of the key points people saying are “lacking”

“This drama is not fully crime concentrated.”

Well the screen writer of this drama is famous for his dark comedy scripts and Vincenzo itself is one of them. If you guys watch this drama expecting only crime, well I say... You might get disappointed.
Each episodes have its own essence of either crime or comedy.
This drama, contains standard comedy with a better crime theme. In the end, its however about the entertainment. With prior said, if you are into comedy, well you will be thrilled by the crime action scenes.

“About geumga plaza tenants”

I read many comments telling that the tenants scenes are just lagging and they dont make it up to the point.
Guys, the main theme is concentrated in the geumga plaza. So how could they avoid tenants?
And in my opinion, the cast did well potraying each characters beautifully.

“Vincenzo is not being overrated”

The cast and crew did an amazing job with this series. The plot,visuals, characters,osts are just “chef's kiss.” Just because it's a mix of dark-com, it doesnt make the drama any less thriller.

“The drama isn't romance biased”

Ofcourse it contains romance scenes but not any fluffy or lengthy.
Ms. Hong and Vincenzo are perfect couples. Their romance is mainly off screen. The story is showing only slightest peeks of their relationship.

If you're expecting more romance scenes from this drama, you may just stop now or might get disappointed in the end.


THIS IS A DRAMA! “DRAMA”
That being said, if you look for perfect logic, then why calling it drama?
Drama is all about dramatic plots and twists... And vincenzo, adds to it.

If you're ok with a drama being less logical,dramatic, thriller x comedy, less romantic...
Then this is recommended for you :')

All Star Cast, Amazing Acting, Compelling story, some inconsistencies
8/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Action and Crime drama with 20, approximately 80 minute episodes.

Park Joo-hyung (Song Joong-ki) grew up in Italy. At eight years old he was adopted and harbors resentment towards his Korean mother who he feels abandoned him. He later becomes part of the Italian mafia and is such an asset the head, Don Fabio, adopts him. As a member of the Cassano family Joo-hyung is renamed Vincenzo Cassano. He becomes a lawyer and utilizes his skill as he works as a representative for his adopted father in mafia dealings. When the father dies, the biological son attempt to kill Vincenzo and, after taking revenge, Vencenzo flees the country back to South Korea.

In Seoul, Vincenzo goes to the the Geumga Plaza which is a site where he helped a Chinese tycoon hide 1.5 tons of gold and install tenants to disguise the real intention of the building.
The Chinese tycooln is dead, and ownership of the gold now falls to the Cassano family, and Vincenzo plans to recover the gold for himself. Of course, the building has been taken over by a South Korean crime organization in the form of a pharmaceudical company, the Babel group. The Babel group has been strong arming the tenants so Vincenzo decides to team up with one of the tenants, a lawyer, to take down the Babel group. The lawyers daughter, Hong Cha-young (Jeno Yeo-been) was originally represting Babel but after her father is murdered by them, joins up with Vincenzo to exact revenge on the Babel Group. Sparks had originally flown between the two but as they unite toward a common purpose those strong feelings evolve to something more.

Overall, I liked this series a lot. All of the actors, and you had a pretty much all star cast with a few exceptions, did an amazing job acting out their characters. The storyline was exciting and the villians were incredibaly villanous. The whole ""it takes a villian to catch a villian"" axiom was true throughout the series. The chemistry between the two leads was not immediate, which made sense to me because they did not start out liking each other but developed a deep friendship through working to take down a common enemy.

*Spoilers The pros were the incredible acting, great locations and filming, and appropriate but not too invasive musical scores. Who doesn't love Song Joon-ki in action, he is incredibly handsome and charasmatic. The sense of community with the building tenants was both refreshing and engaging. I loved that Cha-young was a tough, no nonsense lawyer with a bit of a dark streak. It made her the perfect pairing for Vincenzo because she did not have an issue, if justice would not be served, with going outside of the law. I loved that there was gold hidden in the building and how disturbed Vincenzo would get whenever someone would pursue his gold. He reminded me, in those cases, of a Leprechaun guarding his gold. One of the most comedic scenes was when he had to pretend to be gay to lure in a bank that was willing to work with Babel. Whether you are gay trying to be heterosexual or heteresexual tying to be gay if you are engaging the sexuality that does not fit - it is cringy. I was laughing, so hard during that part. The funny thing, was he seemed to turn all the guys around him gay. The men seemed to love him as much as the women did. It was like everyone's dark fantasy, apprently, to be in the mob. So there were bromances galore.

The cons were the times that Vincenzo failed to stay true to character. What it seemed, was he was a South Korean child, adopted into the Italian culture but was old enough to remember the language and most of the culture of his original country. His anger at his mother for ""abandoning"" him, and the death of his foster parents through criminal activity, led him to embrace the dark side for revenge. I got that. Made sense. But, it showed, in so many ways that he was very humane and caring and had conscience and could love and all that - not even a sociopath because he wasn't simply ""blending in"" his feelings appeared genuine and he underwent an evolution through meeting and falling in love with Cha-young, being mentored and befriended by her father, and just forming so many friendships in South Korea. But then, his mother, who he was on the precipice of a true reunion with, is murdered and it is like it flipped a switch. He backtracked on all the progress he made and the brutal element fully came back in him. The fact that he had flashbacks and nightmares of past incidents clearly showed that he had remorse to that point. But then it was like he became a slightly different person after his mother's death. I thought the way he killed the Babel villians was just a bridge too far. I cannot reconcile burning someone to death with someone who is a good person. Although the chairman was evil and had done horrible things, drilling someone to death is just the next level of brutality. Becoming as evil as the evil you are punishing does not make you a good person. I was disappointed when he blew up Cha-young's father's killer. He broke his word in my opinion. hHe told him once he did this thing the debt was fulfilled and he could go free. It was dishonest and it seemed even Cha-young felt he had gone too far. But she never said that although her response to the news seemed as if it bothered her.
When he killed the female lawyer he broke his morale code which was no women and children. She even said you are going to do this to a woman and he said, basically, you are not a woman, you are a monster. Still, burning her alive was the next level up brutality. It took him from a batman like, superhero justice seeker, to just a murderer little better than the people he was ""punishing"". I also could not buy that the law enforcement friends in his circle were so okay with him brutally murdering those people. They helped him get away with it and even shook hands with and hugged him when he had the blood on him. It was a bit like ""Dexter"" in that dark anti hero type persona but I am just not a fan of that level of ""eye for an eye"" because his treatment of them was even more brutal than the way they treated their victims.

The ending also fell short for me. Perhaps they are setting it up for another season. I did not like the very ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" end where he can only come back when on a diplomatic mission (diplomatic immunity). It was over obvious in the postcards he sent that he wanted her to come find him - yet she didn't. To me it seemed as though her emotions toward him took a turn. I did not have the sense she would be willing to leave South Korea and go join him on an island off the coast of Malta. I had no care for his Italian family. We never got to know enough of that piece to care that he had reunited and was now ruling that family. And, we were reminded of his brutality when he mentioned the revenge he took on a rival family and that their remains were fertilizing his grapes. They confessed and kissed but then parted ways with a somewhat sad and whistful look in both of their eyes.

His behavior, as other reviewers have pointed out, was not even consistent with what is often the case in organized crime. I knew a situation like that once - one of my best friends in high school let's just say her father was a retired person in a very well known organized criminal entity. In those situations, usually the lawyer is very valuable and also high up in the crime organization. They do not have those folks act as ""hit persons"" they are too valuable to the organization. And they typically have done their dues and don't want to get their hands dirty that way. Not that they have suddenly grown a conscience, but they just don't do the dirty work anymore. So that did not make sense. He was a lawyer and the second in command - the family would typically not risk such an individual by involving them so intimately. Even if he, himself, wanted to be involved, unless there was a compelling reason he would usually be ordered by ""the boss"" not to.

That being said - I would still recommend it and might even rewatch it at some point. It is unique and so well acted that the flaws are not a complete deterrant. Others really liked it and did not consider these things flaws. Cha-young had just enough darkness in her to accept a lot of what he did. It was very ""Game of Thrones"" in the darker elements and how most of the characters were not completely good or completely evil but various mixes thereof. And how you were rooting for anti heroes. The ""Queen of Dragons"" in Game of Thrones reminded me of Vincenzo in the way their characters evolved and the sudden switch down a much darker path. But I wasn't a fan of how that ended either. I like redemption and character growth. This followed the opposite trajectory. If there were a second season I might watch it. I am extremely disappointed in the brutality of the murders so I can't think of a way back from that but would be interested to see where their relationship evolved.

Questo edificio è mio!
The best drama of 2021. Everything was AWESOME! the story, the cast, the acting. I laughed a lot, cried, got angry, shipped the protagonists.
There were only two faults: Hanseo's death - I cried a lot despite the fact that since the beginning when he started to be against his brother, we already imagined that he would end up dying. We already expected but we weren't prepared for this moment.
ChaEnzo's ending: yes, the focus of the drama wasn't romance but I thought they needed more work on what happened to their relationship. Would ChaEnzo date from a distance? Would ChaEnzo each go on with their lives in their respective countries? Would ChaEnzo just be friends with benefits when Chayoung came to visit him in Malta? It was very vague.

Anyway, I want a second season!

The Best Crime-Dark Comedy Drama I've Ever Watched
If Flower of Evil is the best Crime-Romance drama ever, I would like to put Vincenzo in the ""best crime-dark comedy drama"" category. It deserved to be in the top Korean dramas.

Pros:
- Song Joong Ki. Yeah, I know most ppl anticipated this drama because SJK is the main lead. But, I have to admit that he's really good at playing in comedy-dramas.
- The comedy is always on point. It will make you laugh in every episode.
- The twists are so smooth that you can barely notice them and they're always wrapped with comedy.
- It shakes your entire(?) body. It heats your anger up.
- It actually tells about psychopaths without putting it in the drama's main topic so no one realized that this is a psycho-drama.
- The plot is so solid that it satisfies me. No duration-eater crying and romance scenes. I love how romance being the least portion of the drama genre. Many crime/action dramas are overshadowed by romance scenes and it's terribly annoying.
- I don't speak Italian, but the Italian words used in this drama are really ear-blessing ? I would like to learn those words too!
- I usually watch a drama because there's/re my fav actress, but Jeon Yeobin really stole my heart in this drama. I honestly think there's no other actress who could fit the role. She's not cool and badass enough, but I think that is to balance the action and comedy aspects. If her character is the same as SJK's, the comedy won't blend well with the crime-action aspects.

Cons:
- Ep 19 will make you facepalming ?‍♂️The most common mistake in the action drama, just like what happened in Flower of Evil.
- The anticlimax plot is too short/too fast that I found it unsatisfying.
- The romance scenes in the last episode are unnecessary tbh.

High quality drama with an incredible cast
The plot of this drama is amazing, and so are the score and the action sequences, but the best part of it is most definitely the cast! It has so many supporting characters, yet all of them get their time to shine and somehow have an important role in the main story.

Every single scene with the tenants was so wholesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed the villains as well. I was so impressed with Taecyeon's acting in this - after watching ""Bring It On, Ghost"", I was expecting something simple, with either very few facial expressions or weakly executed ones. But I am confident this role is a massive turning point in his career, as he was PHENOMENAL in it. Naturally, so was Song Joong Ki, but he proved himself long ago.

Vincenzo had several moments that were tough to watch. There are many deaths, a lot of blood and overall cruelty, so I couldn't really binge watch it. I also expected more romance than I got (fair warning: this drama has close to zero romance), but its value isn't in that anyway, so it didn't make a difference to me. My mother and a few friends also watched it, and we all agree it's an excellent drama.

""Romance""
I had heard a lot about this drama when it first aired the first episodes, but I usually wait until all episodes are out and that was what I did time as well.
It is not often that I watch the trailer or read the description of the drama, I didn't this time eihter.
But there are a few things I do want to know, and I do scim through some recensations.

I just wanted to share something I would have liked to know about this drama.
That would have made my experience watching it more enioyable.
I feel like the information I found about the ""romance"" in the drama was misleading and it made me annoyed at times.
It had a lot of potential, it could have been really good, but now I feel pretty disappointed when I finished it.
I think there was great chemistry, there were a few teasers, but the season was 20 episodes long and there was only 2 kiss scenes.
So don't go in to this drama expecting romance because that is not what it's about at all.

(I truly liked the characters/the actors, it was entertaining)
(I haven't ever rewatched a drama yet, so that rating has nothing to do with the k-drama itself)

Is it worth the hype? Corn salad says yes!
Most definitely, and I agree with the corn salad. I was afraid that the hype I saw on my social media pages would leave me disappointed, and I'm so glad to be wrong.

This drama introduced me to JYB as an actress, highlighting her expressive character and streamlining it with the more collective Vincenzo. SJK did an amazing job at portraying his character, handling all the issues that came his way with a flare of dramatic expressions and his signature smirk and occasional Italian lines (I don't speak Italian, but damn they were so cool!) Taecyeon and Kim YJ did amazing with their characters. While Kim YJ/ Choi Myung Hee did a better job as passing off as villainous, Han Seok felt like a comedic ragey villain who throws a tantrum every time he fails. (though the ending episodes, he definitely felt more villainous).

That leads me to my only quip with this show. A majority of the episodes ended with a stupidly frustrating cliffhanger, only to be extinguished within ten minutes the next weekend. In a way, the show's unpredictable nature became predictable. Issues were dealt with rapid pace, and it felt largely anticlimatic. For example...you'd never expect to see a flock of pigeons as a form of deux ex machina, but figures.

Regardless of the anticlimatic cliffhangers, our leads partnering up together was an enjoyable watch. Seeing them scheming together to bring down Babel was extremely pleasurable to watch, it's so hard to not root for them and the Geumga plaza squad working together to keep their building and each other intact.

Now the OSTs are a bit less memorable when compared to other dramas, but they're still very good regardless at boosting the feels during specific scenes (my two faves are Adrenaline by Solar and I'm Always By Your Side by John Park).

Go watch Vincenzo now!! While you're at it, try and sneak some gold from the vault, will you?

Hilarious, heartwarming, and so much fun to watch!
Vincenzo is truly a dramedy - dramatic, extra af and full of little gems of comedy that combined make for a really good time.

The acting is phenomenal, and as the show progressed you really learn more about the different characters and they keep showing new sides to themselves. When I first started watching the show, the FL reminded me a lot of Fiery Priest - and then I found out later that it's actually the same director, so if you loved that show you'll love this one too.

The show centers around a Mafia lawyer Vincenzo Cassano (aka Mr. Corn Salad) who comes back to Korea and ends up entangled with the tenants of Geumga Plaza, which is on the verge of being demolished by a big (and bad) corporation fittingly named Babel Group. The acting in the show is just spectacular, not just from the ML and FL but also from the tenants of Geumga Plaza and the various guest stars that appear.

Kim Sung Cheol (from Prison Playbook) appears in a few episodes and is SO funny. There's a scene where Taecyeon sings the Produce 101 song and the comedic timing was so good, I had to replay it for the laughs. There's a subtle nod to Sungkyungkwan Scandal in one of the episodes (one of the earlier shows that Song Joong Ki was in, and one of my early favs) and the plot keeps everything moving quickly. I can't even choose one favourite character because I liked so many of them.

Did I mention everyone is secretly a badass? I love it.

Vincenzo is easily one of my favourites of 2021 so far.

Unexpected
I truly appreciate the humor in this otherwise dark drama. I have to say that I was a bit worried seeing the total number of episodes and how each episodes average around 80 mins, that it would drag in the middle. Happy to say that I didn't find myself being bored with this drama. Overall, it was a fun watch, and I'd happily recommend this to people who would enjoy such humor and wasn't looking for anything too serious (it's almost cartoon-ish, which I don't mind every now and then).

There are a few things that bug me while watching this drama. Story wise, they're ok, some plot holes, but I can brush it off. I think I'm more annoyed with the little details. One of them being the believability that Vincenzo was basically an Italian local by the time he came back to Korea in the drama. Coming from someone who speaks English as a second language and have spent more than half of my life in an English speaking country, but still speak my native tongue every now and then with friends and family, I speak more English than I do my native tongue, I even think and have my inner monologue in English. When I go home for holidays, it would take me about a week or two to be fully acclimatised to my native language and local dialects, as well as catching up with the new slangs, etc, and I even speak a hybrid of English with my own language. So to find Vincenzo was fluent in Korean like a local right off the bat was not that believable, considering that he spent time in Italy since he was a young kid, and assuming that he retained his ability to speak Korean somehow, he would have needed time to get used to it again. However, I just want to say, kudos for Song Joong-ki, as it's very hard to perform with a foreign language. Then also with the instant coffee.... I get that it was product placements, but for a character who has such a refined taste and was basically raised in Italy, a country with long history of coffee and strong coffee culture, I very much doubt he'd touch instant coffee even if it means risking migraines from the lack of caffeine intake (I live in a city with a very strong coffee culture, and I know so many people who would not touch instant coffee). I also didn't know what the point was to have Luca came to Korea, it didn't make sense since what he did while he was in the country could have been done via a phone or video call. Then there is the ""indestructible"" Vincenzo.... I'm not sure I like how almost god-like the drama made him seem, because it's always that everything has been planned, like nothing could go wrong, and no matter what situation he ended up in and how dire it is, he gets out of it somehow (seriously, a swarm of pigeons?).... and speaking of pigeons, what ever happen to Inzhagi? I love that bird and would have loved to see more of it at the end. Also worth mentioning, how many zippos does Vincenzo actually have? Seems like he's throwing them away like they're nothing, but considering how much he fiddles with it throughout the drama, I find it doesn't make sense for him to have a collection of them and throw one away every time he wants to turn up the heat.

I LOVE the Geumga Plaza crew, they're so colorful and quirky, and they're always exciting. I also appreciate that the romance isn't at the fore front of this drama, but instead, bubbling in the background and occasionally comes forward. I did, however, find that Vincenzo had stronger chemistry with other male characters than he did with Cha-young. Then there is the duo that is Han-seok & Myung-hee... WHAT A PAIR!! They're ruthless, and I just love the contrast between these two and Han-seo & Seung-hyuk. However, I have to say that the villains were shallow and one dimensional, perhaps it's to do with Han-seok's mental state, but still, it would have been great to see more layers to Myung-hee. In saying that, I absolutely loved Han-seo, he was a character that captured my attention somewhere near the middle of the story and I ended up rooting for him as much as I did for the Geumga crew.

The drama itself is actually quite dark, and the comedic elements of this seems to mask the degradation of the Geumga Cassano Family's moral compass, from being the one being walked over to the people delivering these ""punishments"". Granted, ultimately it was still Vincenzo himself delivering these punishments with help from the crew, but the fact that Cha-young was okay with going through with their plan knowing the ultimate outcome, as well as everyone else who seems to be fully aware what Vincenzo's intentions and still went ahead, kinda didn't put them in a better place than the ""bad guys"".

So anyway, yes, it was an enjoyable watch, just don't take it too seriously :)

PS: MDL didn't let me not have any ratings for the rewatch rating so I put it at 1- just fyi, I almost never rewatch anything.

one of the best things i've seen
it is a beautiful show. everything is amazing. i got an account just to write this. may not be everyone's cup of tea but you have to try it at least once.

the revenge in this show is immaculate. no kidding folks, it's out there and brutal.
the slow burn is quite possibly one of the best out there, not to mention the chemistry between the leads.
there is no redemption arc for our anti-hero. no 'he needs to be saved' bullshit.
the female lead is a Queen. i lover her to death.
the music. oh God, the music. where do i even begin.
production is top-notch. netflix and tvn came out with the big guns.
lastly, the acting. holy hell, give Song Joong-ki all the awards. man scared the absolute life out of me. more than once. him and Ok Taecyeon gave me chills. Joen Yeo-bin was campy, fierce and so strong that i fell in love.

fair warning though: this show will give anxiety. but you'll keep coming back for more. it's that good.

This show is a good watch and I enjoyed the ride. Every episode is something I look forward to seeing on weekend nights. But just like any other shows, this one is also not spared for some criticisms despite the fact that I loved it.

My major complaint is the last seven minutes of episode 20. It is very clear that the meticulous and badass Vincenzo suddenly disappeared into thin air when he could've saved Han Seo. How in the world did he walk into that place without any back-up plan at least? This is a major character regression. With all his expertise, for sure he knows Cha Young's shot isn't that fatal. And here goes Cha Young acting overly as if she's dying. Just because of what? Love? So cliche.

I feel like Han Seo's character is the best in development in this series. I still believe that his death could've been preventable and him dying is really unnecessary. It was a heroic one, yes, but I'd rather keep him alive and give him a chance to run the company straight. They quickly got over his death. Did they mourn for him off-screen? I wish there was a scene like that for a bit.

The death of the two pyschos were gruesome but very satisfying. Two thumbs up for this.

I wish the show fleshed out more on how Vincenzo became a member of the Mafia. What's with the lighter?

Even though I feel satisfied with how this was wrapped up, I still have a lot of questions in mind. There were some loose ends I need an answer.

I don't think a season 2 is needed. Maybe just a spinoff.

Nevertheless, it was one enjoyable ride and Vincenzo is a good watch. Kudos to the whole Cassano Geumga Fam, and the production of Vincenzo.

I Don't Know What You're Doing If You STILL Haven't Watched THIS
STOP RIGHT THERE. YOU. YES, YOU. Are you reading this to see if you should watch this drama? Well let me just save you some time from reading this and tell you, You damn right should watch this, no seconds thoughts or anything, just dive in head deep. Man was it painful watching this and waiting for episodes every week, you're already lucky to have all the eps just waiting for you to look at. In all seriousness though, this drama was just a ball of happiness for me. It knew how to make me laugh really hard and also at the same time portray a story. The thing that really had my attention was every character. The personality and traits of each person down to the detail was phenomenal. I loved the concept and it was entertaining. I found myself being attached to every side character because they were all just as important. This drama wasn't very romancey, but it did leave us with some hints at times. I actually think that it was better this way. Also the bad guys were another thing, they acted very well and it was amazing that they made my blood boil so much. The only other thing I can say about this is that I wish there were more osts ahhhh, but regardless it was great. Anyways, I could say lots of things but please just give this a chance despite anything else you've heard. Everything deserves a chance right? Happy watching!!

Contain violence, be smart for watching,, only suitable for some people, not too bad

be smart in watching,, containing scenes of violence, or partial justice,,
glorifies violence,, remember!! this all just a drama

violence reciprocate with violence




#story

honestly, I think this drama is quite boring and feels very slow until episode 11 also feels very slow to me,,its better ep 12-13, but slow again until ep 18 its getting better again, although there is a little comedy that is quite entertaining, but at first I felt too pushy comedy

the development of the story feels very absurd ,, Geumga tenant members who from nothing become good fighter or having a secret talent
,,,national intelligence assisting crime and escape,,,,the sudden relationship between the cast,,,


#plot

they explain how some of the events happened using flashback,, and of course it is better than there is not explained at all, which makes the incident unclear

the drawback is that they doesn't explain the entire flashback that is displayed and the timing is not clear when the flashback occurs (for reason read ep 17 below(contain spoiler) )


#cast

about the past of the cast is not too clear ,, Vincenzo ,, Jang Han Seok? how can he be so psychopath

1. and it seems that Vincenzo dentity is not completely explained,, they said that he is adopted and vincenzo say that he took revenge on the robber who killed his adoptive parents by torturing him for 2 years,, so mafia boss fabio not her adoptive father? And how could he join the mafia members?,,, and flashback about him shooting someone and there is a kid in the car ,who is it?


2. At first I felt the FL acting was a little too much, and then I persuaded myself that the cast characters should be like that, and if you look at that side, the acting not bad

3. Jang han seok,, At first I did feel something strange with him, but when found out that he was the real boss of Babel,, I find it so absurd to make such a twist,,, but his acting proves that she fits the role perfectly



###Question###

1. when they make a traps to destroying janghanseok? when lawyer hong picked up the phone from Vincenzo who told him the identity of BABO (BABELBOS)? before meeting jangjoongwoo or after meeting?


2. Ep 17,,when did AN agents know about the whereas of the guillotine file?from the flashback does not match with what is said by Vincenzo,,, because when the director of the intelligence agency joined the babel tower meeting, vincenzo was still in the secret chamber,,

and lawyer hong, you shouldn't know that the secret chamber belongs to wangshaolin(ep12) or it is where the guillotine file is located,because she still concludes ""means the file is back to korea"",,,, and mr nam and lawyer hong just found out that the file was in vincenzo's hands when they were betrayed by prosecutor jung


3. Why is there a blue rope on Inazagi's leg?

Honestly after 4 or episodes it was so nerve-wracking to watch, there were too much tension that made me become disinterested for next episodes. Cinematography, acting and lead's chemistry was the things that made me continue to watch but in the end they weren't enough. I really wanted to watch some romance because of their chemistry was so great but unfortunately it was wasted. Other thing that made me become disinterested to show were the tenants. There were many memorable scenes (especially funny scenes were very enjoyable for me.) and catchwords. However, i find it overrated and i had to push myself to watch after few episodes.

The best k-series I've ever watched.
If you like a witty, comedic, dark, gory, antihero story with a good splash of romance, you've come to the right place. I went into this series with no expectations. 2 episodes in, I felt enjoyment but no real spark. Then episode 3 passed and we went into the fourth episode; from there, the enjoyment of this series takes off exponentially. Each episode is action packed, meaningful, heart wrenching and fun. I've never enjoyed a show so much as I have this one. It's been an absolute pleasure to follow each weekly viewing live. The chemistry between the main leads is absolutely captivating.

Vincenzo is going to leave an empty hole that no other drama can replace, and it's bittersweet knowing it's over. Definitely worth a watch, and I'll be rewatching this one for sure. A complete Korean drama masterpiece.

Overall 10/10.


(MINOR SPOILERS BELOW)
The most satisfying part of this story was the partnership between Vincenzo and Hong Chayoung. Firstly, their chemistry was to DIE for, I don't know if it was their acting, but for a show that isn't romance centric, the subtleties (e.g. the glances V gives CY, the light touches during the comedic scenes, etc) leave viewers asking for more. And thank god the writers delivered a satisfying end for Chayenzo. Secondly, their story, the way that they started as enemies but quickly became friends, then good partners, then drifting to the ""it's complicated"" realm, to finally coming full circle (I feel like I can say they are dating). The chemistry and the development of their story was so wholesome I can't believe that some viewers disapprove.

Song Joong Ki should be grateful to land such a great role alongside Yeobeen, a beauty as well as a great actor who can finally dispel the disapproval of Joongki after his divorce.

Amazing
One of the best crime mafia esk dramas. It has plot twists and reveals that you don't expect alongside the villains you believe are villains are redeemable. It is very funny alongside dark when it needs to be. The casting was perfect alongside the chemistry too. There was no moments were I was bored, the humor was enjoyable and well placed compared to other shows. The wardrobe chose also adds to the overall greatness. The FL in my personal opinion great, she wasn't helpless but she had emotions and flaws like all the other characters.

My favorite corn salad! Vincenzo is GOLD!
This one will definitely and will surely entertain you. No dull moment. All episodes are fun and intense.

You'll be so in love with Song Joongki!!! He was born to wear expensive suits. No, I mean, expensive suits are made for him!

Every end of each episodes made me think that 'this episode is the funniest' or 'this is the best episode'. Then after watching another episode I'll be like, no this is the funniest/ no this is the best. *haha mamamia*

I love how it has everything. I love how Family/ friendship have developed between Vincenzo and the Geumga Plaza Gang. I love that there were a lot of comedic scenes. I love the fighting scenes. And I love how Vincenzo almost always have the upperhand. In other Kdramas Villains always have the upper hand but this one is different.

Of course there is no perfect Kdrama and there are still plot holes, but it's fine. We watch it to be entertained anyway.

Plot is not really that amusing. But I love most of the plot twists. The writer is so brilliant. I actually don't like dramas with a lot of action and grotesque scenes but scenes here makes sense. And Song Joongki is effin hot.

All actors did great. You'll grow to love the Geumga Plaza Gang.

I am really satisfied with what happened or on what Vincenzo did to the Villains. I'm like, every Kdrama Villains should be treated the way Vincenzo treated the Villains here. Do it in Vincenzo way.

But the ending as a whole is not so satisfying. It's just so-so. It will leave you with a lot of questions. Though the Drama as a whole is GOLD! Love it!

I love this over-the-top series but...
I thought it was a straight-up gangster drama bec of the 1st scene but it wasn't and i liked it like that.
What i loved:
The tenants. Weird and flawed but they could go up in arms to defend Vincenzo.
The younger Jang brother. Man, he had the greatest likeability factor in this show with his character devt!
SJK. I mean, who doesn't want to see that face on tv? Even 4k tv could not find a single blemish on his face ?
Romance was in the back seat. I liked that love angle was not front and center of this show. But the writer just couldn't help it and forced it in the end ugh!
What i hated:
Romance in the most impt back seat. Damn! All i can say is that Vincenzo in love was a helpless, prideless, undeserving-of-a-brother's-love prick. Have you seen it? Well?
And the kisses...whose blood was it that was wasted so you can have those kisses with the (weird) lawyer lady?
The brother's blood that was wasted unnecessarily. I still can't get over that fact.
Still, i loved this series despite the last episode. Flawed but powerful.

Potential Imbalance
An anti hero with a mafia background goes back to his homeland to retrieve the secret stash of gold buried there after the owner dies. There he encounters a series of unforeseen problems, gets dragged into a war against a conglomerate and learns that there are more secrets than he had been made aware of. It's a fantastic foundation to base a story on. We can see that it has deadly potential to give us one of the best dramas of the year. But sadly, that is what it remains- a foundation- which is why it feels more disappointing than the average series that failed to deliver.

The plot is pretty straight forward for a touted thriller- but the back and forth screenplay keeps the viewers guessing. If you've watched enough movies/dramas, you wouldn't find the plot unpredictable. There are the usual betrayals, the chases, the comebacks, the one-upmanship, the cat and mouse game and the intermediate comic relief. But there are also a lot of unnecessary scenes and half baked elements that were mixed in as well. It could be because they all were originally a part of the script or because they had to fill the entire stretch of 20 episodes with something. In other words, this is not a racy or nail biting thriller. Truthfully, this is more an action drama.

The writer-director duo tries to overcome the hurdle of ""too many episodes with too little story"" with humour and fall flat face first onto the ground. That they respectively worked on Chief Kim and The Crowned Clown is another example of wasted potential- they could have turned the tables and made this better at any point of time during the show! The slapstick comedy feels forced, dispensable and boring. They could have totally done away with them and placed some actual courtroom scenes, seeing that the series' main characters are lawyers. The glaring lack of court scenes is rather conspicuous. The action sequences are nothing new either. I wouldn't call any of the plot twists shocking - I saw them coming from a mile away. Barring the first three episodes, the first half is long and uninteresting and the finale ends up being meaningless in its attempt to be a ""desperate-last resort"" action. Also, why all the last minute gore and torture?

The beauty of Vincenzo is that it is engaging in spite of everything. It is visually pleasing even if a majority of the incidents happen in an old building that actually requires the redevelopment that it vehemently opposes. For all the right reasons, yes, but it needs to be mentioned. The story picks up in the second half and the show delivers then what it had been storing all along. It feels like a fresh breath of air to see the plot take the reins and run the show, to drive its characters into their respective positions and make them do what they were brought in to do. The characters feel more grounded, as if they are a part of the story rather than in the beginning when they felt out of place with visibly forced acting. This overall improvement is backed by some solid performances from all the actors, with Ok Taec Yeon and Kwak Dong Yeon standing out. I think if Vincenzo did one thing good, it is that it brought out the versatility of these two.

It took me a while to accept the chocolate boy looks of Song Joong Ki as a feared and ruthless Consigliere and I was never fully convinced he could do it. But he does it, and although he didn't look threatening at any point, it's more on the plot. He provides a lot of gravitas to the character of Vincenzo that even the script fails to provide, ironically. He was a treat to watch. Did I say his Italian is sexy?

Jeon Yeo Been emotes well. She shines in how accurately and excellently she portrays the antics of her character, right from the scene where she is introduced to us, without being over the top. In my opinion, we needed more of her extras and less of the unpalatable comedy that was thrust in our face. I was never sold on the chemistry between the leads but the romance is light, breezy, blink-and-miss and yet, good and adequate.

Kim Yeo Jin is brilliant as Choi Myung Hee in what is one of the few best written characters of the show. Kim Yoon Hye as Seo Mi Ri is another. Music and cinematography are the other plus points.

The major pitfall of the show is its imbalance in the construction and execution of the plot and the inconsistency in the characterisation. I got tired of how easily and quickly the residents of the plaza changed their stances. Hong Cha Young's fire and extras in the first three episodes vanish abruptly and she becomes yet another woman who needs rescuing towards the end. The character of Jang Han Seok was only saved from being a weakness that could drag the story down by Ok Taec Yeon's incredible work because he loses his spark midway as well. It's as if after his reveal as the Chairman of Babel he had no more cards left to play. All Han Seok did in the second half is just a response to Vincenzo's advances. Han Seung Hyuk was the most unstable of the lot and it was difficult to predict what he'd do next- in a way that's more irritating than it is exciting. This uncertain characterisation and a plot that doesn't tie up its lose ends (starting scene? Vincenzo's dreams? How did he get into Han Seok's house? Why did one of Myung Hee's lackeys return to her?) adding in comedy for fillers create a sense of imbalance. Several scenes and episodes feel disjointed. At times, the scene transition is not smooth and the music cuts off suddenly. It feels like a poorly patched up broken vase when the vase was never broken in the first place; just a little messy.

So would I watch it again? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Yes, the actors are amazing, go fall in love with them. Should you watch it? Yes, if a slightly wonky mafia story is your bowl of corn salad.

Not amazing, just acceptable!
Initially I was avoiding this drama, as I thought will not be on my taste.
I watched first episode and I want to discover more, so I watched each episode till the end.
I may say that this drama contains some weak scenes, but I was able to pass through them, as I liked a lot acting of the main leads.
I got a big disappointment on the last two episodes of this drama:
1. I did not like how the director create the scene when Vincenzo go to save the girl .
2.I didn't like the ending, if the screenwriters created a love connection in this drama, they should offer to the viewers a scene with ""I love you"", the one with ""I miss you"", was not good enough for me.

Interesting
Very fun and interesting drama. Great performances from the cast, especially Ok Taec Yeon. Strong female characters... Though since there is so much violence, the male lead still has to save the female lead again and again. The villain could have been written better; they implied that Jang Han Seok was intelligent, and combined with his craziness and psycopathic tendencies, he should have been able to take down Vincenzo from time to time. Disappointed with the ending: although Jang Han Seok was the type of crap to kidnap a woman as a hostage (like every action movie ever made), I really had higher hopes for this drama.

Vincenzo the character
I've only watched this once and I had huge expectations from it. But, Vincenzo the character was not up to my expectations. I always got so worked up when I see the evil guys in kdramas get away with anything just because they have unlimited power at their disposal. And Babel was the perfect example of that. So just like Hong Yu Chan, I wanted some monster who could go head to head with them, who doesn't have to think abt law and goes beyond it. And that's what I was expecting of Vincenzo's character. We were shown how ruthless he can be in the first ep where he was in Italy. And I was excited to see the same in Korea, but Vincenzo's Korean version was more of a subdued kind. I get he's in another country where he has to abide by the law or else he might get arrested. I get it but that's not what I wanted to see when Vincenzo decides to get more involved after Yu Chan's death.

There were moments when we got a glimpse of his old self when he burned that factory or fought with Babel's men late at night or when he went on a rampage after his mom's death. That's what I was expecting to see from him when I started the series - a man who goes beyond the law to punish the evil men/women. And that's why I like the Italian Vincenzo better than the Korean one. I could summarize my disappointment in one scene - when he shoots at the detective guy working for Myung Hee I was rejoicing only to be disappointed to see he had faked that and kept the guy alive. Sure he kills him later on in his own sweet time.

The last ep has to be my favorite one for sure! The way he takes revenge on all of them *chef's kiss*. Now that was what I wanted throughout the series!! In this respect, I think Taxi Driver scores the goal with its revenge theme (only watched 4 ep but totally my style)

I am enchanted!
A series that brought moments of horror and at the same time lots of laughs. But I was prepared for a real gangster series, unfortunately I got an ordinary law series with a little bit of thrill. But I hope to see Vincenzo as the head of the Italian mafia and the real gangsters.
I am very pleased with Ok Taecyeon's acting. His character is the best in this series. I love him in such strong roles. They suit him very well in my opinion.
Song Joong-ki as the main character, Italian mafia member Vincenzo Cassano is also eye-catching. Especially at the very end of the series, when we get stronger cinema than those legal adventures from the beginning. The only thing I miss in this character is ""strength"". Vincenzo Cassano is a handsome man, constantly wearing suits, as befits a mafioso, but I miss the authenticity and maybe even the feeling of being in this role. Somehow I don't buy what he shows us on screen.
And the last character that stuck in my memory was Jang Hanseo played by Kwak Dongyeon. I really liked his acting and the whole character, it's a pity that there's not much of him on the screen.
The series holds your attention, has a great cast and a really good atmosphere. It's worth taking your time and getting to know its storyline. I hope this is not the end of the adventures and we will meet the Cassano family again!

This was pretty awesome. I almost didn't watch it because growing up watching GodFather 1, 2, and 3, with him with that lighter reminded me of that movie. It wasn't too gorry so that was a plus for me. Song Joong Ki who played the main male lead was awesome as he always is. The emotions he had to play in changing calm to an expressionless person is hard to do... Jeon Yeo Bin who was the main female lead was so hilarious to becoming serious.... She was great, I hope to see more of her dramas. The fighting with some Martial Art was great... I didn't enjoy all of the killing but that is how the mafia behaves. This Kdrama had me focused on every episode... so I hope you will enjoy too.

A good show, but could be shorter and with less comedy
Vincenzo is definitely one of my favorite shows of the year. The main story is compelling and the acting is great. But I’m not the biggest fan of the comedic part of the show. I feel like those moments break the momentum too much. I feel like the show would have been even better with less episodes, probably something around 16. Also, the fact that the show was heavily spoiled to me might have lessened the overall effect. It took me months to finish it because of that.

It’s inevitable for me to compare Vincenzo with The Devil Judge, which was released after but I watched first. Both shows focus on revenge, have charismatic protagonists that are self proclaimed villains, punish people via “the law”, and there’s not much romance. Yet, I’d say both shows are very different. I enjoyed The Devil Judge more, since it’s shorter and with no comedy. But I probably would say Vincenzo Cassano is the best character of the year.

The cast was overall fantastic. All the main cast is outstanding, specially Taecyeon, Joong Ki and Yeo Jin. But, in my opinion, the best was Kwak Dong Yeon. Han Seo was probably the death that got to me the most and I loved all his scenes. I’m glad he was the key to defeat his brother in the end.

The Plaza gang was probably the weakest point in my opinion. I perceive them as a subplot to slow down the main story. I didn’t care about them until they finally started to be more useful by helping Vincenzo and Cha Young directly. The entire gold storyline was boring, too long and didn’t even have a good ending. Obviously, without the gold vault there would be no Vincenzo in Korea or a stablished place to put the Guillotine file. But for a plot that was stablished in the very start of the show, it didn’t go anywhere.

Heavily scripted drama that will give you a whiplash
I can see why there was so much hype around this k-drama when it was first released. It was quite different to your typical parcel of k-dramas being released and the main leads definitely got the netizens talking. However, watching the show a few months after it finished its run, the rose tinted glasses cannot hide all its rough edges.
On the positive side, the ML is handsome and overflowing with charisma. Whether you believe he is a Mafia consigliere is your decision. The FL was flamboyant and matched well with the ML so the OTP's chemistry was signed and sealed. There were quite a few stylistic moments and quotable quotes just right for memes. Action sequences were generally well executed and impactful. Production value was high. OST more than serviceable with classical music taking a prominent role.
When observing the show from a distance, like war and art, you start to notice a coda that ends with the death of a key character (and those were obviously marked for death). The odd thing is that in most cases, the in-between space was filled with comedy, sometimes slapstick and quite farcical. This swing in mood did give me a bit of whiplash. I don't know if part of the problem stems from the drama being 20 episodes long and each almost 1.5 hours in duration. If it was trimmed down to 16 episodes, it might be tighter.
Most of these comedic sequences were supplied by the occupants of the Plaza. They were a motley crew with hearts of gold. In that sense, I was disappointed that they were largely used as comic relief and had little growth. They reminded me of characters in the movies ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"". A bit derivative, to be honest.
Oh mama mia, the overacting. There were so much overacting. The main villains were racing to see who is more evil and the said support cast amped up their traits to the max, most of them became caricatures. Subtlety was the main casualty and there were more than just gallons of blood on the floor. Ditto the violence. It is over the top and the impact waned over time.
Now we come to the biggest problem for me. There are quite a few plot holes and some illogical story telling. The show started well and we have the lone wolf arriving to help the beleaguered ""village"". I can accept that Vincenzo is an anti-hero and very grey when it come to the definition of good and evil, it does add spice to the proceedings. However, the longer the show went on, the more problematic the story telling became. There were lots of shouted intentions but mostly just milling around until we hit one of the key event I mentioned before. Scenes like the ML fighting 3 mafia hitmen and was saved by Inzaghi, reward for good deeds? The scene when the ML confronted the Interpol officers, one sequence was shown at the end of one episode and when the next episode starts, a completely different scenario was played which contradicted the earlier scene. The role of the Guillotine file which was supposed to be the ultimate deus ex machina but it sort of works but eventually watered down. The gold plot went rogue, why a bed and does it really ends there? Sometimes the plot twist were clever but a lot of the time you can sense the writer-nim's hand on the steering wheel to make sure the show stay on a given course. Several times during the show, it could have ended ""logically"" but it just kept going.
Vincenzo is handsome and oozes charisma, the show is enjoyable in parts and it will pull your heartstrings from time to time, the found family trope can be cute and heart warming. There is no question about the chemistry between the OTP (I do wish they devoted more time to them). A grand opera of revenge can be sweet music. However, the inconsistencies will pull you out of immersion. Personally, I find Itaewon Class a superior David vs Goliath drama but nobody ever goes to watch a James Bond movie for empathy and sensitivity.

A mafia turned good citizen
GOOD main leads.
GOOD plot.
Above-average supporting characters.
An over-drag villain.
A complete disastrous representation of SK law.
A little bit of disappointment in the ending.
Overall a good watch.
A big no for re-watch.

The story begins kinda slowly. But after episode 4 it picks up the pace and makes you believe that our star MC will fight the evil and get his girl for sure. Slowly the plot twists arise and the episodes became more of an action-comedy to me. The execution of Gangster vibes is in check and the cuteness of Jeon Yeo-been makes your heart go throb.
If you like mafia / gangster type revenge plot with rom-com GO for this.

Vincenzo is quirky and entertaining.
Vincenzo concluded, and the executions of Jang Han Seok and Choi Myung Hee were a gore-fest. Vincenzo is one of the quirkiest, most entertaining K-dramas, and it might be the best K-drama of 2021. I thought that it was an over-the-top silly slapstick/crime/suspense drama in the beginning, but I kept watching it every week.

Protagonists: Song Joong Ki shined in the role of Vincenzo, and he carried the show on his shoulders. This is his best acting role to-date. His special skills got the job done, while he regained his humanity. Jeon Yeo Bin was overacting as Hong Cha Young, who acted like a spoilt princess most of the time. Her supermodel catwalk strut and her facial mannerisms were very annoying. When she was serious, she radiated on screen.

Antagonists: Ok Taecyeon stepped outside the box, and chose a role that I never envisioned. Jang Han Seok was psychotic, bipolar, evil, schizophrenic and despotic. Kim Yeo Jin as Choi Myung Hee was the most irritating character in the drama. Her styling was off. She looked like a frowzy fashionista with dirty hair and expensive fashion wear. It looked like Kim never washed and combed her hair for twenty episodes.

Chump: Kwak Dong Yeon is memorable as the cowardly weak brother, Jang Han Seo, who developed a spine, and helped Vincenzo take down Jang Han Seok.

SPOILER ALERT
I found the opening segment of the final episode was very irritating. Master Executioner Vincenzo froze while Jang Han-Seok and Jang Han-Seo were having a showdown. This was so uncharacteristic in Vincenzo. I would have choreographed a better scene, with Vincenzo and Jang Han-Seo taking down madman Jang Han-Seok. Even if Jang Han-Seo was weak, he was still redeemable. As usual, the K-drama time jump wrapped up the drama. If the production team took off a week to fine tune the last four episodes, they surely raised the bar on the gore.

SPOILER ALERT
A Season 2 is probable, considering the gold bars are sitting in Hong Cha Young's shed. They could bring back Jang Han Seo, the good brother. I do not think that they acknowledged that he had died. He could be lying in a coma in a hospital, and reawaken in Season 2. The gold has to be redistributed among the Geumga Plaza residents and the lawyers. It can't sit in Cha Young's shed forever. They could build a better Geumga Plaza/residence/retailer/office building, and Han Seo could be the CEO. Wishful thinking!

Disappointed Much
Okay there have been a few reviews that match mine so I feel like I’m in good company lol. Let me start by saying I love love love SJK and the main actors weren’t bad actors (although my mate JYB did let me down in her portrayal of her character - however I don’t know that I can wholly blame her or the writer’s depiction of her character) overall I feel like the writer let this one down. The fact that there was supposed to be romance (limited and odd) within the action drama did not end well on this score and the whole story left a lot to be desired.
The support actors did their best to be who they were supposed to be but even these guys were oddballs, particularly the baddies - just oddballs.
The one thing I must say (I know it’s been said before but I completely agree with them) OTY - OMG his portrayal of the villainous evil guy but Mr Nice guy was superb and amazing. The 2 male leads had me throughout this one and it took me a while to get through it because the writing was so poor, I had to drop and then pick i tup several times over after a break of some time between. I’m usually a drama junkie and can get through a drama within 3 or 4 days if it’s gripping and compelling. This one - sorry to say took me over a month to get through and this is the greatest disappointment and letdown because of my admiration and love for the 2 male leads.
Not sure if I’ll ever fully recover to be honest as my love for both these guys has been scarred from bad writing and possibly directing. I’ll definitely be hesitating the next time I have to choose a drama with my favourites in them. Although I’ll probably end up watching them anyway purely because they’re NOT BAD ACTORS.
Will I ever REWATCH this one - Never again!!!! 절대!!!! NEVER

Great casting
As much as I want to say I love this drama I’m not sure if it’s just because I love Song Joong Ki or just because of the drama. But it’s a great and overall drama, the characters roles fit the casts, and great team works but have to say I hate the ending was hoping for more at the end, not because of the romance but they have they have to send Kwak Dong Yeon off like that. But other than that this drama is great because of course it’s Song Joong Ki;) those who haven’t give it a try or have drop definitely give it a try.

A gem in all the korean dramas in 2021!
First of all, this drama deserves a round of applause for not following the typical mafia storyline (where the female lead tries to change the mafia male lead into becoming a better person). Nope, it's a far cry from that! This drama has 20 1 hour and 30 minutes episodes that make you laugh, cry, shout, and awed with!

Plotline:
The story is really interesting, it started off grand, showing you the main lead - Vincenzo's background, what he does for a living, his interactions with the people around him. The first episode got me invested in the character that Song Joong Ki played, and the episodes went on to show how he dealt with the Italian Mafia before he went on to his home country, Korea. The story genre is never the same as soon as he lands in Korea. it changed from mystery/action to a dark comedy which I found amusing. It really highlighted how different Korea and Italy were and are in our day-to-day life for the main lead. For me, the story starts to pick up around the 10th episode where there are so many pieces that start to come together and the characters really are the ones that were moving the story.

Characters:
Vincenzo chose the right casts for the characters, I cannot think of anyone else except for Song Joong Ki to play Vincenzo. The villains in this drama were incredible actors, they made me want to punch my screen because of how bad they are HAHA. The back-to-back interactions between the female lead - Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo are just refreshing to watch. We don't normally see this kind of female leads in a lot of dramas, so it's a really nice change of pace to see. The side characters have my heart in this show, they made the whole drama filled with laughter and I seriously can't get enough of them!

Rewatch Value:
8/10 for me. I think this drama is one that I will only watch once but it will stay in my heart as one of the gems I found in Korean dramas. There are many elements in the drama that only works when you watch it for the first time!

Thank you for reading this long review HAHA, if you do decide to watch it, I wish you enjoy it as much as I did!

Just Okay at the End
From the first episode, I thought I knew what I was getting into, and I confess, the first few episodes did seem to confirm my thoughts! But by the 18th episode, I had lost a lot of interest. In my opinion, there was way way more that could have been done with the writing. I understand it was a dark comedy thing they were going for, and the comedy was many times really good! But the villains were lackluster, and the development of characters was nearly non-existent. The villains kept doing the exact same thing (that OBVIOUSLY didn't work), and when Vincenzo would intercept it, they'd be like :O. But you kept doing the EXACT same things?? And the romance between Vincenzo and Cha Young, like I enjoyed it, but when it came to Cha Young's character values, it seemed way too muddled. At least there could have been some sort of conflict in that area, since she was initially portrayed to somewhat have some reserve towards how far she was willing to go, vs Vincenzo. There was also the wasted opportunities for the op character and even the writing of the Plaza's people was questionable sometimes (felt unbelievable/convenient). But anyways, that's just my gripe and this is just my opinion. Though it made finishing the last few episodes a hassle, the show was still a solid okay, I won't argue with that.

I have quite high expectation for the drama, with the hype everywhere and the high ratings. Well, the expectation wasn't 100 percent fulfilled but I still give quite high rating as I enjoyed the series. I expected more for the storyline you know like law and stuff, but it was rather simple. It did shows some smart moves but hm I don't know I just expected more like coolness, smart, mind blowing things. But I do enjoy the whole anti-hero perspective, the 'evil punishing other evil' thingy, and since I was ready for it, I enjoyed it a lottt. It was evil and gruesome especially towards the end, but it was a literal satisfaction for me, because i kinda agree, justice won't always win. The acting were all amazingggg, all casts did a great job, I'm okay with the humor I actually like it and for the romance, well I love those slow burn romance but it's not like 'aaa they're so cutee kiss now' it's more like I root for them but the last episode I find it cute. Oh and the pace were good for me, it's not too slow lovee it and there are some parts that I wish we got more explanations. Lastly, one of the complaints that I have is the ppl? it's too obvious and I find it annoying sometimes haha. So yeah, bottomline is, I enjoyed it but I did expect more. It was good <3

Let me start off by wiping my tears first...
I'll start from the beginning. We got a very dramatic start from this drama from episode 1. It's been quite some time that I watched a Korean drama which showed little details of every step and every scene like they did in Vincenzo. The mafia storyline was indeed different. I loved it!!!!
I liked the fact that they let Vincenzo's character commit murders. A lot people might think that it isn't right for the male lead to do so and specially the methods Vincenzo uses to get back at all the villains is something not shown in dramas today. However, as Cha Young says, you cannot deal with such monsters with justice. Specially if the government is corrupt. In my opinion, Vincenzo already gave all the evil characters a merciful ending. Handing them over to the police wouldn't have done anything.
I'm glad they didn't make Cha Young's character timid and shy. Just like the male lead, the female lead also had her own charm and her own mafia style ways of dealing with her stuff. She was on par with Vincenzo. For me, it doesn't matter that there wasn't a lot of romance in this drama because Vincenzo and Cha Young's partnership was everything. It's actually good they did not try to add too much romance and spoil the main purpose of the show.
Another good point was that all the characters from the plaza turned out to have hidden talents which made it all even more interesting. Nice too see them drama involving all characters equally.
I do feel as if the ending was a little rushed. From the last few episodes it looked that Mr Lee of the pawnshop would die but they totally turned the tables and killed Han Seo. So unexpected!! I am still shook at this. I know directors always kill these kind of characters in drama to make the audience even more emotional but in my opinion, Han Seo not dying would have been the best choice. Characters like him who have such developments in the drama deserve a happy ending. I feel as if there were too many things going on in the last episode that they didn't give focus to Han Seo's death.
Overall, the drama was very carefully planned out. There were so many parallel scenes as they call it. The court room episode in episode 5 and then the one in episode 19. The hospital scenes of the main leads and many more.
Like I always say, if a drama makes you genuinely cry, then it's a fantastic drama.

A Great Anti-Hero Drama!
I was doubtful about trying this despite its popularity but I eventually gave it a try a month ago. It was hard for me to get used to the drama at first because the first few episodes have a lot of humorous scenes which felt a bit too much for me. So, I ended up watching up to episode 2 and putting it on hold for some time until a few weeks ago when I gave it another chance. And, boy was I surprised. After around episode 3 or 4, the storyline picked up and it got so interesting to watch. I was captivated by the characters and the story and I was intrigued about how it would end. I am so glad I did not give up on this drama because it would have been regretful to not have watched this drama. I love that it is a battle of evil against evil, as a paraphrased quote from the drama, because this is a theme I love to watch in dramas. So, if you enjoy seeing bad guys take down bad guys in a satisfying way, that is one reason to give this drama a try! Other reasons to watch this drama are the amazing chemistry of the cast members, the hateful villains, the superb acting, and great bgm/OST. The acting is one the biggest reasons to try this besides the plot! SO MANY TALENTED ACTORS IN THIS DRAMA! So many of the actors in this drama can act with their eyes and they each pulled off their characters amazingly. I suggest that you should not judge this drama by other people's reviews and the synopsis, but actually give it a try first before making your decision about continuing it or not. It may take you three episodes to get into Vincenzo as I did, but it will be worth it in the end so I hope you at least watch up to episode 3 if you are not hooked from the beginning. The only thing that bothered me was that the humor sometimes felt pushed BUT even though the humor may be a bit too much sometimes, overall, the drama was such a great watch. SO PLEASE TRY THIS DRAMA!! You will not regret it once you finish. I am already missing Vincenzo now :(( I wish there are more dramas like this..

More details on why I liked this drama but may spoil.....
.
.
.
.
.
1. I grew to love Vincenzo's relationship with the Geumga Plaza residents and Jang Han Seo. It was cool to see the hidden skills of the residents and their willingness and loyalty to Vincenzo despite not liking him in the beginning. I became attached to them and some moments were very touching.
2. Vincenzo is so cute with Hwang Min Seong and Jang Han Seo. The unexpected friendship between Vincenzo and Han Seo was adorable to watch and it made me really sad that Han Seo's ending was what it was because I wished to see more interactions. Hwang Min Seong is also cute with Vincenzo even though he is a terrible person, because he is willing to change for love lol. I hope to see the actors who played Min Seong and Han Seo is more projects and hopefully as the male leads because they are super talented!
3. The emotional scenes were a bit unexpected but they were carried out nicely. I did not cry but I did tear up when Cha Young's dad died. It was actually his death that pushed forward the plot and made it more interesting to watch because it pushed Vincenzo and Cha Young to team up against Babel.
4. THE ACTING WAS OVERALL JUST AMAZING! I haven't ever fully watched one of Song JoongKi's dramas but he showed me why he is a top actor in this drama. His drama was just amazing and I don't even have the words to describe how well he did as Vincenzo. His acting was top notch and I loved how he pulled off the emotions with only his eyes. The other main and supporting actors were also amazing as well. Taecyeon and Yeo Been were great for my first time watching them. It was also nice seeing some Crash Landing On YOu actors in this drama with a humorous role again.
5. The cinematography was amazing too. I love how they ended each episode with a cliffhanger with dramatic music and a zoom in on Song Joongki if he's in the scene. It just blew me away and made me want to quickly go to the next episode.

A little disappointed
Sooo i started Vinzenzo beacause of my friend who loved it ♡
The beginning was impressive, but then it was a little to boring (at first it was slow the story but after 10 episode came the 'good stuff' )
I understand that they wanted to combine all the types •action
•mafia
•sadness
•comedy
•romance
But the result for me was: some scenes was masterpiece and some others was boring.
Except from that, the story was good and interesting but there were times that i was lost for what was going on
On the other side i can say that i loved the acting like OMG i was not expecting but i was shocked(in a good way) many times
I loved that the role of female protagonist was a powerful (metaphorical) woman
The production, ok, i don't have words, it was obvious FANTASTIC and the ost was veryyy good
I reccomaded mostly for the acting!

Masterpiece of the year
Vincenzo was well written and perfectly executed in my opinion. No overload of romance to the point where it takes away from the story. Highly recommend.

This drama perfectly balances drama, comedy and violence without being overbearing in any aspect.

The ending perfectly captured the way that Vincenzo is neither a hero nor a villain, he still does bad things, and ""doesn't care about justice,"" yet we still see him develop relationships with people and treat others with sympathy, which introduces a dilemma for the viewer.
A dilemma which Hong Cha-young also faces as she learns more and more about Vincenzo.

Captivating and most definitely worth the watch !
I just finished ep20 and I wanted to see the ending before writing a review because not only is the plot important to me but the ending is as well. It can really make or break a kdrama/series/movie imo. Vincenzo was chill and amazing. I loved the cast. I loved the fast retribution and the overall pace of the show. If you haven't, i highly suggest you give it a shot. I fell in love with han seo. I'm so happy he wasn't a bad guy. I wish he didn't have to die but i guess it worked for the best. Vincenzo was ofc and exceptional actor in this (when is he never tho?) The scene where he and his mom are at the park talking about each other while not talking about each other make me bawllllllll. His mom saying what she would say to her son not knowing that she was saying it to him all along. And i also appreciate the fact that it wasn't overly romantic. And that romance wasn't the focus but instead friends and family.

This is masterpiece. The excitement and and the emptiness of finishing this drama is still here.
ACTING/CAST:
Song Joong ki - He is PERFECT for the role. He execute the whole Vincenzo vibes. I still remember the scene where he is punching this one guy, his eyes in that scenes is just so scary. And then how he jump into being our Corn Salad is just so cute.
Jeon Yeo bin - She is not a rising star anymore, she is now shining up there. Brighter than everyone else. Her character and how she portray it, is just so LIT. She really did a good job, better than good job, I have no words. Big thumbs up to her very appealing portrayal and diction as Hong Cha young. (I just love her, I falling to her, though I'm straight).
Taecyeon - To all his dramas that I've watched, Vincenzo is different league. But he freaking spice this drama so well, that you will never think that he is an idol. Han seok, his character, is so freaaaking irritating and I'm really furious at him, meaning Taecyeon did really well for his character.
The lawyers (Choi Myung hee & Han Seuk hyung) - Big thumbs up for the two, especially Kim Hye jon, oooh goodness self, just how many times I've beaten up myself to wish you bad. Good job
Jang Han seo & Geumga Tenants - Everyone portray uniquely and shines individually and as a group. Big spoce in the drama.
And our Inzaghi - you virtual birdie, thank you for saving our Corn Salad.

STORY & PRODUCTION & VISUAL FX:
Story is just ghad dam amazing. Cute, flirting scenes, fighting, guns scenes, death. Just everything is so good in the production. ++ love how colors of every scenes, it just gives totally the vibe of the scenes. Inzaghi and green screens - MAMA MIA

OST:
Every song is soo damn good. Periodt.

REWATCH VALUE:
i WILL absolutely watch this again. Let me finished ""Be Melodramatic"" (Jeon Yeo bin's drama) She is just a girl crush.

‘Un diavolo scaccia l’altro' that means ‘A devil punishes another devil.’
AS THE HEADLINE SAY, THERE'S NO HERO. EVERYONE IS EVIL AND THAT'S MAKE THE STORY MORE INTERESTING TO WATCH!!

Firstly I wanna say, Don't judge a drama just by our reviews, because NO DRAMA CAN FULFILL EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS!!! Just remember this and we all like/dislike/drop the drama only bcz of our interest and mood.

Those who love a drama which has lots of twist and turns, mixture of different genres then you'll definitely gonna like this drama.

Coming to the story line, then according to my pov, I must say this drama will grow on you, the more you'll watch the episodes. The story is a slow burn but each scene will make an impact ( as I have said it's a mixture of diff genres). The story is unpredictable to think what will happen in next episode. Everyone has their own way to win the battle and I must say this is the best thing they have portrayed in this drama that no one is perfect and if someone has done something wrong, then that person should be punished by having the same thing done to them. And that's what I'm gonna call the theme of this drama.

The characters are so fitted for this story. Each character has something unique and also has a very great importance and you will get to know when you will watch the episodes. From being totally suspicious/crazy to becoming a part of something big, you'll see the growth of each character and will fall in love with each character originality.

I'm not gonna exaggerate more about this drama freshness and creativeness because I believe if I'll do, it will loose it's own charm. Just wanna say go and experience it in your own way!!

A TREAT TO WATCH <3
I have been watching so many shows simultaneously (thanks to the amazing country of South Korea for giving us these precious dramas all year round) and this one is such a treat to watch I'm in love with the whole concept, the main leads, and even THE VILLAIN heheee WOW I mean I wouldn't want to give you spoilers so i'll just say that everyone on this show has got a really really good sense of humor and that's what makes it a treat to watch.. The neighbors, the main girl, even the villain hahahahha and they all got style especially our Song Joong Ki & Jeon Yeo Been.. I am loving Cha Young's character so much she is smart, quirky, funny and sooooooooooo EXTRAAAAAAAA loove her and uri VincenZo shi ;) is the level-headed one.. That's why they make the perfect pair.. Loving both of them SO MUCH.. Loving the mafia vibe and loving how Vincenzo makes funny remarks keeping a poker face lol Song Joong Ki is an amazing actor.. How does he even do it?? He is funny yet scary at the same time while looking so incredibly handsome in his booralro suits??? Also, the highlight of episode 7, ""THE CHILLI SCENE"", You have got to watch this show guys every scene is worth it.. You are going to enjoy this show A LOT.. And I'm already so excited for the ""heist"" part because somehow I feel like all the residents will be involved and it is going to be insanely funny lol but that's just my assumption.. I'm only at episode 7 so let's see how it goes.. :D

A series from the bad guy's point of view?? I eat this sh*t up
First things first: I'm Italian, so watching Vincenzo for me has been... an experience XD

I loved this series. Despite the (expected) stereotypes about Italians and the mafia, I could thoroughfully enjoy it.

What I love the most about this series is that the main character is a villain. He is a bad guy, a criminal, a guy who knows that he doesn't deserve Heaven or redemption, who is aware of his being bad and doesn't act like he wants to redeem himself.

The series doesn't hide or try to soften the fact that Vincenzo is a criminal, and I loved it. Up to the very end, you don't get some cheesy message like ""yeah I did bad things, but for the right reasons because I believe in justice"". That's just bulls*it, you won't find any ""legal"" justice here.

Don't get me wrong, Vincenzo is far from being unlikeable. In fact, he's very much likeable and you can't help rooting for him even when he does 'bad' things. But as you watch, in some remote part of your brain a voice says ""wow, this guy is ruthless"". And yet you can't help but fall in love with him for so many reasons.

Song Joongki in this drama is simply Oscar-worthy. And I loved how they managed to use the whole cast well despite having so many characters. I really grew fond of every single character.

Chapeau at the whole team behind this drama because they made 20 episodes of 90 minutes each (each episode is like a movie basically) and yet I never felt bored for one minute while watching it. It's pure entertainment! I wouldn't rewatch just because it's really really long, but who knows! I might rewatch my fave episodes in a month's time. There are many great epic moments in this!

Last thing I want to say is: Moonlovers should have had this kind of ending. It was that easy to give it a happy ending. Thank you Vincenzo for giving me my happy pill!

Ps: despite this drama not really romanticizing Italian mafia, I also think they painted a way too 'cheerful' picture of it. And unfortunately there are no charming guys like Song Joongki, so remember: MAFIA IS BAD!

The only kdrama in 2021 where I did not skip or hit the pass forward button
May 6, 2021

Holy shit, it has come to an end for bingeing this series and I am fking dead. Hands down Vincenzo deserves the hype that it has! It is literally the only kdrama released this year where I never found boring. Each 20 episodes were fulfilling and I can tell that the writers put effort into producing such a brilliant series.

First and foremost the CGI, HOLY CRAP. The graphic is just majestic you can clearly tell that the producers and directors put everything they can to fking deliver. I don't care what anyone else says, but many kdramas from late 2020 to early 2021 are full of mediocre plots. A lot of them were very disappointing. I have drop a lot of them or skip until the finale just so I can it was good. I feel like Vincenzo and Penthouse were the well-written ones out here.

As for Vincenzo Cassano himself, I can say that he is majestic. Obviously, we know that he has a past and that he is not really a hero, but he isn't a villain either. He pretty much just trying to live his life. He is so funny and ironic. And his chemistry with Cha Young is off the charts. Well obviously the romance aspect was not really the main focus but it is still pretty well delivered.

Cha young on the other hand is strong female lead who is a badass bitch and intelligent asf. She may have her Damsel in distress moment but overall I love her acting and her character. She is very charismatic and not a nuisance.

HAN SEO, AH MY BELOVED HAN SEO. I am so happy that he was able to find true brotherhood with Vincenzo. I am so sad that things had to end that way with him. I literally fking bawled the fuck out of my eyeballs. Holy crap, how can the writers be so fking cruel. Like goddamn it! TVN U BITCH U ALWAYS WRITE OFF MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS!!!!!!!

It's like starting a race too fast & then slowing down while compromising form, etc.
• effeminate ML and effeminate villian quite cringe & they don't fit the look for their roles.
• the acting isn't bad it's average from most of the cast
• too much comedy for something as serious as mafia, & annoyed me how much they allowed the FL to go around saying ""mafia"" recklessly in public.
• I enjoy slapstick comedy & find it funny but this drama ultimately has yet to exceed my expectations so far
• It's just very average/regular drama
• heard it's just like Fiery Priest which I have yet to see but even if by same writer I dislike 90% copycat dramas

Overall I think this drama has been really good so far. I love the casting, and all of the actors and actresses have been doing really great. You can truly tell that they put a lot of emotion while acting which made the drama even better. And I think Ok Taec Yeon's acting was Incredible and it played a big part in his character. I do think that it's a bit slow in the beginning but once you get a couple episodes in, the plot story starts moving along. The drama is filled with thrilling episodes, comedy, action, suspense and a tiny bit of romance. I do suggest watching the k-drama Vincenzo if you haven't already. I guarantee you will love it. Enjoy!

Let me start by saying that I do feel reviews in general are based on an individual’s preference and Vincenzo is definitely my type of Korean drama.

This drama is currently on the top of my “most anxious/anticipated drama to watch”. It is hilariously funny, it’s got suspense, unexpected events, always something new and different to share in each episode. Some people might think this drama is a bit overboard with the comedy but I loved it! I enjoy every bit of it and each supporting actor contributes to that at one point or another. Each one also seems to be an expert in a different field from one another, so they each have their turn to shine and I also enjoyed this.

SONG JOONG KI - he makes an awesome Vincenzo, he’s got the cool, handsome vibe. He’s supposedly serious but that’s also what makes him just as funny. He’s a greater fighter and a sharp shooter. He really does make Vincenzo extremely attractive.

JEON YEO BIN - first time watching her and she’s got a great partner in crime with SJK so I’m hoping they can make her character shine a bit more.

OK TAEC YEON - seeing him play a villain was a bit difficult to adjust in the beginning but his character definitely grew on me. I loved his every so often small English phrases, I enjoyed seeing his anger and his frustration, just his plain evilness, he does a good job.

I feel the only thing lacking thus far is the romance between ML and FL and I’m such a huge fan of a good romance, so I’m hoping we get to see a bit more of it as it’s coming close to ending.

I watch this drama the same way someone would watch a movie at the theater. I need my snacks and drinks ready so I can be in tune, not miss a beat, and glue to my seat. I feel not every drama needs to be 100% serious and by the book, having a mixture of everything brings out the best of all worlds.

You can avoid flying knives, but you can’t avoid hidden ones
Review: South Korean series ‘Vincenzo’

This has to be one of the best series I have watched. The cinematography and everything was impressive. The storyline was smoothly played out without any disappointments. The unpredictable twists and turns were what kept me on the edge every episode. The plot is not only masterful but the comedic timing at every turn, keeps you wanting more content. I liked this show because it features a female character who represents everything patriarchal society disapproves of - she’s loud, outspoken, persistent, etc and doesn’t hesitate to make herself visible in a crowd. What I love most is that the plot didn’t go follow the evil to morally good cliche, instead, the protagonist aka Vincenzo justifies his existence as someone who uproots evil when the law is not sufficient to punish the monsters which make the show even more unique. This doesn't also mean that Vincenzo is a hero, he's an anti-hero. As per him, he is trash which can't stand the trash that smells worse than him.
This drama shows us that there are instances where justice should and can be served mercilessly in a so evil world nowadays. The whole show truly lived up to its genre, which is ‘dark comedy’ and focused on their motto “only evil can punish evil” and I believe they’ve delivered it perfectly.

The cast indubitably performed so well that I could feel the emotions going on in every scene. Until the last scene, they unquestionably did a great job.

It’s a must-watch series - 10/10, will recommend it to everyone.

Did I like it? Yes. Would I criticize it? Also yes cuz why not?
This review will point out some positives and negatives.

I'll be speaking about 4 main points.

1. The Pacing
2. The Villain
3. The Romance
4. The Characters

[The Villain]

I'll start off with the biggest shortcome of this series, the villains. They were fundamentally weak antagonists. When you watch them, you DO NOT think,
""Wow, they are a step ahead.""
""Omg, they are always winning!""
Because they never were. They were always behind. Even their so called small ""victories"" were never real victories. They were hollow. Whenever they try to gain an upper hand, they follow the exact same tactic throughout the entirety of the series. There were probably only few instances that they do something different aka bribe. You always knew, when watching, that Vincenzo would outsmart them. Which makes them boring and flat. They were not as smart as they initial were portrayed. The fact they even lasted that long is beyond me. I don't feel frustrated neither do I feel excited. They are that dull.

I had high hopes for our female villain but she truly just sucked. Had she been a good, smart opponent, it would have made everything more impactful and sweet when she gets what she deserves. One of the things that struck me as odd is how we don't get a background story on why she does the things she does and why she joined hands with Han Seok. Where does her trust in him stem from?

I would say Han Seo was the one that actually made me curious. He was a puppet but he was behaving in ways that were conflicting which made him interesting. His character development easily made him the most enjoyable one to watch.

[Characters/Pacing/Romance]

The series didn't use their time duration wisely. A lot of it was mundane. I would say they could have easily fixed it if they gave a bit of a background story about each of the tenants to deepen the connection with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, the tenants do grow on you and become an enjoyable aspect of this show. However, a short montage would have done the trick. It would have made this excellent if we knew more about them then just the surface.

With that being said, I would say the one character that disappointed me from start to end was the female lead. Her personality was fine and I gotta give her props for not enforcing her values on the male lead. However, she does BARE MINIMUM throughout the entire 28 hours of this series. Her role diminishes as the series goes. You know the writer messes up when the side characters does MORE than the main character. Even a bloody bird did something LOL. She is just there to represent Vincenzo plans during court because Vincenzo is Italian, therefore he can't be an attending lawyer in another country. I like it more when female characters have some worth to the story and she had the potential to go through a cool transition so it bummed me that it never happened.

But the good news is, she's a love interest. That covers up her shortcomings very well because you can enjoy the romance and the side characters can fill the gaps she is missing so you don't lose much viewing experience over her doing nothing. Romance is important because a lot of people can't watch a drama without romance. Plus the romance is actually mature, subtle and realistic. It doesn't use communication but actions to portray love. Whether you think they have chemistry or not is up to you to decide because it's subjective. If you you don't think they have chemistry then... YIKES.

Another thing I would say this series does well is being consistent with who Vincenzo originally were and they have done a lot of bold, daring, refreshing revenges that other dramas have never done before. It can't be replicated. When you watch them, they do leave an impact in you and it's very likely you won't forgot them.

I would like to end my review by saying the plot had a couple loose ends but you can move on from them. I do, however, want to address the Deus Ex Machina that is called the Guillotine File that somehow ended up in the same place as our protagonist...the whole existence of that file is ???? it doesn't bother me but I do want to point out how it's a very obvious plot convenience.

Incorporates a perfect blend of different genres
One of the best shows of 2021 if not the best. The story is phenomenal and the acting done by all the cast is amazing. Ok Taecyeon's acting as a sweet intern to the cold-blooded villian was terrific to watch. So was the acting delivered by Kwak Dong-Yeon who played his traumatized brother just wanting someone to love. And can't forget Jeon Yeo-been's amazing acting as the one of her first main lead! Last but not least is the man himself Song Joong-ki who portrayed Vincenzo perfectly. Overall Id say this drama is in my top 5!

Just finished Vincenzo last night and I personally enjoy the whole 20 episodes eventhough there wasn't that many ear catching soundtracks. I think it was a great and smart ending. I love how they wrapped it up and stay consistent with ""Only evil can punish evil"". Cause that's the main point of this drama. It's so satisfying to see all those evils punished in the end. Sad but in the end, our best boy did not die in vain. I personally think with or without romance, it would still turn out good but you know you gotta spice it up to make it delicious. Great one.

Exceeded The Standards of a Korean Drama
The way I’m SHOOK by this is unbelievable.
Everything about this was a chef’s kiss.
The Cast was SO PERFECT! Most importantly everything in this drama was balanced. Comedy, Romance, Suspense, Thriller, Action, Bromance (what we crave)- everything was extremely well balanced.
This drama has exceeded the standards of a Korean drama. This is international level y’all.

Cast: The cast was so perfect. Each and every character ROCKED their role and nobody could’ve done it better than them. I was a little concerned about Tacyeon cause he is a cutie and the role of the villain seems new but like damn that man was perfect. I’ve seen many joon ki dramas and I know his capability, but the way he impressed me here is INSANE!

Overall: I really recommend this to EVERYONE. No matter what genre your into you will come to love this. It’s a high quality drama made with utmost care. I really respect this dram. Majorly impressed!

*Major Spoilers Ahead*

I was mad they killed Han Seo, but it was realistic. I can understand why they killed my sweetheart cause it seemed really realistic.
The End: I was honestly very surprised by the end (in a good way) I am highly impressed by the way it ended cause it seemed the best. No matter what people wanted they did not kill the image of Mafia Vincenzo Cassano. No matter how much he loves our little miss Hong, he did not forget his principle and his identity of a mafia and I’m impressed. This IS how a mafia would realistically choose. This HIGH KEY seemed like I was watching a high end Italian drama. I am so impressed and I honestly recommend this to everyone!

Amazing story and character developments
These months when Vincenzo aired, were some of the best months of my life, as I was looking for some dramas that have some more comedy than your usual rom-com dramas. Well, this drama came with a pack made by both action and comedy. So let's start with the story.

~The story was pure gold. Everything from start to end was *chef kiss*. In my opinion, it wasn't draggy and it certainly was not boring. Even though there were some unhappy events, the plot was still going strong until the end.

~The acting was on point. Jun Woo is one of the villains that made me feel really mad and in some moments, I was even terrified of him. That's how good he portrayed his role. I'm glad that villains got what they deserved, in the end. The tennants were so funny, and, along with the other actors, they never failed to make me smile.

~ The OST : Brilliant. Amazing. Show stopping. Spectacular. Never the same. Solar and Aalia (and everyone who took part in creating the OSTs) are very talented and have wonderful voices. 10+ for the OST.

Also, I plan to rewatch it pretty soon because I already started to miss each character, from tennants to everyone at Jipuragi Law Firm.

A diamond I found in a box of coal
The rating though mayn't be accurate according to some peoples' preferences and taste but it has made its way to be my current most enjoyed and favorite drama of 2021. This review I have been waiting to write for over a week or two and I finally get a chance. I'm gonna keep it quite short and less on the spoilers.
The story is the kinda of vibe I am actually into, by vibe I mean the comedic scenes in every episode, the thrill being present, though there is romance it is not to heavy or only focuses on that and of course our charming male lead. Each supporting role and actor had made the whole show a show of amazing performances and laughter filled. I can't say I didn't have a smile before every episode and after one XD. I was excited to know what will happen next and at times even wished the episodes were released everyday instead twice a week that was the only major problem I had while viewing this (while airing).
Song Joong Ki is one of my most favorite actors and if you are a fan I know for a fact you will enjoy this but even if you are not you will start to like him. I started to like his acting or his dramas after his acting in Descendants of the sun and I don't have to say more about Jeon Yeo Bin's acting. It was my first time watching one of her dramas and I was impressed. Loved her character from the beginning to the end, all her funny sides, happy sides and of course her evil revengeful sides. They each had their own charm. Including the pigeons and also the villains, none of the actors made my experience feel boring or not interesting. I think this is what's important when you watch such dramas which are not based on complete reality.
This drama focuses on the corruption of society and how people from various parts (common people) of it join hands to bring it down and bring over justice, mafia and killing is not something done in all parts and the corruption is not basically severe to the extent as it was shown but I liked how there was drama which portrays this message through an entertaining way and wasn't like the others I found which just show the corruptions and the justice winning and nothing else(like literally no form of content or laughter). Further on the music was simply amazing. No other words, you have just gotta listen it yourself to judge it.
So overall this is the kinda of drama I enjoy on days I am completely utterly bored and there is no action. Recommend to people like me and all the others and definitely has a high rewatch value from my side.^_^

This is my first review so it might not be amazing.
Vincenzo was a drama I picked up on weeks after the first episode aired, I'm more of a hard romance watcher but this show has absolutely influenced me to watch more action-type dramas.

Story: overall the story was very solid, good pacing and fantastic written main characters. Although I do wish they would have touched more on the side characters (people living in the plaza).

Acting: I haven't actually watched anything by the two main leads (Song Joong Ki and Jeon Yeo Bin) but now after their performances in this show I am definitely interested in seeing more that they are in. Ok Taec Yeon was absolutely fabulous in his role, probably one of the best performances I have seen in a drama.

Final Thoughts: I'm not one to usually rewatch shows but this one would most likely be one of the top contenders. Excited to see what these three main leads get up to next.

EDIT: I totally forgot to mention how good the locations and camera work are in this show, some of the angles they took at certain points in the show were so amazing. Any time they turned the camera sideways for a shot was spectacular, I don't really know how to explain why it's so good but it was. Also the fighting scenes were very well done, I know Song Joong Ki is used to action-type scenes but they were still very good.

An easy-to-watch drama
This drama for sure deserves recognition. This amazing cast truly knows how to deliver some incredible characters. The constant plot-twists compels you into watching the next episode. Everything is on point and you cannot help but fall for the charm of these actors. The only thing that prevents this from being a masterpiece is the comedy, without the humor, it would have been a real thriller to count on. Even so, the comedy still makes it easy to watch and prevents it from becoming too serious, and I believe some may prefer it that way since it gives more personality to the characters. The romance isn't a big part of it all but it must be the most natural and best displayed romance I have ever seen on-screen in dramas. It doesn't come off as forced and you cannot help but love them together.

WATCH. IT. WATCH IT NOW!!!!!
OMG!!!!! I HAVEN'T FELT THIS EUPHORIC SINCE HEALER!!!

Honey, The Actinggg??? A+
The intricacy and brilliance of scheming??? Elite!
The comedyyy???? GOLD
CHILE THE EYE CANDYYY????? OH SO DELIZIOSO ??!!!!!

This was not a drama with a good side and a bad side. This is no ""good triumphs over evil"" drama. This is a fight over who's the Badder Baddie. I know we're only in the first half of the year, but this is already the drama of the year. IDC IDC. Tbh I'd love for there to be a strong contender before the year is over, but honestly idk that anyone can top this. This storyline by itself- the dark hero that gives the bad guys the punishment they deserve without pretending to be no goody-two-shoes- gives such a cathartic feeling of ""HELL YEAH!!!!"" that literally has you drunk on adrenaline after every episode and craving more. Factor in the amazing actors, the brilliant writing, and stunning visuals and I can already tell the withdrawal symptoms are gonna be severe with this one. I rated the rewatch value a 9 only because some of the joy of the series is the plot twists and surprises so this wouldn't I do think some of that would be lost in a re-watch but I definitely see myself coming back in a couple of months for a full rewatch and definitely will be indulging in short clips on YouTube.

Let's dive into some of the characters, shall we? ⛔️SPOILERS AHEAD ⛔️

THE GOOD BADDIES:

SONG JOONGKI IS SO HOT FOR WHAT?!? And the range chile. From Hot sexy action daddy to comedic genius older bro, to cute puppy in love all at the same time y'all. He's phenomenal and honestly he better get ALLL the end-of-year drama awards. 🤌🏾Vincenzo Cassano🤌🏾, my Mafia Zaddy with a big heart. Tbh I usually don't like morally compromised leads because I struggle to support them fully but he was so brilliantly written as doing this for the little guy that I couldn't help but fully encourage him to kick some a$$ and blow some heads off. Obviously, I know he did stuff while he was in the Mafia that was most definitely NOT to defend the little guy...but they didn't focus too much on that and just lead us to a point where we would very happily follow the man to jail.

JEON YEO-QUEEN-BEEN!!!! NUFF SAID but here's some more anyway. Hong Cha Young was never an angel but oh how I relished her further villainous corruption. Her father dying was her true villain-origin story and the queen dived right in and took her rightful place by Vincenzo's side. I love that she's crazy and funny but is DAMN good at her job! I laughed and cried with her so obviously her acting is superb. The only queen deserving of my King 🤌🏾Cenzo🤌🏾.

The entire Gemga Plaza squad. Y'ALL WISH YOU HAD A SQAUD SO FLY AND TALENTED. QUEEN SEO MI RI, the beautiful and talented hacker turned piano teacher, NAM JOO SUNG, special effects master and member of the Cornsalad Daddy 🤌🏾Cenzo🤌🏾 fan club along with National Intelligence Service agent, AHN KI SEOK, and wrestling athlete YANG KYUNG WON. The whole building was badass and I can't list everyone but dammit even the MONKS came throughhhh. Not sure if Geumga squad would count as baddies but they're sha not totally on the right side of the law.

THE BAD BADDIES:

DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FINEST BADDIE TO EVER DO IT- OK TAEC-ME-DADDY-YEON!!!! Your faves could NEVER look so hot covered in pig's blood- Damn, girl we really went there? YES, WE MF-ING DID!!! Bro I have NEVER hated someone so much (a testament to his acting) but also be absolutely delighted with and enamored by his crazy (again hats off to the acting)- totally see the appeal of toxic relationships now. Although I missed Joon Woo's puppy-in-love character.....I was absolutely here for the Psychotic Babel CEO murderer. I wanted him dead but enjoyed his pretty face enough to happily watch 16 episodes of him being an a$$ (he was sweet in the first 4). I really wanna give Ok Taecyeon all the accolades because idol actors get such flack and he consistently proves that he is a master of his art and no one can look down on him.

Choi Myung Hee: She's literally the worst. Hate her a$$. Literally wanted her dead so much I was begging every episode. She has zero remorse, not cuz she doesn't know what that is like our diagnosed psychopath Jang Hang Seok, but because she chooses not to be remorseful. She's a cruel, loyal af leech that's looking for power and will crush any and everyone to get it. AND SHE'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!! Kim Yeo Jin (actress) has such range in acting!! I have seen her play the sweetest mother and the evilest queen. I have loved her and I have despised her. SHE. IS. BRILLIANT!!!!

Jang Han Seo: I honestly don't think my baby deserves to be in this section because he really is the bestest boy but I guess since he was on the other side for most of the drama I'll put him here. My baby was a tormented and bullied soul. The people who should have loved him used and humiliated him almost crushing his spirit and sense of self. As soon as he saw a lifeline (Daddy 🤌🏾Cenzo🤌🏾) he grabbed it and hung on to it for dear life and love. I AM SO FREAKING PROUD OF HIM. MY HEART IS SO FULL WHEN IT COMES TO HIM AND I NEED KWAK DONG YEON (actor) TO PLEASE JUST STAR IN SOMETHING WHERE HE'S HAPPY!!! My man is always suffering abeg. IONTBO, My Strange Hero, now Vincenzo. Man always has such horrible luck with family mehn. Can we just have him be born into a loving family and he can meet a nice partner and just be freaking happy. He deserves that!

HONORABLE MENTIONS
Cornsalad Daddy 🤌🏾Cenzo🤌🏾fan club: Kim Sung Chul (Tae Ho's sugar daddy) and that Tailor that got Vin fitted for his new suits

WATCH. IT.

Borderline on Comic relief
This drama is one of my favorites this year, having watched 18 episode of it I can boast that you will hurt your ribs from laughing too hard while watching this drama. The plot is simple, Vincenzo fled italy to Korea to get his buried gold out of Guemga plaza , we have our female lead who still works for the villian. I love how most of the tenant in Guemga plaza have a secret identity... No scratch that .... Almost everyone in this fr***king drama as a hidden motive or secret identity. The villians are almost as comical as the heroes. Just when you think oh no it's over for our Mafia friend Vincenzo he bounce back with countermeasures of his own (absolutely brilliant). Overall you would want to revisit some of the most hilarious scene (lots ofthem).

Best Dark Comedy Drama Ever
Story: THRILLING
Cast: INCREDIBLE (SJK 😌, JYB🔥 and everyone else is just bomb)
Visuals: EYE CATCHING & EYE SOOTHING
Twist: YOU WILL BE HOOKED.
OST: the songs are amazing
Every episode ends with a bang, first two episode may seem slow but after that you won't be able to stop. Every character is important and their acting skill is stunning. The director and writer did such a mind blowing job. Twist comes your way like nobody's business. Humor is full on, you will laugh like crazy then get angry and then sad. It's full on entertainment. They served looks , istg.
Song Joong Ki looks smoking hot btw.

Worth your time tbh.

Better than I expected
I had no idea what to expect with this, but the Italian mafia ties and setting in S Korea had my attention. The intensity and drama are there along with some comedy (sometimes a little too silly for me). There are a couple of characters that, to me should not be as ""goofy"" as they are.

But this is worth watching. The leads are good actors and pull this off well. The bomb has dropped and they all know who the chairman is now and the fight between Jang Jun Woo and Jang Han Seo just got started. I'm looking forward to each episode as it comes out.

SJK poor script choice
Indians will understand
This drama is like a remake of south indian movie. If you see any mahesh babu movie,he comes to his motherland,fights with local goons,saves the area,is very kind hearted but can fight,the whole fight is connected with the female lead...blah blah blah...the same story
It is maybe new for international viewers but it is the usual story for indian viewer.This is not like any other kdrama and that's why it is bad.
But the characters are definitely better than south indian movies.the male character is gentle with female lead unlike south indian character. And their chemistry is top notch.
Everything was good about this drama except the main plot.
And why the genre is comedy.this is not even dark comedy.this drama was suggested along with iotnbo,hdl,cloy. The other 3 shows were so good that i rewatched it but vincenzo is definitely a bore.

Exhilarating!
This has got to be one of the best kdramas ever. The acting, the directing, the music...it has been such an awesome experience. There have been so many highs and lows. Watching Vincenzo go from sorrowful son to cold killer just shows the skillful acting abilities of this actor. As always the ending of ep 17 has left me gasping for air. Of course there are not enough words to describe the supporting cast. Every one has played their role to perfection. Even the music is noteworthy. There are only 3 episodes left and of course we are hoping to see Vincenzo and his crew step off in style. All I can say is wow wow wow….I loved it. It’s a dark comedy so when it was dark it was really dark but I think that is part of the overall appeal. I laughed, I cried , I cringed and got angry. It was like
riding a rollercoaster. Personally I never liked roller coasters but this was one ride I fully enjoyed. Kudos to the ml who I adore and to the entire production team.

So. Much. Fun
I have to admit I was a bit lost at the beginning. I started watching thinking it was going to be a crime series and after the first episode I was completely lost and about to drop the whole thing. But as often, I keep watching just in case it picks up. And then the whole comedy aspect hit me and I started to laugh. Hard. I love the whole thing. The lead team with both lead actors is top notch. They are a real power couple. They don’t do too much or too little and their comedy timing is impeccable. Vincenzo’s base story is just an alibi for the whole series and I think I’ve got a few ideas on how this whole thing is going To wrap.
Now, the villain. I remember watching Taec yon as a cute ghostbuster all sweet and things but seeing him as a villain filled me with joy. You can clearly see he’s enjoying the whole experience.
The rest of the cast can’t be left aside as they are, I think for the first time in a long time, quite an important part of the story. I usually skip and get bored by sub plots but here it all makes sense and I’m having a lot of fun.
Each episode brings laughter and derision. So have a go. You’ll tell me “grazie” later

One of a kind masterpiece
Ok let me start off by saying that I had doubts of watching this show but because I was curious I decided to give a chance and let me tell you, that was one of the best decisions I have EVER made. Personally I love law and crime kdramas but I’m not very lucky with finding ones that I like and this one looked promising so I watched the first episode and right from the start I knew I was gonna love it. I love everything about this drama, the villains, the ost, the cast is freaking AMAZING, I love both the male and female lead, and the story is very different from your typical kdrama story. Although I loved all the characters Cha Young was my favorite character and she is so different from your typical female lead and it’s just so nice to have something different once in a while. Jong Ki is so freaking handsome, this role was literally meant for him. The Geuma Plaza people were awesome as well, they were so cute and funny and supportive of each other ughh? the best friendship EVER. This is my first review btw but this drama deserves it so much.. I’ve never watched anything like it and I don’t think I ever will all I’m hoping for is season 2 with the same cast. I do want to make a quick point about Jeon Been and Jong Ki, these two NEED to start dating.. the way they look at each other bts is really something else, I’m honestly not gonna be surprised if they announce that they are dating ?. Also I have the same b-day as Jong Ki jsbdhsbdhidh my birthdays are gonna feel extra special knowing that I have the same birthday as him ahhhhh so happy!!! Anyways thank you to tvn and Netflix for this one of a kind show. I forget a lot of things but I’m never EVER gonna forget this masterpiece!! Definitely be rewatching this.

Clever Dark and Funny Show that is Occasionally Uneven
This show is difficult to cleanly categorize into a fixed genre which makes it very unique. It is a blend of a serious, revenge story and a comedy that isn't shy to draw on different strategies, including meta references to other Korean dramas. I feel the series' main strength is how clever the writing is: there are some very, very funny little moments and there are some very, very, tightly written storylines that have clear setups and payoffs -- I never felt that anything didn't make sense within the constraints of the Vincenzo world nor did I feel like a particular plot ending was overly contrived and random, as is unfortunately the case with some other Kdrama shows.

The symbolism and meta commentary of this show is next level. It's impossible to get into specifics without talking about spoilers, so I won't, but the way that certain things play out show a mastery of fiction writing that I think belongs in a novel.

However, because the drama doesn't consider itself 100% serious nor 100% funny, it does create some unintentional ridiculousness and pacing issues. For example, episode 1 establishes Vincenzo as a serious Italian mafioso to be reckoned with, but does so in kind of a semi-ridiculous Godfather kind of way that makes you wonder whether it is supposed to be funny or serious -- having finished the series, I still don't quite know, so my conclusion is ""kind of both"" which weakens the seriousness of the Vincenzo character, which is important because his expertise as a criminal is leaned on heavily as a plot device throughout the show. Furthermore, the most jarring sin related to this pacing issue is when you are watching a very serious plot line and show decides to throw in a scene that is only humorous -- in that moment, it's sort of like ""I don't really care"" because I REALLY need to know what happens with X or character Y.

Speaking of pacing, I think the first three episodes are the weakest point. You don't really know what the show is about until the first major event happens which takes place at the end of episode 3/beginning of episode 4. This is a short time but I think it's an important for a show to show you ""what it's all about"" right off the bat. However, this series opts for more world building and backstory instead. I also felt the conclusion of the story to be slightly hollow after it resolved everything -- it gave me the feeling of ""everything as expected"" without anything particularly pithy or unique if that makes sense.

Regarding actors, we have to give Song Joong Ki a lot of accolades. He clearly spent a LOT of effort to prepare for his role -- his Italian has been commented by native speakers to have flaws and word choice occasionally unnatural, but understandable without subtitles. This is an amazing feat considering how little time he has had to learn Italian. The other actors are very good too and I especially wonder why Jeon Yeo Bin has been such a well kept secret in the drama world (maybe because she has been working with movies all this time?). Her scenes playing ""ridiculous mode"" Hong Cha Young were easily the highlight of this show for me.

Overall, I think this series was a positive and enjoyable watch. You may think that review is overly critical for such a positive score, but I think there is a LOT of hype surrounding this show and I don't believe it is without flaws, so it is intentional to show a contrast to all the praise showing that I'm sure is everywhere. At the end of the day, give it a watch and decide for yourself.

Dark comedy at its peak
Recently I have been quiet tired of all this romance and heartbreak stuff in dramas, so this show was probably the best combination of action, thriller, drama and a bit of romance here and there that you will find. When I first saw that it was going to have 20 episodes I thought it would get draggy or slow at some point, but trust me it doesn't.
This drama will have you sitting on the edge of the seats, glued to your screens for the whole time.

The story apart from the italian mafia part was genuinely pretty common, but the casting and acting made up for it. Song Joongki was his usual amazing hot self, but Ok Taecyeon just- , he played his part too well. Another really really good thing was how the female lead managed to not annoy me at all, she was strong, smart and righteous without being (again) annoying. Girl Power!

Also the guemga plaza people just stole my heart. Those characters had me wheezing. Even thought one that one thing had me crying at the end, overall I was suprememly satisfied and happy at the end of the drama.

So trust me one this one and just watch it. It is one drama that should not be missed.

The World We Live In
This drama has a great cast who have brought to life a very poignant story line. The director and its production crew should also be commended for portraying this story in such a dynamic manner. There are not many dramas that I would watch again but this is definitely one that I would watch a few more times. Although this is fiction, it does portray some real life aspects such as protection of family and friends, betrayal of those you wouldn't have expected or the comedic side of someone who never seemed to be more than stoic. Well done and wish there could be more of this drama.

~Loved the first half of the show, it dragged on in the second half only to gain amazing pace towards the third half
~Stellar acting by the four main leads but I was rather disappointed with the over-the-top unrealistic and random characterization of the Guemga Plaza residents. It wasn’t my kind of humor after a few episodes to be exact. Most of the latter was just fillers for the second half.
~The lead actors were just too good for the mediocre scripting and the writing went from dark comedy to illogical & absurd especially given how the show had a strong forte in villains.
~The depiction of the gay character and slight homophobia also left a bad taste in my mouth for a show as big as Vincenzo
~All in all, Hong Cha Young is now one of my favorite kickass female heroines in kdramaland, Chachenzo -my favorite crime law pairing and Han Seok one of the craziest villains I have encountered.
~Props to the high quality production and use of CGI though
~I liked how the ending showed that Vincenzo will always be an anti-hero at the end of the day

Perfection
I think everything in this serie is somehow Perfection. It starts a bit slow but after episode four I was completely hooked, and only got better and better.

Acting, storyline, character development, music, everything is great. Is a masterpiece on my book.

Of course is dark comedy with a bit of everything as drama, romance and of course action. I wish to find more series like this one, it was a great surprise, since I wasn't convinced to watch it at first. I'm glad I started watching it, and definitely will be watching it again soon.

I'm the mafia
Where do I start? Again, Vincenzo is one of those dramas that had so much high expectations I was afraid I wasn't going to like it. But, as many times before, I, once again, was wrong.

Starting off with a strong and catching opening scene, we are quickly introduced into Vincenzo's character and personality. The casting team did a really good job at giving Joong Ki the role of Vincenzo cause I think no one could've pulled it off better than him, the character suited him so well I was impressed. He has this charisma that makes you fall in love immediately with him. I really love that Vincenzo has his own principles and ideologies and he lives by those rules no matter what. He has a strong will of justice (eventhough he still denies it in the end, but his actions proved otherwise) but likes to do it by his own rules. He truly cares for the people close to him and will do anything to protect them like family.

Cha Young, another great character, and one of the ones that has the biggest development throughout the drama. She starts as a corrupt and shameless lawyer and changes completely when her turning point hits her life. That moment when she decides to take revange and seeks for Vincenzo's help, that's when her real development as a lawyer and as a person starts. I really like that she brings corckiness to the series and has those funny moments to soothen the tense drama.

Eventhough romance is clearly not the main plot here, I appreciate a little bit of it throught the drama. Vincenzo and Cha Young really complemented each other, and both actors did a really good job. The chemistry slowly grows throughout the episodes and you can feel how both of them start to fall in love. Again, this is not the main plot at all but I really liked their scenes, it felt like a little break from all the action.

Great construction of characters, speacially the ""villans"". I can't streach enough how much I hated Han Seok and Myung Hee. They made my blood boil, and I think that's what make them good villans. They both have motives to be the way they were and I'm really happy with their endings... cause they totally deserve it. Vincenzo finnaly had his revange.

One of the most endiring things about this drama is the family Vincenzo finds at Plaza Geumga. I always love a good group of people that come together to fight a greater evil. You can see how Vincenzo slowly starts to get attatched to these people and how he would do anything in his power to protect them. I really loved their dynamics and how their relationship starts to grow as the episodes went by.

Han Seo... oh my god that character. The way my heart teared apart every time Han Seok treated him like shit. I really loved how, at the end, he stood by himself and decided to do everything in his power to rule Babel legally. Also I'm so happy with the realtionship he formed with Vincenzo, he found a person who he could call brother withouth feeling guilty or humiliated. And that's why his death pained me the most. He didn't deserve it.

This drama has so much plot lines and it's so well articulated that I can't write about everything. I think the writers did a really great job at developing every single one of the plots till the end. I don't really think there was any plot line left unfinished in the end. Also, the way the subplots thread with each other, amazing. Script on point, visual effects too. I'm pretty shook to say the least with the CGI, and it shows how much budget this drama had.

As a conclusion, I really want to say that Vincenzo exceeded my expectations. I'm not really into mafia/politic/corruption dramas, but this one blowed my mind completely. The mafia thing is just one of the layers. And the story is so well structured and developed that you get completely inmersed into the story.

I LOVED the villain more than anyone else
Hooked since the first episode. I already knew who the villain was before starting this drama (wish I didn't), but it was such a good twist.

Starting with the lead this drama is named after, Vincenzo: I love anti-hero leads, and Vincenzo is a vigilante, who classifies as an anti-hero lead, but I didn't love him half as much as I loved the villain. Vincenzo gave me the same vibes as the ML from Lawless Lawyers, but he was much more... elegant and lawless, but also kind of boring. Though he is technically not a 'hero', I thought I'd like him more than the SML, but I was wrong. I don't speak or understand Italian, I've watched few Italian dramas, and I think Song Joong Ki did an amazing job with the Italian. He really pulled off the whole Italian Mafia background storyline.

Hong Cha Young is now one of my favourite FL's in a K/Cdrama. She was a strong FL, who also pulled off being adorable, without being in the least bit annoying. It's hard finding a FL in a Kdrama, and especially Cdramas, that can pull off even one, not to mention both, without being annoying. I loved how crazy she was, not the revenge aspect, but her ""acting"", bad sense of direction and random skipping, singing and dancing. One of my favourite things was her friendship with Jang Jun Woo, wish they were closer at the start.

Jang Jun Woo was my FAVOURITE character in this drama, who STOLE the ENTIRE show. I also loved Ok Taec Yeon's American accent whenever he spoke English and sometimes even in his Korean. Knowing he was the bad guy prior to the reveal, and actually seeing it, was so much better then I expected. I loved him as an Cha Young's intern/only friend. Their friendship was adorable and hilarious. Ok Taec Yeon did such an amazing job portraying such different personalities, his eyes really showed the psychopath in Jun Woo. I know he's a psychopath, but it seemed like he was also bipolar. His relationship with Cha Young was so different to that with his own brother. He also seemed to enjoy being shouted at and essentially being harassed by his 'boss' and especially Cha Young. But, he will also kill you or bite off your ear if you shout at him or mock him. His reveal to his 'bosses' was really well executed, we actually got to see him flip the switch from a 'stuttering' intern who doesn't mind being ordered about, and the psychotic BOSS who will kill you, preferrably with a hockey stick, if you try to order him about:
""Nothing's a problem for me as long as I don't feel like shit"".
I LOVED everything about him. He was such a GOOD, bad guy. He is why I rated this drama so high, because he was a 10/10.

This was my first drama with any of these three actors, and I LOVED them all, but mostly Ok Taec Yeon .

This drama got boring after around 15 episodes. I wanted Jun Woo's identity to be revealed to the other leads much later in the drama than when it was. It was also really anticlimactic. I was only able to finish this drama off for him, and I was rooting for him. His scenes were the most interesting, especially after the reveal.

Sadly, as expected, even a psychotic genius can't outsmart a mafia anti-hero ML.

AMAZING !!!!
This drama was something that made me excited for a Sunday or Saturday, just waiting for the next episode was so exciting. Such a found family drama with amazing friendship and bonds between characters.

The story was amazing and such a creative idea. You never knew what was gonna happen next and the cliffhanger after every episode just made you want to know what was gonna happen next and not put this drama down. They weren't any plot holes which I love, they basically covered everything.

The Acting was amazing !! all the actors pull through and became their characters.
Song Joong‑ki is such an amazing actor a played Vincenzo really well. Vincenzo is one of my favorite characters he is so badass! Also, him speaking in Italian swoon me Lol !! Cha‑young is such a badass character too, she and Vincenzo made such a heck of a duo. Even though some might be disappointed with the romance with these two I think was well done.

Such a satisfying ending, all the characters have found peace and justice. I'm glad for the way that they ended it.

The OST wasn't one of my favorites but they did have some amazing songs on them. My favorites are John Park (존박) - 'I'm Always By Your Side' and Aalia (알리아) - 'Adrenaline'.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPOILERS

WHY DID THEY KILL HAN SEO !!!
I was so happy with his character development and his bond with Vincenzo I was hoping for a happy ending but it was realistic that they did it at least my angle is in peace. T-T

Don’t play with your food, just eat it.
This drama was so so good. The production values are high, the actors are great, the special effects are great, and even the music is exceptionally well done! There’s comedy, light romance, action, big brain strats, lots of plot, and plenty of gimmicks. It’s one of the most well produced dramas I’ve seen.

However...two things bother me.

1) the lead actor is incredibly hot but how TF he sometimes looks like a 15 year old kid wearing his daddy’s suit while others he def looks mid 30s?? And I’m not talking flashbacks to teen years, it’s every episode and sometimes it alternates like several times a minute. IS HE A MAN OR IS HE A BOY??? Did they CG his face to look like a child angel sometimes for lols??

2) how TF does he keep getting his lighter back. Dude throws his keepsake lighter away constantly and yet somehow he always has it five minutes later when he needs to flip it open and closed to look slightly more badass.

Seriously though, the acting in this drama is so well done. The lead chick is hilarious, the lead devil chick is so full of personality, all the actors were so good. And of course the leading dude is really well done. Tiiiny pet peeve with him sometimes seeming to drop character, acting in a way that seems slightly out of character for his role, but tbh I think that’s the writers’ error. Like sometimes they make him do/say things that don’t actually fit with his established personality, but not often enough to define the variances as parts of his core personality...so they seem out of place.

The lead antagonist (and dude there are a LOT of antagonists in this show, it has a HUGE cast) was perfectly cast into his role. He speaks in English a lot and thank you god they went with an actor who has actually lived in America and can talk without a thick accent. It bothered me a lot in other dramas (like Mr. Sunshine) where the character supposedly grew up in America but his accent was so thick and his pronunciation so bad it totally broke immersion. In Vincenzo, however, they did it right and the lead antagonist’s English is perfectly pronounced and sexy as shit.

Overall, this drama is definitely worth watching and rewatching, it has so much depth you’re sure to see something new every time you watch it. ...and let’s be real, there’s never gonna be a situation where you’ve had enough of Song Joong-Ki’s angelic eyes.

Amazing drama
Okay so I’ve been seeing a lot of negative reviews in here and although some do make sense I still find Vincenzo as a very good drama. The cast,ost,cinematography was perfect. The storyline was also great but honestly I found some of the geumga plaza tenants scenes a bit unnecessary but nevertheless it is funny and entertaining. Vincenzo was shown as as a ruthless revengeful mafia but slowly started to become more human and caring because of his partner and mother which was quite the beautiful character development. Song joong ki did an amazing job in potraying vincenzo, his acting is seriously so good. overall for me this is my #1 drama and I’ve rewatched it a couple of times but I’m still never bored of it. I really wish for a season 2 because the story is just so addicting and touching that you wanna see more of them! my favourite drama and recommended for watching to everyone who enjoys comedy,crime & slowburn romance ;)

Clean, funny, great story line.....a couple let downs
I was almost....I mean ALMOST completely satisfied with the whole series. I was just amazed with the series until the 19th episode.
What a let down....I’m a woman but felt like I had blue balls on this
episode....and if I were gay it would be a no reach around and no
vasoline on this behind! That’s how I felt when I saw this 19th
episode...Like WTF just happened? It’s like really....OH REARY, reary......
yes oh reary! Vincenzo could jack up 20 dudes in previous
episodes but he couldn’t get passed like 4 security guards here to
save his friends? And somehow he all of a sudden didn’t have his
silencer gun on him even though he’s mafia and his homies end up
with bullets in them with some sorry ass revolver. It just was so unbelievable.
Part of a good series is that it’s somewhat believable for this character..........
.but this was so out of tune.
Dude V was superb, but like the chick was like a side chick’s side
chick that you might now kick her outta bed but you might not
bring her home to mama. V was handsome and played the part
well....I just thought maybe this was going to make me not regret
500 hrs of my life.....of my life I cannot take back....my husband
guessed every episode...he just good like that.....he should be
writing this crap. You know what saved it to be 9.5 stars? The
comedy had me pee my pants and roll around the floor laughing.
Where do they find these funny dreamers!? Korea has the best
jokes and made me forget my bad days.....amazing how they can
drink Soju in every freaking scene and not have an alcaholic
problem. Anyhow they also saved the ending pretty well....
I’m ready for round 2 of this series please....just don’t make me
regret it....j/k please make another one

Song joon ki is always so expressive and shows deep emotion which is why I just love watching him. I loved the chemistry between the leads and beautifully placed humour. I love SJK of course so action scenes for me were perfect. Also have to say that our bad boy here was kind of hot 😂 too. In fact all the villains in this series did an amazing. Overall a big cast of characters that really all just complimented each other. The Italian steriotypes might have been off but I didn't take that too seriously.

Well Executed! worth a future rewatch
Everything about it was well done. ML was antihero from start to finish. Romance did not bug the story down at all. Loved FL too. Every issue was brought properly to conclusion. I could really see that the show cost 20 billion. Also, the screenwriter, director, and entire cast down to the wardrobe did not waste the investment. I barely skipped anything. If i skipped it is cos i got a bit squeamish to see some things unfold. The villain was well thought out too. The female villain really was a villain. Totally worth a future rewatch. May take in all the finer details next watch. Only downside is that the morale of the story is that villainy cannot be punished by the standard justice system. It leaves normal folk somewhat hopeless as normal people do not role with Mafia boss. Plus, mafia is almost painted positively. Almost, which is not really a good thing. Nevertheless, as a work of fiction, it was excellently executed.

Great quality series that does it all
You start off thinking the show is good, but after episode 3 it becomes great, and after episode 7 it's AMAZING. I'm so glad I found this gem and that a lot of others are enjoying it! Have never enjoyed watching a series as much as I have this show. The best part is, the ending was extremely satisfying (unlike so many dramas that have been ruined by the ending). The romance is UNDENIABLE. Great job SJK and JYB, now please give us more behind the scenes and photoshoots. Overall, I'd give this series a 10/10, and encourage all of those on the fence to give it a try!

Purrrrfecto!
I'm not the kind of person who love watching dark comedy, or the mafia thing but this drama change my whole perception!

It started with a boring and cliche but starting from ep 4, you will start attach to them. You will laugh despite of suspense! Thank God the director make this drama funny and not serious all the time so that I will keep on sticking to my netflix.

The acting: All are superb. At first I watched because of Song Joong Ki but in the end I got crush with the 2nd lead syndrome. Song Joong Ki, we cannot denied that he is very good in acting but this Taecyeon, wow. I am really impressed with this guy. Really can't wait to see his next drama.

So as summary, the whole story is cool and perfect except for the ending. I don't really like how it ends but still this drama is sooo coooool! hands claps and bravo!

BEST ACTION DRAMA OF 2021
Vincenzo Cassano is really a character that you won't forget and Song Joongki definitely gave justice to this character. This drama gives you a perfect balance of comedy, thrill, action, and romance. It is also perfectly casted in my opinion because every actor in this drama fits their role. The only thing that's stopping me from giving this a perfect score is the last episode. To be honest, for me, the latter half of the last episode is kinda dragging. I thought that the whole last episode will be packed with action and will keep me at the edge of my seat but I was kinda disappointed. Maybe I just expected more because of the quality of the first 19 eps. Nevertheless, this drama is still very worthy of your time! If you're looking for a sign to watch this drama, then this is it. Go watch the drama and get ready to fall in love with Vincezo Cassano.

The best dark comedy with a combination of a breathtaking slow burn romance
BRILLIANT STORYLINE. TOP TIER CASTS. UNDENIABLE CHEMISTRY OF THE TWO LEADS.
WOW! This drama is definitely one of a kind, I never regretted watching it. Every character has a big role in the story, this is the first kdrama ever which made me so connected and super attached to each character. The story flows so smooth and that made it very interesting. I was surprised on how they create scenarios that made my heart jump, because it made me feel like I am part of their group. The Guemga tenants never fail to make me laugh out loud, there was no dull moments... it only filled with excitement and fun scenes when Guemga tenants are on the screen. I love how this kdrama gave me a new home, family and comfort. If you are reading reviews about this kdrama, believe me you won't regret watching this and falling in love to their stories and relationship of the CASSANO GUEMGA FAMILY.
I am telling you every episode of Vincenzo is worth watching, every scene is entertaining.. I couldn't take my eyes off from my laptop because I want to watch every detail of the scene.
Song Joong Ki and Jeon Yeo Been's chemistry is on another level, they are so compatible, partners in crime and I love how cool they are in this drama. I want to praise Song Joong Ki for his amazing performance in here, his eyes are literally alive as if they can speak. Song Joong Ki ate this up, this role is meant for him and it is so amazing how he portrayed his role as a mafia consigliere perfectly. I BOW DOWN TO HIM, BEST ACTOR INDEED.
Now, I want to appreciate Jeon Yeo Been's acting, I am grateful I watched Vincenzo because I have found a brilliant and amazing actress. Jeon Yeo Been as Hong Cha Young is definitely my favorite character in the history of kdrama. She is funny, sassy, savage, cool, witty, intelligent, beautiful and stunning. Jeon Yeo Been was able to portray all of Hong Cha Young's character in the story. There was this one scene that made me really astounded by Jeon Yeo Been, when she cried on this one scene I felt her emotions, I felt her pain and that makes her one of the best actress in this generation.
Taecyon as Jang Han Seo (the antogonist) really portrayed his role very very well, I really hate his character and that only ,means he did a great job to act out Jang Han Seok which is really evil. I can't imagine another actor that would act as Jang Han Seok but Taecyon.

The romance here is very satisfying to watch, eventhough romance is not the center of this story but every moment of Vincenzo and Hong Cha Young makes my heart beat stop for a second. They were not that too intimate but the way they create every simple scene like a romantic vibe only proves that they have the best chemistry ever. I am so drown for their love story, it was slow and I love it because it went really smooth which made it fulfilling for us to watch. Their kissing scenes are breathtaking. IT WAS MAGICAL AND PERFECT.

After finishing all the episode of this kdrama, I can't bring myself to watch another kdrama because my standard went too high. I still have this post-vincenzo feeling and I couldn't let go of it. I am praying that they could give us a SEASON 2 because we all deserve it. Although the ending was really really beautiful I am still begging for SEASON 2 HUHUHUHU.

I am obsessed with SONG JOONG KI AND JEON YEO BEEN's chemistry, I mean they are really comfortable with each other, I love how Jeon Yeo Been always makes Song Joong Ki laugh and smile behind the scenes. I never thought I will need this kind of pairing in my life. I wish they could work again in another kdrama but I hope this time it will be a romantic one.

WATCH IT NOW!!!!!!!!!

No words to explain the sensation of this drama 'Vincenzo.'
This drama, 'Vincenzo,' has surpassed my standards significantly. I'm usually one to never participate in such things as 'reviewing' dramas, but this drama had me feel the urge to do so. Honestly I wish I could forget this drama and watch it again. The adrenaline boosts I got from watching this is not explanatory. From the plot, acting, music, cast from end to finish successfully finished in completion to satisfying my standards. As I had awaited after watching episode 15 to binge watch the rest after all the episodes have aired, I've been in constant thought of this drama. I started watching this because of a tik tok edit of 'Kwak Dong Yeon' (in mid-late March) in this drama. He is arguably my favourite actor since 2018 (Oh My Lord I've had the hugest crush on him since 2018). Everyone in this drama acted superbly, I am very impressed. This drama covers almost all aspects, if not many of emotions and stabilizes the need for all sorts of genres. This is the one drama I highly recommend with all my heart. Trust me, this drama had brought my standards up and have been unable to enjoy dramas the way I enjoy Vincenzo. However I really do wish Jang Han Seo didn't die, I couldn't sleep the whole night after watching that specific part.

Well done to production team, cast, cinematographers, OST singers - everybody involved in producing this outstanding drama. Beyond thankful for having experienced watching this and to have encountered this drama. I've been able to unlock a sensation none like other. My highlight of 2021 that stands out most is watching 'Vincenzo' regardless of any upcoming situations I encounter further in 2021.I'm legit going to cry of happiness - oh my- nowait I already have Tehe

Everybody thinks this is a Rom/Com with some Action & Law drama. WRONGGGG. MINOR SPOILE
Everybody thinks this is a Rom/Com with some Action & Law drama. WRONGGGG.

This is a story about Serial Killers (sociopaths) . Its a Horror* Crime drama with some comedy and bad romance even worse who done(sic) it Mystery. The Genre tags should read: Horror, Serial Killers, Crime, Law, Romance, Comedy, Thriller/Mystery

* Horror - Slasher type and not Supernatural. Think more like Saw rather than Final Destination

I think I just felt bad how morally corrupt (murder/blackmail etc) all the main characters were and How thoroughly I enjoyed the show because of it. This fact made me question mine & wider audiences' morality.

E.g. They murdered a van full of people incl. a child & the FL dad was murdered but the sow still flows from this darkness to comedy, flirting. However, I enjoyed this change of pace & kept it from being a doom & gloom fest, but felt guilty in after thought.

The show is a masterpiece of people giving in to their killing urges and not even trying to justify they have a conscience, all while keeping the audience hooked. If you watch the show, with the frame of mind that this is a tragedy drama, rather than a romcom, I wonder if you will have a different out look to mine and many others who enjoyed the show.

However, this show lacks in the romance category, especially as the leads had great chemistry. A Suave international criminal mastermind/hitman with a law degree struggles to confess his feelings throughout the show, made for lacklustre viewing and in need of some romantic spark.

This is a show that effortlessly flows from cold blooded murder, revenge to comedy and romance for 16 episodes without blinking an eye/missing a beat; this is The Godfather with its own special Korean Sauce mixed in.

This is why I love Kdrama. lol


Rating:
Overall 8.5
Story 9 - Considering its about Serial Killers disguised as a Rom/Com/Action..pure genius
Production 6 - They could have stepped up the Rom in Rom/Com
Acting 8 - Serial Killers blending into society as normal functioning people, totally had me fooled. They were only glitchy during the Rom part.
OST 6 - Did its job but nothing memorable
Visual FX 5 - Meh

Fast Paced Cathartic Drama but Not for Everyone
""Vincenzo"" has been a total treat to watch. Song Joong Ki has been blessing us with his unique charm.

PLOT: Consigliere Vincenzo Cassano, a powerful name in the Italian Mafia returned to Korea to recover hidden gold over 300 million dollars. Guemga plaza, the basement where Wang Shaolin's gold is secured using advanced technology is in the risk of getting demolished by corrupt 'Babel Group'. The basement also contains 'Guillotine File', a file containing misdeeds & secrets of higher officials. This is how our consigliere get involved with the countries major & corrupt in every possible way 'Babel group'. The group is backed up by law firm Wusung. Hong Yu Chang has been fighting for justice for a long time. But power oppresses him. He dies in a conspiracy of Babel regarding narcotic painkiller RDU-9 The main culprit behind of Babel kept his identity and his hideous past hidden using his step brother, Jang Han Seo. The tenants were hostile at first, then they collaborated with Vincenzo their corn salad (misinterpretation of consigliere). Vincenzo believes only evil can erase evil. Amidst all these can the Mafia recover his gold teaming up with Lawyer Hong Cha Young & others tenants.

CAST: The cast did an amazing job. The funny and quirky incidents were enjoyable to watch. Also Kim Sung Cheol's cameo was hilarious. The FL's character initially came across irritating to me but as the story progressed I seemed to like her sassiness. Each tenants were a hidden gem.

OST & PRODUCTION: The OSTs and visual effects (specially scenes in Italy) were pretty nice. I loved the fact that they used some classic Italian songs as background music.

The reasons why I deducted stars:
Inzaghi scene- as a watcher I giggled & enjoyed a lot. But this scene could have been more improvised so that it seemed more logical.
In the last episodes when Jung Joon Woo tries to murder Vincenzo, he seemed to escape with Cha Young. There were various scenes where the situation was way worse and he overcame it. But at this point the fleeing scene did not fit for me.
I get it Jung Joon Woo wanted to kill his brother using his own gun. But in such a prime moment, you've killed many before, now you're somehow free from jail, you just come with 2 bullets!

In short ""Vincenzo"" was really enjoyable. If you're expecting gore and extreme violence hearing 'mafia' from this drama then sorry to disappoint, this was more like a dark comedy. If you liked ""Chief Kim"" or ""Fiery Priest"" you're gonna love it. This was fairly a 8.6 or 8.7 rated drama to me.
I would recommend giving it a try.

Not like your typical hyped up dramas
When I first stumbled upon Vincenzo, I was intimidated by the sheer popularity; from Tiktok to Instagram, literally, everyone was talking about this. Having seen how hyped up dramas like True Beauty turned out, I was hesitant in starting it, scared that I would end up being severely disappointed. What I didn't know was that this drama would soon land a well-earned spot on my top 10 dramas list.

The story/plot: Writer Park Jae-Bum and Director Kim Hee-Won really created a story filled with every single emotion on the spectrum, putting an amazing cast together and bringing the story to life. The story begins with an intriguing plot and continues for the whole season; there are small yet necessary build-ups that are vital for character development, making the plot even more fascinating. Of course, the added mystery of the Mafia aspect attracts any crime/mystery fan. What more can you ask for? The best part for me was the development of the romance. There was no rush to incorporate their intimate relationship yet you could clearly see how much the two leads loved each other. The tenderness shared between them gives you the impression of two best friends who will always be by the other's side, no matter the obstacle.

Actors: The people who brought everything to life. Song Joong-ki. NEVER disappoints. His range is impeccable. But I got to give it to Jeon Yeo-been. To act out such a lovable character and have everyone under her grasp was something she went beyond with. Her emotions spilled through the screen, and her chemistry with every single actor she worked with was truly amazing. And of course, the Cassano family. Every great kdrama has a squad, one that brings a touch of humor and also a sense of home. It was impossible not to love every one of them, each of them making up for the space left by the others and coming to form a perfect circle. Also, another scene added to the most iconic walking scenes in Korean dramas (if you know what I mean ;)

Music: John Park's ""I'm Always By Your Side"" is on repeat. That's all. Also, the instrumentals, Jipuragi, RDU-90, and Giseok Theme illustrated what the scenes would sound like perfectly.

Overall, you won't be disappointed. Come join the Corn Salad family!

extra!!! watch the behind the scenes videos and all their interviews! Truly amazing people off and on screen.

Just splendid :D
This drama hits all the right notes. It's not meant to be taken all that seriously and has a lot of comedic elements, but it also touches a nerve about corruption and how underdogs need champions who can fight on the level of the consciousless nasties & their minions. Suspense, a low-key love story, and OMG Taecyeon just CHEWING up the scenery!
I loved this start to finish
I was watching Mouse right along with this one, and Mouse - well, I had to stop watching 10 minutes before the end of the 14th episode because it looked like they just turned to the sour side, sadly. Vincenzo could have gone that route too - I worried. But it never did - not once. Thank goodness!
For those whining about realism - OMG. REALLY???? This is not meant to be a very realistic drama LOL It's meant to be a feel-good drama, where the bad guys get stopped and the good guys win. It's a kind of dark superhero film, with less fantasy. Where the characters are larger than life but where the premise makes you think about how most effectively to fight evil.
Such a breath of fresh air! And it ended so very well :D
Total thumbs up on Vincenzo!

A 10/10 SHOW AFTER SO LONG!!!
VINCENZO CASSANO *chefs kiss* from his first look in episode one i knew my heart is gonna be in trouble now..... Song Joong-ki oozed power, cold alpha male energy throughout the whole show and YES its PERFECT.

Its about an Italian lawyer and Mafia consigliere of Korean descent who is the adopted son of the late boss of the Cassano Family, a mafia family. During his visit to Korea tangles up in a fight against a conglomerate.
Let me just start off by saying this show was not AT ALL what I expected. I really didn’t know what to expect, but I loved this drama a lot more than I thought I would. I loved everything about it. It was so engaging, so fun, and so funny! With each passing episode it got more and more interesting and it makes a person get hooked literally HOOKED, one will legit be left with a hollow feeling when one episode ends coz it makes you want to watch it more and more and know whats the gonna happen next.
I LIVED for the chemistry between Vin and Cha-young they were like the epitome of perfection, the chemistry? off the charts like seriously it was even better than the one SJK had in DOTS!!! IT WAS LITERALLY THAT GOOD *screaminggggggg and crying that i ca't watch them anymore* There are just a few romantic scenes but when it happens for sure it’ll make your heart skip a beat. I love when Vincenzo gives her those heart eyes, he legit is wipped for her.
It's brilliant. The characters, cinematography every single thing is perfect. Everyone played their roles beautifully.
Cha- young is a chef kiss. Her character legit got me fangirl for her bad..she is sassy, witty, savage, funny, literally the whole package in one!
Taecyeon as Jungwoo, he is the kind of character who makes you fall in love with him but at the same time, he’ll make you feel the hate. I would have loved to see more of his interaction with Cha- young as ep 19 got me like go crazyyyyyyy !!
It has the perfect amount of thriller and comedy that makes you take a step back at the brilliance of it. The plot was never boring and even the villains had a sharper, darker edge compared to what I've seen in most dramas, it seemed much more realistic and truly fit the theme of evil vs evil. Our dear male lead was never a hero from the start and that aspect remained true to itself till the end.
Let me just say this for one last time, if you are thinking to watch it ? PLEASE GO AHEAD AND DO THAT IMMEDIATELY !! this show made me cry for an hour when it ended and it deserves every bit of success that it is receiving<3

Action, Humor, Romance, Suspense, and LOTS OF GOOD LOOKS
My actual rating for this show would be a 9.5 but I don't mind rounding it up to 10 because:

Everything about this series was dripping in sheer Quality! From the visual effects, the script, the instrumentals and songs, the editing, the costumes, the sets, to the performances of the actors, each scene was oozing with magic. Each episode felt like a movie - I was satisfied with the plot that unfolded per episode but was also left with a yearning to see the next one.

The baddies were so colorful and basically pure evil and even though you hated them you appreciated them anyway. This show had a lot of supporting roles but I was invested in every single character on this show. They were a lot, but it never felt crowded. Each character had a soul and identity and it shows throughout this show's 20 episode run.

And lastly I want to highlight the outfits in the show! Everyone was SO classy! Especially, SJK and JYB! SJK served his looks in literally EVERY SCENE. Both his and JYBs outfits were on point all the time, I was constantly blown away because they looked so good!

This show is almost perfect. I say almost (and the reason for my 0.5 point deduction) because I wish there were more fluff/romantic scenes between the two leads!!! After everything these characters went through (and because my thirsty inner-self craved it), I wanted to see more PG13/R action between V and HCY. I'm not saying I'm not happy with the scenes they had (I am), I just wish they had MORE.

Anyway, this is a solid Drama and you should watch it!

Mafia Style
Wow I really enjoyed this series although it was long, but it was definitely different.

It had everything in it, humor was hilarious they were times i just killed myself with laughter the FL was totally awesome, especially everytime she did that little hop and skip when she was happy. And her comments and her little scarsctisc quirks were just on point. The were tears and sad moments, then were times when you were like what the hell is wrong with these people.

I especially liked the ML his cool demeanour and i dont care attitude was what made the series. His quick thinking and response to tackling a situation head on was truly amazing.

This series gives a whole different outlook to mafia style and also the godfather!

Really Loved It!
What can I say...I really loved Vincenzo and I am honestly not quite sure why. It was definately a rollercoaster ride. One minute so serious and the next slapstick comedy. I would go from cringing to laughing out loud. I noticed some said it was classified by netflix as a rom-com but I checked and that is not the case. It is definately more a dramedy as their really is very little ""romance"" in my mind. You spend the whole series waiting for the romance...I loved Song Jong Ki and how he played his character. I loved all the little side characters who were so quirky and ridiculous but you learn to love them and start rooting for them. The show portrayed how corrupt and disgusting society is and Vincenzo is part of that brutal world and yet you cant help cheer for him. He is the epitome of an antihero. Ok Taec-yeon, Kim Yeo-Jin were incredible. It is rare for me to root for a character to die but boy they made me do it! Kwak Dong-yeon was also amazing in his role. I must say the leading lady, Jeon Yeo-been, did not really do it for me. While she was not horrible, she was not, in my opinion fabulous either. That of course could be the writers fault but I found her personality a bit annoying. I get the writers were trying to make her very outrageous, loud, quirky, and smart but I never got the smart part. She just looked annoying most of the time and she was someone whose mouth worked faster than her brain. I would have given 10 stars, almost unheard of from me, except for the leading lady and the ending. That did not quite do it for me either. Give this show a try and I think you will entertained.

“This drama is like a refreshing soda” is how Song joong ki described this show and honestly that’s the best way to describe this amazing drama. With an anti hero who uses refreshingly villain-ish ways to tackle evil, the show is absolutely exciting. Song Joong Ki really came back with a bang in this one and he nails every aspect of Vincenzo be it the action, the wrath, the comedy or the lowkey in-denial love strucken male lead. Also, it’s my first time watching Jeon Yeo Bin and she does an amazing job with our spunky Cha Young, and I grew to love her more every episode (CenCha ship is superior and nothing can top their chemistry).

With the right sprinkle of comedy, action, thrill and romance, this drama is a full on entertainer and has the perfect cast to deliver action packed episodes. The OST is also extremely fitting to the show and are absolute bangers. Personally, when I began the show I was intrigued by Vincenzos character but slightly put off by the lowkey cringe comedy that the Geumga plaza people offered however, the show really picks up pace and excitement by the 4th/5th episode and the Geumga plaza people grew on me just like they did for Vincenzo himself.

The drama really shows how the best color to depict humanity with is the color grey, as we can see all characters, (including the protagonists) as different shades of grey, making us as the audience question the concept of morality, justice and law as well. Apart from this philosophical wisdom, the drama also sheds light on building relationships and feeling part of a community. We become part of Vincenzos journey as he finds his own attachment to people he can call his own community, in a place he least expected to, which is honestly very endearing. Also, I love the romance in this, sprinkled in the right amount as you never really find that is is unnecessary. Cha young becomes a bridge that connects Vincenzo to a warmer world which he is unfamiliar to and both of them support and protect each other in their own ways which just makes it such a lovely bond that I couldn’t help fan girl over.

I’m going to miss my weekly dose of Vitamin-cenzo and I know for a fact this drama will always remain one of my favorites, as I was obsessed with it throughout its run. Would definitely recommend everyone to give it a chance and trust me when I say there is no escaping from Vincenzo Casanno’s charm!

I found it to have a really slow at the start but then BOOOOOOM
Was looking for a different genre of drama to watch. you know, something like a breather. And SJK and JYB were the main casts so more the reason to watch.

The first few episodes, I was trying to grasp what's the main plot and for me, I found the first few episodes a little bit too slow in terms of phasing. So I started to question whether or not this was worth the 20 episodes. Because you know, even for some dramas, 16 eps is a bit too long if the plot was static.

But then after episode 3 everything started making sense for me. Bit by bit the story gets more and more dynamic and before I knew it I was hooked.

Vincenzo is not really a perfect drama, it has its loopholes. One of which is that, they keep branding the male protagonist as a ""psycho"" but they kept on portraying him as someone who is capable of emotions, which is really contradicting. But you know what, overall I'm willing to turn a blind eye on those small loopholes because the charms of this drama outweighs them.

The ending was really satisfying. It was literally brutal. But anything else would have been a dishonor to the ""mafia"" image that they kept on building up since the first episode. It was sad to see Jang Han Seo die but I think if they all lived in the end, it would've been too good to be true.

Anyway, I'm not sure if this drama will get a S2. If it does, I hope Netflix does a fine job on it.

Kudos to everyone!!!!!

A criticism towards corrupted people
Vincenzo as a character is so interesting, and I see this as a criticism towards corrupted people who manipulated the law. I started watching this purely for the actions and thrill so I am very satisfied with the whole story and ending, the romance is there and it didn't ruin the plot, it feels just right. Jang Han Seok as villain also did great, but I personally think that Choi Myung Hee is the most annoying one. Why? Well, Jang Han Seok is a born psychopath so him doing all these crimes didn't get into my nerve as much as Choi Myung Hee because it just his nature and was built like that, while Choi Myung Hee is another ordinary human being but choose to be a bad person. I also love how Vincenzo stick with his principles by not sending them to jail whatsoever and punished them himself. Gonna miss seeing the Geumga plaza residents too❣

Rich in many ways
The series presented many cultures (Korean, Italian, biblical, Buddhist, ... ) presenting a mafia person, who somehow never forgot spoken and written Korean, and barely learned Italian, though an Italian lawyer.
He is caught in a good vs. evil war, siding with the former, though unable or unwanting to shed his old self.
In the end I wondered whether I had to go through so many killings, and why the author chose not to develop some relationships among the cast. I am not only referring to the woman protecting Vincenzo from getting shot, de facto a ""I love you"" declaration, which went pretty much nowhere. I am talking about developing the mom-son relationship in the Plaza, do more with the pawn shop couple, get the cook out of his goofiness by learning how to cook, ...
I also disliked the plethora of revelations about the past of the Plaza folks. Too artificial.
Liked the defenestration scene at the end of ep. 19, the re-creation of Delacroix' masterpiece ""La Liberté guidant le peuple"", the music overall, and the fact that the author spent time to tie together everything in the end.

Hesitant at the first step
The summary of this drama is what brought me here (except Song Joongki ofc). Italian mafia vibes with a promising character of a consigliere.
Oh, how I was disappointed! My expectations were so high I couldn't watch the first two episodes! So I dropped it. Didn't come back for a few weeks. And then came this boring evening when I wanted to watch something without thinking... and I was wrong once again. Two nights later at 16 episode, waiting for the last 4. I was crying every day, waiting for them to see what's gonna happen! The story, the acting, the thrilling scenes combined with a great sense of humour! And oh, the symbolism!
Everything about this drama is great. Name it, they have it.
You didn't watch a korean drama like this. You won't believe what happened in those episodes. You will be more and more surprised with each episode only to cry at the end because ""it had 20 episodes yet it finished so fast"".

Don't Think Twice Just Go for it!
I can go on and on about the drama but how about you watch it too and we both go on and on about it?
This show will make you feel every emotion humanly possible and in the end, you will come out as a strong individual and a strong mind.
You will fall in love with the entire cast of Vincenzo. The main lead is obviously important however in my opinion so is the supporting cast and I can tell you after DOTS and Crash landing on you, Vincenzo has the most perfect cast. in fact the best. you will fall in love with each one of them and in the end, you will just crave to be a part of the Cassano family.
PS: The focus on romance is very less however every once in a while it will make you go aww. It has a very logical ending and a happy one that is.

A performance worthy of “The Godfather” film series
This action/comedy thriller had everything...
From the ridiculousness of La Commedia dell'arte (Italian Slapstick Comedy; which was undeniably appropriate for Vincenzo’s background) to the cold bone-chilling and straightforward seriousness of an Italian vendetta (Korean style).
A very well executed production.

*Song Joong Ki and Kwak Dong Yeon nailed their respective roles to a T.
Among all of Song Joong Ki’s performances... This was my favorite.
Indeed, a performance worthy of “The Godfather” film series.

This drama is ALL about Vincenzo and no one else!!!
I was not keen on watching this drama but the pretty gifs on tumblr made me do it. The first few episodes were a task to get through but once it picks pace, it is amazing and a very enjoyable drama.
However, if you're looking for some girl power moments or solid teamwork sort of a thing, you are going to be disappointed because Vincenzo does ALL the work and also takes ALL the credit, it gets really frustrating at times.
The acting performance by all the cast members is absolutely phenomenal, they carried the show on their back. Especially Ok Taecyeon and Kwak Dong yeon. Song Joong Ki is breath-taking as always, this time with his visuals AND his performance. Jeon Yeobin was great too, though I would have loved to see her kick some butts in the court :(

Conclusion: Vincenzo is a must-watch for the outstanding work of the actors. The story crumbles in the last few episodes and the whole deal becomes quite violent for no significant reason. If that's your cup of tea, you can go ahead with it.

Not Over Hyped nor over rated!!!!!! I Loved it.
I watched Vincenzo when It was airing and it was so exciting. Each weekend I got my laptop and my speakers to watch and have a blast. The episodes were a roller coaster of emotions, you could be laughing, then shed a few tears, then get angry, cringe and even feel disappointed. This drama just had me in my feeling. through the week I would watch back my favourite scenes or even rewatch an episode.
All the actors were great in their respective roles.
Acting
1. Vincenzo (Song Joong-ki) had so many different sides to him and his eyes would especially bring out these different sides of him. He could be scary mafia dude, but cute and romantic hubby, he could be silly. His face just always showed what mood or character he was portraying.

2. Hoong Cha-young (Jeon Yeo-been) executed her role just how she was supposed to be. A shameless lawyer who would do anything to win. She made me laugh , cringe and sad throughout the show.

3. Jang Jun Woo (Ok Taecyeon) the first half of the show he nailed his innocent clueless intern role to a T. But then he was the vilian and also that spoiled rich little boy who liked to smash and destroyed what he could not have or control.

4. Choi Myung-hee (Kim YTeo-jin) I hated her so much each episode I was just wishing she would be killed how cruel she was and how she could just order people to be killed just like that then sit to eat or dance. Because of this I think she did a fantastic job.
The Tenants - they were so selfish at times, but then each one of them ended up showing how useful they were and that they were worth fighting for in their own little way. I especially liked Tak Hong-shik, Mr. Nam and Seo Mi Ri out of all the tenants. Mr Tak, because when he stated to fight with his scissors; Mr. Nam for his awkward, adorable and usefulness and Miss Seo because she was just this weird piano player but then bam Top Hacker extraordinaire.

This show had a little bit of everything, comedy, action, angst, subtle romance. It dealt with trust, family, loyalty, fairness in the society and the legal system, cooperation and so much more.
Give the drama a try you either love it or hate it. You might think it's average and that just fine.

All dramas are not made equal and everyone does not need to like everything.

This drama's stars are without doubt the Writer and Director, without whom this sterling cast could not have so well displayed their mettle.
And to say that the behind the scenes 'actors' nearly outshine those on the screen is no small accolade. The performances are without exception outstanding, from the main stars, to each minor character. However, the quality of plotting and slick production allow them to shine.
Vincenzo himself is a dark and disgusting character, but the writers along with Song Joon Ki manage to present him only as a reasonable and skilled man using extreme measures to achieve natural justice, or to simply do business with brutal men. Somehow they manage to conceal his brutality behind that beautiful face, elegant frame, great clothes and impeccable manners. And while doing this build in many moments of pure comedy.
A man embittered by his youth, and out only for his own gain, he comes to Korea to collect a massive cache of gold, intending to make a surgical strike and leave pronto to return to Italy. But, as soon as he lands in Korea, the whole eccentric timbre of the film sets in, and he finds himself in a ridiculous situation of immense comedic punch. He was lucky he was left with his designer suit on - I'd have left him in his underwear ... or swapped it for my own clothes, and sold it! But, then, given the visual potential I might have opted for just the underwear...
He's faced with a deeper dilemma than simply sorting out his wardrobe though - nothing goes as he planned. He has to deal with threats from developers, a collection of hapless and helpless tenants who consistently frustrate his plans, and of course, the benevolent lawyer devoted to helping the underdog (who we all know pays peanuts) against their chaebol aggressors, while facing determined criticism from his lawyer daughter who acts for those very oppressors. And then there's that damn pigeon stopping him from getting a night's sleep!
The Mafioso and the Lawyer strike up a friendship, a death leads to an alliance between Consigliere and the daughter, and the plot hits its stride. And the pigeon comes in surprisingly handy at a crucial moment, too.
The brutality is brutal, and made more so by the elements of psychopathy in the main villains - each of whom has their own well developed personalities - which also at time make them the butt of humour. But most of the violence is suggested rather than painted bloody in your face. Most of the victims are the bad guys - though the good guys do get hurt. The threat and violence are extremely finely judged. Somehow the writers and actors manage to provide a ""hero"" who is a murderer but remains a sympathetic character.
Our female lead is elegant and beautiful, able to look after herself and brave in the face of real risk to her life. She is also mildly insane - a complete clown, throwing herself into extravagant gestures and bodily contortions to cast contempt or humour at her opposition. She uses her body like a wild child dancing in the rain - but at some quite inappropriate moments, which is hilarious to watch. But fiercely intelligent, supposedly making the courtroom her playroom as she defeats villainous lawyers with virtually no material to work with. I'd say that every courtoom scene is simply played for laughs. I can;t think of any actres who could have carried this off so well as Jeon Yeo Bin.
Other characters in the new Korean ""Cassano family"" slowly reveal their true natures as gifted fighters, organisers, and including a computer hacker who could not be more serendipitously placed, nor more essential. They blossom and realise that they had not formerly known their own strength. They appear to become a warm and supportive family. This was rather lovely, not because of the family metaphor, but because drooping, trembling, weak people grew into themselves - and that permitted their relationships to deepen.
Thank goodness the predictable romance developing between Vincenzo and Cha Young was muted, and remained so to the end. They are a beautiful pair, but their roles in the plot remained unencumbered by neediness between them. He respected her autonomy and she somehow accepted him as he was, a mafia thug, using his skills for his own ends, but in the process working for a good cause in Korea. That tolerance of each other's autonomy is pretty rare in Korean Dramas - the trope being that a man shows his developing feelings by being possessive, demanding and bossy and the woman starts being huffy and jealous. A nice relief!
Yes, there were some clichés, but they were minimal. There are many plot twists and setbacks, and many dark moments amid the bonhomie of the tenants association and the wacky humour. You might think the humour in such a drama would be dark Well, I didn't find it so. Sometimes it was defiant, sometimes ridiculous, but I never thought it was just plastered onto a situation either. The greatest originality in this drama is its use of humour which always comes as a surprise and a joy.
At a time in which Korea is releasing a particularly rich crop of dramas, this one seems to be, rightly, dominating the screens. I don't think I have ever awarded marks as high as this for any other drama. It deserves every accolade.

All my information and comments about the Vincenzo series (very honestly and without any prejudice). Using genres? Are these really genres ??

--- Crime and Action: From the beginning, we have had more than 20 murders in the series, and cut off the sub-genre of the crime series, but some people mixed the suspense and mystery genres with crime. Most of these two genres are associated with crime, but each criminal genre definitely does not have these two. Anyway, it is not great in this genre, but some crime scenes are not without merit to be remembered.
Comedy: The main genre of the series and with an almost irrational but entertaining process, the sub-branches of this genre are slapstick, dark comedy, Farce and parody, which can be said to have been used almost well. In this section, the author of his ideas is relatively good (at least for me with a long history in watching movies)
—Romance: This lack of love has caused us to be attracted to him. If it had been like any other series, we would have been beaten. Not having these words and looking like a couple at all, only they did not know. Lately, they have been flirting with each other indirectly.

Predictable or unpredictable?

Both — to be honest, the characters are very, very predictable, and we predict all their movements But how something is going to happen in the series is very, very unpredictable. It can be said that the movements and ideas of the author are unexpected. Let me give you an example: no one could have guessed how Vincenzo wanted to turn the court in his favor by coming to court as a witness. Or even this rescue of Vincenzo in episode 15 of those 3 assassins, no one has any definite idea about it yet, and we all know that it is going to be more unexpected than we expected.

Excellent"" series or just a ""Do it well"" series or ""Medium"" series?

None — the newest and weirdest Korean TV series I've seen in years. I choose the adjectives ""cluttered"", ""comic and irrational"", ""strange"" and ""scary"". This series respects its audience a lot and does not hurt their heads with ridiculous and sophisticated complexities, but it makes the audience laugh and keeps them satisfied.

Logical"" or ""irrational""?

A series that is completely irrational, but of the most attractive kind of irrationality - being irrational is not a strange thing in the series, and it seems that the author has got used to the series completely intentionally and intentionally mixed it up with the series.


What is the script and story like?

It looks very mediocre, but I liked it. In some places, a series of small details are mentioned that I was cutting. The script does not have a lot of sentences, but I think it has a good depth. Zero percent (neither characters nor story) is not complicated. The script is very personal. New story, especially the use of the ""Italy"" theme.

Consecutively, Netflix is among the top 10 in the world. Knowing this fact, the soul left my body. Hey I was saying to myself really ??? at the world level ??? This is great

Beautifully Written
The first episode had me hooked. The opening scene was beautiful. The characters were awesome. The acting was great, but I was worried on how they will be able to keep the essence of these characters true throughout the show. There was a very fine balance walking along the dark side and the light side (law). If you had these worries, let me tell you know that this show kept true with the characters even as they developed.

The biggest complaint that I have heard is how annoying the female lead is. I agree at the very beginning I thought she was annoying and was really worried that she would be the damsel in distress. This changed when I realized that she is a professional lawyer who has a temper and does not give a f*** about people's opinions. She mocks peoples to see them flounder about and reveal their weakness. She uses that to her advantage. In terms of her world views, they are very gray at the end of the day. I won't lie her character is always something I am worried about turning into the typical FL, but so far this show has not disappointed me with her presentation.

Every actor in this show really knows their characters. I never really think about this while watching this drama, but you can totally tell the dedication and effort these actors are putting into this show.

Overall, this show walks on a fine line the entire time of being a great hit or the next Game of Thrones, so far this show has me hooked at episode 10 and the balancing act has been real. This show is a breath of fresh air that I have been craving for in this sea of very similar plots.

Pleasantly Surprised
After getting hooked with Song Joong-ki's filmography, only recently I didn't know what to expect with this drama series. After watching the trailer, I thought it would be the typical hard-core mafia themed series. The comedy variation in the plot was a pleasant surprise. The comedic scene and dialogue are pulled-off unintentionally (it seemed), giving it a nice twist. I personally like court scenes and this drama gave me a different appeal with the unconventional approach in presenting the case and procedure. Song Joong-ki's character, appearance, versatility (italian language) -- makes him more appealing in this drama...as he is already after watching most of his drama and movies. I like how he does his 'fight' scenes and yet comes out still looking daper. The casting for the leading lady of Joong-ki is a good choice, they complement each other. I really look forward each week for the new episodes. One of the best season finale I have seen. Air time for each roles (including secondary) were sufficient and did not seem rushed. Although the death of the antagonist was gruesome, it was presented well. The best scenes for me are: the proposal at the museum and the italian exhibition (stairs) -- before they said goodbye.

Great performance by Song Joong Ki and Kim Sung Cheol (episode 8)
I absolutely love Song Joongki on this show... but then again, I love Song Joongki (SJK) in all his movies and dramas. But since watching episode 1 to the current episode 8, it is very clear that he is carrying most of the weight of this show. The 1st episode, the scene when he was in Italy was great. That was the 1st 10 minutes of EP. 1. The rest of EP 1 went downhill rapidly when he returned to Korea. Only the last 5 minutes was worth watching. In between, the show was filled with the most annoying characters - the noisy, irritating tenants of the building (""the Tenants"") who are overacting in very silly slapstick scenes . The worst character is the female lead, who is overacting and extremely annoying. Both the female lead and the Tenants fail miserably at humour with their overacting - which is more suited for a variety show. It is surprising because the rest of the cast were good. Even the gangsters didn't overact and they executed their parts well. The cast from Wusang law firm were good and the Babel cast too (fake Chairman and real Chairman). It is hugely disappointing that the brilliant acting of SJK and enjoyable acting of the Babel cast, Wusang cast and Gangster cast were marred by the silly, overacting of the female lead and Tenants.
There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel - Episode 8 has redeemed the show. This episode focused mainly on SJK (the female lead faded to the background). All you need to do is fast forward and skip the scenes with the Tenants in Episode 8 in order to enjoy it. This episode focuses on SJK and Kim Sung Cheol. What a delight to watch SJK and Kim Sung Cheol (KSC) acting together. KSC's portrayal of his character was absolutely perfect. Because KSC's acting was brilliant, it made SJK's scenes with him such a delight to watch because SJK himself is brilliant throughout this drama. This is absolutely the best episode so far. There is hope yet for this drama, as long as they totally minimise the role of the Tenants and the female lead. At the very least they should drastically tone down the ridiculous overacting and silly slapstick antics of the Tenants and female lead. Yes, the genre is ""dark comedy"" but there is nothing funny at all in the way the Tenants and the female lead are portraying their characters. In fact, it is jarring on the nerves! Everyone else in the show are doing a good job to make this show enjoyable. And THANK YOU to Kim Sung Cheol for injecting a life-saving performance in this drama together with SJK. I am praying that the upcoming episodes have further delightful surprises like what we saw in Episode 8.

Having already watched at least two, wait... FOUR of Park Jaebum's earlier works, I have to say that I'm really looking forward to watching this recent project. Not to mention that this drama had Song Joongki and had a hint of a mafia theme, it sounded like the drama would be a lot of fun to watch.

While I wouldn't want to criticise other's choice in their preferences in watching the kind of drama that they want to see, I have to say that if there was any opinion to be made about this drama... you might as well need to keep watching till the end before making any strong opinion about it. Having completed Fiery Priest and quite a bit of Chief Kim, I've grown to be fond of Park Jaebum's style of comedy as well as writing.

Since this drama is still ongoing, it'll be pretty rash to make any conclusion on whether it was good or bad just because certain episodes may move a bit too slowly or too boring to some. In fact, personally, I felt that that the current pacing is just fine. A good story plot doesn't have to always have to be bombastic all the time in order to be good. It needs to have its ups and downs and even more important it needs to have a good plot and character development in order to give a good story. Or else, the story wouldn't be very memorable in the long run. And this series is a black comedy, yes but it is not makjang.

That said, I was pretty intrigued to find quite a few interesting similarities and parallels between the two main characters of Vincenzo to the two main characters of Fiery Priest. And I have to say, as long as Park Jaebum keep up the good writing and pace as he did for his earlier works that are of the same genre one can look forward to a great story.

A drama that just gets better and better
Dont let the opening scene mislead you, this wont be a mafia drama full of action and guns and whatever else you imagined. If this doesnt turn you off, then by all means keep watching this trainwreck of a show! The first 4 episodes are slow, but set the foundations for whats to come, still, very enjoyable. The whole show has a nice pacing, managing to keep you on edge every second. The story might not be the most elaboarte ever, but its elevated by its Characters. HYC, who seems unlikable at first is such a joy to watch, especially her dynamics with our ML, Vincenzo. Superb acting from them, as well as the 2nd lead and supporting cast (shotout to our main villains) is what makes this show amazing. It has some great writing at times, with hilarious jokes and situational comedy.
Amazing, yes, but not perfect. The tenants are honestly so unlikable sometimes, I know they are comic relief, but they get on my nerves. The plot does get a bit repetitive, but its a 20 episode drama so thats to be expected.
Overall, a great watch if you enjoy dark comedy, the slowest of slow burns and amazing main characters. You might want to wait untill all episodes have aired, since the constant cliffhangers make the 1 week waiting unbearable
Best ep - 10, funniest one yet.
Worst ep - 8, it made me feel uncortable how they handled some things.

He is a consigliere member of a Mafia family
He arrives in Korea and straight away the people he meets rip him off. They don’t know that he was part of the mafia in Italy. Now they have illegally taken away his building. They don’t know what they have done. What he will do to get it back.

Oooooh! It’s exciting and fun. They are underestimating him at every turn. They don’t know the terrible things he’s done in the name of the mafia.

Song Joong Ki looks so clean cut, sleek and immaculate but his favourite means of revenge is fire and intimidation. He recruits his team of collaborators from those hurt by the chemical firms.

I love this drama so much Song Joong Ki has transformed himself into this pseudo-villain and he and Jun Yeo Bin have this Bonnie and Clyde vibe going on. It’s so sexy, provocative and vexatious. Wow! Just want the episodes to keep flowing forward. Every week is like a taster for the next exciting event and experience. I can’t wait for what they are going to reveal next, because the real villain has materialized and shocked us all.

Some episodes are just crazy and Kim Yeo Jin/Choi Myung Hee is just the wrong actress for this. I don’t find her that believable in that part. I just find her pathetic and inadequate when she overacts. Not like Song Joong Ki/Vincenzo Cassano he is so cool, handsome and has that dangerous vibe going on.

I like Vincenzo Cassano and Hong Cha Young’s relationship of equality. She is what we call in New Zealand, a hardcase, funny yet super intelligent. She has guessed that he is in the Mafia. She is getting feelings for him but they don’t have chemistry yet. She is such a comedian.

Vincenzo Cassano biological mother is dying and on the execution list for a murder she didn’t commit. He has been ignoring her because she abandoned him and that is why he ended up with Italian adopted parents, but I think that he is beginning to get compassion for her.

This drama has it’s comedic moments then back to serious and deadly. Roll on next week

Well yeah! There was a bit of a lull mid drama but the real villain has hotted things up with a spate of killings. The brothers Jang Jun Woo (Mr Lunatic) and and Han Seo (Mr Wimp) but I think that both of them are totally psychopathic. The older brother has Daddy issues that haven’t really been explained or I missed it.

Vincenzo Cassano has mummy issues stemming from him being abandoned in and orphanage when he was young but he coming to the realisation that his mum had reasons for it that he didn’t know of when he was a child.

I was looking at the name Vincenzo it reminds me of incendio.

Shades of my Harry Potter experiences.

This cold hearted man is getting feelings for this girl that he has no chemistry with the leading female. Yikes! no way!

Goddamn AMAZING
Wow. Just wow. I have never waited every week for a drama to come or this excited to know what happens next. Every episode is it's own masterpiece. The plot and storyline are very well balanced and thought out. The chemistry is just on another level. All the characters are enjoyable, they're complex in a unique way, they make you want to know more, they keep you engaged all the time. The comedy is gold, the characters make you fall in love, the story and plotline is addicting, the acting is off the charts, this drama has been one of the few 10/10 in my list. Though I like to rate dramas after they're finished. As for now its a absolute 10/10 for me

2-star drama with a 5-star tag
the most overrated kdrama i've seen
it started off amazing, it had everything a good kdrama needs, suspense, comedy, and romance(the sexual tension between vincenzo and chayoung is like nothing i've seen before)
halfway through is where things started to go downhill:
it seemed like the writers knew their goal but didn't know how to reach it, and as a result they came up with the strangest plot devices.
by episode 12, this drama lost everything it had in the first 8 or so episodes, they seem to have forgotten where they started and now vincenzo and chayoung are just doing over-the-top and cringey stuff to embarrass jang hanseok....it has literally has no relevance to the plot.
the romance is the only good thing about this show and i feel like i haven't seen any of that in a WHILE.
some other things that annoyed me:
- hong chayoung is a really hypocritical and flaky character, she can't seem to stick to her own words
- the tenants with their over-the-top skits started to get annoying VERY quick, they got way too much screentime
- the dialogue is...BAD. it's childish. too many unnecessary lines. if two characters are about to do something, they should just go and do it! we don't need someone to say ""come on,let's do ___!"" each time.
- why are the good guys so bad?? i understand the main theme of the drama is that only evil can defeat evil, but what they're doing is no better than what babel is doing, i can't root for them
- additionally, their schemes aren't as ""cool"" as they make it seem, it's unnecessarily elaborate and falls flat, the way vincenzo and chayoung act all cocky makes me cringe ?
P.S. every scene with the intelligence agent and his head officer was hilarious and inzhagi is the best character

You need to watch this. It’s lit ?
It’s just so cool. It gives you a thrill knowing that they are going to fight for justice but, they have to fight fire with fire. It’s not done yet but, this will be on the my list of rewatching over again. I can’t wait for all the episodes cause it’s killing me waiting every week for the next episode. I need to have all the episodes now, all the cliffhangers especially on episode 6 is killing me. I might die from it. Like how can I not want more Song Joong Ki. Everyone wants some shiiiiiii

Unique and Tremendously Entertaining
Not Your Usual Crime Drama

I didn't watch this flick right away because the first scenes supposedly shot in Italy were the only scenes I found interesting and entertaining on Episode 1. I saw funny memes about Song Joong-ki and Oc Taecyeon on social media and thus made me binged watched the 12 episodes over the weekend.

Halfway of 2nd Episode was the turning point for me! The over the top funny gestures, facial expressions and sarcastic and wise cracking lines was just unexpectedly entertaining!

Episode 6 and 8 was just super hilarious! Those are my most favorite episodes so far.

In the first few episodes Oc Taecyon as an antagonist was so charming and cute but a little scary at the same time. On Episode 10, his character started to become horrendous, it's hard to see him adorable anymore.

What I love about Vincenzo is that you don't need to wait for several episodes to get revenge or justice. It gives you satisfaction to at least feel a little bit of balance between good and evil every episode so it doesn't get too frustrating or tedious for all things good to be in place.

I love how tacky the jokes and funny scenes are sometimes but it's creatively and expertly acted out, it doesn't come off that way. Sooo amusing!

I can't wait for the next installment!

One of the best dramas I've watched
Yes, some people say it's over hyped. I was afraid it would be too so i waited ages to watch it and nah. I loved it. Yes the humour can be absurd sometimes but...thats kdrama? I personally enjoy it. It was needed in this too. I found the comic relief an essenial balancer with the dark stuff that was going on. I ADORED the character's, they were amazing even the baddies were just so good at being bad. I also personally loved how vincenzo didn’t have his character watered down at the end. Overall just a good story with amazing.characters and unmatched acting. If you're unsure please watch it to atleast episode 5 as at ep4 it really kicks off.

A mix of serious action and storytelling with kimchi-slap morning kdramas
This is a really good kdrama. It could've been in my TOP5 but the absurd comedy made it less impressive for me.
I am always very forgiving with absurdity in kdramas, and this one was no exception. No way i would've let so many flaws get by in a western production, yet this is the beauty of watching a kdrama. The absurd parts are so absurd that the only thing left to do is laugh, and that's ok.

I liked the ending. At least in the end some ""realism"" was left and the happy ending is somehow bittersweet if you think of it.

All actors did an excellent job. Every single one of them! Side characters included!
Loved the movie and other kdrama references that were written in the script! Truly hilarious! The ""2PM"" jokes were also chief's kiss!

I would totally recommend this kdrama to everyone used to asian productions. It's like a really good manga/anime. Half of it it's very realistic and the other half is crack humor that doesn't make much sense but we are here for it anyway.

Just one last thing. ""Mademoiselle"" is actually french.

Loved this!
I saw a trailer for this on Netflix, and the minute I saw Song Joong Ki! I was ready to watch it.

I literally watched it from the start to the beginning every week in came out! I loved it and thought it was sooo funny, and the storyline was really interesting,

I’ll admit the start I really didn’t like the main girl Hong Cha(Jean Yeo Been) at the start, but near the end she did grow on me and I loved the mafia crew <3 just the whole building gang were hilarious and the secretary too! -

All the actors and the way the show was so cinematic like every episode! I would definitely rewatch this again. One of my top dramas to watch!

Perfect, outstanding, satisfying, amazing
This is one of the best dramas I've ever watched. You usually have dramas with an obvious differentiation between the good and the bad. Villains in the end would either die or get thrown into the jail. Vincenzo is definitely a drama on a different tier.

I personally never believe that a quick death is a punishment to villains. Which is why I've got to say this drama has really hit a different spot. The two worst villains - Myung Hee and Jun Woo - were portrayed perfectly. It is impossible to not hate the two of them because they are just the perfect definition of cocky, spoilt and evil. Thinking they have everything under their control and pretty much nothing in the world can stop them from doing what they want to do. Until Vincenzo comes in and spoil every single one of their plans.

There are some parts which I absolutely love (prepare for spoilers):
1) One of the early episodes where the villains lost to Vincenzo and Jun Woo commented that the reason why they always lose is because Vincenzo is creative and that's what they are lacking. I completely agree! Vincenzo would always surprise the audience with very creative and different ways of handling crisis. Just when you thought he would be toppled down, he bounces back up and strikes back harder.

2) Vincenzo was furious after they killed his mother (which is pure stupid by the way). You would think after so many altercations with Vincenzo you would know not to provoke him unless necessary. That is when Vincenzo declared war and you can really see the shift in the episodes to come. You would honestly think Vincenzo was being nice in the previous episodes in the way he treated them.

3) Vincenzo visited Jun Woo in the prison. He was telling Jun Woo the story behind his nickname - cat that is always full. That pretty much sums up the entire drama, to be honest. The entire time, killing Jun Woo and his minions was so easy but it was just too easy. A cat that is always full will play with the mouse before it decides to eat the mouse. Woah, that scene is hands down my most favourite scene in the entire drama. The satisfaction is just *chef's kiss*

4) The excruciating deaths of Myung Hee and Jun Woo. Omg. Just... omg. I have never seen such a satisfying ending. Myung Hee and Jun Woo definitely deserve every second of their painful deaths. The thought and creativity put into ending their lives, Vincenzo, again, did not disappoint.

5) All the tenants of Geumga Plaza playing Mafia together. There are quite a lot of times when they will gather together but that moment hits me differently. I love how all of them are together, each of them with a different back story, sitting together and just playing a game of Mafia together. The chemistry between the cast is off the charts. I have never really watched a drama where I get attached to every single one of the characters.

There is not one thing which I dislike in this drama and this is how perfect it is. Absolutely amazing 10/10

An amazing, memorable drama.

An amazing drama that is definitely worth giving a try!

STORY:
From start to finish, the drama managed to capture and keep my attention throughout the hours worth of episodes, and kept me on the edge of my seat with each scene.
The cliffhangers were just perfect, and had me counting down the days and hours until the next episode would be released.
The mixture of action, crime, drama, comedy and law was amazing, and I've never seen a plot be so well paced as Vincenzo.
The story was well thought out and well written, nearly every character shown ended up having a role to play and they weren't forgotten so easily.
Vincenzo was a rollercoaster ride that managed to have me going from laughing, to cheering, to crying and back to laughing all in a matter of minutes.
I liked how the corruption is kept on a realistic scale in this drama.
Best running joke will be both the Corn Salad joke and the countless mispronunciation of Vincenzo's name.
I will say, which is currently a popular opinion, that the drama could have been better off with maybe 16 or 18 episodes instead of 20. There was a lot of filler in the later episodes, which messed up the pacing a lot.

CHARACTERS & ACTING:
The monks, Mr. Cho, the Pawnshop couple, Mr. Tak, the crazy mother with her son, Chef Toto, the zombie dancer and even the gangsters had so much more backstory then I initially thought. Geumga plaza gang / Vincenzo family was truly the best.
Song Joong-ki and Jeon Yeo-bin's chemistry was just fantastic, and while I disliked Cha-young's character at first, her development was just amazing and I was absolutely in love with her character.
The villains were just fantastic, and I've genuinely never hated villains more than in this drama. Absolute kudos to the writers, and the extremely talented cast who portrayed these characters so well.
Ok Taec-yeon's duality absolutely baffled me, and although sadly I already got spoiled before watching the show, I still found myself in awe at his amazing acting.
I loved that Vincenzo remained set on his mafia-self until the end, that Cha-young never tried to make him change his ways and accepted him for who he was. A lot of dramas tend to change the character for the sake of love, but thank goodness that this drama decided to do it right for a change.
I will say that they missed out on fleshing out Vincenzo's character a little more, we get flashbacks, but never really understand the meaning of them.
The character development of Jang Han-seo was just tear jerking, and he deserved so much better. I really hope Kwak Dong-yeon finally gets a leading role after this. He did such an amazing job at playing Han-seo.
Loved Mr. Nam with his little lighter when imitating Vincenzo, and his polite hands.

MUSIC:
The music was well used and memorable, Adrenaline by Solar is chef's kiss.
In other situations, the lack of music made the emotions of the scenes just that much more impactful.
The music always matches well with the ongoing scene.

REWATCH:
I would rewatch this show purely for the comedy, it was truly one of the best I've ever seen.
Though rewatching it would lose a bit of the impact it had on the first watch.
(I don't think my heart can handle rewatching the finale.)

OVERALL:
I truly did love this show, and it will definitely be an all-time favourite of mine.
It was well structured and written, and it's very clear that a lot of thought and time went into this story.
Exceptional work from the entire cast, and it's definitely a cast to be remembered for a long time.
Though my critique is that the finale was messily written, which all comes back to the fact that this drama would have been better off with a few episodes less.

SR. VINCENZO CASSANO.
O que falar do melhor drama de 2021?
Com toda certeza afirmo que este drama merece o título, e ainda estamos no ""meio"" do ano. Uma obra de arte, super intenso e interessante, atores incrives, história magnifica, cinematográfia impecável.

Não tenho nem palavras para descrever bem como esse drama é bom. Então, vou comentar um pouco dos personagens e pode ter alguns spoilers leves.

VINCENZO CASSANO: Vulgo, meu marido. Não preciso nem dizer que o principal é o melhor personagem, né?
Lindo, carismático, às vezes engraçado, meio doido, mal (o que deixa ele mais lindo ainda). Super passei pano pra todas as maldades dele (é ficção, lembre-se).
Song Jong Ki, se entregou de um jeito maravilhoso a esse papel e eu me surpreendi em ver a mudança dele já que tinha uma imagem dele sempre interpretar personagens mais leves e brincalhões como em DOTS. Porém, tenho apenas elogios e ele conseguiu ir pro meu top 3 de melhores atores com esse drama.

HONG CHA YEON - No começo eu peguei uma implicância com ela, pelo jeito que ela estava sempre brigando com o pai mas depois percebi que todos são assim, até que a culpa consome a gente.
Gostei bastante em como não colocaram ela como a vítima ou aquela situação onde eles colocam uma femme fatale e é só ela se apaixonar, que vira chorona e tal. Ela a forte, do início ao fim.

Jeong Yeo Bin, foi uma atriz incrível que atuou perfeitamente. Até hoje não entendo o por que dela ser atacada por isso, se ela é uma atriz boa pra caramba.

PRESIDENTE DA BABEL E SUA CORJA: Passei o drama inteiro querendo voar neles, quanta raiva eu passei assistindo por que parecia que eles sempre saiammm impunes. Só queria que todos os podres deles fossem jogados a público antes de terem sido mortos, principalmente a da advogada e do presidente. Odiava olhar pra cara deles.
Os atores foram completamente incríveis, senti tanta raiva dos personagens mas sei que os atores são uns amores, principalmente o Taeceon ♡

Um grande shout out pra ele, pelo ad-lib de ""Can you feel my heartbeat (música do 2PM)?"", só faltou a coreógrafia mesmo hahahahaha

GEUMGA PLAZA: Uma grande família amorosa, que eu queria que tivesse sido mais explorada e mostrada. Pelo menos um pouco mais da vida deles. Se eu morasse perto de pessoas assim, nunca me mudaria. Eu me sentiria junto a uma enorme família.
Chorei muito quando o mestre de artes marciais leviu aquela facada, nossa.

JIPURAGI: Quatro advogados e um oficial da inteligência, incríveis. Amei todos os momentos de fangirl que o Sr. Nam e Ki Seok tiveram por causa do Sr. Cassano.

Recomendo assistir esse drama pelo menos 3 episódios por dia, por que é tanta informação que pode confundir. Eu assisti 10 de uma vezes e até troquei umas coisas no início kkkk

Se for assistir, espero que aproveite bastante toda ação do drama.
E se já assistiu, espero que tenha empatizado com a minha review, por que vamos ser sinceros, o drama é maravilhoso né?

Must Must watch...!
I don't know what to say in this moment. Iam totally blank now just finished this wonderful drama called Vincenzo.. i mean to be honest i don't know how to explain what i experienced this past 2 months, it's getting better and better episode after episode.. i still remember those 1st 2 week of the drama started.. with 4 episodes there were lot of negative opinions i saw and its quite natural because initially its very slow and not a type of a interesting story telling..

But From E05, the villain inside the hero jumped out all of a sudden and it was truly a very thrilling sequence when he just show of some fear to that prosecutor middle aged lady. Which was totally a mind blowing and damn brilliant reply to her.. Eye to eye that was his policy.. after that all Episodes has something new to offer, and its really interesting and thrilling to watch. Not only the so-called hero doing all the things he formed a Cassano family and all the members were just outstanding with their performance,

For the plot i don't really interested to explain anything, But just for a curiosity, Our hero Italian Mafia Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano Came back to korea after years with a personal motive, But that thing was not an easy task to do for some reasons, So he need a proper planning and everything.. the problem he faces and more are dealing in the whole 20 episode journey here, the biggest thing that they maintained a very good pace for every episode, there is nothing dragging or boring. But if i need to say some negative i think the villain has to be more strong. I mean you exactly don't feel that because ofcourse this is a one man show.. always the performance of hero look cool in your eyes , So you forget about the villain.. But again it doesn't matter at all..

You must watch this drama. It will surely surprise you.. So many Goosebumps moments are there... Totally Worth watching

HONESTLY WATCH THIS DRAMA
I do not know how to begin describing the absolute MARVEL this drama is. The drama follows a complex but easy to follow plot (which I appreciate because some dramas' plots i can never understand at full) and is engaging from episode 1 to episode 20. The characters' development in the storyine is something I'd like to applaud. All of them experience growth and thus many friendships are forged and some relationships rise (cheesy but true!!!) I liked that it involved romance but was not all about it. AHH but when romance was involved it was done GOOD: subtle but firm. HONESTLY go watch this right now do not waste any more time reading my review. This is the only show I've given 5 stars!!!!!

What.
At first, I wanted to wait until the series was over since I knew this was going to make me have suspense for the past weeks.
This drama literally has everything I could ask for.
Now, I am a BIG romance person. I usually dip series whenever there's barely any romance. But with Vincenzo, I just couldn't.
Cha-Young and Vincenzo weren't a big ship for me to be honest. I shipped them but not so much.
Also, THE MUSIC IS EVERYTHING. AND THE VISUAL EFFECTS.
Gosh, from day one I've loved the Visual Effects and Music, made me so interesting!
Jun-woo (or Han-seok) was my FAVORITE VILLAIN! They did everything that I could ask for with his character!
Han-seo became one of my favorite side characters and I was disappointed when he died honestly.
The people at the Plaza were also my favorites as well! I loved all of them to the core.
The drama left me with many questions regardless of the end. I never give dramas with barely any romance a 10 but Vincenzo does the spot! I could defo re watch this! Never regretted the 3 days I watched this
Even if you're a big romance person, please check this out! It hits the spot! I'm defo going to try watching more Crime Dramas later on!

Loved it but the villain's storyline :(
First of all i know this series is definitely worth watching. I loved it! They did an amazing CGI job and actors were amazing, I even draw fan arts for this drama but story?
I guess nowadays using this success formula is popular. Badass and morally grey lead male, totally successful and badass woman lead (at the end match her to the male lead because all female leads need romance right?) and a villain who is totally gonna die at the end of the drama. Why?!!! Let him live. Let him win some real games. He isn't even equal to Vincenzo the whole time. He was introduced us as a psycho killer. Ok, but he could be a killer and a real businessman with some serious ideas. He needs his lawyer to figure things out for himself. He just kills for success. He could be more witty.
And why always pure evil characters die at the end? I'm not saying he should turn into an angel. But killing him is too easy and predictable. And romance between two lead at the end? That kiss! Wrapping things up with happy ending kiss. I was so frustrated TT

Some details i absolutely loved was:
Inzaghi (Pigeon): This detail was marvelous. I know mafia stories need a twisted details like mascots e.g. Sopranos's duck. So pigeon was an amazing idea in my opinion.
CHE CAZZO line: aaaah that scene was so satisfying. Swearing in italian. Perfecto!
That BL episode: perfect match!
Balloon company: just PLEASE HIRE ME!!

Just go dor it it'll surely not.... Disappoint you it's a perfect combo!!! ✨??
I just finished vincenzo and yes it's just a blockbuster.??.. Not only because soong joong ki made come back through it but because of the extraordinary Story, caste, and brilliant acting .....
If you are a action and thriller lover do watch it as it's released gully now you need not to wait for next episode and trust me it won't disappointed you.... So the Story goes like this soong joong ki was abandoned by his mother due to some reason ( i wont tell that) and then he was adopted by a Italian family after years the Italian mafia came to south korea to get the gold left hidden by the boss but was stuck there due to sone reason and then he met cha young and he fell in love with her... Further the started to Fight against babel a company but at start they didn't know eho the real boss was. But soon it came out to be joon wo.. ( tbh It was really shocking
I didn't expect so)?? and that's how he started to do all possible things to get him down and soon everyone around vincenzo became fond of him even the main villains brother left his brother and went to vincenzo.. Even there are some emotion scenes of death and even he killed vincenzo's mother that was truly hard to digest!! As vincenzo couldn't even tell her he was her son!! ?????
I would give its Story 9.5 because although the story wad great but what i found disappointing ??was that there was Very less romance!!!!!! I was totally shipping chen cha/ power couple/ mafia couple/ vincha but we were barely shown any Romance scene so if are here to see sone romance sorry it's gonna disappoint you a bit.. Although there are 2 kiss scenes to satisfy your eger fully!!! But still ut was not so great at last the love story was left open!!! We weren't shown that what they did with the gold or how the utilized it... Or if they ended up together!! ????
And ost or music was overall great... I would say but still something felt missing so i would give it 9....
And caste has done it's best so 10 points i could found any error in there acting further italian scenes were shooted virtually and still the vibes were same!!!! ✨? so loved it!!!!!
I won't say anything about rewatch value cause i don't like rewatching dramas!!! ?✨ sorry
And overall 9.8 .......... Just lover it!!!

The true satisfaction comes when you look at the entire plot.
From what I realized is that everyone has mixed reviews on this drama. So If you want to watch this drama there are a few things you need to know.

1. The start is slow, like any other normal drama to a point that will make you even wonder why everyone is making such a fuss about it. But believe me when I say it's going to snowball into something really good. At times you will find yourself at the edge of your seat and the next second rolling off it while laughing.

2. You're going to meet the most eccentric bunch of characters, that you won't see in any other drama. The only sane character is Vincenzo and he later gets influenced by those bunch of weirdos down the story. At first, you will probably find it exasperating, but trust me those characters will grow on you.

3. Truthfully the story doesn't have much depth to it. but the true satisfaction comes when you look at the entire plot. Usually, most of the stories are good guys vs bad guys. but have you ever watch an evil guy standing alongside the good guys and kick the asses of another bad guy? and the satisfaction of the bad guys losing at every corner because of one big baddie on the good side!!!

To sum the story up, it's about the evil Wusang- Babel family bullying the Geumga family and the rest of the society with their power and money. This powerless party pairs with Vincenzo Cassano to fight against the opposing party. So a fight between the Cassano - Geumga family Vs. Wusang - Babel Family ensures. To put it simply it's like a fight between Godzilla vs king kong.

Genuinely good.
Vincenzo was a show that was enjoyable to the very end. The relationship was cute and not too overly romantic as that wasn't the focus of the show. The show integrated the relationship in a way that was sensible to the overall plot of the story.

Vincenzo gave a satisfying and realistic ending. I believe that the show wouldn't have been as good if he didn't have to flee Korea after killing the villains. Though it was sad to see him and his new family in Korea, it was a strong and solid ending.
The story was very strong, and the actors executed their roles to perfection.

Part Mafia-thriller, part slapstick comedy, with an outlandish plot
It starts off hero-worshipping Song Joong-ki but gets better with every episode. People seem to agree with me on that, and the ratings improved with each release. Jeon Yeo-been plays his formidable partner in crime, sharing great chemistry in spite of very little romance.
Both of them are really good actors and Episode 16 is epic when Song Joong-ki puts his soul into it. But 2PM's Ok Taecyeon takes the crown for best actor in this show! The Geumga Plaza crew are a sweet bunch and bring the comedy that is much needed in this dark comedy when people drop like flies.

It's part Mafia-thriller, part slapstick comedy, with a high body count and an outlandish plot. It's dramatic of course, but a bit too dramatic ? That is why I give the story a low score.

Damn son!!!
Okay, so I put it on hold while watching this title because after ep 14, me thinking about waiting for 3 more weeks to get the finale made me anxious. I am a binge-watcher so I told my mom that we are halting at ep 14.
After that, my work got a bit tough and I got a bit late, but I really wanted to give a review. So here it is.

ACTING: Do I really need to say anything about the acting? Like really? This is a star stud....1000000/100 for the acting.
SOUND: Mmmhhh chef's kiss.....no words.
PLOT: The plot is so interesting... this whole thing is so new. Honestly, in my life of watching so many kdramas, I have never watched an MC killing off people like it's no biggie. Like it's normal. It would've been so weird if Vin being a mafia didn't kill people.
Also the comedy....a drama without a bit of comedy is just lifeless to me unless we are doing serial-killer stuff.

Also my baby Kwak Dong Yeon, writer-nim waeee??? Also I hated the fact that none of then gave a damn about my baby after he died while saying ""Hyung I did well right?"". Nobody had a char. dev. like my babe did.

REWATCH VALUE: Well I don't re-watch mystery thrillers (unless it's Signal or Healer or some other) so the rewatch value is less for me. Because all the mystery is gone. I'll again rewatch it when I am in my 30's maybe(currently in my 20's)


Those who are thinking if they should watch this, I have 3 things to say:
1. Yes
2. Oh YES
3. HELL YESSS

WOW, JUST WOW
okay so, I don't know how to start but I've never written a review for any drama but this drama, Vincenzo is just wow. Like, WOW. I'm not ""capping"" but this drama is just chef kisses, Michelin 10 star. I swear to god, the story, the acting, the plot, etc. is just wow, it's so good to the point that I find no other drama interesting. Legit.

If you're reading this comment, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, watch it. There are no boring parts at all, If you're not a fan of horror or thriller ""like me"", Vincenzo isn't horrifying, or extreme so, yes. Watch it.

Lmao, this review is kinda dumb but I just want to express how good Vincenzo is lol.

Good plot with great execution/acting..
Vincenzo was very good from the start and ended amazingly. The lead actors had the charm and their presence never faded. An Italian gangster in Korea fighting for rights, the story was unique and well executed.

The production was excellent and not to forget, the side characters aptly did their role as well. Although I had a little issue with the Runtime/No. of episodes it had (16 episodes would have been sufficient), it maintained itself till the very end with satisfying result.

I don't write much long reviews, but to summarise, Vincenzo is easily among Top 5 best Drama to have released this year..


My Overall Rating: 8.5/10

vincenzo cassano, i will serve you.
i haven't watched any kdrama for months until i watched vincenzo. i was at first curious why was my mom laughing while watching this, given its mafia-law plot but then as i got to the first episode, i understood now why she found it funny.

the comedy balanced out the heavy elements of the drama, considering that it dealt with corruption and LOTS of blood. the geumga-cassano family will always have my heart as they did from the first episode. i love park seokdo and his subordinate's development, went from babel's employees to part of the family. although i will forever laugh at how he was very much afraid of vincenzo in the first episode.

taecyeon. my god ok taecyeon. i've watched him in let's fight ghost before, so him taking on a villain role was a new experience for me and he portrayed it so WELL! the way hanseok's personality changes when he's with chayoung to being the ceo of babel, literally *chef's kiss*. i love how jang hanseok's very unhinged, and he did justice to him.

jang hanseo, my poor baby :( i never paid attention to him because like what the characters in the drama said, he's just stupid with someone backing him up. towards the end of the drama, i felt this sort of fondness toward him, especially when he decided to turn his back on hanseok and start working with vincenzo. his death really devastated me (and my whole family) because he just found himself a brother that takes care of him and then all of a sudden, he's DEAD. i will forever cry at the way he calls vincenzo his 'hyung' and how he copies his moves.

and song joongki, my vincenzo cassano. he's literally perfect for the role LIKE? every time vincenzo shows up with this mafia aura around him, i can't help but swoon over him. he's so SOOOO sexy and the casting director really made a good job casting him as the perfect vincenzo cassano.

all in all, this goes to the list of my favorite kdramas. i never expected to watch a drama with joongki in it but here we are, having brainrot over this drama the moment i finished it. kudos to everyone!

The BEST ANTI-HERO Oddly Satisfying Adrenaline Rush Satire Drama of 2021 so far
I watched this drama because I was curious why this drama is 9 in mydramalist and 8.6 in imdb so I was more curious then watch it after watching the drama I was so amazed of the location they shoot especially the scenery superb and also after watching the special episode they did not shoot in Italy but they use only CGI WTF!!!! MIND BLOWN I was so speechless yes Director Kim Hee Won you did great!!! The story is very fast paced after 3 episodes it will not bore you watching becoz it has a lot dark comedy skits it will make you feel weird but laughing all the time and lots of action scenes with less romance thank God becoz im single lmao , but has roller coaster rides of emotions like in ep 16 and ep 20 its so painful to watch so I was devastated watching it and has lots of twist and turns or plot twist that keep your adrenaline rushing all the time. The acting is Perfect Vincenzo Cassano(Song joongki) is one a hell of a monster that could not be beaten his a fcking overpowered lol but I like his personality very cold but very witty always thinking outside the box and know how defeat his enemies smoothly and also the hilarious female lawyer and also her partner in crime Hong Cha young(Jeon Yeo Bin) is a weirdo wtf she supports Vincenzo Cassanos dirty mafia tactics to ther enemies because of corrupted justice they faced so its ok with me atleast its not your typical goodytwoshoes FL Lol and she is a badass too I love her!!!! Also all of their enemies are bunch of PSYCHOPATHS their so dangerous that they can kill you without mercy!!! Also a lot of side characters in the drama lol at least it will not be a boring drama to watch. The Music is spot on , a perfect OST , BGM and sound effects are all wonderful. A big thumbs of to the staffs, actors, writers , director and all who participated !!! Hands down, THE BEST KDRAMA OF 2021 SO FAR!!! Highly recommended who are a fan of satire, dark comedy, slow burn romance, action, mafia , and thriller.

YOU WON'T REGRET
THIS IS THE BEST DRAMA EVER INDEED. I can't stress enough how good this is. Tha story, the acting, the character development, the VILLIANS, everything is so on point. No one could have played vincenzo better than Song joon ki. He's the best. Jeon yeo been is so good as Cha young. Their chemistry is so refreshing. The drama makes you hate the villian(jang ho seok) and at the same time makes you fall in love with actor (Ok taecyon) cuz he's so good at it. And everyone else as supporting characters are also out standing. You will fall in love with the Geugum plaza family. Finale will leave you overwhelmed. Totally recommended.

May have been the best drama I have watched
I have to say this drama is really the one I have been looking for...
It contains comedy, mystery, and A LOT OF PLOT TWISTS. It's the first drama that I was really captivated by a drama and made me wanna watch more, like the most unexpected comes out of the expected. Things I was satisfied with on how the plot fills well with the satisfactions of the last episodes major plots (such as the karma) in those aspects it was really well written.

It occurs to me on how the music starts playing on the most dramatic times, I found it really funny because when ever the OST plays it just makes the scene extra funny such as the horse riding scene. BUT there were somethings I did not like but if you think about it, it was most likely destined to happen. Such as Hanseo death I feel like we could have seen more scenes of the good of him, along with the ending of this drama I felt like we could have seen a little more of what happens.

BUT OVERALL I really liked this drama just because somethings I wanted didn't happen doesn't mean this drama doesn't meet the ""10 star review"" everything in the end fits really well. This drama will give many funny and roller coaster moments which would make you want to watch it, so therefore I would highly recommend it and re-watching it would give you goosebumps.

100/100
I would rate this drama hundred times with highest rates and it still wouldnt be enough for one simple reason NO stupid character redemptions for non redeemable characters! Villains stayed villains till the end and those who deserved to die painful death died! Mafia wasnt romanticized and was portrayed as it is evil, even if it fights against evil. Actors did great job, i'd totally watch it again for the justice it served coz to be quite frank im sick of dramas with evil people suddenly turning nuns and pastors at the end repenting their sins.

Revenge is a dish best served cold
Thrilling!
I usually am not a fan of ""overrated"" dramas (Descendants of the sun was a torture to watch), but this time I am on board. The mix of comedy and dark revenge is so fresh and so welcome in dramaland!

I had to subtract 0.5 point due to the finale episode which could have been SO MUCH BETTER (spoilers ahead):
- The smart and bold FL just disappeared due to an aching shoulder;
- The well-developed character that was Jang Han Seo left us in a disappointing way (don't get me wrong, I cried like a baby, but I couldn't stop thinking to myself that I couldn't care less about Hong Cha Young's boo boo seeing that boy alone...).
- Vincenzo's stupid behaviour during that whole ""Hong Cha Young has been captured"" scene.

Overall, the cinematography is very impressive, the ost and bgm go so well with the scenes, the acting is pretty much flawless, the story is (most of the time) quite nice with a lot of details on the revenge plots.

Of course there are some issues with this drama, mostly in the last 2-4 episodes, but to be fair I don't want to judge this drama on these. It managed to make me happy every Sunday evening, and gosh, that's not an easy thing to do. So thank you!

Standing Ovation!
Okay, guys....if a drama doesn't offer what Vincenzo delivered, then I don't want it.

This drama has ruined everything!

Redefining friendship between the ML and FL - I looooved that Vincenzo and Cha Young were partners
Redefining badass - the ML is the villain and you will love him, the FL is what I want to be when I grow up, and the gang ...waaah
Redefining friendship - that Geumga Plaza Gang is just goals
Redefining romance - giving you that slow burn
Redefining humour - oh my gosh, had me tearing with laughter
Redefining plot twists - I remember following chats and videos about predictions and somehow, we all just didn't see it coming
Redefining OST - all the music *chef's kiss* and that BGM....gave me chills at all the suspenseful moments
Redefining character development - the most unassuming characters just blew my mind *Hello Mr Ahn!*
Redefining writing - the plot, the dialogue....whaaaaaat?!

Just wow. Hats off! Throwing flowers on the stage because ...wow! (I shall be in my room recovering)

What a Ride!
It is difficult to put it in the right words. Vincenzo is one of a kind.
Vincenzo is the best series I've seen this year. Period. The cast, the story and the OST, everything was just perfecto. It was the best mix out of tension, intrigues, comedy and heart-warming scenes with amazing side characters and overwhelming twists and turns. Vincenzo is indeed a feelgood drama.
I've seen that some people are upset because of the glorification of the mafia, his action and the impossibility of defeating Vincenzo, but keep in mind it is just a fictional series. I personally do not quiet much enjoy action or thriller series and movies, only if they are paired with warmth or justice (can be viewed from different perspectives here...) they are an option for me. Due to the fact that there were that many unexpected turns and Vincenzo really knew how to deal with gangsters, every cliffhanger kept me going straight into the next episode.

To the main leads (all the supporting actors were great, too, and I'm looking forward to their next projects).
I knew both of the before. I've seen Jeon Yeo‑been in BeMelodramatic. Furthermore, I really enjoyed her acting, and she kinda carried the show for me. When I started watching Vincenzo, I was very surprised. She seemed like a completely different person, and I'm still very impressed by her talent.
I know Song Joong‑ki from Descendants of the Sun (DoS) and I'm so glad I do not speak Italian because I'm pretty sure he delivered those Italian lines just like the English lines in DoS. In DoS you really noticed that he didn't know what he was doing, and that he was allowed to do it in such a way surprises me. In general, I only liked him semi in the series, but that could also have been due to the relationship structure. So here it did not bother me, because of my lack of knowledge, which means I can not judge it at all. I liked him a lot in here. He embodied Vincenzo perfectly with his innocent looks and confidence.
Ok Taec‑yeon was the perfect representative of the multiple personalities and played his two roles very well. The magic happens in the eyes like I could almost grab the madness.
My personal highlight was episode 8, but obviously all of them are bangers.
It's about power struggles, friendship, the past and reinvention among most of the characters. In the end of Vincenzo, the relationship of the main leads is not defined, but I can easily say that I have not seen such a healthy relationship in a Drama for a long time. There is no crossing of borders, no invasion of privacy and if somebody told a lie, it was accepted until the person was ready to talk about whatever happened. Nobody needed to change or complement the other, they liked each other as complete individuals. They just liked being around each other and had the same goal.
The music never failed to hype me up. I really loved everything about it, but I'm pretty sure there will not be another season.

BTW since they are calling themselves the Cassanovo Family, aren't they also a part of the mafia XD

My experience
Y'all, if you still haven't watched it, you need to watch it right now. You don't need to hesitate. It's totally worth it. ><

I gotta say, it might disappoint you in the ending for those who are watching kdramas for romance... but yeah I won't say anything more :D

I love this sooo much. It makes me cry that I already finished it. T_T
WATCH IT right now or else Vincenzo will leave a letter 'C' in your house... :D
he he he he he he he...

Anyways... This kdrama is one of the best and I had a lot of fun experiences. It has a lot of funny and awkward moments... and some of them may give you some SECOND HAND EMBARASSMENT... :))

Best of 2021!
Where should I start? Since the release of the series, I have watched this drama twice and I still can't get enough. Every character in the series are so apt to their role and they have given the best performance. Song Joong-Ki acting is the highlight, in the series, as you can see so many various colours of his acting, my personal favorite is Tae-ho (well if you have seen it you will know). Love you Corn salad!

Apart, from that drama has amazing action, dark comedy, suspense and romance.

Psycho VS Mafia
For starters if you're obsessed with psychopaths, mafia, murder and revenge like I am...you couldn't have come to a better place! Everything about this was pure, flawless and heavy GOLD (referencing)! From the beginning you'll witness the power and awesomness that is Vincenzo. The comedy throws an amazing loop into the mix of war, giving this show the perfect balance and there's enough romance to keep the main story going without any mishaps but still cause the plot to thicken like molasses. I was hooked from ep1 and I don't think it'll be different for anyone else lol The ONLY reason I don't give it a perfect 10 (despite all my praise) is cause the ending wasn't what I wanted (I'm so selfish LMAO).
I find it hard to believe you won't...
Enjoy!

One of the most memorable shows with the most memorable titular character!
Bellasimo! Bravo! - Words I want to say as I clap while the end credits roll. Although I shall try to be as unbiased as I can while I review this because as memorable or entertaining the show was, there were also some okay-ish parts which need to be mentioned.

The story is quite gripping, the premise one of a kind, the execution quite good and the pacing well done. I had my doubts when I learned that this was a 20 episode show, as I tend to lose my patience (or the shows just keep dragging on) post the 16th episode. But the storyline was engaging all along. Okay, maybe, I wouldn't say it was engaging ALL the time, but 90% of the time. I just found myself lost a little in the multitude of subplots or the portions about the ensemble support cast. That being said, I really enjoyed all the characters! It was evident that a lot of time and effort has gone into writing each and every character, no matter how small their part may be! You get acquainted with all the characters you're watching. It was fascinating how I found myself thinking from the characters' POV after a point because I've been made aware of what the character might think or do. This was brilliantly done by the writers.

Kudos to the actors as well, as they brought to life all these dynamic characters. I truly loved the good(but also bad) guys and loathed the truly bad(and definitely heinous) guys. If it would be a crime to gush about Song Joong Ki right now, I plead guilty because this man is a heart(scene) stealer through and through. I could almost hear the collective screams of all the fans (new and old) when I was watching his most stellar scenes. He was *ChefsKiss* This was the first time I've seen Jeon Yeo Bin and I was IMPRESSED. Definitely looking up other works of hers. She gave a very memorable performance as well! The whole cast did an incredible job in my opinion.

I've mentioned quite a few things I enjoyed in the show, now to mention the parts that stopped me giving it a perfect ten:

1. Weak plot links every 3-4 episodes.

2. As much as I loved watching the Cassano Geumga Family members on screen for 20 hours. I wouldn't have minded if was concised to 16/18 hours.

3. Too many deaths after a point of time to ignore. I mean, I get that we were shown the real and ruthless side of the consigliere Vincenzo that wasn't prominent in the earlier episodes but it wasn't just him doing this. The people from plaza (and a govt. agent) were on it ALL THE TIME. It got a little weird if I thought about it too much, so to be honest, I stopped thinking about it at length and moved on.

4. There are so many ridiculous moments that make no sense but I just swallowed the ""It's a K-Drama"" pill and I was good to go for the next couple of episodes.

Now that we've addressed the elephant in the room, let me summarize the experience I had while watching this show. The show was definitely a class apart, and one that will stand out for a long, long time for its production, story, cast and quality. It's well-written (for the most part), well paced, well acted, well directed - essentially well made. The last show which brought such quality vibes was Crash Landing On You. God, that CGI! And now that I've typed it, there really are many other similarities in the shows as well, but let's skip that. Nevertheless, the characters of Vincenzo are definitely memorable, and several scenes are already replaying in my head as well!

I truly hope this show serves as a benchmark for future works in terms of quality and attention to details. There's a lot that could have been better, but there's more that deserves praise and acknowledgement. I'll surely revisit this world of Vincenzo to relive a lot of impressively written scenes.

Give it a definite try, but do not watch it with astronomical expectations because of the ratings. Also, the viewing experience gets tenfolds better once you stop trying to reason and analyze everything more than it needs to be. It is after all, a drama, written for entertainment purposes - which the show does, and does quite well.

I'll miss the gang!
If you've managed to make a cast consisting of around 20 people memorable to me, then you're doing something good. The thing that I thoroughly enjoyed in this drama is how the friendship and trust build up through the episodes slowly but surely. I was a little comprehensive, agitated even, at some of the tenants of the plaza in the early part but they won me over and that negative emotion eventually turned to happiness whenever I see them together.

More than the acting, I would like to commend the script and the direction. I like how serious and dark it is when needed and then it will just suddenly blow you with a comic scene where the humor is spot-on and the execution is flawless. That isn't very easy to do (Welcome to Waikiki comes to mind but that show was purely comical). The lines/script isn't cringe-y or trope-y, and evokes just the right emotion. A little let-down was the last episode though where we were punched with a lot of very cliched tropes, but I guess it's hard to maintain perfection when the first 18 episodes were perfect.

Acting-wise, all of them are experienced actor which is why it's noticeable how Taecyeon is a little bit lacking. I had some scenes where I found it funny instead of feeling scared or fearful and some where the other cast took my attention when he's supposed to be the focus, hopefully he can improve in his next projects. I've been rooting for Kwak Dongyeon since Love in the Moonlight so I'm glad this show was able to provide a boost to his popularity. I hope he hits it big soon, he doesn't deserve to be the pitiful second lead anymore. All in all, I loved the ensemble cast so I hope everybody will achieve great things in the years to come! It was truly a fun 2 months with Vincenzo!

As a bonus: the cast collaborated with Na PD for The Game Caterers and it was soooo funny (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML9E33z2jJ0). The died during the Shout in Silence of the monks. I think I will be watching out for Kwon Seungwoo (Monk Chaeshin)!

Good Enough
Korean Drama "" Vincenzo "" had a good concept but there were times that it didn't make it work.

The main problem with this drama is the length. It's not only twenty episodes long, each episode also was about an hour and twenty minutes. However, the story was not for that length. Therefore, there were episodes, especially the final ones, when the story was full of fillers, unnecessary twists, and ridiculous situations that were trying too hard to be funny. The blend, though, of action, comedy, and legal themes was an interesting combination that worked for most of the cases. Most of the characters were also pretty interesting, though some of them, like the piano lady and the female lead, were annoying and it was obvious that they were written to be eccentric, but that was presented in a way that screamed try-hard. The villain was a boring character in the second half of the drama. However, it must be noted that the big twist was an innovative one and pretty entertaining.

As for the performances, everyone did a great job, especially the male lead who finally found the right character for his proper comeback after the big hit DOTS.

So, overall, six out of ten.

Anti-Hero Hero Glorifield
I have had a lot of thoughts while watching this show. Both good and bad. Let's start with the good shall we:

1) Production Design - Amazing production and direction. The Italy piece was amazingly shot. Made me pause just to look at the vertical shots, and the different angles many action scenes were shot as well. The fight choreography was decent. Every arson scene looked so real.

2) The Villains - I was definitely more interested in the villains than the main character (will come to that later). Ok Teac Yeon made me so much invested in his character that I completely ditched the MC, and was primarily watching for him. For me, he was definitely the USP and the one character which I felt could have had better treatment. Choi Myung Hee was such a great subversion for a feminist trope that I never knew I needed. She really made me hate her character and I really despised her till the end.

3) Song Jong Ki - The man is so charismatic as Vincenzo, it is really difficult to take your eyes off him. Half the reason Vincenzo works is because of this man.

4) Supporting Characters - I did have a like-dislike relationship with the Plaza people. It was definitely a funny gag to see how each one of them was immensely talented, and their coming together as the Casanno family really melted my heart. But their search for the gold plot tested my patience and I skipped their many scenes.

5) Music - The Music and Background Scores are bangers and elevated the scenes a lot. The song Adrenaline really did come at a funny situation, but still a banger.

6) Chemistry - SJK had chemistry with almost all the actors and even more so with his male cast members. I did feel a little queerbaiting here and there but I cast was really good and the acting was amazing.

Now what didn't work for me:

1) Vincenzo as a static character - VC is a charter who remained static from start to end. He has precisely one change in the entire show which was after episode 3. And the ONLY consequence or low point in his life was episode 17 when his mother died. Apart from that Vincenzo would Swoop in save the day, get in trouble by the last few minutes of the episode, and then by the next episode within the first few minutes all his problems would get resolved. He is ALWAYS ahead in his game, never loses literally. I don't have a problem with OP characters but this problem persists throughout the show, which made me believe there was really nothing at the stake for him.

2) Themes - Glorification of VC as an anti-hero and no nuance themes. The drama treats VC as an anti-hero but at the same time, he acts as the hero most of the time. The show never shows me (lesser evil vs evil). It treats its lesser evil as a Heroic trait. All the scenes of VC come off across as ""cool"" or ""wow"" but never, is he right or wrong because he is always right. Even if you see the MC, he barely has more than a scratch on his face doing col stuff.

3) Female Lead - The FL really came off as annoying and over the top. She did shine through after episode 3 but rarely showed character development in the latter half of the show. She blindly followed all Vincenzos plan. While the actors did have chemistry and romance was slow-burn and had a comrade of a married couple, the romance did feel a little off and little to no need.

More Afraid of the ML and FL than the story villain
Story: Awesome!
They will leave you wanting for more. I keep waiting for the evil plan which our ML will execute handsomely.

There were points in the story that I pity our real story villains, why? They are so helpless.

Absolutely, the Vicenzo guy is on another dimensional level compared to them. They are just a corrupt company headed by a psychopath.
Like, duhh you shouldn't messed up with Vincenzo in the first place cause they are no match.

Really, in the last episode I pity Babo. He's mentally sick and lost, I don't know if that's really what he deserves. I wished they have portrayed the reason why Babo is mentally ill and have visualized him more as a total asshole, Babo didn't even hit the FL in the last episode when he abducted her, I wonder why.
He should have hit her, hurt her , he was even confused when he realized that his bullet went through the girl, I was so confused by that. I am gratified in is death, but questioning.

Acting:
Song Joong Ki : Nailed it!
Chemistry: Just perfect for the theme
Comedy: Fun but sometimes I feel out of sync, some of the comedy where OA... Like I am watching a stage play. Specially the playing piano girl...bagging her head and hair from left to right.

Music:
Perfect

Rewatch Value:
100% Especially when Vincenzo shoot the guy who have killed his mom. WOw, that scene, it's perfect. His face, the anger, the anguish. Song Joong Ki, Just wow, he can be cute sometimes, deadly sometimes.

Overall: It was really nice. I seldom watched a drama that I would finish. but Vincenzo? I have watched every episode. I even replayed some. That's how I like it.

Thanks for this wonderful drama. 2021.

Overhyped
Don't let the headline fool you, I am the one who over hypes this drama to anyone I recommend it to. Honestly I have no idea where to even start because I feel like if I explain my thoughts and feelings about this show it'll be a whole ass 3 page essay and I don't think anyone wants to read that. All I can say is that Song Joon Ki is the love of my life because of this drama and I've watched mostly everything he's been in because I saw this drama. Just don't even think about it and watch it, it has everything you'll ever need, crime, law, romance, comedy, found family, an extremely hot and terrifying villain. Ever since I started watching k-dramas I never was the one to really like law and crime dramas but because of Vincenzo I've been on a non-stop watching of those genres and it hasn't been the same. When I tell you this drama changed my life, it CHANGED MY LIFE. See overhyping, just go watch it, and if you don't have Netflix I'll give you my Netflix account... jk jk.. but go watch it on dramacool or watchasian. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

Mindblowing drama with bittersweet ending
HI guy if u going to watch this show then go for it.its amazing cast and story line.full package of drama,comedy,crime nd slow romance.every cast members did their best .I bet u fall for the main cast they are super cute and perfect bonding no break up drama or typical love triangle they love each other nd accept each other who they really are they don't try to change each main lead was from mafia but it's never bothered main female lead she support him because she love nd trust him .
The only thing that's disappointed me was ending of the Drama it's not sad ending but it's not totally happy ending either they love each other they don't break up but still can't live together because main lead has to return to Italy for his mafia work nd only come to Korea secretly to meet her because in Korea people are looking for him nd he can't leave Italy for long but she goes to Italy when ever she want .actually ending shows us real world of mafia relationship with common girl so it's acceptable because ml get trust nd find true love that he never expected
So all in it's bitter sweet ending but I hope they come with season 2 because many of thing is unsettled in drama like gold (the mAin reason for v for coming Korea) people looking for him ,his lady love just hope they make season 2 or they come together in other projects with same cast

A little inconsistent, but what a ride!
TLDR: Vincenzo is a dark comedy about anti-hero mafia consligere who delivered justice, in outrageous crooked ways, with loveable characters (looking fly as hell), coupled with interesting villains. Being a comedy, every episode would have something funny. This at times back-fires, as it created a couple inconsistencies in characters, albeit endearing and entertaining. Also, there are a few unnecessary characters that make this drama a little too dragged out, perhaps to fulfil the 20-episodes arc. All-in-all, a fun and entertaining ride!

*spoilers ahead*
What the show did well: The show's premise was indeed outrageous from the get-go. It could have gone so terribly wrong if not for the spectacular VFX (Italy scenes) and acting (Song Joong Ki) in the series. Besides VFX, the action scenes were shot really well, probably one of the best action kdramas in my opinion. Secondly, the writers have definitely provided endearing main characters for viewers to root for, especially the Geumga Plaza residents and Hong Cha Young. The drama's initial surprise of innocent-looking Jang Joon Woo being the mastermind of Babel was really good, and his psychopathic character and his spiraling out-of-control was entertaining yet intimidating to watch. Lastly, my boy Jang Han Seo deserves better (more so of the actor playing characters that have happier endings). I really liked the character development for most of the characters, including Jang Han Seo and former Babel minions. Last but not least, the soundtrack was dope. Some of the tracks being classical-influenced amped up the pompous or outrageousness of the drama, which is pure entertainment.

What the show could have done better: I wish that ex-Prosecutor Choi was given a better storyline. Heck, she could have been the main villain or forge a different path (aka joining the good guys/not being the subordinate or sidekick). In earlier episodes, we see that she was a boss ass bitch (albeit terrorizing) in the law firm. Yet, in later episodes we were given a Harley Quinn-ish character that stayed by her Joker (aka Joon Woo). While I do understand her character development, it felt like she was shoved aside to make way for Joon Woo. Same for Hong Cha Young, I also wish she could have shown more of her lawyer skills/chops instead of Vincenzo always saving her ass/the day. The last few episodes had some random ass moments/subplots that felt like fillers instead of character or plot development. Also, I felt that there were a few too many episodes ending in a cliffhangers that results in unfulfilling plot devices.

Nerve-racking show with an annoying comedy
It took me awhile before I fully understand what’s going on during the beginning of the show. Then most of the side characters are familiar which I’ve already seen from different dramas, which also made a trademark from their previous drama. At first I’m happy seeing them again in a new drama but it’s really a boring characters for me so I didn’t actually like it at all. The first few episodes don’t interest me but after Mr. Hong died I started to like the show but then many things happen and it was a rollercoaster ride yet 20 episodes is too much for the story. Too much miracle happened in the story that turns the series an unrealistic drama.

Brutality and violence that’s goes round and round with an ever ending deaths. To be honest, I don’t like how Vincenzo plays along with the villain although many of his acquaintance was killed. It just that it really not a mafia thing to let the main suspect lived longer than the rest. Specially that Vincenzo emphasizes “Devil for devil, eye for an eye, and tooth for a tooth” throughout the earlier episodes. Vincenzo is obviously a murderer but he become soft afterwards which were confusing for some reason. But anyways, it’s a satisfying ending seeing how the villains ended up in a painful way to die. Only evil can punish evil.

I’m getting annoyed both with the villain characters and at the same time the failed comedic attempt of the show. The people who played the antagonist were so clever and I really feel irritated towards them, meaning that their acting is effective. And then we have the most annoying genre of the show, the comedy! The most cringe character goes to the Chef’s assistant or the spy agent from the international crime division. He is trying hard to make the scene funny but I didn’t laugh at all, it was a failed comedy attempt. Most scenes coming from the people renting the building seems to get boring and boring as episodes passed by. I even find it naïve that they can win against thugs who are crueler than them, in a physical fight.

One thing that I liked the most in the drama is that Kwak Dong Yeon finally been able to recognize by a lot of people. He is indeed a talented and handsome man. I am already a fan of him a long time ago, that is why I am so happy for the feedback of the viewers to his role.

Vincenzo is probably a good crime and law drama but not actually the best. I like how they didn’t focus on romance that much which is exactly a good thing. But then again, the comedy just ruined the entirety of the show.

Best Kdrama I’ve watched
I have been watching a lot of Kdramas for a while now, and when I started Vincenzo, I didn’t feel like it was that good for the first 3 episodes. However, I kept watching because it was pretty funny and I loved the way it was shot, I had faith in it. It started getting really good all of the sudden and when it ended I literally couldn’t get over it. It has really raised my standards for Kdramas and every Kdrama lover should watch it. The cast has great chemistry together, which made the acting really good in the show. Even the villains are such great actors that I couldn’t even hate them. The drama has everything like action, romance, plot twists and humor, it is really amazing.

A true masterpiece
Anyone that tries to argue that this isn't the best kdrama ever can go argue with themselves. Every aspect of this show was great and it was really unpredictable which I loved. Not only were the two main actors hot but they portrayed the characters so well. Not to mention the cinematography and editing job was insanely good. Would def watch again and recommend to everyone. Also, Vincenzo is the best villain. I love how he can go from looking like a soft innocent boy to this intense evil guy. The ending was so satisfying which was great because I hate it when kdramas are amazing until the ending that's a let down. :)))

An Italian point of view
As an Italian, I was curious to see this drama, and also a bit afraid because of the delicate topic they've chosen.

It's not easy to write a story involving Mafia without falling into stereotypes and romanticization. It's something that it's almost never discussed outside of our country, and not many people who talk about Mafia have a real idea of what they are. They aren't the cool and sexy boss who kill just for the pleasure to kill, and that justifies their actions for the sake of ""love"". They are a plague, a terrific and still existing problem of our country. So many have suffered, especially in the years from the '60 to the '80, but even now in different forms. It's not something to laugh at, something to think as ""cool"". It's evil and cruel, and I really hope whoever has started this drama had this point really clear.

Now, what about Vincenzo?
The plot itself wasn't that complicated, it's the typical law/criminal kdrama, with our evil guys who kill and don't really care about human life or morals, and we have our heroes, who on the contraries want to bring justice. But here we have someone in the middle. Vincenzo Cassano is ""the evil"", as he represents himself, but he also works against the even worse evil of the drama, and his purposes are driven by the need to bring justice where the justice system lacks.
The story was nice, a bit slow, and boring in the middle (the whole search for the gold plotline was honestly so annoying!), but it was interesting enough to keep me watching.

Vincenzo's character was generally well written and, despite my worries, he wasn't the romanticized hero of this kind of narrative. I liked how from the beginning he never showed himself as the good guy, he knew who he was, he knew what he did, and what he was planning to do was morally wrong, but in his perspective, it was the only way to bring peace. He was human enough to feel some remorse for his actions, but he was willing to live with those feelings.
In the end, he wasn't really different from the bad big guys and it honestly looked a bit unrealistic how he never suffered from the consequences of his actions. This was the only sign that he was indeed the ""good guy"" for the drama and for the audience, which was something I didn't really like. Somehow it was strange to see how the people around him worshipped him and his actions... I mean, he helped them a lot, but he was still ruthless and cold-blooded and yet they never criticized him for this.
Also, there were some things that didn't sit well with me. Not particularly with his character, but with the whole Mafia topic. Somehow, especially from the halfway point of the drama, Vincenzo and Hong Cha Young's actions seemed justified just because their enemies were doing something even more wrong and evil. They used some Mafia modus operandi (like the pig blo*d, or even the ending for Myung Hee) as a way to fight their enemies, but they were shown almost like a joke, with funny music in the background and their smiling and satisfied reactions. To be honest, those scenes made me a bit uncomfortable, because it wasn't funny to think about the people who had suffered in the reality.

As for the rest of the characters, they were okay, but nothing remarkable. The big bad guy was the usual big bad guy, crazy, without morals or rules. At least he was handsome.
I really liked Jang Hanseo's character, though. I liked his struggle between the need to stay alive and the desire to be genuinely appreciated by his brother.
And for the Cassano family gang... well they were just the usual comic relief to make the drama less dark and heavy. Funny the first two episodes, then they became overrated. And they were too many, they took so much screen time that could be used to show better the main characters instead of the stupid hunt for the gold (yes, again, I didn't like that part, sorry lol).

The acting.
As always, this part doesn't disappoint. I really appreciated Joongki, more than usual. He worked so hard in learning his parts in Italian and he was also pretty good. I feel sad for those who don't understand the language and have missed all the poetic shadows of his swear words. They were beautiful and perfectly Italian!
Also big shootout to Taekyeon, he's always so expressive when he acts and I really enjoyed his representation.

What else to say?
It wasn't a bad drama, I actually enjoyed it, but I think they could have done better work with the whole Mafia topic. I know I must sound boring, but it's really important. And while they haven't fallen into ugly stereotypes, they still didn't show the reality. The Mafia isn't the ""best alternative"" to fight the bad enemy, and I wished they hadn't slipped on this part.
I'll probably never rewatch this, though.

VINCENZO ! *chefs kiss*
VINCENZO ! VINCENZO ! VINCENZO ! VINCENZO !

I enjoyed this drama a lot! The beginning of it has some beautiful Italian landmarks & landscapes but I was surprised to find out IT WAS ALL CGI !!!!!!!!

The CGI was so good & the overall Vincenzo series was amazing from start to finish with lots of elements and it never got boring to watch!! The acting was so good as well & it really made me hate the villains / like the main characters.

The overall plot was interesting as well & had a lot of jaw-dropping moments & surprises along the way ?

Would recommend this series 10/10 I binge watched it all in a week !

The series presented from cultures (Korean, Italian, Biblical, Buddhist, ...) presents a progression from the Mafia, did not forget the way of speaking and writing in Korean, and barely learned Italian, take off, Italian, Italian, as he is stuck in the war of good against evil, and he sided with me since the beginning , and assist in the ruling in the struggle for justice.
((People need to understand that the Mafia does nothing but brutal murders and murders, they have to follow it, only from here comes what you see in the media portrayal of the Mafia)).
This show had a lot of supporting roles a lot, but I've never felt crowded. Each had a spiritual character and a 20-episode episode of that show was featured.
""Managing episodes, as long as you can visualize it.""
● Ok Taecyeon is amazing in his amazing dual portrayal and the CEO of the company, his presentation of both characters is amazing. He's a legitimate madman and a perfect demon) I felt sorry for him, a clearly flawed and troubled human being. I loved all his little English phrases often, I enjoyed seeing his anger and frustration, just his gluttony, he does a good job. I want him to be with the heroine but at the same time I want him to be tortured the way he would torture anyone who gets in his way.
● A half-brother, played by Kwak Dong Yeon, was once again cool in his portrayal of Jang Han Seo.. He's funny but scary at the same time while looking incredibly handsome in porralro suits??
Kind of prepped, in other words, imagine what will happen, but it concludes, definitively. Those who go to hell from eternal torment, those who go to hell.

A drama you would never forget
Everything about this drama is amazing. Ive never seen such an amazing drama in my life. All the actors were amazing and there acting and chemistry was amazing...except the english actors were a lil.. well anyway they only appeared for like 10 minutes so it doesnt really matter. You really feel for the characters and I even got very attached to them even after the show. Watching this show was the best decision ever. The comedy all on point mixed in with the very dark stuff its so balanced and well done. I give a big applause to the antagonist and the antagonists brother, to me these two really shined and I loved watching them so much there acting is so on point and their characters are so unbelievably deep. In conclusion, do not hesitate to watch this series. I does have very long episodes but there was never one that was ever boring or slow it was all done soooo well.

Not mafia but politics
Plot: Don’t expect too much mafia stuff here but more on government/politics issue that is happening in real life but with too much obvious deaths. Episode 6 onwards it became predictable. There were some plot holes but still watchable and entertaining. Mostly skipped the tenants parts but there were some foreshadowing that I actually like.

Acting: SJK did good however JYB didn’t. Her acting reminded me of Jun jihyun, honestly, her dramatic scenes weren’t on point and few of badass moments were sort of awkward. I think SJK did the heavy lifting when it comes to their chemistry. OTY & KYJ did amazing here as well but my favorite is KDY. He didn’t deserve his ending but necessary for his character to be memorable.

Music: Music is very deadpool-ish especially during action scenes.

Rewatch Value: Would definitely rewatch KDY scenes

Overall: I suggest that you don’t take this drama seriously or don’t expect too much because the plot was sort of so-so but still enjoyable.

The Best Kdrama I’ve Watched
The ratings and viewings did not lie. I saw some negative comments but I think they have no taste or just haters and bitters. Vincenzo just captured hearts that it is the first kdrama that is so hard to let go. It made my weekend nights so happy. Every episode is so packed with everything you want. The chemistry of the casts are beyond perfect. And lastly, the slow burn love story is the best romance story in kdrama world. Not to mention the Best Kiss.

Perfect mix of dark drama and comedy
Vincenzo is a unique series that mixes comedy and dark drama to make something truly entertaining. It gave me a balance between laugh out loud moments, moments I had to cry, and moments that were exciting and action packed.
Each side was making moves like a chess game and everyone had a plan to surprise viewers.
I loved the friendship amongst the group of residents at the plaza and the main characters. They quickly hop in the help Vincenzo because of how much they love him and the Hong family.
I saw some reviews where they didn’t love the comedy, and honestly, it comes down to personal taste. I personally LOVED it. The contrast between the gloomy dramatics and the ridiculous comedy, fan service, and characters like the chef was refreshing. If you want a drama that is realistic in humor and plot, this isn’t for you.
I will say that some of the violence was over done and there are story lines the drama could have really emphasized and explored. I wanted to see more of Vincenzo’s personal relationships, personal development, and more about his time in Italy. But I’m giving this drama a 10/10 because it was truly a unique and thrilling experience from beginning to end.

Was scrolling through the comments here and some are just way too harsh lol but each to their own I guess. I personally thoroughly enjoyed the show. Each episode almost an hour and a half so it was lengthy but it kept me engaged so that's a big plus in itself. Loved the cinematography, loved the characters and their dynamics with each other. The actors played their part well according to the demand for the type of show it was. At times there were some ridiculous things in the plot but honestly I didn't care much. The push and pull between the good and bad parties each episode was exciting. The villains had me wanting them to die a horrible death. I had some good laughs throughout the show as well. Oh and this drama probably had the best episode endings I have seen in dramas. Vincenzo definitely one of my favorite dramas of the year so far.

Overhyped
I can't believe this has a 9 rating, really? The only thing exceptional about this show was the cinematography. If they hadn't mixed genres and kept this a serious, beautifully shot thrilling mobster romance, it could have been worthy of that 9. Instead the genre mixing of so many attempts at comedy, goofiness and more was really out of place here and cheapened the experience.

The acting was just okay. Like I said, nothing else was exceptional. I dropped it at episode 6 and have no desire to go back to it.

I'm not a fan of law dramas, I only wanted to watch this for my girl but with this writer it's just like they made a Hani role but without Hani, it's a spitting replica of the fiery priest character

the law stuff is booorrriing, yet another revenge story with evil people doing evil stuff and talking about it over dinner.. korean villains are become like the LAMOS from totally spies

the worst part is the lack of balance between serious and comedy. one second they're all hotshot poker face people and the next they're like Goofy the Disney character

the fl is super over reactive, she's a walking 2nd hand embarrassment and the ML is like a giant baby throwing tantrums
then there's the whole mess of the tenants, everyone is out of a parody textbook, I literally couldn't care less about them. just pointless time and space fillers

basically all of this criticism is directed at the writer, they just kept repeating their comedic sense from chief kim and kept repeating it in different settings


also Kim Nam Gil, Namgoong Min and Hani are made for this comedic sense but Song Joong Ki and Jun Yeo Bin are better off in serious roles


the plus side, my girl got another casting call and I loved her outfits, honestly she looked so hot in the stills..


She's more comically aggressive than Hani, Baek Inha, Veronica Park, Hwang Jungeum and even Lee Yori...
I went from ""aw my girl is a total boss lady"", to ""aw look she's acting cute"" and ended with ""what the heck is wrong with her""...

And worse the other smart boss lady is also as over reactive with the weird dance and crazy facial expressions. That is not comedy and I loved Pegasus Market and Spring turns to Spring

Who can help me understand the 72 hour ref in Ep. 1
The opening scene of Ep 1 shows the building crashing down and there is a subtitle about 72 Hours earlier... we then see Vincenzo in Italy... so...at the end of episode 4 I am confused about that... seems like more than 3 days have passed and the building is not yet imploded. What did I miss? And, when he was in hospital one of the arcade shop keepers talks about him having been asleep for 9 days... so I am confused. Really enjoying on the whole, even though I got a bit bored in Ep 3. Ep 4 was great fun with unexpected plot twist. Yay.

Might be spoilers so dont read if you didnt watch ep 4
To be honest with you I thought I was going to hate this drama because I hate crime show but this is actually really good

But most people might also hate it because it has romance which I don't understand
Is it because of the FL or because of the ML?

This show is really good
I think most people misunderstood the FL because of her Character but it shows that she a good actress if she plays a character like that.

Ok Taec Yeon First Villion lead
In Ep 4 when we found out that the building that was burned was own by him I was so shocked

But I hope you continue to watch it because it getting better every ep

Started on a high note but..
The first few episodes were good and created a curiosity about the characters' stories. Episode 3 climax was also interesting as I thought that finally the good lawyer will team up with devil to take out the devil instead of being straightforward.. He hardly says it that the crash happens. And then he dies???? What the! I was hoping to see how they team up and win so this was an anti-climax. Also, had high hopes for Yoo Jae-myung after his performances in Itaewon and Stranger so this seems like a wasted opportunity especially after his almost equal presence in the first 3 episodes!! Another untapped charatcter- Yang Kyung-won from CLOY. Disappointed. Now, I have to put up with a over the top female lead trying to do what I am not sure, her silly ass intern, slow motion and opera music, the main character being stylish from a 100 different angles! Zzzzzzzzzzzzz... Predictable how this will turn out.. I am dropping out. No thanks!

One word: Satisfaction
First I wanna say sorry if my english is bad, I'm from Portugal so english is not my first language. About Vincenzo: This is the first time that I felt the need to write a review, this drama made me feel so happy that I almost cry at the end just because it ended. It has comedy, it has good fight scenes and badass moments. The story, in my opinion, was amazing, it wasn't something extremely complex, it's the type to just sit and enjoy, and I love it. I'm in favour of each person forming their own opinion while watching, I can see why some might not enjoy Vincenzo as much as I did but if you are considering to watch and are looking for an extra opinion I can only say the you should watch, you might actually have so much fun as I did.

SJK at his finest

Mr. Song 'Vincenzo Cassano' Joong Ki at his finest. Vincenzo doesn't take itself too seriously and it knows how to have fun, just what we all need right now, and that's where this hit drama's charm lies. It feels a bit like 'revengey' Suits x sitcom x heist drama. It's about an ex(?) mafia and a ragtag group of neighbors getting themselves unexpectedly involved in a fight for justice.

It's so nice to see Song Joong Ki in a (kinda?) light role again. He get to do a lot of things here, with all those expensive suits, slow mo's and closeups. I still wish he'll do a full blown comedy (like Sungkyunkwan) because he's kind of the straight man with a great comedic supporting cast. Lol I think this show is half a SJK modeling/ad show. (Lord, I want his flawless skin.) I appreciated the fact that he still acts his socks off unlike other hyped actors.

The romance here are basically just crumbs. SJK and Jeon Yeo Been looks good together, she does tend to overact at times, but that's forgivable esp. for comedy, and it's wonderful her career is taking off esp. after Vincenzo. I love that we are getting unapologetic loud heroines like her.

Mild spoilers:
Admittedly I haven't watched Taec for a long time, but he really improved his acting a lot! I wished there was more of him as an adorably bumbling intern. As main villain though, he still lacked that creep factor. It's great they tried a different look for Kim Yeo Jin as Ms. Prosecutor Choi (not very polished), but she also lacked that sinister feel. Maybe it was deliberate casting as the show has to balance the dark with its comic edge.

Kwak Dong Yeon is amazing as always. The whole cast is good, my always fave trope of small town village feel and found family concept because of the colorful Geumga plaza dwellers, and their crazy quest for hidden gold. One thing I hated is the length! I like me some SJK but omg tvn pls cut your drama episodes to 1 hr, it feels extra long and superfluous when bingeing. This probably works better as a weekly watch.

Oh how I didn't know that Korea could do such a marvelous job when incorporating another culture into their drama shows!

I didn't expect the ML to be able to fluently speak Italian! I know I can't speak it but the way they portrayed the mafia made me respect the mafia a little bit more!

The first episode started off hardcore and ended the same way. I saw a few familiar faces in this series which I was glad to see. I'm not familiar with the main character. I haven't seen anything he's been in. But to save face it's because I'm a month shy of being an avid Korea drama fan watcher for a year. Anybody who has mad fighting skills I'm immediately drawn to.
As I say in my reviews I'm a action fanatic. I grew up watching old martial art movies they use to air on Saturday nights when I was a kid led me to this point. Thanks Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat!!!

OK, I put this may contain spoilers just in case I slip and accidentally say something but I assume A LOT of people have already watched this.

The chemistry this cast had made me want to truly want to be apart of. I loved every member good and bad. They were spot on with their roles. I really want to hug the casting agent and writer of this series! The only thing that had me gritting my teeth was the fact that about the 19th episode it was like the writers forgot who the main lead was because he became weak because of a girl....Oy, this is why I no longer care for series that have romance in it. Saving a girl putting yourself and others in danger always tank for me. It went well up unto that point. Thankfully the last episode made up for the lapse of judgement from the previous episode.

I cheered, nearly bawled, got angry, and laughed a lot! It was so awesome that I was even cheering for a pigeon!!!

I know I'm twisted but I loved the way justice was served. Some was quicker than the others but it worked for me. It took me back to the movie 'Taken' with Liam Neeson. He gives a speech about how well his skills are and the bad guy just laughs thinking it's a joke until....Vincenzo took on that route which is why I love this series!

I didn't want this season to end but it had to. Will I rewatch this? Maybe. I gave it a high rewatch review because it was just that good. I only rewatched one of my favorite Korean dramas because I hit a action drama drought. I tend to do that at times but I may rewatch this one as well.

The BEST K-drama ever
This is such a FABULOUS K-drama that I have ever seen. Previously, I hadn't watched any drama of Song Joong Ki and Joen Yeo Bin, but this one is SOOOO much exciting to spend your time with. The main leading roles of Vincenzo & Hong Cha Young are quite matching with wonderful chemistry, even though there are not many loving scenes in the show. If both of them can successfully develop their relationship in real life as they grow for each other in the drama, that's perfect and I wish them happiness. Their performance in each scene is really unforgettable and mesmerizing.

10/10 for Song Joong Ki and Joen Yeo Bin. (I'm shipping them now)
10/10 for all the Guemga residents. They are the cutest supporting roles, esp. Mr. An who is much lovely and hilarious.

The other antagonists also performed very well in their roles. I really like Jang Jun Woo in those early episodes because he looks childish and lovely. His face looks so kind and nice so he might not fit a lot in Jang Han Soek, not very scary in this role. However, he did try the best to bring out this evil character.

Music: really love ""I'm always by your side"", and ""This is love"" whenever both of them are playing in the kissing scenes. The melodies perfectly match with the background where Vincenzo and Cha Young are falling in love, but still embarrassed to confess to each other.

Congratulations to all the actors and actresses, supporting roles, director and screen writing, all the staff working very hard to bring out the best drama. I LOVE you all!!!!!

This is a great and unique drama that can be viewed as a satirical account of the characters in the drama. The plot is a deranged representation of criminal investigation of psychopaths perpetrated by a group of individuals that get involved with the leading couple as they seek justice and their share of a fortune left by a deceased criminal. This is a well written and executed story that shows the vice in humans with a dose of dark parodic satire that seems, at times, to lighten the overall dark tone of the drama. Vincenzo is not the typical crime drama where good triumphs over evil; it is a drama that makes individuals question if, given the circumstances where the justice system and its representatives are corrupt and no justice can be expected, an inherently evil action be warranted by a good reason. This is a star-studded drama with impeccable performances across the board and not for the faint of heart!

A perfect blend of humor and intensity
Vincenzo is a show that checks every box in my list of what makes a good drama. It has law. It has humor. It has thrill. It has good storyline and writing. It has beautiful cinematography. It has enough Romance to keep me on my toes. Couldn't ask for more.
This show was something I waited for everyday of the week. Every week I was so excited to watch it as soon as Netflix dropped it. It really keeps you so pumped and ends with cliffhangers every episode.
It has alot of impact on my daily life. I keep remembering the show looking at random things like pigeons, zumba etc.
I loved how well the writer really thought out the show and wrote it so intelligently.
This show is so balanced, every episode there was an equal amount of humor and intensity. So you'll never know how serious the next scene is gonna be and this doesn't tire you out and make you overwhelmed.
I remember really laughing out loud, literally to many of the scenes in the show.
The osts of the show are haunting and really well suited to every scene.
I really enjoyed most of the characters, they were well written and well executed by the top tier actors. The bts of the show was super fun to watch, I loved how comfortable the cast were so comfortable with each other.
This show really is so impactful, it made me stronger, I felt somehow empowered and ready to take on challenges (I know right, sounds a little unrealistic, but ngl I really felt it).
The only complain I have is the last episode, the first half made me almost want to reduce the rating to like a 8 lol. It was a bit too fast and overwhelming and some of the actions were unnecessary. But the second half kinda saved the show and increased my rating to 9.5. It was not a perfect ending but I felt vincenzo deserved ""that"" for his sins. If it were a perfect ending it would be unrealistic. So I dont actually have a problem with it.
Other than that, I loved the show so so much. It was beautiful. Highly recommended. Please watch.

I really hope that there will be a season 2 of vincenzo cassano!!
SJK really inspired me a lot when he was acting as a mafia in ""Vincenzo""... He is a kind man and well-suited for this K drama. He is genius on many things, I really love both of the characteristic (SJK amd JYB). I just finished this K drama. Honestly, I am in tears now after finished it, I hope there will be a second season!!

Patience is a virtue!
Acting/Cast
- The casts for this show were truly excellent and the characters were very well executed, that's the main highlight for you!
- It took quite some time (around half of the whole show) for me to feel attached to the characters mainly Geumga Plaza family, the second half of the show brought me to tears on several occasions as I felt the characters' struggle & sadness.
- Sense of humour is spot on most of the time, well at least for me.

Story/Plot
- The first half is the reason why I gave the story's rating of 6 out of 10, due to its lighter tone, slow & draggy.
- The first half of the show is significantly lighter than the second half, the tone gets darker and darker until the very last episode. Yes, the finale is the darkest one & I love it!
- Identity reveals in this show are no joke! Seriously, each of them made me paused, took a breather before continuing.
- People do back-stabbing as if it's their hobbies.

Music/OST
- Just MASTERPIECE, near perfection!

Rewatch value
- Not in the near future, maybe after a year or two. Not quite sure if I want to repeat the first half again, hence, patience is a virtue.

It is literally bollywood but better
Summary: Local mafia man comes to Korea and gets into civil war with a corrupt conglomerate and equally corrupt law firm while he tries to smuggle gold out of the country

This is the most hilarious crime drama I've seen and I felt it really balanced the dark stuff and the comedy well. The casting is spot on and the humor is so over dramatic that the writers took refuge in audacity while writing the script. It's funny to see Vincenzo fighting pigeons and being a fake shaman with a straight face, but the show at the end of the day reminds you that this is a cold blooded mafia man who you do NOT want to fuck with if you want to keep your heads on.

The villains here are deliciously despicable. Jang Han Seok is a complete psychopathic manchild and Choi Myung Hee is a terrifyingly successful dragon (no, not literal)/consigliere to Han Seok. And while I didn't feel devastated for Jang Han Seo, I did feel sorry for him. Poor guy needs a drink and a better life, sheesh. (yo SK, what is up with you and killing off little bro characters these days, huh???)

Jeon Yeo Been is just amazing as Hong Cha Young (her character looks like her audition tape for the role of Poo from K3G jdgfjhs) and she and Song Joong Ki have excellent chemistry. The romance tag may be a little misleading because you don't get any major overt romance scenes other than the fake proposal and the end when Vincenzo comes back from Malta. The chemistry comes from their partnership which is seamlessly carried out and it gets a logical conclusion in the end (its a bittersweet ending, fair warning)

I was not completely on board with the Geumga plaza sub plot because they kept it relevant, but the humor in the gold searching scenes felt a little dragged out for my tastes. But the acting is top notch and at the end of the day you really get the found family vibes coming from them.

Why you must watch: If you're a fan of over the top humor played straight (local mafia man gets saved by pigeon gang, no I'm not making this up), dark content (there is fair amounts of on screen blood, torture and off screen skin peeling) and a cerebus rollercoaster plot, this show is for you.

The first few eps were really boring and disappointed me but after that, every episode was better and more amazing than the one before it. This is one of the few dramas where I literally clapped my hands when the characters did something badass or won and cried when beloved characters died.
I did expect more of the FL tbh. I expected her to be very badass, smart, upfront and as she was the best lawyer in her agency, I expected her to have more connections and to fix things herself, but Vincenzo is the one that planned 99/100 of things, the one that killed, questioned, saved, used connections. And while I understand that the consigliere of the Italian Mafia is a whole other league than a Korean lawyer, I still expected more. The casting was perfect but I think they didn't portray emotions that well, but I understand that it's more of an action dark comedy than a romance, melodrama, or whatever. She was extremely good as a character but a side character not a main honestly. Cause in my opinion she should've achieved more on her own than just follow Vincenzo's orders.

That aside: The music was amazing. This is the first drama where the music had my complete attention and the first time I liked the whole soundtrack!
Vincenzo is a badass to the bone and I liked how he always had shit under control. and if he didn't he always found a way to win. he was protective of his friends and family and he was deservingly well-liked.
Plus he is handsome

I loved how the ppl that lived in the plaza were all secretly talented and how loyal they are. There were many things I did not expect from who the villain is to who the secret hacker is to the trackers put in Chairman Jung's watches. Loved the time skip in the last episode and it was a really good conclusion to the whole series.
It was extremely entertaining even tho some things could've been better. Some scenes were also really funny and I liked the friendships in the drama. Tho I did hope for more indication or like the tension between Vincenzo and Cha young. Cause I felt deep friendship, protectiveness, loyalty, and true love with 2 kisses but didn't really feel the romance. There was a mutual attraction which was sooo CUTEE. and all the gifts they gave each other ahhh so cutee

Anyway, a bunch of smart funny talented sassy experienced people come together to take down their disgustingly greedy enemies, what more could we ask for?

I feel hollow. But not in a bad way. I feel like I've been watching this show for years (I know it wasn't. Lol) so I feel way to attached to all of these characters.

I admit when I first started this show, I was not in to it -- at all. It just isn't my kind of thing, Never has been, but I had someone behind me, pushing me to keep watching and I'm so glad they did! I got hooked so fast, I felt like I was losing my mind waiting for new episodes. Lol I was so worried about this show and it's ending, I just wanted it to keep going forever.

If you have been eyeing this show, I'm telling you, YOU NEED TO WATCH IT!! There was never a dull episode (even if you're like me and it's not your thing, this show might actually change your mind). I always felt like I just got off a rollercoaster when a episode was over.

(honestly right now, my thoughts are scattered -- I just have constant screaming in my head since the last episode)

Everything about this show was unique for me and so intense! All of the characters were mastered perfectly by those who played them. It changed my views on so many actors. Like, they played their parts so well I know I need to step away and calm down for a bit. But I love that. I love when a actor plays the part so well. It just shows how talented they are!

I know some people have a issue with this har mafia guy suddenly teaming up with strangers and helping them (I questioned it at first two) but I loved seeing how cold he was at first, only for him to later really seem them as his family. I loved seeing this story progress the way it did. I get it's not for everyone, but it really made the whole show better that way. I loved that by the end, he really did pretty much have his own little mafia. Lol

I loved the comedy that was squeezed in some places to help lighten the mood when it really needed it, I don't think any of them were misplaced or pointless. I really feel like they were perfect and added more to the story. With everything going on I'm glad they had that or I think most of us would have either cried ourselves to death or had heart attacks. Hahah

THAT ENDING!! Omg. The last two episodes in general had me sobbing my eyes out. I don't even know what to say about them. There was so much raw emotion and it was .... brutal, honestly. But so worth it. I wouldn't change anything about them. But I really am curious if there will be a season 2 or not. They ended it in such a way that it could go either way. It's been a long time since I've seen a show like that. Usually it's pretty cut and dry about which way it could go but this one, they really were like ""well... we might and we might not"" and I can't even get mad at it because it's still a great ending. Lol All the tears were worth it!!

I'm sure I'll come back later to update this once my brain stops screaming. Haha

Every episode just got more and more perfection
Without a doubt my favorite series of this year and one of my favorites forever, I know that it is early in the year to make a statement of this caliber, however, after watching so many series you know when you are in the presence of an anomaly and for me Vincenzo is practically perfect in all departments, besides that in a very subjective way the story totally captured me and I think that's why it took me so long to write this review because once it is done I have to accept that it is really over.

To start the story, wow and what a story, there was literally not a single chapter that did not make me nervous and excited about what was happening, in general terms it is the story of an Italian mobster who returns to his country of origin (Korea) to to beat a large corporation, by means that we could not call fair, but deep down it is much more.

One of the themes that the series touches throughout the season is the family, Vincenzo since childhood has survived in the world practically alone, we do not know so much about his life in Italy but we are given to understand that his adoptive family was murdered, so that for many years he depended solely on his intelligence to survive a hostile world (considering that he was not even in his own homeland), in addition to getting involved in the mafia the ties he could develop with other people were increasingly reduced, when he come to Korea, all the walls and schemes that he had built around him were slowly collapsed one by one, in Korea people wanted to be close to him, they supported him and a bond of mutual need was created between them, little by little we experienced how Vincenzo has that need to protect who he loves and how he is going to become fond of all the inhabitants of Plaza Geumga and some other external characters.

Another of the topics widely followed by the series is redemption, something very important is that Vincenzo is an antihero and although we pretend that some of his actions are justified, the reality is that he mostly plays below the legal limits, when you have a character like this, generally there are two paths that can be followed: the total redemption of the character, most of which end with his death in a great act of sacrifice for a just cause; or on the contrary, the total submersion in moral decay, where most of the character breaks those self-imposed rules that connected him to his humanity; Vincenzo on the other hand chooses a third path, what if you sink them a little more and at the same time give him redemption? In such a way that towards the end the character continues to maintain his balance between justice and decadence and continues to be an Antihero however, this antihero is not the same as we had at the beginning, there is an evolution, a development and a series of decisions that transform the world of the character and that also transform his environment.

The series takes that path and does it in a masterful way, the great thesis of this moment is in the last conversation that Vincenzo has with the older monk Jeok Ha, in the end Vincenzo cannot redeem everything he has done, his impact on him world is undeniable, however his fight against cruelty is also there, and he will forever have to live with the weight of his decisions and the most interesting thing is that he does, genuinely his actions weigh on him, he is full of guilt and These actions are reflected in the type of person he is, it seems that this point is obvious, but no, there are an absurd amount of stories that give us characters ""with complex pasts"" but at the time of the hour they are just anecdotes the impact they have on the lives of the characters.

I will not deny that initially I believed that the only way to conclude the series was with the death of Vincenzo, however the ending they decided for the series seems to me the most acceptable of all, it is not a happy ending, it is not even an ending, everything that happened in the series was one more event in his life and although he changed it in many ways, he still has a path to follow and he will still have to continue living with everything he did and with everything he caused, maybe one day I even have to face the consequences, we don't know.

The villain of this series is another of his great successes, it is true that by the end of the series it is more or less obvious that he pales in front of Vincenzo (not only because the latter is too intelligent but also because he is a mobster made and right and knows how to play his game), but regardless of that, Jang Junwoo is a very well built villain we know what it takes to understand his way of thinking, his lack of compassion and his purposes, for him everything is initially a fun game, but little by little we see how his mental state degenerates more and more as the plot progresses, not only is he intelligent, he is captivating, he is attractive, he is manipulative and terrifying in many moments, it is easily understand because he is at the top at the beginning of the game, when he understands that his capabilities are below those of Vincenzo is when he begins to fall apart and stops being fun, he was not afraid of dying before a Vincenzo that he considers an equal rival, but when he sees himself inferior he begins to fear, not so much of the act of death itself, but of the fact that this implies that he is inferior, that is his true fear.

Choi Myung-hee is the other side of the evil in the series, on the one hand we have Jang Junwoo who as I said is charming and likes to play from the shadows and on the other hand her, her rhythm of play is not to be pleasant, she does not seek to convince anyone, she is a terrible person from the front, everyone who lives with her directly or indirectly knows it and that is why they become the perfect companions and at no time their loyalty wavers, their interest although of course it has monetary connotations, they always go hand in hand with obtaining power and abusing it directly by causing others to suffer. In addition, the relationship of the antagonists with the protagonists, especially with Vincenzo, seems to me, simply great, how they face directly, how they use political and judicial strategies, the relationship between the situation they are living and who they are as individuals really feels.

The rest of the characters also give for an analysis each one, but I will try to make it concise, all the secondary characters from those who live in Geumga square, to Jang Hanseo and Jo Youn Woon are the best I have seen in a never series, each and every one of them has depth and evolution throughout the series, and although it is ""a deux-machina"" that everything is so damn talented, it is justified by the tone of the series since we must remember that it is It is about a black comedy (the fact that the genre of the series is black comedy and drama is another success in itself since it allows the inclusion of more fanciful elements in the series that would not otherwise be organic), regardless of it And despite having so many characters and things happening at the same time, the series gives each of the characters time on the screen and not only that but it makes them iconic, they all have high moments of drama, they all have great dialogues and well constructed, everything is relevant in the story that is being told and that is the best that a series can do, create empathy between the characters and the viewer (not only with the protagonists) because in this way everything that is happening interests you and the dive is deeper.

I have to highlight here Lee Cheol Wook, Ahn Ki Seok, Park Seok Do and Nam Joo Sung as characters, each one conquered me in different ways at different times in the series and their relationship with the protagonist is so good that in the final chapter they had me trembling with concern that something would happen to them.

But definitely the secondary character that takes all the palms is Jang Hanseo, as he is the most evolving character of all, it is true that much of the series is presented as a single puppet under the orders of his brother who is not very intelligent to say, but when you start to analyze the whole picture, this character becomes more and more profound, let's start with the fact that he has lived his entire life tormented by a psychopath who also killed his father, even so I think that by moments and not explicitly it can be understood that a certain level in some twisted way ""loves his brother"", he has lived under Jungwoo's shadow always and this has prevented him from living a life that allows him to develop in any way to having him always tied up, with Vincenzo and his group is the first time that he is required to be more and he does it, we see him not only being a genuinely good and loyal person, but also that we see his capacities to be a good leader, everything potential that he had not been allowed to exploit was developing little by little, his need for affection is clear, to have a real family, a real brother and in Vincenzo he finds that bond to the point that he sacrifices his life for him, he is a character that one hundred percent obtains his redemption (I still suffer it).

We talked about ""romance"" in the series and of course Hong Cha-young, I really liked the decision to leave the romantic bond a little background in the story, mainly because too much was already happening for the characters to have time to worry for this reason, even so the link is there and you can see it in each gesture, look, in their genuine concern for each other, there are many romantic series that scream at you with words that the main characters love each other but their actions never reflect it, in this series we have the opposite, we know what you feel through the subtlety and beauty of their interactions, but just like them, the public realizes that it is not the time to get romantic. Honh Cha-young is a female character who seems to me simply spectacular, she is not the typical good-natured protagonist who lives only for the main male character, no, she is an intelligent, ambitious woman, she is good yes, but not completely like the vast majority in the series exists more in a range of grays, is brave and can face battles without the help of Vincenzo and even in many moments it is she who protects him, in addition, little by little her consciousness as a lawyer changes, partly if because of his suffering from losing his father, but also because as a person he feels better when he defends the weakest through the law, even when he knows that he has to say goodbye to Vincenzo despite his feelings for him, he takes it with bravery and is facing it. And the moments of madness and evil of her are simply amazing, what a good character.

The performances, Song Joong Ki is not a new actor for me but I must say that it was with this performance that he won all my heart, the series is his, all the characters are excellent but at no time do you forget that the series is Vincenzo always, his work is spectacular, all the looks, their emotions, their anger, their happiness, each moment is iconic and remains engraved very deep in your mind; and I have to acknowledge all the scenes with her mother it is sublime, you feel that duality between the genuine love of a child and the resentment of having been abandoned and the cathartic moment when she can finally forgive her, I remember it and tears come to my eyes and sorry but Italian had never seemed such a sexy language to me until this series, you can see all the work behind it and how committed the actor was at all times; I must also say that in all the performances it is felt that they were really enjoying doing the series. Jeon Yeo Bin, also does a spectacular job, I think he achieves a great balance of duality between the madness and the seriousness of his character, much of the character's suffering has to be kept in the dark because he is facing a great enemy, however in his gestures, glances and the longing in his gaze you gradually realize that he is more than what is shown on the surface and that can only be achieved when he has a first-rate actor. Ok Taec Yeon, ufff ... I really love this man, I don't know what else to say, he was bad with desire and despicable, but even so I felt slightly bad when his character suffered, all the cynicism, madness and mental decay that he had what to achieve with his character, it was simply spectacular, honestly, he was for me the great surprise of the series and I just want to see more of him, thank you, just thank you for giving us this character and every time his eyes got teary with anger, I just wanted to take all those moments and immortalize them for posterity.

All the other actors did a spectacular job, I can't talk about all of them because in itself this is already very long, but, it is more than obvious how committed and the love they felt for the project itself each of the characters, there is not a person in this series who does not believe that they gave the performance of their life and that is certainly something that I do not think I have the fortune to witness again. Respect.

The music is very good, the use of classical Italian music combined with pop or romantic Korean music, they are geniuses, one not might think that will work so well, but it does and it is simply a visual and aural spectacle.

The production work, I am deeply grateful that they made the decision that the series will be shown seriously raw, we do not see use of extremely fake blood as it happens in many Asian productions or the action happens out of focus, no, no, here the blood is seen realistic and the action is put in front of you, regardless of whether it implies violence, torture and even death, the characters are cruel at times and the series does not stop to show you this, leaving this aside, the series is beautiful each scene is built to be a work of art and each frame could easily be you new screen saver and that special effects, wonderful.

I could not add anything more to this review, which more than review it is a compilation of praise for Vincenzo, but really I found a spectacular series and I recommend it to everyone, just want more series with that quality and wonderful characters to be produced, Korea never ceases to amaze me when I think I have reached the epitome, it always has more to offer me, it will take a while to get over this series, thank you, thank you for Vincenzo.

I miss you, Col Salada.

Bravo
Note: if you cannot tolerate an antihero and prefer justice the legal way, this drama and this review aren’t for you. Watch a regular legal drama instead.

I was a little worried before I started watching Vincenzo. I wasn’t sure if I’d like the drama but, I don’t regret watching it. Every second of the drama is entertaining. This drama is a solid 10/10

Vincenzo is a very well planned, written and executed drama with brilliant actors and great cinematography. Some parts of the story are predictable but it doesn’t take away from the drama. In my opinion It’s like a drama that needed a theatrical release, some of the scenes were so intense they’d give you the feels. Vincenzo strikes the right balance between comedy, action, drama and a tad bit romance. All the characters in the drama play and important role in pushing the plot forward. This drama does leave you longing for more but in the actual plot itself there really aren’t any loose ends that call for a season 2. But somehow I’m hoping for a spin-off to address some parts of the story that we’re still curious about.

About the plot itself I’m just gonna say that Vincenzo Cassano is a smart mafia consigliere ??and his attacks on the villains are ingenuity. He’s not perfect and does not always outsmart the villains but most of the time he does and this isn’t entirely because he is extremely smart, it might simply be because he has encountered worse villains being in the mafia that the Babo and Wusang lawyers might just feel like a few drops in the ocean. Vincenzo tackles Babel and judicial corruption his own way making him a sympathetic criminal antihero.
What I like the most about this drama is that they didn’t make that age old twist in the drama where Vincenzo suddenly turns out to be an intelligence officer. He was evil and continues to be evil.
SPOILER- ....................neither did he have a very big heart to share the gold with all the plaza tenants just because they helped him as one would’ve expected............

About the actors, before Vincenzo I had only seen Song Joong Ki in A werewolf boy and I knew the guy was talented. He didn’t have a single dialogue in that movie yet his expressions and body language spoke volumes. I think he’s done a good job as Vincenzo. I want to watch more of his dramas. I’ve never seen any projects of Jeon Yeo-Been before but her acting skills are good too and very natural. I also have to add this she’s gorgeous. Ok Taecyeon’s acting skills are on point. He’s one of those idol actors who can really act and does a lot of justice to his roles. Be it innocence, frustration, anger or pain he portrays it perfectly especially with that look in his eyes. All in all I think all the cast members have done a fabulous job the main characters, the villains and the supporting cast.

Also I do like the stopped time and Un diavolo scaccia l′altro instrumental osts, and Adrenaline especially the English version.

Lastly it’s kdrama land don’t put too much thought to into it and bring down the drama just because it may not be the most realistic because most kdramas aren’t. The drama has it’s flaws but it’s imperfectly perfect. I agree this drama may not be for everyone but those whose ideologies align with the concept of the drama are gonna love it. It’s not that frustrating fight against injustice and corruption where there’s so much to lose for 3 quarters of the drama and then one big win. Just sit back and enjoy this one like a refreshing soda. Cheers!

A FUNNY, ENJOYABLE ACTION DRAMA
overall, i really enjoyed the drama. it has AMAZING casts, seriously like how can the director get those actors and actresses in a single production. they must cost a lot sobsob hahahah. the story is a bit mess for me because the main characters are villain who is trying to seek for justice but in an injustice way (?) idk how to put the words together. but the thing is it is enjoyable and fun to watch because the characters in this drama are all cracked HAHAHAHHA i had a lot of laugh. ohh not to mention VINCENZO is really cool, a mafia who has a good heart lollll. anyways, it is a really good drama eventhough i cannot find any good lesson for life from it hahahha but it's an okay for me. yes, it's a worth watching.

If you loved Chief Kim, you will love this (as long as you are fine watching something more violent)
When I first heard of this drama and say the trailer, I was a bit confused. The trailer has a tonal whiplash to it that made it seem like an uneven drama. But in reality, the drama was well-balanced, while it did go dark for certain scenes. The tone of it was well-balanced and I rarely found it off-putting when it moved from comedy to dramatic to violent.

The plot of this drama is very similar to Chief Kim. You've got similar character archetypes, a main character who can be kinda crazy, and corporate villains. But there are unique aspects to this drama, such as the flair some of the characters have and how violence and murder are much more prevalent. Also it doesn't really have a mystery element that Chief Kim had with its plot, with this drama being more about the heroes and villains clashing. Any mystery set up usually gets solved really quickly as it pushes the plot forward. With that, there are some really predictable elements. The end of the episodes become somewhat predictable, even though its clearly designed to be suspenseful and keep you on the edge of your seat. It just gets a bit tiring by the later episodes.

The biggest detractor in this drama is it doesn't have an addictive soundtrack like Chief Kim or a drama like Stranger. It has some good tracks but it would have been really elevated with a strong hero's theme. But the fact that the music is the biggest detractor says how good the rest of the show is. I wasn't too impressed with the fiery priest but this drama is the worthy successor to Chief Kim.

Has its flaws, but still brilliant
(spoilers)
There's so much to love about Vincenzo: the acting, the killer music, the comedic moments interspersed with intense drama, the action scenes, the contemplation on good vs evil and the nature of justice. Song Joong Ki is at his peak in this drama, making the titular character shine in all his complexity and moral ambiguity. He makes the show what it is and continues to prove that he is a force to be reckoned with on the screen. Jeon Yeo Bin was a new face to me, but I was in love with her within five minutes of meeting her. She's unlike any FL I've seen in a Kdrama to date, and Jeon Yeo Bin masterfully captures her playfulness, her deep determination, and her messy morals. Taecyeon was a brilliant villain, even if his star started to fade a bit toward the end, and Kwak Dong Yeon (another new name to me) stole every scene he was in with his fantastic acting and the complexity he brought to what could have been a very forgettable role as the younger Jang brother.
I do feel that the writers were a bit too generous with Vincenzo. A tight plot and story is all about balancing characters' wins and losses, and quite frankly Vincenzo got a few too many wins. Song Joong Ki did a stunning job with the script, but there was certainly room in the second half of the show for more setbacks, more give and take between Vincenzo and Jang Han Seok. When the protagonist is constantly outsmarting and outmaneuvering the supposedly terrifying, psychopathic villain, it's easy to get comfortable and lose some of the momentum built early on. Jang Han Seok and Choi Myung Hee, both incredibly compelling villains early on, were readily admitting they were no match for Vincenzo well before the end of the show, and failed to anticipate any of Vincenzo's moves or even have much of a plan of their own beyond reacting to whatever he threw at them. I wanted to see Vincenzo really, truly threatened, to see him defeat a powerful villain after a grueling and satisfying battle, but instead, in his own words, he was the cat and Jang Han Seok/Choi Myung Hee were the mice. (For example, for seemingly no other purpose than pissing Vincenzo off, they murder his mother, and are then shocked when he of course retaliates immediately and brutally? How did that murder fit into their larger plans? Why do it at that moment?)
I have other little qualms with the story of course, but overall this was an addictive, intense, entertaining drama that I would definitely recommend for Song Joong Ki and Jeon Yeo Bin alone. If you're looking for morally gray characters who fight evil with evil, or if you just want a fun, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat story, this is a must-see.

The best quality drama ever watched. Smartest drama ever.
Perfect Cast , musics were sooo good.... The story was great.... Everything is okay... This drama makes me rewatch it unlimited times... But something feels cringy... At ep18 The hand fight scenes were a little cringy... I mean a group of gangs vs Mr Cassano alone... And mr cassano still wins the fight.... That felt so cringy... I know mr cassano didnt fight lonely at all , the tenants fought with the gangs also , and that scene was so cringy... I think they could've used some italian gangs of vincenzo instead of using the tenants , that wouldve added more fire in it ??, it could make sense too , because at that episode , they talked about Italy.... But im not saying the tenants fights were bad.... It was great too... But it couldve improved a little bit.....



The dialouges were the best of this drama , they were so satisfying and savage...
The sound effects of guns and fight scenes were also awesome....
Must watch drama! Even it makes you feel like ""ah I wish I was a mafia"" xD

Thanks for a great drama like this ?

Vicenzo - A rare drama which deserves 10/10
This is the first time i am posting a review. I couldnt help but write one after i finished watching Vincenzo. I have only one word to describe this drama - MINDBLOWING!!
The drama is a blend of everything - action , suspense , comedy , tragedy , romance, u name it. They are all well balanced and complement each other perfectly.

STORY -
The storyline is in such a way that it keeps us hooked to the last second. Its filled with unexpected friendships and betrayals. Unlike many other dramas, u will never get bored while watching it. It never once dragged. This is one of the biggest advantages of this drama.
The drama clearly shows us the real way of the world. It shows us how humans are greedy, selfish, corrupt and manipulative. It shows us the fragility of our laws and justice. It gives us the idea that only evil can eradicate evil.
But even when portraying such serious issues, it never became too dark or too boring thanks to the hilarious situations in between. The balance among them was just perfect.

ACTING/CAST -
Every character in this drama was worth remembering, even the smallest of the roles. Each and everyone did their best.
The chemistry btw Song Joon Ki and Jeon Yeo Been was so gud that it easily grow on u. Even though romance is not the main genre of this drama, u cant help but fall in love with this couple. The character development was so smooth - it was neither fast nor slow. Whether it was as friends, partners or lovers, they were perfect for each other.( And lets admit it, SJK with a gun- WOW?)
Some special mentions:
○ Guemga family- Everyone in the Guemga plaza was unique and full of surprises. They are one of the main reasons for the success of this drama.
○ Jang Han Seo - Started as an enemy, ended as a brother. U cant help but sympathise with this character. Kwok Dong Yeon did a great job in playing this character.
○ Inzaghi - Even though its just a bird , it played an irreplaceable character in this drama. The drama would have been incomplete without it.

MUSIC -
This drama has a great collection of music. Every ost was just perfect for the scenes. The fusion of Italian music was catchy and the cherry on top for this drama.

REWATCH -
Vincenzo is the kind of drama that u cant get enough of. U cant help but rewatch it again!! Its just an EPIC drama❤

Song Joong Ki rocks but the rest is meeh
I used to be a cereal binger, thinking there is no drama I can not binge until I met Vincenzo who truly made me question my identity as a full on die hard binger. At first I thought there was something wrong with me, had I hit a slump? Having worked really hard to avoid spoilers I actually managed to be surprised by some of the twits so I could not blame spoilers for this feeling. Was it the length of the episodens? No not really, I have seen worse, so how come I could not manage to binge this drama that I had been anticipating for months? I felt conflicted since I at least thought I was enjoying the drama and did not think it was bad.

I have given this allot of thought (okej not allot but some thought) and come up with several explanations:

1. It did not live up to the hype.
2. Some parts are actually boring
3. Some of the acting is pretty mediocre
4. It has several annoying characters, who just prolong the episodes without actually adding anything.
5.The characters that are annoying most of time have each moments that are brilliant resulting in confusion, do I like this character or do I wish it gone...
All of this makes it it tiering to watch.

So what did I like about this drama enough to give it an 8?

Well
1.Song Joong Ki character
2.Song Joong Ki, acting
3. Soong Joong Ki, styling
4. The pigeon
5. Song Joong Kis interaction with the pigeon
Where all grat!!!
6. The main story is actually pretty good it is just dragged out a bit to long but it is actually really interesting.
7.The cinematography is utterly gorgeous.
8.Song Joong Ki with a flower in his hair
9. Song Joong Ki with on a white horse
10. Song Joong Ki with a polo shirt
11. Amazing explosions!
12. Interesting ways to kill people
13. Fire and lighters
14. Great use of phones and umbrellas
15. Truck of doom, with or without a make over
16. Some parts where actually funny
17. Character development, every singel character changed in some way or another not bad for a drama with ALLOT of characters

So some parts where great, some part where bad and some part where just meeh... Actually not bad to incorporate all this in to one drama (a very long drama). So to be honest it didn't get me up on my toes, it didn't make me cry it did not really make me feel any thing else than love for Song Joong Ki so in short it was simply meeh

A very mixed opinion and review
I am a Lil biased about Song Joong ki. No doubt his acting is fabulous, but even though his Italian accent seemed very forced, for obvious reasons, I kind of blindsided it.
OK, coming to the build-up of the drama, the first 4 episodes were frankly not able to capture my attention. If the male lead was somebody else, I would have probably left the drama after the 4th episode. The actual hype comes after the 5th or 6th episode when the real fight begins. The FL's acting seems very very forced, the laughs, the normal dialogue delivery, everything rather seems very forced to me. I understand she has a rather bold role, but she could have delivered it more naturally. It felt as if she was trying very hard, but she just couldn't match up to what the actual role needed.
Next, I feel they revealed the real owner of Babel a little too early, they could have kept us hooked on and on a cliffhanger for a tad bit longer to capture our attention. Ok Taecyeon's acting was just magnificent. He made the psychopath role seem so darn natural. It is a role that can be easily done very poorly, but I think he did a fabulous job.
My favourite part of the show was how by the end all the tenants of Geumga Plaza and Vincenzo and team became one big family. They made the viewers feel as if they were part of the family. Secondly, the episodes after 13 were very interesting. That is when they caught up to the interest of the viewers. They ended on very sensitive points where it would leave us wondering what would happen next.
The ending was absolutely unpredictable, and that was the BEST part about the show. It's been a long since I saw a different ending in a long time. The way they shifted the gold was just BIG BRAIN ENERGY
Overall, the costumes, suspense bg music, and other props addition were very well done. I wouldn't mind re-watching this show solely because of SJK, but for somebody who isn't attached to any of the leads, it's is probably a one time watch. However, I would highly recommend watching it at least once.

Great, but could have been even greater!
I really enjoyed Vincenzo, though I could have liked it even more if they had reduced the amount of comedy, as I think Vincenzo would have worked even better as a pure-crime/action focused drama. Don't get me wrong, the comedy in the drama was funny, and I did chuckle many times, but it got to the point where serious parts of the story would just finish and then all of a sudden the drama is trying to make me chuckle with another piece of comedy.

Great cast, great acting, addictive OST, rewatch value is perhaps a little low but the episodes are roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes each - which for me anyways is long. 20 episodes was probably the correct amount of episodes this story needed for it to reach it's full potential.

It's always a good sign when I am begging to binge-watch a series like I have done for this drama. Highly recommend.

Drama flow Meh - wow
Okay so as I’m a big fan of comedy - crime - action - thriller (this is not a romantic drama by the way if that’s what you were expecting) I thought I’ll watch it. To be honest this drama is very similar to The fiery priest, which I loved a lot.

My experience throughout the whole drama -

I had big expectations when I started but as I was watching episode one - five a big disappointment came out. Unfunny comedy, over dramatic characters with no attachment, boring plot is all I could say.

But, just like “The fiery priest” things got pretty interesting when an important character died and people around them got a slight character development. I was hooked pretty much and my overall rating went from 5.5 - 9 real quick.

Story (8.5/10)

The drama itself revolves around a bittersweet revenge and their ideology of justice. I loved the concept and will watch any similar dramas. The ending was satisfying as the character got exactly what they deserved. They tried to play it as realistic as possible.

Acting (9/10)

First of all I would like to talk about SJK. His acting, visuals, actions were so satisfying! OT perfectly played a playful psychotic killer. JYB’s over dramatic character was super fun to watch. There were a few moments where I could relate to her. After episode 5 all characters from plaza were so much better and I felt a strong emotional attachment to all of them. Loved the whole cast!

Music (9.5/10)

The osts and soundtracks were pretty different from usual dramas. I would say they were perfectly synced and beautiful.

Rewatch value (10/10)

I would love to watch it again.

Overall (9.0/10)

So, if you’re on episode 1-5 and thinking about dropping it, DONT. The drama gets 0 to 100 pretty quick and you’ll love it. There was a slight romance but not enough to influence the plotline. The main part is thriller - crime - revenge and if you love intense stuff, give it a go.

Persevere, people.
I know a lot of people come to this section to evaluate if it's worth it watching based on other's opinions. So I'm gonna give my honest opinion but regardless of that, I think everyone should try to watch at least the first episode, and ideally til the fourth. I'm saying this because I wasn't that excited until episode 4. Also, I'm terrible in giving ratings, so don't trust my grades, just read this. I'll try not to spoil anything.

So let's go.

First, the Story: I'm ""relatively"" new to the kdrama world, it has been almost a year since I started and even though I've watched over 50 dramas so far, it's mostly from 2016 to 2020, so I haven't watched a lot of classics but based on my experience, this ""mafia"" related, coming from another country, being essentially and unapologetic on the other side of the law is something new to me. The fact is that Vicenzo is someone who did, does and plans to do illegal things, despite being apparently a good person. I started not that excited because the story didn't caught my attention at first. I guess the whole Babel's Pharmaceuticals issue was not thoroughly explained in the beginning, I had a feeling that they just said ""Just know Babel is bad."" because the story begins in the middle of the problem, but things became more clear as the story developed (and I got more interested in it). I was surprised by three characters: a death and two revelations. Perhaps I was surprised because as I was not invested, I didn't pay much attention. So even though the first three episodes weren't THAT thrilling, a got really excited in the fourth and I have a really good feeling about it. I know a lot of people are not interested in romance in a drama like this, but I love romance in any kind of drama, so I'm also expecting a good one in this.

Second, the Cast and Acting: starting with Song Joong Ki (Vicenzo), I personally think he is a great actor overall, haven't watch a lot of dramas with him (kind of dropped Descendants of The Sun, though I plan on finishing), but I just finished Arthdal Chronicles, and his acting was amazing in it, so I expected a good job in Vicenzo and I'm not disappointed. I think he's doing an amazing job, even though I guess the writers will make him to be not as ruthless as the first episode led us to believe. I think he's good in portraying emotions, specially in the court flashback scene, we could really see him struggling inside about his mixed emotions; Now on Jun Yeo Bin (Lawyer Hong Cha Young), I not really into those type off exaggerated and loud characters like she is in the beginning, but I do believe she's slowly maturing. I guess she's trying to be someone she's not due something that will later be explained, and has deep unresolved issues to deal with. As I said, I love romance, so I think her personality contrasts with Vicenzo's, therefore I'm expecting a well developed relationship; I guess the whole building squad are there to provide comedy and lightness to the drama, and I always like this type of groups. Extra opinion: I love the Vicenzo and italian Chef interactions and I'm waiting for more.

Third, Music: I didn't really paid attention, so I'm thinking not remarkable? I did notice some italian/opera thing, which I guess fits. Will pay more attention from now on.

Fourth, Rewatch Value: can't say it yet, I'm not really a ""rewatch"" person, so no opinions on that.

Fifth, Overall: I think it's definitely worth watching, you can ways drop if you don't like it. But I would definitely put in the ""worth watching"" category. If you trust me and persevere till at least the fourth episode (the best for me so far), I think you won't regret it.

Ps.: I loved the pandemic references, they obviously are not in a pandemic (they just occasionally use masks to hide their faces), but it was mentioned playfully social distancing, quarantine and they checked temperature for a party. I liked that.

So bad
It started out ok, but the story got too confusing. The Vincenzo character is inconsistent. He goes from being intense and serious 1 second and then silly the next second. It doesn’t fit. The secondary characters/actors have no chemistry, characters are silly/stupid, Hong Cha young character is so annoying. They all try too hard to be funny but it comes off as stupid and annoying. I know that some silly scenes are expected in Korean dramas but these ones are too much! Couldn’t even finish 2nd episode. Skip it!!

Not what I expected but still entertaining
THE TONE :

I expected a dark comedy. Instead, it was slapstick comedy almost burlesque with many characters and situations exagerated and caricatures of what we usually see in Korean dramas. But it worked for me. Because the drama assumed its tone and made me believe in the characters. I liked the good guys and hated the evil ones. And starting from ep10, when the corpses started to pile, it became even more fun.

THE STORY:

Two axis of narration:

1st: the ML is trying to retrieve a treasure from a vault and he has to get rid of a bunch of weirdoes blocking his path as they are residents of the place where the vault is. They go through different phases which bring them together. I Like how it was developed, the deception, the suspicion, the manipulation, until they learn to trust each other and collaborate to solve their problems.

2nd: the ML is involved in a fight against a conglomerate which does not stop at killing people to achieve its goals. They find the ML on their path and they would do anything to get rid of him. This part was fun because ML mostly kicks their a$$es. It's a comedy first so there is no terrible or long angst.

THE CHARACTERS:

I liked:

- Vincenzo Cassano: Handsome, suave, elegant, but also a man with mafia's principles and totally ruthless when needed. He is smart, thoughtful, rarely outsmarted. He has a great ability to anticipate and keep his cool when facing the evil ones.
- Hong Cha Young: I really had difficulties with her personality, her temper and her antics. But she slowly grew on me. I finally liked her for who she is: a courageous woman and a fun and great sidekick for the ML.
- Jang Han Seo: I had pity for him. He looked lost, a coward, pathetic, trying to find a way... and finally, some kind of redemption. I will not lie, Kwak Dong Yeon is one of my favorite underestimated actors.
- Jo Young Joon: VC's friend from the beginning. The guy is interesting, surprising. he goes from high to low in his relationship with VC.
- Tak Hong Shick: One of the hidden talent among the residents with a nice set of skills.
- Seo Mi Ri: Looks kooky but also another hidden talent. I liked her part.
- I liked most of the residents.

I hated:
- Choi Myung Hee : She had no authority, no real power, no real backer, no nothing. Only her big mouth to mock people and yell at them. She looked like the clerk who wants to please the boss for the paycheck and plays super diligent by having people killed like they are numbers. Her demise was super satisfactory.

- Jang Jun Woo/The Great Evil: Ok Taec Yeon had to play two faces of a same guy and they were too different from each other for me to take him seriously. One was too silly and the other one was too much of a nutcase. When he finally showed himself, he was just a complete psycho acting with outburst of anger. Could not top VC like that...

- Han Seung Hyuk: How can a president of a company accept the criminal behavior of his client? He totally had the ending he deserved.

MUSIC:
OK. nothing special to mention for me.

REWATCH VALUE:
The drama was fun to watch but I don't think I will rewatch entirely as I think it suffers from a flaw : the main villain is too weak compared to the main guy. He is basically a complete nutcase from the very beginning and never evolves. He is just venting his anger trying to get rid of people who make him angry . He meets a huge roadblock named VC and this is the end of him. It would have been better with a fair competition but I guess it would have required a darker tone that the drama did not intend to have.

OVERALL: 9/10 . A good drama! 20eps *120 minutes look long but you are rarely bored. Recommended for its many fun, quirky and savage moments.

Vincezo : An emotional review.
I am literally at lost for words to describe how outstanding and breathtaking this drama was.
But I'll tell you one thing first, that I never thought a drama could be so dark and gritty that the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you hold your breath---and then so genuinely funny and comedic that makes you laugh out loud so much----but then so emotional and hearfelt that it brought tears to your eyes and left you shattered multiple times.
The cast was too,was beyond perfect. Let alone Vincenzo, Hong Cha Young herself blew my mind with her entire role.From being so independent,brave to being so authentic and quirky not giving a single fuck about what others think---it all just screams CONFIDENCE,COMPETENCE and BRILLIANCE....so unapologetically herself,never trying to act cool or be someone she's not---fearless and determined even in grief;I could go on about her forever.She is insanely funny but headstrong,alone but brave and both so quick witted and kindhearted. And her Chemistry with Vincenzo was immaculate to the point of breathtaking---an absolute*chef's kiss*. Also loved how unlike many female leads she didn't end up becoming a a damsel in distress seeing which was so refreshing...rather she fought alongside Vincenzo in their war against injustice and corruptions.Cha young didn't even try to change him rather helped him on the way to stay true to himself. Their little interactions and their mischievous power moves made them the definition of Mafia Soulmates period.
From their friendship to partnership to Cha Young staying by his side despite all his flaws...it melts my heart just to think about it. They didn't need words to express their love and devotion for each other,from the moment Cha young came rushing to the underpass where Vincenzo went alone to fought to when it came to Vincenzo only ever kneeling down so that Han Syeok don't kill her.
They mightn't've fallen head over heels in love at first sight but seeing their gradual friendship and intimacy grow amid the chaos they were going through made it even better.Even their goodbye....God there was not a single tear but the pain they felt in parting with each other was clearly visible in the air between them,from their longing eyes to their p r o m i s e. It was sad but it was hopeful.
And then the tenants of the plaza...Goddd they were soo freaking adorable and all of them literally owns my heart.
And the villains also had their own thing going on that made me sooo intrigued about them despite hating their guts so fiercely.And they end they got,the gritty,violent,poetic death left me shcked and satisfied.
And now, the plot!!! It was beyond my wildest dream that how gripping and thrilling the plot was-how balanced with all and every character in the show-from their unexpected bondings to their unexpected betrayals.

Everything was planned so insanely perfectly with absolutely no detectable plot holes, especially considering the TWISTS and TURNS that had been threaded so intricately into the whole storyline that had me gasping uncountable times.
The production, the cinematography, the locations were all another level of charming.

And finally,Vincezo Cassano----my most favourite anti hero of all time!!!
He is simply incomparable---to put it mildly.And despite Vincezo comitting many sins,I loved they(the writers) didn't give him an unrealistic redemption arc but rather explored his strength, his tactics and his experience to fight ruthlessly Against those who deserved it and fight For those who needed it.
He was complex and cunning but also caring and kind.And he stayed a man of his words until the very end...Little things made Vincenzo even more iconic; from his pet pigeon Inzhangi to him cursing in ltalian whenever he got furious to him playing along with Cha young's craziness to his bromance with Han Syeok goddd it was all so adorable.
All in all it was incredibly entertaining as it was meaningful and heartfelt. All in all a poignant speculation on the classic tale of good vs evil, friendship, family, and justice.

Great
I didn't feel that vincenzo was boring. I felt that its too much of violence and I really don't appreciate Vincenzo's approach. This drama is somewhat similar to The fiery priest(100% recommended and its so funny) but the fiery priest did a good job with the ending and how the corrupt people are sent to prison. The villain is really good! The actor nailed it. My favorite thing about this drama is the funny side characters and team work

Outstanding in all forms
Honestly, there isn't much to say about this show other than it's beyond amazing. The cast, plot, cinematography, everything.
I wasn't ever one to watch a drama that was crime based. Because they were all following the same plot and you never got to be fully satisfied with the way the criminals were punished. I also hate when a show stays super serious the whole time.
Vincenzo really had it all. Although the ending was good on most fronts, he deserved better. (once you watch the show you'll know who I'm talking about) I choose to believe he is on the island. My heart hurts less.
I highly recommend this drama. :)

EPIC HOTNESS..EPIC ACTING.. EPIC DRAMA
EPIC..... SONG JOONGKI IS SOOOO HOTTTT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just one epi down..... The drama has made me sooooo dammmm thrilled..... The premier was sooo good!!!!!
Sjk is so amazing... His acting, his nuances, his demeanor, his Italian, his action and his handsomeness...... He just lits up the whole screen the moment he enters.
Yeo bin is as amazing with her character and her role of a lawyer ..she is just soo badass and her expressions and her fierce attitude won me over...... She really made me fall for her.....( all those saying she isnt acting well or her character is too much or she is struggling....actually NO SHE IS NOT....her character is written that way and she is brilliantly performing it......i love her and there are many people like that in real life...she is doing a great job...her potrayal is very authentic and real)
And taec.... He is soo cute and bubbly...he really suits the role and ofc his Cheekiness is too cute to ignore.....and him in the sec epi...was just soo damm hilarious and cuteeeeeee
All in all the cast is just fantastic..... Really looking forward to the villains now and their antics! !
The script is well written.... The direction is just as amazing..... The cinematography especially the scenes in Italy were so beautiful.....and a whole ost in Italian is cherry on the cake!!

Also it is ofc a mafia drama... But it isn't about only action and drugs and gangs... Not at all. ...It's more of a dark comedy.... And the supporting characters are very hilarious....infact sjk has some amazing comic scenes....

Really can't wait to watch more. .. (How will I even survive a whole week waiting for it😣😣)
This is a must watch drama..... Sjk makes u fall for him literally way too much for u to have any scope of recovery left.... And ofc even him swearing in Italian is like music to my ears!!!
Go for this drama... It is totally worth it....
Infact i am literally rewinding every single scene again and again....its just soo amazing!!!
I am a die hard sjk fan....but ofc i def would not have watched it if it wasnt worth it....but it STANDS tall on all my expectations......
Love it

Unexpectedly Refreshing -- Enjoyable Ride
Vincenzo is not what I expected it to be; I'm not even sure what I expected, but when one hears Italy and the mafia, one immediately sets an expectation of mayhem, drugs, and murder. Vincenzo is nothing of the sort, well, at least not yet. It's crazily witty, entertaining, and thrilling all at the same time. I am refreshingly pleased by the writing style, the acting, and the directing. Vincenzo is everything it was hyped up to be and more.

I thought Vincenzo in Italy was brilliant; everything about it was sexy and beautiful, from the people to the buildings but most of all, Song Joong Ki speaking Italian. His subtle yet cutthroat demeanor is enjoyable to watch. But Vincenzo in Korea is where I fell in love with the drama, and the man, especially G Plaza. I can tell the plaza and its quirkily insane tenants (I love them all, even the annoying daughter) will be my favorite place/scenes of this drama. There is a lot of story behind Vincenzo, be it his childhood to what drives him at present, it will all be worth exploring.

Song Joong Ki is fantastic in his role; the last drama I saw him in was in 2016, Descendants of the Sun. It sure is good to have him back. It's also good to see the fine Ok Taec Yeon, the enormously talented Yoo Jae Myung. Despite not being too familiar with Jun Yeo Bin and slightly turned off by her unscrupulousness, I can tell I'm going to like her. I enjoyed her affectionate banter with her father, played by Yoo Jae Young.

Soulless and painful to watch
I had such high expectations going into this drama considering its high rating, but sadly I am so disappointed. Watching the first episode made me give up on this drama and I usually don't give up on episodic content. It feels like there's no plot and this whole drama is just filler content to be honest. The characters are mostly unbearable and difficult to connect with (not just because of their nature). I think the worst part is the humor and the sound effects – they feel incredibly forced, there's no natural comedic value in the situations. This drama is visually perfect, but it has no heart. It's like it was targeted at teens due to the choice of the actors. I can't believe this mess has such a high rating. It feels like this drama is set in an alternate drama world where anything is possible, but in reality the main male lead wouldn't even live past episode 1.

Vincenzo is Okay for NOW...
Vincenzo is definitely fiery priest 2.0 as it's by the same writer and if you happen to love fiery priest you will certainly enjoy Vincenzo. The plot is quite similar, by the end of episode 1, I already knew FL's dad was going to die and that would be the beginning of a bloody revenge and that's what happened. Show can definitely feel predictable at times.

I've also seen few complaints about the FL regarding her overacting but I like her, I find her fun ( I love my FL crazy and flawed) even though it might seem like she is trying to do an impression of Honey Lee's character in fiery priest. I wish she would make this character her own and tbh she kinda toned down in episode 4 and we got to see a smart and perceptive side of her. I feel like she will become very useful to Vincenzo and I can't wait to see some character development for both our leads. Let's hope they stay badasses till the end.

Episode 4 was definitely the better episode, and we finally got the reveal about the Big BAD and I've a few reserves about Taecyon playing the villain, will he be able to pull off this kind of roles ? I don't know, I find his acting average at best most of the times but we will see how things go.

I hope Vincenzo will have more surprises in store for us and will manage to keep us on our toes. As of now, there is nothing groundbreaking but I am willing to go along the ride with an open mind also it doesn't hurt that Song Joong Ki is hot AF with a gun.

Unbelievable plot
Do they need to have it set in Italy in the beginning? It was barely 15 min. It could be in S Korea and it would've been fine. I might be the odd one out here but I don't think SJK is right for this role. His appearance is a bit too effeminate to be playing such a tough guy character and it's just not believable. Some scenes are quite cringed for me and I just don't know how I will continue. I also don't like the comedic plot, rather it be more of a serious drama. I'm not feeling any chemistry so far and everything is messy. I hope it gets better.

AMAZING DRAMA. NICE COMEBACK
THIS DRAMA HAS ALL THE NEEDS. ONLY THING I AM AFRAID IS IF THE VIOLANCE WILL BE LESS IN UPCOMING EPISODES. IT WILL AFFECT ITS RATING. BUT IF THE ACTION INTENSITY ARE MORE THAN IT WILL BE DRAMA OF THE YEAR I THINK. NICE COMEBACK AFTER ALL THE DIVORCE SCANDAL. I AM HAPPY HE DEALT IT WITH PAITIANCE. GOOD LUCK IN THE FUTURE.....................................................................................................................................................................................................

Overrated
I find it cringy everytime he acts Italian also damn did he get old, his face looks like he is melting i wish they didn't do close ups. The only good thing about this is the directing and ost especially solar adrenaline other than that the chemistry people in the comment section bashing dots when this doesn't hold a candle to it even if you like this you don't really have to compare especially bashing song hye kyo acting that is far superior than any othese c level actresses and actors. I can see that kdramas are getting more westernized which is sad if I wanted to see American shows I would just do that but I don't they are trash so I hope they keep what made kdrama good in the first place

Its not bad..
so, its really not a bad drama. I think its a cool idea and honestly song joong ki's visuals in this drama are *chefs kiss*. i did not understand why in the beginning they showed sjk's character as some tough guy from the mafia and then that all changes when he gets to Korea though. also the female lead kind of gets on my nerves she's a horrible person and just plain annoying.

I really wish this drama wasn't a comedy. I mean its not bad and its actually the kind of fun but (this is my personal preference) for a drama with this plot I would prefer for it to be more serious and purely crime. If it was not for sjk i would probably drop this drama because of it. putting aside that i would prefer purely crime. the characters are enjoyable and i am interested to see how the story progresses. i think this drama is easier to get through if you like sjk and know what to expect when you watch it. if it really bothers you that much like others based on the first 2 episodes then it is better to just drop it.

CAN I JUST SAY WOW
I just finished the first episode and I am completely HOOKED!! From the way it was directed, the visuals and cast, it was amazing. Song Joong-Ki made a great comeback in this drama. So far I have to say it’s a must watch!

From the first 5 minutes of the episode, I said damn this is serious stuff. It definitely has some comedy to it!! Had me laughing! Can’t wait to see what else is in store. This is one of those dramas where you want no one to bother you and to have a snack ready so you’re set for the next hour!

Btw, it doesn’t hurt that Song Joong-Ki looks absolutely AMAZING!!

favolosa dramma
I think this one is going to be my Start Up drama of 2021. It's the sneaky drama that hits you while you're watching it and you say, this is pretty damn good?! It's original and not boring at all and it's funny like heck. The acting is great of course by SJK- a seasoned actor and probably someone who loves challenges. His Italian is pretty amazing. And this $18 million budget spent on this series by Studio Dragon and Netflix is well spent on sets, cinematography, wardrobe etc, Maybe the OST will be better as we move forward. I am worried about the FL lead tho. She seems to over act her role. This story is super original and I think the momentum it's built in just one episode so far is fantastic. I have never laughed and been on the edge of my seat at the very same time. Watch this please.

savage cool
down to fourth episode, we found surprises in each turn. However each character here is lived up their savage cool side to camouflaged their true self...

The Good is trying to be mean and ferocious. The Bad is acting up their jester. So, there are no single weak moments. Both side is able to threw banter without actually hitting them. Suddenly, surprise surprise tragic happen. Explosive retaliation. Grand entrance. No time for grieves for the taken soul.

It gets interesting all the way up or down narratives, however I found it a bit loose hooked.
Are we doing gold heist or not? Are we plotting our avenge blue print? Are we casting heroes? Where are we exactly?
