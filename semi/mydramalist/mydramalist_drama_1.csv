Well played Reply 1988 writers, you psyche-ninjas. Well played.
I'm in a state of emotional mess right now. A pair of eyes are haunting me. So bear with me if this review turns out to be nothing but series of ramblings. The last 12 weeks (or 13, if we count that one week when it didn't air. but heyyy who is counting. Not me, ever me). Anyway, the last 12 weeks have been one hell of a ride.

The thing about Reply 1988 writers is , they're like the Agatha Christies of their art. We think we know exactly what they are up to but no matter how hard we try, they are always always one step ahead of us. They already know what we THINK we know. Let me give a light example. I spent the first 3 episodes taking their previews seriously. But they always turned out misleading. Then I spent the next 7 episodes dismissing the previews. By 10th I almost didn't watch them. And then dropped the preview of 12th episode and I was like, ""huh. One more misleading preview. I guess we're set for the ending then""

BOY WAS I WRONG.

I'm not sure whether to appreciate the genius of the Reply 1988 writers or be scared of their grasp of the psychology of the human mind. Since I fail to come to a conclusion, I have another meltdown. Whether they are tears of joy or tears of heartbreak, you'll have to watch the drama to know. We all know the writers are capable of both.

For now, Here are 10 things I absolutely loved about this drama (it was hard narrowing them down. I have about 70,000 on my mind right now):

1. Yoo Yeon Seok. Somebody has new permanent crush and that somebody is me

2. Song Hwa. Somebody has a new girl crush and that somebody is me.

3. Woo Joo. Somebody has a new role model and that somebody is me (seriously, this baby was GOALS. ""If she doesn't love me, I won't love her either"". He's more sorted than any of us would ever be).

4. Jung Kung Ho dating his best friend's sister. AGAIN. And potentially everyone knowing about it except for the know-it-all Ik Jun (or wait...)

5. The final 15 minutes of the final episode

6. The OST

7. The anti-climatic climatic ending that turned our world upside down

8. The supporting cast wearing the cape and stealing the show

9. Ik Jun <3

10. The band practice. Yoo Yeon Seok singing.

11. (SPOILER ON THIS ONE) Ik Jun and Song Hwa ending on a cliffhanger because I knew one episode was not enough to bring them together. They have 20 years between them and we want a lot of explanations and flashbacks.

12. The simplicity and the positive tone of the drama.

13. No hospital politics (thank god). Not too much blood.

14. Rich weren't assholes. No stereotyping and no cliches. Just beautiful human stories and emotions.

15. HILARIOUS SCENES

16. Aloha Karaoke scene

17. Jo Jung Seok singing aloha and releasing it

18. Winter garden couple (I mean, people were hyped over them exchanging two words. When has that ever happened in the history of Korean drama LMAO)

19. Yoo Yeon Seok's emotional range and his versatility as an actor (I'm watching Mr Sunshine these days LOL)

20. Seok Hyung restarting the band (no, you did not use them. Now go live your life)

21. Seok Hyung in general.

22. Reply 1988 writers being Psyche-Ninjas

23. Make-up-less Mi Na :)

I know I said 10 points but I never promised. Now time to go cry in a corner and patiently wait for the second season. Also, if season 2 ends up becoming one of the things Corona screws up, I'll turn all Gu Dong Mae). Over and out. Thank you for bearing with me. I held it in well too :')

PS - I might end up adding more points as I remember so bear with me.

I liked it, but I just wasn't a big fan of it. Seeing how high the ratings were, I was expecting a different thing. I guess it has to do with the fact that I needed a heavy-plot type of story but this was more of a slice of life-ish show, which is perfectly fine, don't get me wrong. I just wasn't feeling like 'oh my god, this episode was so exciting, I need to watch the next one right now!'. I was more like 'finished this episode, I'll see the next one tomorrow if I have time'. You get what I mean? It's weird.
Acting was great though, characters and the band itself were soo wholesome! It's nice to take a break from dramas with too many shitty characters. Anyways, as I always say, I base my ratings on overall enjoyment. The show was not the best of the year but it was a comfortable and cozy watch. 7.5.

Slice of Life medical drama with funny moments
Likes: The great ensemble cast and their easy chemistry. The funny moments

Dislikes: It was a bit forgettable.

I usually don't like medical dramas, but this one was easy to watch because of Director Shin Won ho's distinct style of using an ensemble cast and creating a nostalgic vibe with bits of humor. Just like with his previous works in the Reply series and Prison Playbook, there's a sort of subdued tone to his dramas that focuses on community rather than plot.

The ensemble cast was great particularly Jo Jung Suk who again shows that he's capable of great comedic and dramatic acting and Shin Hyun-bin who does such a great job making the aloof expressionless chief resident so likeable. The chemistry between the cast felt so organic that it was fun watching the banter and the friendships play out.

There were plenty of moments that made me laugh, but there were also many moments where I was bored. While I found the drama overall an enjoyable watch, it was also one that was forgettable. I wasn't dying to watch the next episode...more like there was nothing else to watch, but if you enjoy these types of dramas then I think it won't disappoint.

Is it Worth Investing Time in ” Hospital Playlist”?
Yes, I am late to the party with only just having completed screenwriter Lee Woo Jung ( Reply series, Prison Playbook ) ‘s drama “ Hospital Playlist”. However with ”Hospital Playlist 2” now ( at the time of writing) being released on Netflix streaming services , I decided it was a good time to give the critically acclaimed and hit series a go.

Of course“ Hospital Playlist” isn’t without its more nuanced flaws. At times ” Hospital Playlist” struggled to step away from the medical show fusion genre scenario with the mundane setup of high drama, lighthearted comedy, “life vs death” consequences, and not every patient makes it through in order to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. (Additionally this provoked the evident problem of tedious pacing in the show also.) However, there’s a more poignant element similar to Friends in the mix, as the quintet are revealed to have a deep-rooted friendship with one another for more than two decades.

Whilst the first couple of episodes invest time within “ getting to know” our ensemble and present the fairly dynamic performances of our main cast, the following episodes explore an oddly balanced investment into the quintet jamming out in their band during their free time, backstories and the current ups and downs of life at the hospital also.

Arguably one of the major roles to talk about in the drama was the role of Jo Jung Suk as Ik Joon. As a single dad, Ik Joon could have easily been stereotyped as the cliched “ estranged father” or having a “ bitter” relationship with his son Woo Joo (Kim Jun) due to the bitter nature of his divorce from his wife , however, Ik Joon is refreshingly nothing but a kindhearted goofy dad, with a charm that easily wins over even his most stubborn of patients in the hospital . Arguably the potential “ love story” element in consideration to his unrequited feelings for Song Hwa ( without decisive spoilers) may leave viewers a little on edge by the unnecessary setup, however, surprisingly the later decisions of Ik Joon felt surprisingly natural for his character.

Following on from Ik Joon is evidently Jung Kyung Ho as Kim Jun Wan.
Despite his tough shell in front of the trainees and his peers , actor Kyung Ho seemed to pretty much nail Jun Wan’s archetype as the “ grizzly bear with a marshmallow heart”. Jun Wan is a harsh teacher at times, but a brilliant cardiothoracic surgeon and truly cares for his patients ( even if it means making tough calls). In one particularly heartfelt scene of the series, Jun Wan adorns a terrible suit from Jae Hak (Jung Moon Sung), and attending the wedding of his patient’s daughter as his patient is unable to attend. His love story with Ik Soon ( Ik Joon’s sister) did undeniably start on a bit of an eccentric and uncomfortable setup but did become enjoyable ( especially with Jun Wan’s grouchiness at times) as the series progressed.

As the only female friend of the quintet and a single woman in her 40s Chae Song Hwa could’ve easily done down the more stereotypical route of being “ bitter” or “ pitiful”. However Song Hwa is refreshingly anything but these labels. A Charismatic, compassionate, intellectual and elegant character , its easy to see why actors Jo Jung Suk and Yoo Yeon Seok recommended theatre actress Jeon Mi Do for the role.Arguably whilst season two has given a potential opportunity to explore the landscape of Song Hwa’s mixed feelings for her respected love interests, season one undeniably often failed to truly sketch - out Song Hwa’s more profound complexity in her love life. (However room for a second season will hopefully delve into this issue more.)

Nevertheless arguably one of the most surprisingly heartwarming characters in the series was Kim Dae Myung’s role as Seok Hyung. Seemingly starting off the drama as the cliched and spoilt “ mama’s boy”, Dae Myung’s performance added surprising layers to Seok Kyung as a character with his complicated past and rationale as a medical professional . His potential love story with coworker Min Ah could’ve easily gone down several mundane routes, but his overall development and reactions rarely felt out of character.

On a weaker note, the final member of our quintet was Yoo Yeon Suk as Jeong Won. This isn’t to say that Yoo Yeon Suk’s performance was bad in any way. In fact the actor truly animated his onscreen persona to life with many endearing and likeable qualities. However Jeong Won was sadly a little less well-rounded. Whilst he had an intriguing storyline and a more complicated backstory than a lot of the other characters, but his later motives and personality assets often felt less profound. In addition to this whilst the show did seem to go down the evident route of his potential love story with Gyeo Wool in snippets, it often lacked the same charisma as the rest of the ensemble.

So is “ Hospital Playlist” worth watching? The show doesn’t entirely step upon new ground with its concept with certain characters and storylines felt slightly undeveloped ( although a sequel season will hopefully dismiss these issues) and snail pacing in parts also. On the other hand “ Hospital Playlist” has surprisingly profound and bittersweet themes with backstories and life in the hospital, as characters are often faced with realistically challenging issues which helped to provide food for thought. If you are willing to invest some time into this show, then you’ll absolutely love “ Hospital Playlist”.

100% RECOMMENDED HP CASTS, DIRECTOR, WRITER, AND STAFFS U DA BOMB
Everything in this drama is just so perfect. It gives you the warm feeling while watching it. It made me smile, laugh, cry, and get hungry the whole season. As a med student myself, this drama is very realistic and it really tackles about what people go through within the walls of a hospital. I'M SURE ALL OF YOU WILL LOVE IT!

Story - 10/10
You would think that the story might be boring at first since they really need to introduce a big cast, but if you continue, you'll realize how good the plot and progression of the story goes. This slice of life drama really lets people realize how important friendship is. They have their own lives and their problems but they were always there for each other. The cases of the patient were also realistic and we can see here that the story was not exaggerated. Just like the other works of Shin PD, we really can't predict anything.

THEY ALSO HAVE THE BEST SEASON FINALE! I wasn't disappointed with how the story went. The finale was really worth the wait, I wanna cry I'm so happy. Shin PD and Writer Lee, good job!!

Acting/Cast - 10/10
The cast is perfect. I love all of them. They acted so sincerely and we can really see how much effort they put into their roles. They trained very hard for this. Every emotion shown here will really make the viewers feel like they're in the same shoes. Whether you are in the field of medicine or not, you'll feel their struggles. We all experience these things one way or another. Even the kids in these drama acted so well. Shout out to U-ju, gyeopta!

Music - 10/10
The title says it all! I love their band and their songs so much. It really feels good to listen to their songs especially the covers they make. I saw how much effort they put into practicing the songs which makes it feel more special.

Rewatch Value - 10/10
Most people say that the rewatch value is low BUT IT'S ALSO A 10/10 FOR ME! Just the fact that there are meanings in the small details in the drama makes me want to rewatch everything. The cliffhangers and the clues given also make my mind go crazy. I also love rewatching their band practices. Season 2 will air on 2021 so we have a year to rewatch the episodes, the interviews and the relay cams. I'll rewatch their scenes whenever I'll miss them. Ugh I can't wait for the next season!!

Watch this!! 100% recommended <3

Shout out to Yoo Yeon Seok!!! I love you oppa! I hope more people will come to appreciate you.

when i tell y'all that this delivered, i swear on everything that i love that this drama delivered.

even if you don't carry that much knowledge about medical terms and abbreviations, this drama will be sure to give you lots of emotions. it felt hella good to see that it wasn't very centered on just one or two characters. everyone was given equal screen time and honestly it felt whole or complete? it's jusT so satisfying to see a natural bond of all these characters and they definitely chose the right cast for this.

the situations shown here were quite close to reality and it definitely tugged at my heartstrings seeing as to how the probability of things going well are sometimes less likely and it made me think of real life doctors and nurses who go through these scenarios... families anticipating the results...

one more thing i liked from this is that it felt pretty balanced. it wasn't too dramatic but it also didn't feel too comedic or ridiculous. it just felt right.

p.s. the songs are bops too

"" Hospital Playlist "" is one of the hyped dramas of 2020 and you are going to like it if you loved dramas like Reply 1988. However, even though there are not many reviews that are not praising this drama, Hospital Playlist is not for everyone.

The drama keeps a slow tempo, with the story being spread throughout the drama, probably so it can serve the next two seasons coming up next. Maybe that's when the drama picks up. And yes, this is a slice of life, but, at times, it felt like there was nothing to look forward to in the next episode. Also, there were moments when the drama got boring too.

That said, they did handle the romance masterfully, as to not overshadow the friendship and so that it didn't become the main focus of the drama. They did a good job with the blend of music and story too, as well as with the flashbacks of their old days.

Finally, when it comes to performances, the drama of course had excellent ones, as the cast was consisted by the best of the best.

So, overall, six and a half out of ten, because there were some nice moments to the drama, but it felt like there was no story to it.

If you like Reply series and Prison Playbook, you will like this too!
Many of you might have already known that Reply Series and Prison Playbook are the same writer as Hospital Playlist, so if you like this writer's piece, you will love this as well; but if you don't, then you might not enjoy it, because the writing style is pretty much the same, just that the theme is different.

Unlike normal medic drama, it doesn't focus on a ""special ability"" doctor who struggles to become a doctor, or evil doctors fighting with good doctors to get recognition. It doesn't have a climax or big conspiracy hidden in between. It surrounds five main leads to share each of their individual life and the friendship that they shared, at the same time bringing out many unexpected, heartwarming short stories of the patients, medical staff and their families.

Similar to their previous series, they will always bring out the nostalgic feel in the 90's and 80's by having some memories flashback, classic songs and of course, as usual, having some black humor that makes you chuckle!

I love this writer's written drama, although I like prison playbook more, but this is great too! Perfect acting skills from the casts, so I'm definitely looking forward to Season 2! :)

The usual medical dramas like to glorify doctors. most of them only deal with fast paced medical emergencies that has people running, screaming and fighting each other just to perform surgeries.
but this, this shows the real side of a hospitals life. they had ungrateful patients, the ""I saw this on google so I know more than you"", the ""you MUST save my family"", the ones who blamed the doctors for inevitable deaths, the impatient patients waiting to be examined, the complications of surgery, the wait for donors, everything!

just like prison playbook the first couple of eps felt slow and rushed at the same time, they gave us many characters and then took their time introducing them, so tbh at 1st I did contemplate whether I should drop it or not, but soon the realness of the characters, their friendship, the different type of relationships, won me over alongside the relatableness of them..

Lee Ik Jun seems like a carefree nutjob but he's sweet, caring and friendly that he's friends with everyone and he knows everything
Ahn Jung Won looks naive and absentminded but he's a softie with kids and has a big heart
Kim Jun Wan looks cold, scary but he's assertive and tells people what they need to hear
Yang Suk Hyung is unappreciated! especially by his friends and everyone thinks he's selfish but he's the real sweetie and the core of that friendship
Chae Song Hwa looks like the ideal modern woman, but she's a marshmallow once you get to know her.

this made me cry, laugh, get frustrated, relate, fangirl, and feel jealous in every episode. I loved their jam sessions and the ost was nice, and I never rewatch stuff but I need s2 now!

I know what some of you are thinking. You want to watch this drama, maybe because of the all star cast or the high ratings but you are hesitating because it's medical.

Well, in that case, take it from someone who thinks that med stuff is boring, the jargon makes you yawn and hospitals are depressing that this drama is amazing and will make you love it to bits and pieces.

Yes, there will be times you might zone out when they get technical with all the fancy doctor-ish words but even when you don't know the terms used, you'll feel the urgency of an operation, the sadness of a life lost and the joy of a successful surgery and that's all that matters.

What really makes this show an excellent watch though is the group of five doctor adolescent best friends who form a band together. Oof. The friendship, bromance and warmth in this show is no joke. Their music sessions are a healing experience and you feel affection for every single character.

The character development is phenomenal with each of the five bringing their own charm to the table.

Jung Won, the handsome as hell pediatrician with a butter heart that gets overly attached to patients; Lee Ik Jun, the goofy, emotional general surgeon and single dad who's your resident nice guy; Suk Hyung, the cute, anti-social introverted gynecologist; Song Hwa, our bomb female lead: the witty, quirky, graceful genius of a neurosurgeon and last but not the least my personal favorite Jun Wan, badass cardiothorasic surgeon who's a prickly hedgehog on the outside but a complete softie on the inside. He is also 100% boyfriend material and you just want to squeeze his cheeks and flick his nose.

The dynamics and chemistry between the 5 is off the charts and not only do you feel the real friendship between them, you want to be a part of their group.

The acting is outstanding and these people make you fall in love with them so completely that without any drama, flashy plot twists or shock value, the show still manages to reel you in and makes you content with watching hours of it just so you can get more of these amazing humans. Even the supporting cast is stellar and brings forth numerous characters that leave a mark on you.

With brilliant laugh out loud moments, emotional turns, beautiful music and a constant feeling of happiness- this show will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

Give it a go. You won't regret it. And ladies, if you want some superficial encouragement, then keep in mind that the men in this show are HOT. As if Yeon Suk's beauty and Jo Jung Suk's charm wasn't enough, you have Jung Kyung Ho, who is unarguably the human embodiment of God's greatest gift to mankind.

Are you still here? No?
Good, that's what I thought.

MY PRECIOUS!
This show was a great surprise for me. I started with low expectations because I'm not a fan of medical dramas (only Grey's Anatomy), but when I saw the first episode, I was fall in love.

How could they create a friendship so beautiful and amazing? I melted every time that I saw a scene with my band, they are perfect together! I wanted to be part of this group so badly! All the actors were amazing, but I wanna make an honorable mention to Jo Jung-suk as Lee Ik-jun. He was my favorite character from distance and I always laughed when he talked anything. His expressions, lines, the way how he interacted with the others, everything was awesome for me. THE SCENES WITH U-JU (Kim Joon)? MY GOODNESS, I ALMOST EXPLODE WITH CUTENESS! My mention extends for Kim Joon as well. What a kid! So cute and focused on the role!

Hospital Playlist isn't a show made for a marathon or for people that be in a rush. It's a show about process and progress. I watched an episode in a day and reflected on what I saw without the addicted to seeing the next one quickly. I think the format told about life and death, and the development of relationships, ask for you to watch peacefully. And I love this experience! Another honorable mention: THE OST IT'S AMAZING! (Even when Chae Song-hwa (Jeon Mi-do) was singing, hahaha.)

I can't wait for the second season and what we gonna see in the Yulje Hospital! If you are looking for something deep but calm, cute but visceral, soft but heartbreaking (at some times), this is your drama.

The greatest cast delivered us the greatest medical show up to date.
Let's be grateful for the perfection this drama is. No power struggle plot lines, no over the top unrealistic medical cases, no flawless doctors with such amazing skills they could be called superpowers. What we’ve got is a realistic representation of a hospital as a workplace with a brilliantly written set of original characters and smart comedy with depth and heart intertwined. I could not ask for more.

Some might argue that the characters were too perfect, but if anything, they were perfectly written. They still had their flaws, but I wasn’t slapped across the face with them. They were insecure at times, scared, and didn't know how to communicate with others. Their small struggles and mistakes they made never annoyed the viewers, because they were realistic and made sense. Rather than frustrating everyone, it made the characters extremely relatable.

The acting was A+... I truly don’t think we need to discuss that. With that cast you can expect outstanding performance and still be surprised with how good the end result is.

Is there anything that could be considered a flaw in it?
Yes and No. I think it depends on what you are expecting to see. There is no one leading plot line. It’s simply the daily life of the characters. Each one of them has something going on, but except for their friendship, there isn’t any big conspiracy linking them together. One could say it’s a slow paced drama, but with shows like that, talking about pace doesn’t make much sense. Since the plot does not progress in a typical sense (from point A to point B), we can’t talk about its pacing. It’s for sure character driven, and I myself love it.

What’s more, the cast of characters is huge and it might feel overwhelming at first - trying to remember who is who and how they are all connected. I have an advice for you: just watch. Do not try to remember and recognize every intern, student, doctor, nurse or patient. It’s not necessary. You don’t need to remember with great detail who said certain lines. There is no mystery to be solved, no puzzles to create a perfect picture. You can treat it as if you just started interacting with a new group of friends - as the drama progresses, you will slowly learn the names, personalities and motivations of these people. There is no need to stress yourself about being confused at first.

For me this drama was perfect. I’m sad that some of my ships did not sail, but it also makes sense that they did not go with the most obvious choice. A clean 10/10. I just finished it, and yet I want to rewatch it right away.

Very Drawn Out And Boring
I read the reviews and expected a lot more out of it than I got. Not much happened except a lot of eating (constantly), idle chatter, and band practicing, oh, and did I mention eating? I’ve watched much better dramas with lower ratings than this one. One thing I will say, is the cast and acting were fantastic, as was the occasional humor. Not a whole lot of intense romance, just lightly touched on it. I know that the people who gave it 10s probably think I’m crazy, and I have bad taste, but honestly, I found it very boring. A 90 minute running time works fine for a lot of dramas, but it didn’t work for this, since the episodes felt like they dragged on forever. I guess I am just not a “slice of life” kind of girl. I need more of a plot heavy drama to stay interested. This wasn’t that!

Very overrated.
I’m still not understanding where the high ratings are coming from. The plot/premise of the overall K-drama is fairly predictable and the lack of twists, surprises and the fireworks a GREAT K-drama (or any drama series) brings to the audience are all lacking. I thought perhaps the second season would be different than the first (I was aware that the first season was cut short due to the Pandemic), but no, nothing. Same. In fact, worse because we knew how average the first season was already.. and the second season is the same, drab of the first season. I typically turn off about 15 minutes into the episodes as it’s the same thing from the previous episode… some annoying side characters, very annoying patients (or their parents), etc.

I think the key characters are charming and I really love the fab five as the core group, but this drama ends there and falls flat. Just nice, background noise while you work on something else, or web browse.

If you really want to know what I’m talking about… compare this to “Vincenzo” or “Racket Boys”.

Decent Drama.
I decided to watch this because of the high ratings. Unfortunately I expected so much more, nevertheless I don't regret watching this. It had a very weird start and at the very beginning the doctor role was not convincing to me but it got better as time went. It is very realistic and its really about 5 friends living their life. The best thing I liked about the drama are the 5 main leads, I love how unique each of them were.
One can easily get bored while watching this, I found myself being on my phone a lot and skipping a lot of scenes. There were LOTS of characters in this drama and each had a story of their own and it can be tiring getting through everyone's story. I love the little romance definitely added a little bit of fluffiness. This is a good friendship drama which would make you feel every emotion. Im glad I watched and I am looking forward to the second season.

(SO FAR) MOST HEARTWARMING DRAMA OF THE YEAR!
Let me start reviewing Hospital Playlist with 2 words: 1. VISUAL and 2. TALENT

The visual is not a joke! Isn't it crazy seeing a drama in which the casts are all visual? Jo Jun-suk, Jung Kyung-ho, Yoo Yeon-seok, Kim Dae-myung and last but not least, the prettiest rookie, Jeon Mi-do! I was seriously in shock just looking at the drama's poster at that time. I was thinking, ""How come all the casts are this handsome and pretty?"" Leaving the main casts alone, the support actors and actresses are so good looking and suit the roles pretty well too.

The five main casts are so talented! While waiting for the new episode to come, I spend my time watching their behind the scenes, either on Youtube or somewhere on Instagram. I got some videos showing the Mido and Falasol band practicing! I didn't expect them to REALLY play the instruments by themselves, but they did! As a church musician myself, I believe it won't be easy for any actor or actress learning to play an instrument for a shooting purposes, but they made it! Hats off!

Last, you don't need to question the quality of this drama since Hospital Playlist is from the same team, director and writer who worked on the Reply series and Prison Playbook. From their history of making films or dramas, we know that we're going to have some meaningful, heartwarming and insightful view of the professions in the medical field and also the relationship built of the hospital family.

To resume my review here: Hospital Playlist makes me cry. Hospital Playlist makes me laugh.

Please give it a try! Cheers!

The beginning was a little bland because they had to set up the drama and introduce the huge cast. But keep watching with an open mind - it gets interesting after a couple of episodes.

It isn't the typical medical drama with dramatic surgery miracles. It's somewhat realistic with ups and downs. The drama is a collection of stories of the daily lives of doctors and patients. This type of show is always a hit or miss for me, but I loved Hospital Playlist's storytelling. I was always either laughing or crying. Each character is unique so I quickly got invested in the entire cast. Time flew while I watched each episode because everything felt so natural, like I was in the hospital with them.

There's a bit of a retro vibe for fans of the Reply series, but it isn't a major part of the show. As with every Shin Won Ho drama, every scene is crucial and hints to what will happen later in the show.

Looking forward to watching Season 2 next year!

Coming from the same team of Answer Me series and Prison Playbook, this drama is another gem to this awesome team.

With the incredible cast and an awesome plot this is definitely worth watching. Like their previous hits this drama focuses on 5 friends. They relationships with every other and everyone else, Romance added in mix but not the sole focus.

This drama is in my Top 10 drama list and I highly recommend it to all. Only negative thing I found is that now we have to wait till 2021 for season 2!!!!!

FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, MUSIC, FAMILY, COMFORTING.
Ikjun , Joon-wan, Song hwa, Jung won, Seok hyung.
5 words 5 friends is what this drama is all about.

Just when you think what great could they possibly show about group of people in their forties comes in the artwork of director SHINWON. You surely are gonna envy their friendship.

The only thing that came in my mind after watching it was to try to become like them ; to become a better person and a better Physiotherapist.
I can write a 500 word essay on this drama , but I’ll try to cut it down short.

A)The most appealing point of a series is when - You can enjoy each and every episode.
For sure it will never bore you.....didn’t skip even a second.,infact REWATCHed those cute scenes again and again.

B) Characters- IKJUN ❤️ Fell in love with this character from being smart to funny to caring to having the purest heart of all. I hope to meet a person like him in real. You know no one can pull off ikjun like jo jung suk . I adored him as Lee hwa shin in jealousy incarnate but I’m head over heels for Lee ikjun . The handsomest social butterfly , father, GS, Brother and singer. Ikjun will set friendship goals for you.
2) UJU- after ikjun it had to be our uju❤️ The only dates that matter are uju and ikjun dates. Find me cuter and wiser kid than uju in kdrama ; I’ll wait. I want ikjun and uju father son relationship in my life Please God.....
3) Song hwa- teaches us to cherish every part of our life work, friends, hobbies ,food?, etc. Our korean Hermione - would get bored without work on a Vacation
4) Joon wan- funny in his own unique ways especially when with ikjun?. The phone call scene cracked me up. He shows how one has to be patient and understanding in a relationship
5) Jung won - just two words PRIEST and WINTERGARDEN
6) Seok hyung - My soul spirit❤️ I guess 90%of the people here get his love for TV and dramas and enjoying food in his own company. “ I’ve decided to do things that i like” simple yet impactfull.

7) BEST FRIENDS- jung won’s mother and the director have that innocent funny moments.... the kind of lifelong friendship everyone wants.
8)Honorable mentions- all our residents, nurses , interns ,iksun and jung won’s family.

C)STORY - No Spoiler. It’s set interestingly since the 1st episode and portrays messages through simple stories in every ep .
Their past life scenes were very organised and revealed at proper events. Never felt They dragged it
There is so much character development in all the 5 main leads .

D) OSTs - once you hear it here the next day it’s on your spotify list - the fact they play the instruments and sing themselves makes the osts even more intimate.

Summary- JUST GO AND WATCH IT YOU FOOL....
If you alread have -rewatch it again soon❤️And become ujuholic ?
Hospital playlist is definitely in my top 3.

Dear Hospital Playlist,

Thank you for all the laughs, the relief tears, the butterflies, and the feels. You didn’t feel like a usual k-drama that is going from point A toward a certain targeted ending. You were so refreshing and original. You didn’t struggle to create the tension that Medical dramas strive for by employing hospital’s politics. You just told the mundane life of five doctors/best friends and their casual jam sessions in the basement.

You were there for me in moments of despair. In these hard times, away from my family and friends, staying alone and barely going out, you were the highlight of my week that comforted me and warmed my heart. During this crazy semester, when I have to stay up all night sometimes to finish an assignment your OSTs gave me company. The beautiful ‘Aloha’ by the tender voice of a very charming Jo Jung Suk was my ear snack and study break. ‘Oh! What a shiny night’ energized me during those starry nights. And, “Beautiful My Love” and ""In Front of City Hall at the Subway Station"" somehow made me feel relieved and safe during the most insecure times of my life. Hearing these OSTs weirdly reminded me of my childhood and high school days.

Your characters were not flashy, some may see them too perfect, but I could see how human and flawed they were. After all, you named them ‘The lacking five.’ Each of them is struggling with their own insecurity and dilemma. I could see their growth and strive to make the right decision. Ik-Jun’s goofiness never failed to crack me up. His scenes with Woo Jo always warmed my heart. His insecurity in one scene and quirkiness in the other fascinated me. He was my favorite character from the beginning and stayed throughout. A very fine Jo Jung Suk gave flesh and blood to the character and rocked his comedic timing. I felt I’ve learned a lot from these lacking five. Ik Jun taught me to never let someone’s departure from my life affect my self-esteem. While Jun Wan gave an example in assertiveness, he also showed that it’s important to give hope to others while trying his best even if rationally the chances of what they’re hoping for are thin. Song Hwa demonstrated that taking a break once in a while is a must no matter how busy it is for me. Jung won made a case to put the heart over the mind if a conflict ever happened between the two. And my favorite Suk Hyung showed that I can enjoy my loneliness, looking after my mom, not shying away when I make a false statement about someone, and accepting my social awkwardness.

The slow-burn romances were a delight to witness. But, the emotion that stands the most and was the core of you was the lively friendship between the leads. How they understand each other, get concerned if any one of them is going through a hard time. I loved how it’s easy when they’re together. You didn’t try to impress the viewers by friends sacrificing for each other to show us how thick is their bond. You showed that through simple scenes like them having a meal together, and enjoying their jam sessions.

I loved everything about you from the leads, supporting characters, patients/doctors interactions, cinematography, dialogues, jokes, OSTs, overall feels...and all the good vibes that you give me.

Thank you so much for such a ride, and I hope next year will come soon, so we can meet again.

Sincerely,
One of your biggest fans.

Value of a Sad and Pseudo-Life
Screenwriter Lee Woo Jung brought us a near-perfect script compounded by the Director’s vision revolving around the daily occurrences within a hospital setting of the value of a sad and pseudo-life. Shin PD and Lee Woo Jung are inseparable since 2012 as I like to call it the Shin PD/Lee Woo Magical Express-Down Memory Lane ride. The writers of Reply 1988 and Prison Playbook bashed it out of the park with a visual treat to be sui generis.

First, if you do not like this screenwriter, then I will save you the time, do not see this show. Every episode is about an hour fifteen to forty minutes long. It is the one drawback and only drawback to a drama with steady character development from the main leads. Read on if you are willing to maybe think about viewing Hospital Playlist, aka Sage of Life.

What is the reason why so many people were enthusiastic, ‘sad and happy? It was not your typical backstabbing hospital politics drama. It was a medical drama that broke the traditional framework and made us more aware of humanism; we called it empathy rather than a doctor's story. It was different from Life (2018), Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim (2016), or Chocolate (2019). The Director’s passion for editing without an editor was to complete a drama full of detail, and the nostalgic playbook of the Yoo Jung artist formed a sympathetic band beyond generations. I give kudos to the cinematography. Of course, it would be a drama for nothing without clichés sprinkled into the story.

First-rate acting at its finest. Actor Jo Jung Seok demonstrates his irreplaceable presence through his character Lee Ik Jun. Without spoiling when it occurs, I am naming the comical scenes his role creates with his company alone. He made some humorous scenes, “Das Vader, Pick Me dance, Frog King eyes, and subway guide,” which had become a central topic of discussion throughout the drama. One word his character generates DE-STRESS situations.

Jo Jung Seok’s whole character’s essence is the ability to mingle with several surrounding characters, focus on their work, and relieve them of their presence. Jo Jung Seok has developed a unique sense of life-tight acting, giving him persuasion and empathy for the situation and engaging in Anbang Theater style with a friendly fascination that we see with the ambassador in the show. It may be offputting, but his role intended to engage in comical antics.

If that is not enough, Kim Joon plays the winning and always hungry son Lee Woo Joo of Jo Jung Seok. His eyes are beguiling that can manipulate you to no end in sight. He is an impressive child actor who I am looking forward to in the coming years.

The heroine of the show actress Jeon Mi Do was phenomenal her first time on screen portraying a Professor of Neurosurgery. She has a unique screen presence and acting style from her critical success attributed to Anbang Theatre and Musical Theatre. The real eye-opener in the drama, not that she cannot act far from it; it is she cannot sing. Granted, we do hear her angel voice on the OST, but there is a stark difference, which the writers hit on this early. The chemistry with her co-leads is natural that a month or two months of acting cannot teach, but her years of stage/music theater taught her well. She did not appear stiff, which I consider that a plus.

Yoo Yeon Sook, Jung Kyung Ho, and Kim Dae Myung were equally impressive in their roles. You know the Director and Screenwriter did a marvelous job when the viewer can connect with working individuals in a demanding profession that do not get the respect they deserve every day. You will fall in love with Kim Da Myung’s stoic facial expressions/antisocial nature, Yoo Yeon Sook's kindhearted nature, and Jung Kyung Ho’s grave but tenderhearted answers to the patient's family. They are all talented gifted with musical talents, not just acting from the soul.

There were so many new and old faces; they all did a great job on screen. I am no medical expert, but in my eyes, the surgeries performed looked realistic to a certain extent, but like all medical shows bound to be slipups. You may find a slipup here and there, but do not let it discourage you from watching this extraordinary show. The only negatives are there is no real story. The story revolves around the lives of five friends working at a Medical Hospital, but do not let it influence your decision.

The OST was a hit in South Korea, and I, for one, liked the music choices. Every episode, the band the five friends meet once a week or when their schedule is not chaotic to perform a particular song. I viewed every episode at least two times, and the get-togethers are an intricate part of the story. What I got out of this drama, which I hope Season 2 continues this extraordinary story, friendship should not stop at College but extend into our workplace or virtual workplace long after we form attachments. Bonds damaged and amended along the way. One thing I am looking forward to how Season 2 OST will top Season 1 OST.

It is maybe not Bing-Worthy material, but savoring every minute may be an episode every other day. Watch the first fifteen minutes of the first episode if you like, watch the next fifteen minutes. It is all around a tremendous enjoyable show that will have you laughing, maybe tearing up, or cursing. I recommend this show even if it is a one time watch for you. Hop on the ""Shin PD/Lee Woo Magical Express-Down Memory Lane ride.""


Final Rating: 9.20/10

Acting: 9.76/10

This is the type of drama similar to the vibe of reply series that I was looking for the past two years. There is no need to compare both and both are in its own league . Its is a star studded cast but most of the screen space were managed by the supporting actors. That is well done and a first of an experience for me. Looking forward to the next episode and it is a shame that it is only on the next year. The one character that stands out for me is Lee Jun Han and I wish to see him in a more screen space in the next season.

Excellent Slice of Life - Will be Enough for Some Viewers but Not All
I will be completely avoiding spoilers in the FIRST half of this post and will discuss spoilers in the SECOND half of this post. I'll put a separator to try to help you avoid accidentally reading them.

If you like the Slice of Life genre, this will easily be an 8-10 out of 10. However, this show is not perfect, and I believe some of these elements weigh the quality down so that if you are not a hardcore Slice of Life lover, you might find your enjoyment decreased, which was how I felt after completing this show.

First, let's discuss the story: there is no story. Traditional, overarching plots that span throughout the series are thrown out the window so that the drama can focus on the five main characters and their relationships with their friends, family, and coworkers, while splashing in medical cases. This works extremely well if you enjoy purely character driven stories with a splash of medical jargon. This won't work so well if you are expecting longitudinal narratives -- I have to admit that I am not that into Slice of Life, but picked up this show due to all the hype, and did end up literally falling asleep at some points, having to go back and rewatch the parts I missed. However, what the show does well, it does really well: there are many, many, really heartwarming scenes which I will describe in the spoiler section. Still, for me, the show bogged itself down with too many contrivances, especially with some specific romances. I felt some elements were too cliche and appealed too much to the ""kdrama fantasy"" rather than being a solid look into ""real life"", which I would expect from Slice of Life.

Next, the acting: there is not much for me to say about this because it is wonderful. Jo Jung Suk nails it as the universally loved Lee Ik Jun. Jeon Mi Do, relatively unknown to film and TV in 2020, kills it as the bleeding heart Chae Song Hwa. The rest of the cast, including the supporting and guest cast, is very effective and believable at serving their parts.

The soundtrack was exemplary as well, drawing from older songs like the 2001 song Aloha by Trio or the 1996 Introduce Me a Good Person by Basis.

Overall, I think this show lives and dies by its Slice of Life classification -- comparing this to the breadth of romances, actions, thrillers, mysteries, horrors, etc, I think Hospital Playlist is just ""good"".
------------------------------------------------------------
SPOILERS START HERE
SERIOUSLY AFTER THIS IS THE SPOILER SECTION
FOR REALZ, SPOILERS AFTER THIS BREAK
------------------------------------------------------------
It's difficult to talk about my criticisms without diving into specific details about things that happen in this series, so the following is a discussion of faults I found with it.

First, the romance, which to me is the greatest fault: this show suffers ""Grey's Anatomy syndrome"": that is most of the doctors are actively engaging in relationships with each other, are actively considering relationships with each other, and are somehow devoid of outside-of-work love interests. Yes, there are some non-doctor pairings like Kim Jun Wan and his girlfriend, but I would argue even his relationship is too close to home, since he dates a main character's sister, Lee Ik Sun, conveniently within the circle of the main cast. Outside of this, somehow, everyone loves someone in close proximity to the show or are crushing on them: Ahn Jeong Won's resident loves him. Yang Seok Hyeong's resident also loves him. Chae Song Hwa's resident ALSO loves her. There is even a minor romance of two residents who love each other. Do you see the pattern here? For a show where romance takes a back seat to the ""daily happenings of life"", I thought this was way too convenient and made the relationships feel too forced. As this is a TV show, obviously some creative license is allowed, but I think the ubiquitous nature of this intra-show love just felt like lazy writing to me -- a device to fill in the extra time because the writers couldn't figure out what else to put in and just needed to jam some romance in there.

The relationship I took the most issue with was Ahn Jeong Won and his resident Jang Gyeo Wool -- over a 12 episode run, Gyeo Wool is essentially crushing over Jeong Won for 11 episodes, even trying to get over him by going on a blind date, but ultimately still remaining committed to her crush as basically nothing happens with the ""getting over him"" subplot. Moreover, she is characterized as being cold and misunderstood -- she is a very diligent person who is ""kind in her own way"" but is not someone that expresses any kind of obvious affection towards anyone, whether it is her patients or her love interest. Meanwhile, Jeong Won is characterized as being very religious to the point of taking active steps to quit being a doctor to become a priest, like the rest of his siblings, who are all priests and nuns. He doesn't date because he's committed to God. Initially, he's pretty much just ice cold to Gyeo Wool, but expresses increasing empathy to her. Finally, in episode 12, she begs him not to become a priest and he just...kisses her. I'm sorry, but especially a male watcher, this love line felt way too much an appeasement of the female fantasy rather than a realistic, or even semi-realistic romance: we're talking about a woman whose love was so great that she literally changed the life course of man. My issue isn't that their kiss wasn't heartwarming, but my problem is that Jeong Won essentially pulled a 180 over an ""outwardly cold"" woman who basically just wanted him to love her because...reasons. I would argue that Jeong Won's reversal of his decision in becoming a priest would have been more realistic and compelling if he had done it solely on the realization of the value of his strength in being a good doctor, without the added issue of the romance.

Second, and more minor, is the characterization of hospital life -- just like other medical shows, the series combines several jobs in one doctor, so that a general surgeon like Ik Jun diagnosing cancer, which in reality would be done by an oncologist, or doctors only needing to worry about 1-2 cases per day instead of the endless patients they seem to need to see. However, I think this is fine -- the real life paperwork of medicine is probably way too boring to turn into a real show.

Lastly, and also a little minor, the last episode in particular seemed to lean really heavily on flashbacks. I understand that context is important, but I felt it was pretty excessive, especially if you've been following the characters in a purely character-driven story for 11 out of 12 episodes and are just watching the last one.

At the end of the day, despite the issues I took with this show, I felt it was still on the positive side. Some of the heartwarming moments will stay with you for a really long time: the Aloha karaoke scene is a masterpiece and spawned the ""I BELIEVE"" meme that you see in some places.
------------------------------------------------------------
I think this show is really easy to recommend or not recommend: if you love Slice of Life, it's an autowatch. If you are tolerable of Slice of Life, it is worth your time. If you do not like it, it is a hard pass.

Friends are forever
Likes:
1. The enduring friendship between the 5 doctors. I love how they always find time to eat together, play music, and support each other in good and bad.
2. Of the 5, Ikjun is my favorite doctor/character. He is so warm and nice. #JoJungSuk is so funny! I also love his interactions with Uju.
3. I love the romamce between Junwan and Iksun, who is as funny as her brother. But that ending!
4. Songhwa is almost too good to be true. The last part of the drama focused more on her love triangle between Ikjun and Chihong. Of course I am team Iksong!!. .
5. Im happy that Jeongwon isnt going to become a priest. He is very good with the kids and he is one of the few pedia.
6. I also love Mama Rosa and the best friend. I wish they actually end up together!
7. The obgyn doctor has a sad story. Actually cute to see him with Minha though seems like the ex wife will come back in S2.
8. I love the ost and all the times they play band.

Dislikes:
An unpopular opinion but i never got onboard the winter garden ship. Gyeoul looks so boring and lifeless. And she never smiles. I dont understand how, why and when the sweet and smiling Jeongwan liked her.

I almost gave up after watching ep 2 but im glad i continued to watch this little gem. Cant wait for season 2!

Somewhat disappointing
There is no doubt the drama is well acted and the friendships explored and maintained in the backdrop of a stressful, busy hospital and personal life is rewarding. Nevertheless, I felt as though some of the episodes dragged. I kept waiting to fall in love with this just like so many others did, but try as I might I endured through most of the episodes but wasn't wowed like I expected to be.

I will say I love Ik-Joon. This actor is largely why I watched and he didn't disappoint. All the other actors were excellent too, I just wasn't as invested as I expected to be. I particularly enjoyed Rosa's steadfast friendship with the Director and how they relied on one another always.

Given this was written by the Reply 1988 writer, I'm fully expecting Ik-Joon to not be with Song-Hwa. I feel we've been made to feel empathy and excitement about their coming together just as we did in 1988 only to be messed with again. I'm fairly certain we were taken on a ride wherein we saw the Ik-Joon and Song Hwa relationship most only to have it snatched from us so that we question their every past interaction or our expectations. (Clearly, I'm still not over how poor Jung Hwan was wronged and deserved better... LOL!)

This show could have been a 10/10 in all rating aspects. The reason for me personally it hasn't reached this criteria is the awkward episode lengths. Don't get me wrong it's a personal pet peeve, but I don't really enjoy a drama to have each episode nearly 90 minutes long. I believe that movies work perfectly at the 90 minute mark but television shows work better when each episode is between 45 minutes to 70 minutes long - a 90 minute end of series episode is fine.
The first episode did also catch me off guard but by the third episode I believe the show really starts to pick up it's pace and you'll want to find out what happens next which is always great. The cast have an amazing chemistry together and the acting scenes were great, production also was top notch.
I believe that everyone will find this show great, I just believe that the episodes could have been spread to more, and instead of the 90 minute length it would work better with a 60 minute length per episode, but hey, that's just my opinion!

Hospital Playlist won't be everyone's cup of tea. It is a drama about a group of friends' daily lives; there is no complex plot, no dramatic climax, and to a certain extent there is no real conclusion to the story. It is a character-driven drama, and as is always the case with these dramas, it needs a solid cast.

Hospital Playlist's cast wasn't just solid—they were amazing. The screenwriter did a great job creating and writing the characters, but it was the skill of the cast that brought such charm and humanity to each and every character. They made me laugh and they made me cry, and most of all they made me want to root for them. I especially want to highlight Jo Jung Suk's acting -- this was surprisingly the first time I've seen his work, and I fell head over heels for his portrayal of Lee Ik Jun.

Another thing that I adored from this drama was how well it managed to portray happy moments with friends—small pleasures like eating together or hanging out together between breaks, moments that are hard to organize and that are so easily disrupted by hectic lives. This was something I related to a lot and I really enjoyed those scenes.

All in all, I adored this drama and it was almost a perfect drama for me, but if I had to nitpick, I'd say that I wished the character of Chae Song Hwa was further explored, because while I adored her I also felt like she had less character development than the rest of the main characters.

There are only 12 episodes but they are quite lengthy (the final episode is almost 2 hours long!), so that might (understandably) turn off some viewers.

MUST WATCH!
If you have watched the reply series and prison playbook this is by the same director Shin won ho, that is why the casting is similar to before. It even includes some reapperances from the cast of this previous dramas.

1. IT CAN BE CONFUSING FOR THE FIRST 3 EPISODES. At first I was confused on who the main leads were but picked it up by mid ep 1. The plot isn't one big story but rather about life at the hospital, this was slightly confusing at first but around episode 4 all the side storys and characters fit together nicely and its much eaiser to navigate while watching the episodes so do not give up on the first episode just because you are confused.
I love that it focus' on so many characters and their individual lives, the main focus isnt' really on the 5 leads but actually on a whole bunch of the hospital staff around them which is different but they all fit well together.

2. there is no villian or bad guy to ruin your day. It's a feel good show with scenes where you will cry and scenes where you rejoice and laugh its all about life and patients. there isn't a chairman or anything that's annoying and cranky which I am thankful for or characters that you hate. Everyone is loveable and likeable.


3.The main 5 leads are 4 men and 1 women (typical for shin won hos dramas) who have been best friends since university and now all work at the same hospital for the first time ever. there are scattered scenes of them all together, and when they are all together it's so much fun. The actors are so good I could honeslty believe the characters had been friends for 20+ years without a doubt.

4. There is romance in a subtle day to day life thing, I have swooned over some of the scenes between some character and am shipping 2 of the leads together!
It's well worth a watch, each character is so full of personality and it's so well written.
ALSO the BAND! such a fun little add to it! The actors actually play the intruments so its not bad sync playing its actually real!

Wholesome, humorous, and realistic
What a lovely, comforting show.

I gotta admit; the first two episodes are super confusing because there are so many characters (including the five main leads and all the residents/nurses/interns) and they're all in different medical departments. BUT KEEP WATCHING because by episode three, you get a clearer grasp on everyone's character motivations and backstories and it's so worth it.

I loved the relationship between the five main leads; they have such a cute origin story and their relationship felt so funny and authentic. All the show's romances and ships draw you in and make you root for them. Hospital Playlist does a great job balancing serial and procedural storylines; there are the usual medical cases of the week along with compelling season-long arcs. Be prepared to cry, particular with the cases of the week; this isn't one of those doctor shows where the patients always survive. But also be prepared to laugh and swoon as the main characters joke, fall in love, and find themselves. (Side note: the kid who plays U-ju is seriously the cutest child ever).

Definitely well worth a binge-watch!

This review may contain spoilers
I'm not one to hold big expectations, as I'm afraid that things will turn out to be a letdown. Same case for this series; I am a huge fan of the PD-writer combo, and I love all the PDs previous works (Reply series, Prison Playbook) whole-heartedly, including the less popular Reply 1994 :D
But still, I have to admit, I did expect to feel similar 'groove' in this one as with the other works; which I didnt find in the first 4 eps. The series was good, it was light, solid plot and cast chemistry, has its comedic moments, familiar camera works, pretty good bg music choices; albeit slightly confusing with all the characters jumbles without proper narrative introductions. Then came Episode 5....... a whole game-changer! Hospital playlist instantly became my new favourite. Supporting characters and side plots started coming together nicely, intricate backstories unfolded, and (new) relationships bloomed... I could definitely felt the same nostalgic, heartwarming feelings the PD past works brought to me.
Three episodes later at eps 8, I can still safely say that it is still my favourite. Totally worth the one week wait for each new ep TT^TT

The casts are well-chosen; this is my first time watching Jeun Mi Do (I honestly dont remember her role in Mother?) and I think she is a perfect fit for Song-Hwa haha. The same goes for Kim Dae Myung (I havent watched Misaeng); I enjoy his sluggish, softy big bear character here <3 No comment for the rest of the amazing cast.
Oh! I LOVE ROSA AND HER MANCHILD BFF!!! And Sung Dong Il moments are always fun to watch haha

Overall, the series is satisfying so far, and i can't wait to watch the following eps and to cry when it's finally time to say bye to my dear professors.

Slow but poignant. There are moments that truly shine while others hamper the pacing.
I am rewatching the finale. It started off really well in the first two episodes. It's relatable, the gang's friendship. Who hasn't gone out to dinner with your friends only to have your friend's mom phone in and ask how you've been?

After that, I found myself fast-forwarding scenes involving one of the resident's parents and Ik-jun's sister's romance and the endless makbang scenes. The romance I wasn't interested. It's really the friendship, the comedic timing between them all and that epic karaoke scene with Jun Wan belting out ""I Believe!"" Those moments really shined.

I didn't see season 2. This was very slowly paced. This is one of those dramas that leaves an impression on you once you take your time with it. The finale was probably the best episodes of this season. Yes it was predictable, but it was poignant. It tackled life, or rather lives that end in the hospital. The guilt and the weight of responsibility our gang faces when lives can't be saved.

Song Hwa talks about a patient she had. She remembers her name, her face, everything. She stayed with her. But she still passed. ""I felt it was my fault she died. I beat myself up for months."" It's that scene I rewatch over and over. I never see guilt being addressed when there is a passing.

The best part of the series was maybe the first two episodes and the last episode. There isn't really a plot. It's rather episodic until the finale and the last couple of episodes which tied everything together. It’s a medical drama that focuses on the medical side of working in a hospital.

The romance to me was forgettable. The friendship shined and the how the residents had to tackle some heartbreaking cases where their patients didn't make it.

I love romance and enjoy rom-coms but Ik-Jun and Song Hwa to me felt cringe and forced. Song Hwa is an epic female lead and for her to suddenly rekindle her crush from eons ago? Ik-Jun was married this whole time and for him to suddenly pursue Song Hwa? Talk about forced. I liked it better when their relationship was ambiguous. Instead of going on that date, Ik-Jun waits with her at the hospital. Because this was a rare drama where friendship matters. This is rare, especially with people in their 30s-40s.

Very smartly written
It wasn't one of my very favorites, only because it was low on romance. However, this show was well-written, and the characters were developed very well. I loved the concept of the five main characters being friends for many years. One of the reasons that this show was so enjoyable was that the characters weren't cliched - a woman was the head of neurosurgery, a female soldier, a single dad - kind of the opposite of what we have grown to ""expect"". Each person had their strengths, as well as their idiosyncrasies. I also liked that the characters worked in different areas of the hospital, neurosurgery, general surgery, OB/GYN, pediatrics. This kept the story lines fresh. The stories of the hospitalized patients were often so heart-wrenching (There was a lot of crying going on by me), but that was balanced by the funny interactions between the doctors. This cast played well off of each other and you could really feel their friendships. There was a happy ending, of sorts, with a couple of things left hanging in the balance, I'm assuming so that they can be addressed in season 2. I also liked that this didn't have a lot of the K-drama tropes - such as love triangles with an evil person, and I don't believe I saw one wrist grab in the whole show!

MIDO AND PARASOL ARE MY HEART ❤️
Well where to begin with I have so many good things to say... I have loved all past shin PD nim drama's and I can proudly say that this even beats reply 1988 for me !
*it obviously has the best direction and story with the whole hit of nostalgia. It will warm your heart and inspire you.
*All the actors are very well experienced and truly deserve all the appreciation and love, from acting flawlessly to playing band performance in every epiode . They are so Passionate and hard working - took such short time to learn and ace the instruments . The drama also gave us JEON MIDO -a well renowned musical actress with the most beautiful voice.
*Since it's a slice of life drama you would definitely resonate with one or more character's and the various relationships depicted in it.
*The director and writer are known for crafting beautiful stories for every single character and trust me you will love each and every character.
*The friendship between the lacking 5 is very strong, we are used to seeing childhood and teenage friendship but in this drama you'll see how their friendship which is almost 20 years old is so very well developed and matured with time even at the age of 40 when they all have such hectic life. Life can truly be delightful even if you are in your 40's .
*I have never been this emotionally attached to a drama , all the characters actually felt like my lifelong friends. It's like you are a part of their world. There are funny moments where you'll literally laugh out your lung out and some really delicate and emotional moments where you won't be able to stop crying . This drama makes me feel so good at many different levels.
*Even though it's a medical drama but it's not too much focused on it rather it shows you the very real image of doctors, how humanly they try to ease the patients pain be it physically or emotionally .
*Love and romance is also a part but it's done in the right wayand in the right amount so you'll actually ship all the couples like crazy. It's so very realistic and heart melting . (Do watch ik jun's confession in epiosode 10)
*The ost's are amazing and so are the band performance by mido and parasol ❤️ all the old songs are recrafted , trust me you will love all of them.
*The last performance by the band really made me cry , I don't know how I will survive a year without them but this is life - you need to wait for the good time to come. Do listen to their last ost and wait for a year .
Please watch HOSPITAL PLAYLIST it's truly one of a kind.

My God, what this drama IS?
In a single word, GORGEOUS!
I've literally devourd it in less than a week.
The story is so good and real, that is unpossible not to love it. There aren't any heroism or any huge scene over a single patient like many other medical drama, the continuous switching of story is perfect to maintain the attention, and also the background stories where super funny, you really can't hate anyone of the cast.
100% one of the best Netflix titles right now, I sincerely can't wait for 2021 the second season of this masterpiece!

Unexpected Masterpiece
I love watching medical dramas and this one delivers all the feels without any of the angst. Never expected a medical genre with a team of highly qualified surgeons playing in a band, with no discernible plot lines would be a recipe for success. But the pure simplicity of it all made it an unforgettable masterpiece centred on the lives of:

Ik Jun, the carefree, funny man, lead singer, doting father, matchmaker and guardian angel
Song Hwa, the only female of the quintet, cool, personable, professional, perfect role model
Jun Wan, the sensible, arrogant but caring surgeon with a sexy side
Suk Hyung, mama boy but with deep empathy for his patients
Jung Won, generous, loving paediatrics surgeon conflicted between wanting to save lives, serving God and his growing attraction to Gyeo Wool

Each character in Hospital Playlist is done just right. Hard to pick one favourite over another. Love them all but the fellow romantic in me with a penchant for unrequited underdog love stories, Gyeo Wool's story tops it among the supporting characters. Despite being highly sought-after as the only GS resident, she remains humble, steadfast and hardworking even after being rejected by Jung Won. She reminds me of Jang Geu Rae's character in Misaeng.

This one is for keeps! Can't wait for Season 2.

Shin PD back at it again with another one!
At this point, I no longer watch Shin PD’s dramas because of who they cast but because of the creators themselves. What the creators do really well in this drama is hook you in and make you feel emotionally attached to the characters that it LITERALLY hurts to see it end.

Nothing in this drama was rushed. You get to witness how important each character is and how intertwined every one is. They give you enough time to experience, appreciate, love and understand each character. Though it was only 12 episodes, the creators were successful in making the viewer feel like you’ve known them for a lifetime. (Fret not, they are confirmed for season 2!)

Overall, this drama was fun, unpredictable and refreshing. If you enjoy dramas that are light and NOT stress-inducing, has good music/osts, great character chemistry and visuals, this is the drama for you.

I know this show is still airing, I've watch so far 7/12 episode, but I wanna share my opinion on this first half of the drama.

1. The cast is top, I'm watching this drama just for the cast honestly, I didn't even took the time to read the summary cause Jung Kyung Ho is one of my favorite actor so fidelity oblige. I glad to see Jo Jung Suk and You Yeon Suk too. So the cast is really good.

2. The story line is basic, there is not something memorable, a easy going drama to watch on a sunday afternoon or between 2 intense drama. I'm sad to say that I don't wait with impatience and restlessness so next episode. Relationship aren't very exceptional, too much action aren't really well elaborate. And I saw it will be a second season ? But whyyyy ? What will happen ?

3. The music, by reading the title of the drama I excepted better music and the music to be in the center of the story with hospital stories but none, just some cover of songs. Even practice and repetition of the band doesn't make importance.

Don't misunderstand me, I like this drama. I really do but I just don't understand why people feel it exceptional. It's just an easy going and lovey-dovey drama. I'm really waiting more for the second half of this drama so to be waiting the 2nd season. Just to remember that's my personal opinion, maybe I'm wrong that's just how I feel !!!

I have loved all the other series by these writers - all the Reply series and Prison Playbook. I really just expected.....more...from this story. It felt incomplete at the end -- I'm sure it's because they've set up a second season, but that is not why I watch Korean drama. I want a complete story.

The acting from the main cast was top notch - Jo Jung Suk is always a treat to watch as is Jung Kyung Ho. They did an excellent job, as did the others - no complaints at all for the acting. It was fantastic.

The music - from the band was a nice touch, but was a really strange addition to the story. It just seemed like some random thing thrown in even though it was fun.

There really didn't seem to be a real plot line, but just a bunch of stories about a group of friends who happen to work in a hospital. I did love the friendship between the characters and that was probably the show's strong suit and what I think these writers do very well. There were lots of loose ends that I wanted to see tied up that were left undone, hopefully that will be resolved next season. I'll end up having to read a bunch of recaps (because I don't have time to watch the whole thing over again) to refresh myself on what happened.

Anyway, I didn't hate the show - I enjoyed it but am bummed that it didn't feel completed. And I'll have to admit that towards the end, the excitement started to fade for it - like it was fine to wait several days to watch the newest episode.
(Sorry for all those that gave this a 10/10 - I wanted to love this and maybe I'll love it more when it's finished.)

A Transcendent Depiction of Beautiful Friendship and Romance
This is truly a one of a kind drama, and everyone knows it. Whether it's the unrivaled writing, authentic acting, or perfect production, the show delivers in every area. Supported by an emotional OST and an interesting story, it's truly everything you could ever want. Even for those who aren't interested in the premise, I implore you to give this show a try. The incredibly realistic and enjoyable dynamic between the main friends is so intoxicating I literally had to stop watching the show for a while so I didn't get too attached to the characters (which of course I did anyway). This show is such perfection that I'm literally at a loss for words, which will make this the shortest review I've ever written. It boils down to two words:

Watch it. I don't care who you are and what you like, but you owe it to yourself to experience this masterpiece.

Ahem. So yes, I recommend this.

Fun, Unique and Brilliantly written.
Short: Medical drama following five long-time friends at the same hospital but in different disciplines. Each dealing with life and death, and then gathering together to play music in a band that never performs publicly. Great music throughout. Happy moments and sad moments cleverly woven together to the conclusion of Season 1. Doesn't feel like a cliffhanger ending or cut-short story. As always, when the kids are on screen, they steal the show. :)

Detail:
This one was so different, it's a medical drama and in that respect it's a fairly predictable set of cases for each of the cast to deal with some of which are going to have happy endings and some sad endings. Where this one stands out however is the unique production and direction, and the way the writer has woven these episodes together. The inclusion of the band element where they get together and play music as a group but never publicly is really interesting and forms a great release for them to spend time together as a group and forget the worries of their working lives.

Each of the doctors is in their own field, whether it's kids, babies, brains, hearts or general surgery. This leads to a nice variety of different challenges for them to deal with.

For those who are squeamish, it's not bad, a few blurry shots of insides of bodies but honestly not that often.

There's lots of things going on in each of their personal lives, whether it's within the group, with other doctors, or even outside of the hospital altogether. I felt this gave some nice variety.

I held off watching this one because it seemed like it was going to be a half-story waiting for season 2 to finish it much like Love Alarm was - but - that doesn't seem to be the case, while there are certainly some loose threads at the end they are minor and actually some of them are fresh new threads caused by the resolution of previous happenings. There is one that's left open, and had there not been a season two that would have been disappointing but I would have still felt that this show actually did its job well. Great news is that Season 2 is now here, so now that i've just finished bingeing my way through Season 1 I can click ""next"" and see what happens!

The cast are absolutely brilliant, my favourite by a long shot was Jo Jung Suk - all the scenes with his son are an absolute joy to watch, he's a comic genius matched up really well with the young actor playing his son.

Definitely well worth a watch. I'm hopeful Season 2 will be great, but this stands up and (mostly) ends very nicely on its own.

Wholesome, BUT...
Oh, Hospital Playlist. It's wholesome and heartwarming, and ends in a way that's oh so lovely to watch during the holidays (i.e. with a Christmas episode). The five friends are all so lovely (in fact, there really wasn't a single annoying character in the whole series!). I like music, food, and subtle references and jokes to past works / pop culture.

However, this drama suffers from its ties to Netflix, and the awful habit of western shows to drag things on for multiple seasons. My favourite thing about the kdrama format is that shows tend to be contained in 12-20 episodes. I hate that this show ended with a bunch of loose ends and cliffhangers. Only one character had his storyline tied up neatly, argh!! Maybe I should've just waited for season 2 to come out before watching.

The pacing is a bit slow, and I had to hide my face during the operation scenes (because I'm a bit squeamish). But otherwise, this show has all the best characteristics of a Shin Won Ho / Lee Woo Jung collab. There are meaningful scenes set up for maximum payoff later on, some nostalgia, and a wonderful group of friends. Worth a watch for sure.

More than just a medical drama - life, death, happiness, sorrow, love, friendship and more
I'm glad I have finally watched this drama. I was hesitant at first because there are 2 seasons for this drama and I haven't watched medical dramas for a while now. I feel like it's too long however I didn't regret that I invested watching this. At the time of writing, I haven't watched Hospital Playlist 2 yet and I am excited on what kind of memories and experiences will the professors, residents, interns and patients will encounter. The 1st season ended with a lot of cliffhangers.

There are lots of things that I love about this drama. Let me start with the storyline. First of, the story isn't as complicated as most medical dramas. You've get pieces of stories from here and there which will help you see that beautiful image it is trying to create. I love how the writers try to make you feel like you know what will happen but then surprise you with something unexpected. And the best part is it surpasses your expectations everytime. Well played really.

Next thing I love is the characters. There's a LOOOOOT of characters in this drama from the medical staff, patients, and other characters coming in and out every episode. It's really hard to memorize their names however I definitely remember their stories. I was expecting that some of the characters will have shallow stories but I was wrong. Most of the characters have depths of their own and even the patients which is why I think this drama is very emotional. It will definitely make you laugh and cry while watching it. It personally made me reflect about my life and all the emotions I have. The friendship of Mido and Falasol was very dreamy but is definitely the kind of friendship you should experience at least once in your life. One of the charms of this drama is the realistic storyline that is very relatable and since the writer also made sure you know most of the characters, it's easier to understand why they did this, what made them to do that. In short, you understand where the characters are coming from. Super amazing for the casts to really portray their characters and the chemistry among themselves. I can say that the story was given the right justice thanks to the great acting of the casts.

Last but not the least, who would've easily forget the OSTs in this drama. There's just so much feels. I am not sure if the songs were from the late 90's or early 2000's and for sure for Koreans it must've felt nostalgic watching the show and hearing those songs. For me though, it made me really emotional a lot of times. I searched the songs right away and was even singing it along with them while I repeat their band scenes.

I highly recommend this drama. Overall, aside from the tearful scenes I have seen, it's a very feel good drama. I felt like this actually have a healing effect on me. Please do watch this if you have the time.

Heartwarming with an incredible and touching story
Every single part of this series was enjoyable, valuable, and fulfilling to watch and it is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. Everything from the characters, stories, and the musical elements, is definitely worth a watch. This drama was quite simple to follow with not much medical jargon and it's definitely a drama that will tug on your heartstrings. They also showed us how we should all value the small intricate things that life brings us and that we should treasure these moments. Due to this, I believe that this drama feels very different from other shows I've watched in the past. The series made me laugh, cry, smile, and feel sentimental - with a hint of longing to eat some delicious food.

Story
The story itself was quite interesting. I wasn't immediately hooked on the series, but I decided to go ahead with it due to how they would add the musical element into their lives. Medical dramas are not the typical genre I would yearn for watching, but I particularly enjoyed the aspect of the doctors enjoying the company of each other and enjoying every aspect of free time that they individually have. The slice of life drama gives us insight into how important friendship really is and balancing life and work. All of the patient stories were very touching and realistic; also the inspiring stories that followed with it. Everything was executed well and the progress of the drama was extraordinary. This drama paints a realistic depiction of what the life of being in the medical field and working in a hospital setting really is, such as communication amongst patients and their guardians, incompetent and impolite staff, being on-call 24/7, and dealing with the emotional, mental and physical challenges of patient conditions
Although the romance isn't the centre of this drama, I do have to mention that the romance was sweet, mature, and realistic, with no cliche moments

Acting/Cast
Ik Jun - Shown to be the humorous and the 'mood maker' of the bunch, you will definitely favour him for his lighthearted, kind, extroverted and sweet personality. He's known as the 'crazy' one, but that all ties in with his bubbly demeanour I have huge admiration for his character role in this drama series as he balances the life of being a surgeon and a single Father. It was very sweet to see his moments with U-Ju.

Jeong Won - His love, passion, and care for kids was definitely a favourable characteristic of Jeong Won. His caring and compassionate side towards his patients and his subtle caring exterior towards his loved ones were very moving and gave me butterflies. But among that, he's also emotionally sensitive which was quite refreshing to see

Jun Wan - He has a cold, mundane, and outspoken personality that made him slightly intimidating, but as the show progressed, we get to understand more of his tough-love personality and his wish for the best to the ones he cares about. He definitely has a straightforward approach to his relationships as well as his soft side.

Song Hwa - Highly intelligent, tough, and competent, she is the character that we would all admire and feel inspired by. She is the one that holds the group together and ensures the best out of all of them. Her compassion and love for her job are truly amazing and her intuition is remarkable. Although her emotions are not shown much in this drama, I think it made her character more relatable.

Seok-Hyung - Introverted, awkward but also considerate, his non-materialistic and humbleness is what drives me to like his character. His love and value for the small and intricate things in life really moved me. It is quite evident that he treasures the time he has with his best friends from office meals, evening dinners, karaoke nights, and band practices.

I think that each character was loveable in their own ways and thus, I don't have a favourite, because they all shine respectfully. Their friendship goes above and beyond of goals and shows how we should all treasure the moments we have with our friends and look out for those who are really genuine and caring towards us. The selection for the cast was amazing and the actors did an amazing job in depicting the emotions and hardships that they individually portray. This is my first time watching the main cast act so I can't really make a comment on their previous work, but I must say they did exceptionally well
I loved that each supporting role had their moments and stories to share in this series. The relationships that they have with their professors, as well as each other, were memorable and cherishing.

Music
Throughout the show, the cast delivered some great songs that were good. There were some songs that I really found catchy and would listen to again, but others, not so much.

Rewatch value
Again, I am the type that is reluctant to watch a series again, but I would have to watch this again to catch some details of the drama again as I wasn't quite familiar with the drama a few episodes in. This series is deemed as rewatchable to watch the hilarious and valuable experiences that the characters go through.

Overall, I believe that this is one of my favourite slice of life dramas to watch. It's realistic and touching with some amazing chemistry between the characters of the show. Definitely would recommend it if you need something to watch to take a break away from love-triangle dramas, which is what I did.

There’s no way this wasn’t going to wind up high on my list. Fangirl moment: It has Jo Jung Suk and Jung Kyung Ho. I love, adore, will watch anything either of them do. They’re always just so charming and rich to watch. That aside, the creative team behind this show is one of my most dependable. I always watch them because I know I’m going to be treated to heart-felt stories about characters that feel meaningful and real. They did it in the Reply series and they did it in Prison Playbook. Their slice-of-life take on their topics is always touching, humanizing. This show is no different.

As I get older I appreciate stories that focus on characters in their 30s/40s because its nice to see aspects of my own reality reflected back. The world is different at this age than when I was in my early 20s floundering through love. There are hard stories to watch here; one of the doctors works pediatrics. There were tears, and choked up moments because this show is so great at humanizing characters that only show up for a few minutes of screen time.

It’s also great at subverting expectations. There are not really and villains that you’d expect. There are shitty chaebols but also human, endearing ones. People come in a range of good and bad and we get to see them through our loveable group of long-time friends. The show is just the definition of a moving human drama.

With such an amazing cast and great production, the show didn't disappoint.

But with an average rating of 9.3 and many dithyrambic reviews, I was expecting a unique gem. The show wasn't that for me.

The good points :
- Incredible cast and acting : great actors in EVERY main and supporting roles. (Probably the best casting I have ever seen in quantity and quality).
- Solid writing and pacing.
- Beautiful stories, realistic enough characters.

The average or bad points :
- The show was previsible to me (but I watched too many dramas... )
- I skipped some of the band parts (musical parts of the drama) : I didn't like the way it was recorded/mixed and the music didn't move me.
- For a medical drama, it is amazing (although I don't know anything about medecine). BUT there are already many great medical dramas out there, and although the medical parts were amazing, there was not much originality.
- The first season calls for the second with some cliffhangers at the end.

Pure wine
This is most likely the only drama review I'll make in a lifetime. And that's because Hospital Playlist is certainly a drama that'll stay me for life. Friendly summary of everything I loved about it:

- It's hard to beat the greatness of the main five friendship. Their chemistry, understandment and care are just something else.
- It portrays the beauty of life in its root. No flashy heroes, hateful villains or over the top happenings; only life and its greatness, and life doesn't have a planned outline.
- Characters are so well built and compelling, supported by brilliant acting. And I mean all characters, including hospital staff, families and patients. All of them feel important to me, it doesn't matter how big their roles are.
- Again: the acting in this drama is no joke, but rightfully expected from such a great cast. All the care on the process of casting showed.
- The musical breaks are so heart warming and comforting! The OSTs have been in my playlists for months already, and the Aloha karaoke scene remains as my favorite moment in the drama. Plus, props to the actors for making such an effort on actually playing the instruments. No more bad instrument playing cringe on dramas, please!
- It only gets better with time. By the time of this review, I've watched season one 8 times, and it's amazing how the show hooked me more the more I watched and understood its elements.
- The CRAZY amount of details and consistency. The amount of information (specially in the first couple of episodes) can be overwhelming at first, but it's full of meaningful scenario, characters and background details. It's impressive, really. Rewatch value is so high on this one!
- It's so full of emotions and realness. The work put here by all the actors and production must be commended. I sincerely want to thank all of them for making such a masterpiece.

I could go on and on about it, but this is already too lengthy. It's unbeliavable to me how Hospital Playlist could climb my favorites list right away, but I'm so happy it did. This is my comfort show and I can't get over it. Season 2, please come fast!

Mature, skillful writing, direction, and acting that inspires
This is my current all-time favorite drama. Although it's a medical drama, it resists going down the melodramatic path and really strives for a sense of hope. It gives us a glimpse into the lives and meaningful friendships and relationships between very smart professionals. You get to know every character, including all the supporting cast, in amazing depth. It's light in the sense that you're not crying over dead people every moment and it isn't plot driven so some would say the pace is slow, but it's so very deep around the characters' love and support of each other that you are never bored. All the characters are written in a mature way without silly angsty features, which is refreshing. There is magic in every interaction and conversation. And there's an overlay of confidence, humbleness, and making good, moral decisions so the entire show radiates hope and inspiration that you feel like striving to emulate when you watch it.

If you are looking for mature stories, amazing writing, and great acting, this is it. This is the ONLY drama I've rewatched more than twice, and without skipping ANY scenes. It's. That. Good.

The only thing I would have liked to change would be at least one more female in the main cast. It does pretty much balance out because there are a couple strong female supporting characters but having only 1 main female lead out of 5 is disappointing.

And if you've seen this show, you should check out the many behind the scenes videos online. You gain so much respect knowing how they made the show, how skilled the director is, and all the skills the actors had to learn.

In a COVID world where hope is sorely needed, I can't wait for the next season of inspirational relationships! I have a feeling it will take a very long time for another show to take the place of HP as my most favorite show ever.

Okay. I started watching this drama without reading anything about it (well except the actors and director). Didn’t really know how the story will go or what. So half way thru the first episode I kept looking for answers to questions I have in mind - what’s the story? Who’s the main lead? Who’s the protagonist? Antagonist? What would be the main problem? Main love line? Etc. So when the first episode ended, I was quite surprised. I realized that I may have misinterpreted this drama. This drama is simply about the lives of five friends who happened to be doctors and are working in the same hospital.

Seeing that this was the plot (reminded me of reply series tbh), it made me feel refreshed. Initially I postponed watching it when it first aired because it will only air one episode per week and I cannot stress enough how I anxious I think I will be while waiting for the next episode. But I easily gave in, I started watching when episode 3 or 4 was out.

It’s not your typical medical drama where everyone keeps cockblocking the career of others for their own advantage. And where one episode is dedicated to just solely treating a patient.

I love the friendships of every one in this drama. Starting from the five main leads, the doctors in the hospital and of course, the “oldies” (the mothers and the chairman). They really complement each other. But of everyone my most favorite character would Ikjun. He’s just so funny and mature at the same time. A good father, a good friend, and I believe he is a good lover.

Love love love the OSTs as well!!! The voice of Jo Jungseok is really something!!! Daebak!!!

The ending was such a cliff hanger. Can’t wait for the next season!!! Hopefully it’ll be out next year. And really hoping that they will still be the leads for the next season.

Definitely one of the best dramas I have watched to this day. This series got everything. They have a romance for 5 different couples, they have family relationships, doctor and patient relationships, personal struggles of each of our characters, and the best of friendships.

We saw each character’s strengths and weaknesses, their inner conflict, and the reality of what they have to go through in their daily lives. Sometimes they need to give bad news to the patient's family and how every bad news also breaks them inside, as they are a human first before they are a doctor. How they have to sacrifice their personal time for patients and how to make time for themselves.

This show does not have a major plot going on, a major villain, a major case to solve, a big secret buried and waiting to be revealed, nothing like that. This is just a story of a few doctors and how they cope with their daily life. Yet I did not find any dull moments for 12 episodes. Every case is interesting, every patient shows a piece of the reality people struggle with. I feel like I watched us on hospital playlist, I watched the stories about humans and I think that's what we need right now.

I am so happy we will get season 2. I will not wait for season 2 just to get the endgame of our beloved iksong couple (even I certainly hope they will end up together), but more than that, I will definitely wait for another patient’s story and the relationship they have with our doctors!

PS: this drama definitely has the best soundtrack ever (other than goblin)!

So, I went into this drama with no real expectations. I didn't hear much hype on it, and I didn't really have any prior knowledge of what it was going to be about, who was in the cast and what the premise of the entire series was. By the ending of the first episode, I remember thinking ""Wow, this reminds me a lot of the Reply series, I love how this is written!"" Alas, only as I have finished it did I realize it was the same writer. No wonder I loved it! Hospital Playlist is similar to the Reply series in only the best aspects, but also distinct on its own. Some great points:

1. The all around feel-good nature of the drama. There aren't ""bad"" character or ""enemies"".
2. The morals and lessons that are taught throughout
3. The character development/interactions between not only the main characters but side ones.
4. The witty and comical bantering between everyone
5. The style in which the writer tries to mislead you into thinking one way and then reveals the underlying truth sometimes not until much much later. Details are important!!

I'm so so excited that Hospital Playlist is getting a second season. I just can't get enough of these characters and I can't wait to see them again soon!

Light drama that takes your stress away
First things first, this drama is a big appreciation for our medical staffs especially now that we are in the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, this is so light and it's perfect as a stress-reliever. If you are tired, overworked, bored, sleepy, you can watch atleast one episode then after that continue whatever you need to do. For my case, it really worked. A few times, I only watched half the episode then continued later. It's not because it is not engaging but it was just really light compared to the ones that keep you in the edge and that's its beauty. There is no major plot, the drama strive no masterpiece, it is just meant to make you smile a little, laugh a little, cry a little and just there to refresh you. The medical aspect is close to reality, not dramatic, just right and some of the stories just hits you naturally especially those in the finale.

But, I do believe that our medical friends will much more appreciate this drama, since, there are technical terms that might be really helpful for them especially to those that are med students. And there are med jokes, I'm sure they'll loved (I am not a med student, I am programmer btw). Overall, this is really nice, I also learned a little on what the doctors do on certain cases.

However, the reason why my rating is not that high, because although it delivered as a light medical drama, I think there is some mediocrity in it, especially in the first two episodes. The first episode was a bit over the place. There are some stories of the patients in those episodes that I just felt like kind of force. I mean, the stories are sad and I cried, but the directing and acting on some of those first emotional scenes weren't delivered very well as I expected. The humor is also there, I laughed but did not buy me off. The editing of the first scene in episode 1 did really seem mediocre in my opinion --but, wait hold up!! Don't be discouraged because episode 3 got me attached to it and have warmed up to their friendship and by episode 4, I am really vibing the drama.

I also want to talk about the romance as its sub-plot, although I enjoyed the ships especially Min Ha and Seok Hyeong, I think this drama would've been really impactful not it almost turn into a shipping club. But, for what it is, I enjoyed its low-key romance.

The likes:
- Jun Wan and Song Hwa best food buddies
- Yang Seok Hyeong, the sweetest teddy bear!
- Min Ha x Seok Hyeong ship (they are my absolutely OTP in this drama!)
- Gyeoul's character development and her motivation of becoming a better doctor!
- The friendship, it is lovely
- Chae Song Hwa best teacher, best girl, best prof
- Ik Jun being the best PR, doctor and a father
- Uju moments (I hope to see more in season 2)
- Jun Wan and Jae Hak friendship development!
- The touching finale
- Its nice OSTs

The dislikes (major spoilers ahead):
- Ahn Jeong Won's shallow character development.
He's a sweet nice doctor, I commend his character for that. But, I don't buy the way he was 'obsessed' of being a priest, maybe not really 'obsess', but the drama did not give a backstory or the main reason why he wanted to become a priest, the whole plot was just there to become some comic relief. It was really shallow for me. I also thought that at least at the end of this season he would realize that God's calling for him is to become a doctor, but he realized mostly because of some 'romantic' reasons. I know not just because of Gyeoul, but let's admit that she is the biggest influence.
- Ahn Jeong Won treatment on Gyeoul that doesn't feel right
- The lowkey jokes about Catholic priests and nuns
- Some transitions of scenes on the drama's first part
- Choi Young-Joon role as the gossip doctor (I really liked him in Flower of Evil but here his only job is to be a gossip doctor, if he's going to be cast again in season 2 I hope to see more involvement in the medical cases^^)

So, that's it. Of course there are things I did not like but you see, there are more things that I liked. I enjoyed the drama, got refreshed by it and appreciated our medical staffs! :) So last words, if you are craving for a romcom, not this one, next. But, if you are in for some medical drama that is light, good, simple with some good friendships and nice feel good music, hop in and this drama might be for you!

I have just finished series 1 and am already at a loss... I will so miss the characters and everyday life of this excellent hospital based drama.
What a refreshing, well written, excellently directed, fabulously paced and realistic programme this is.
It is not at all sentimental, but feels very real and believable ; from the interactions of the main friends and their colleagues and families, to the patients, their problems and the anxiousness of their guardians. There is no overacting, no perfect scenarios, no obvious clichés, but plenty of laughs, some tears and frustrations.
Real doctors, nurses and carers should watch this too, as it portrays the care patients should get, as when they don't, it isn't washed over, but shown honestly and discussed.
The cast has been perfectly chosen and their relationships are very believable and honest.
I cared about all of them, felt invested in every episode and became quickly addicted.
This one of those dramas that stands out, because it is underpinned by talent from every angle; not by special effects, emphasis on gore, over-the-top fight scenes, power crazy CEOs and mistreated characters.
The struggles, tough decisions, stress and bonds of friendship that are played out, are like a breath of fresh air.
I simply cannot wait for 2021 and series 2, and I cannot possibly recommend this drama enough. Simply FABULOUS! Watch it, or lose out ?

I am really not that type of person who'll write a review. I have been using mdl for years and this is my first time to write one.

First of all, the story is so good. The writer and PD never fails to amaze me. The cast is so perfect - they portray their roles very well to the point that you'll think that's really their personalities irl. Especially YYS, I am just in love with him now - I have been watching his dramas even before HP but danggg, this is the first time that I appreciate his visuals and his smile. He got me.

Second,

The FEELS. I cannot describe how I am obsessed with this drama. I cannot seem to get over it. The OST is amazing and do I really have to mention the rewatch value? I mean I have lost count in how many times I have watched it especially the last episode. The emotions are there. I CAN FEEL IT. I CRIED WITH THEM. My Winter Garden heart is happy and satisfied. Can't wait for season 2!

This type of drama would be boring for those who only find entertainment in romance drama. This drama is well-balanced. Everything is here. Friendship, Family, Romance, Mystery (in terms of who ends with who) and Music ofcourse. I watched reviews from real doctors and said that most of the situation showed in the hospital setting was very realistic.

If you want to feel good for yourself, this is the drama best for you. It can make you laugh, cry, angry, annoyed and also flutter your heart. It relays very positive messages unlike most of drama today that only focus on romance and skinship.

Casts' acting was also great that you would sometimes forget that they are just acting while you are watching.
They also put a lot of effort during band session. They had to learn instruments, Mido had to sing badly even when she's a great singer.

OST and covers were so iconic that I play every day and night their cover of Aloha by cool.


Overall, I think this drama added 5 years to my life expectancy. Lol. That's how much I love this drama.

Reply 1988 is one of my favorite Korean dramas. So when I found out the same PD-writer team was doing Hospital Playlist, I was interested to watch this. However, because I loved Reply 1988 so much, I actually did not expect to be equally satisfied with Hospital Playlist. I wanted to see the same feel good relationship from Reply to appear in Hospital Playlist. But at the same time, I didn't want it to be the same.

I shouldn't have worried though. Because this show gave the same feel good relationship I missed from the previous show, but in a different dynamic with the new group. Since the show focuses on adults, the problems they face are different from the Reply series; and I think this makes it great in a different way.

Each character is complex and interesting. And the actors playing them do a really good job. The way they interact is also very heartwarming. It's also good that we get a glimpse of the lives of the people around the 5 main doctors.

I like how the show is a slice-of-life type of drama yet the show isn't dragging. The show is quite fast paced and they don't drag out unnecessary parts. They explained the 'conclusion' of a situation through a simple conversation between characters.

I also enjoyed the band and the music. If gives such an interesting perspective to their relationship outside of work. And the songs were great too. I especially liked that the characters played the instruments for real.

The only problem I have is that there are so many characters so it takes time to familiarize them all. Aside from that, it's a great show.

It does have a hanging ending though. But we have season 2 to look forward to. :)

I like this show because it's really heart warming and extremely RELATEABLE as I'm a med student. And this is one of the dramas that I didn't skipped a second of. Here's my unbiased opinion about this drama?

STORY (9/10) :
Story is really good. It matches the concept of the series. The way they synchronized both the concepts of HOSPITAL and PLAYLIST is great and funny in the same way. I loved the dialogues. Most important thing is that, the story line is realistic and isn't dragged to much. To cut short, it is TO THE POINT!

ACTING/CASTING (10/10) :
TBH , I haven't seen some of the main lead in any other show. For me, personally, the cast is such an important part. I usually watch the dramas of my fav main lead cast only. But I loved the cast of this drama. Their freindship is just LIT. All of them acted really well and conveyed that feeling of being a true doctor, treating their patients, seeing them recovering and becoming happy, feeling their pain . The professors are not only good DOCTORS but good MENTORS as well. I loved not only the character of professors but every single character of the series ?.

Music(10/10) :
I'm a very picky person especially when it comes to music. But I liked the Music they played during the band practice. Although, they are just cover songs and some OSTs, still they were selected wisely according to the situation.

REWATCH VALUE(10/10)
For me, it has a high REWATCH value. I can learn a lot from them again and again. And tbh this series is inspiring me a lot during my journey of becoming a doctor.

I tried to be really unbiased while writting this review. This series is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED even if you aren't someone belonging to medical profession. It will teach you many life lessons and it's fun to watch too!

A K-DRAMA GEM
I have lots of reasons why Hospital Playlist could be considered one of the best K-dramas out there but I'll be presenting my top 5:

5. It Features Diverse Medical Specializations
If you are a fan of medical dramas, then you will surely enjoy this. It features 5 medical specializations: Pediatrics, Cardiology, Obstetrics, General Surgery, and Neurosurgery. The main characters are all surgeons so you will surely get a glimpse of how these modern-day heroes are working.

4. Weekly Band Sessions
I love how they feature a new song in every episode. What's amazing about this is that the main characters are really the one playing the instruments and singing the featured song. Unlike in other dramas/movies, in HP, they really made an effort to cast someone who really knows how to play the instruments and can pull-off the band concept.

3. The Mukbang Scenes
I also did enjoy the scenes where the '99ers (the 5 main characters) and other supporting characters were dining out, eating in the hospital cafeteria and even inside their offices. Makes you crave samgyup and other korean foods while watching them. We all eat and want good food after a long day, right?

2. Love Story
A fan of the Reply series? Then this is another drama for you from the same writer and director. You will surely enjoy (and have a headache) making theories about who will end up with who. This series also shows how love can blossom even for those who are already in their 40s.

1. Slice of life
Friendship. Family. Work struggles. Life decisions. Name it, Hospital Playlist have it. As what the writer aimed how the drama should be, it is definitely relatable. You will surely cry and laugh with them.

Definitely a gem in the 2020 K-drama world. Worth watching! I can't wait to experience all of these again next year in their second season.

A 10/10 in all aspects!

HOSPITAL PLAYLIST IS ONE OF THE FEW GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE EVER HAPPENED THIS YEAR! EVERY EPISODE WAS PERFECTLY WRITTEN THAT WAITING EVERY WEEK FOR A NEW ONE WAS INDEED A TORTURE. THE CAST IS WELL CHOSEN SINCE THEY PORTRAYED THEIR PARTS VERY WELL. THE MORE EPISODES I WATCHED, THE MORE I FELT I WAS PART OF THEM.

THERE WAS REALLY NO EXTRAORDINARY THING ABOUT THIS DRAMA, THE 5 MAIN CHARACTERS AREN'T PRODIGIES IN MEDICINE BUT THEIR PASSION MADE THEM BETTER DOCTORS. THE SINCERITY AND REALNESS IN EVERY EPISODE ARE THE REASONS WHY THE DRAMA EXCEEDED THE VIEWERS' EXPECTATIONS.

WHAT MADE IT BEARABLE TO WAIT EVERY WEEK WAS THE OST OF THE DRAMA. EVERY EPISODE, THE BAND WOULD PLAY A DIFFERENT SONG THAT COULD STIR DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. IT CERTAINLY LIVED UP TO ITS TITLE AS HOSPITAL PLAYLIST.

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR COMEDY, FRIENDSHIP, ROMANCE, SLICE OF LIFE, MEDICAL AND MUSICAL, ALL IN ONE DRAMA, DON'T WASTE ANOTHER SECOND AND WATCH IT ALREADY. BE ONE OF US AS WE AWAIT FOR THEIR REAPPEARANCE NEXT YEAR.

It’s hard for me to put into words how great this show is. It’s likely because I love how the show makes me ~feel~. I felt warm fuzzies every time I watched an episode, a feeling that followed me even after the episode had ended. Later on I would randomly remember scenes from an episode and it would make me smile. All the small things add up in this show, and it sneaks up on you how much you love it.

I think Hospital Playlist portrays the world as it is and also as we wish it could be. Pretty much the entire cast are “good” people, though they can be good in different ways. Even the people we might expect to be antagonists (parents, the hospital director, etc.) genuinely care about other people and generally have good intentions. Is that entirely realistic? Probably not. But I also felt this show was rejecting cynicism; rather than leaning into our pessimistic expectations of who people are and how they act, the show consistently showed us that most people are kind hearted. So I really appreciate the world that the show portrayed. Instead of trying to be as “realistic” as possible, it decided to show humanity at its best.

The show’s relative simplicity is one of its biggest strengths. The setup is simple: 5 friends who met in medical school are now all doctors at the same hospital. The plot revolves around ordinary days in their lives. Simple, right? Yes and no. The “complexity” lies in the various relationships between the characters both as a group and individually. There is a sprawling cast of all the other hospital staff and family members, so there are a lot of characters to learn about initially. But I wouldn’t describe any of the relationships as complicated; it’s more that there are a variety of them. The relationships between the main 5 are the most fun and interesting, and they really are the heart and soul of the show. The times when they played together as a band (which happens every episode) were consistently one of the times when the warm fuzzies would sneak up on me and I’d feel so happy just watching them play music together. The show does a great job of making the relationships feel real. It shows you how much the characters care about each other, often in very small and subtle ways. It happens in moments when they’re just eating together or hanging out in each other’s offices. I love how the show portrays platonic relationships between so many male and female characters, it’s genuinely great to see a guy and girl care about each other and it not being framed as romantic. The entire cast is awesome and contribute their own little heartwarming and heartbreaking moments. No one really served as (the only) comic relief in this show; everyone had times where they made me laugh out loud. I love all of them so much, and there’s the magic of this show: it manages to make you care about every single one of them, while seemingly not trying.

I don’t know how else to describe how great this show is because it just is. Please do yourself a favor and watch this show as soon as possible.

I made a little silly powerpoint review on Tumblr if you'd like to read it: https://kdramakitty.tumblr.com/post/621054541113294849

""You can't do epic things with basic people""
I'm hoping most of those who watched and plans to watch this already finished Reply 1988. Can't help being reminded of it as I'm watching every episode. Although, no worries since it doesn't give off the copycat feels. Just that lightness and that goofy friendship the characters have. I'm really digging those long term friendship. How lucky they are to have met each other and were still able to stay at each other's lives through the years.

""Friendship is the comfort of knowing that even when you feel alone, you aren't. ""
It shows just how much being with the right people makes hardships bearable.One of the beautiful qualities of friendship is to understand and be understood, and you can really see it in the characters. They have so much understanding for each other as they also know what kind of person each one is. You'll end up loving and wanting each of them as a friend after really knowing their hearts when it comes to the point when they are faced with obstacles - and that is also something real that was shown in the drama. At first you may not like every characters, it may show their not-so-good sides, and in reality it happens, you can never judge a person at your first encounter, you can only try to understand and think outside of the box, because when the time came that a person face something of significance for them, only then can they be vulnerable enough to show what is really is inside of them.

We live a different and unique lives, each of us does. We're facing different problems that may have different effect to other's lives. It is important to always put yourself on the shoes of the others and be sensitive enough of other's feelings. In this drama you can really understand the importance of this, just as they face different kind of patients, different families and in different situations. It didn't lack on anything, they'll show you the positive and negative scenes of life.

This is giving me the BIGGEST BONUS EVER - seeing the characters in a band. Oh yes it is just right for them to put this at the end part, it'll make you feel light after all the hassles of their working lives, just as we deserve as well. If you want to watch something that would make you feel alive again, this is one of it.

Another living proof why k-medical drama is a god tier
it's a fun coincidence that I finished watching this on it's first year anniversary. The reason I watched this is because its rank number one slot on mydramalist, which really deserves the slot. Korean medical drama is my cup of tea so I enjoyed watching this show.

STORY & CAST

Heartwarming and inspirational drama. Hospital Playlist gives me too much positivity in life. Also, the show offers a well-packed medical field of professions. Giving us a thoracic surgeon, pediatrician, obstetrician, neurologist, and a general surgeon, all in one medical show.

I don't know if the absence of a villain character in the story is a good thing or a bad thing. Good because it's not typical compare from other shows and just mainly focus on being a light drama. Bad thing because I guess there is no stable or concrete problem to be solve and suspense the viewers.

The show made me admired doctors and health workers more. I gained too many lessons from both medical field and real life lessons.

Not too much fan of romance. I am neutral on the romance explicit in the story. But Jung Won and Gyeo Wool is an exception. I love how their love story revolved. Also, Chi Hong one sided love towards Song Hwa makes me sad but gives me butterflies at the same time. I do hope that Song Hwa will fall for him on season 2.

The main characters' friendship is strong and reliable. Even with their individual differences, they perfectly bond together.

ACTING

I don't have anything bad to say about their acting because every one of them nailed it and delivered the role in a natural way.

MUSIC

The band members are too talented. I love how they stick with their title Hospital Playlist, performing songs every episodes is too artistic.

OVERALL

I gave this a 9/10 rating because I was not really attached with it and I feel like something is missing. Many casting or characters has its own pros and cons.

I'm excited for the second season.

EP12 of #HospitalPlaylist has to be one of the most stressful EP in the series. Though I loved each and every second of it. Waited a whole week for just 1EP, it was worth it. Each and every moment was beautiful.
The beautiful friendship among the 5 is what I live for. Their amazing friendship, their band practices, the relationship among each & every character, be it- couples, families or b/w hospital staff. Loved how casual they were with senior doctors & director o the hospital. The interactions with patients was beautiful.
The last EPs did start many relationships, we will definitely see further development among these. I'm so happy Jung-won isn't going to be a priest, Song-hwa would be gone for a year, please return after full recovery. And last I want to thank all the production staff, writer-nim & all the actors for delivering this beautiful and heartfelt drama that everyone could enjoy and relief all their stress.

Cannot wait for next season. What will I do till then?

Good Quality Kdrama
I really enjoyed watching this Kdrama. Even though the first episodes were kinda confusing (I shold mention: this was my first medical drama) since I didn't understand how the whole hospital staff hierarchy works, the story really grew into me. The characters are all very different and unique, and you can surely find someone you can relate to. Overall this kdrama is enjoyable, funny at times, full of friendships moments that will make you desire to have that kind of relationship with someone. Would surely recommend.

Pleasantly nice drama
Since it's a hospital drama, I expected it to have hospital politics and lots of surgeries. But this drama had very few hospital politics, and instead of the surgeries, it depended mostly on the conversation of the information to the guardians about the patients. This is where it differs from the other hospital dramas. Moreover, this drama focuses more on the 5 long-time friends and the rest of the time, it's just about the other doctors and doctors-to-be, along with their romantic life. Overall, it was a nice watch, considering all the funny moments to the tone-deaf singer to all those munching moments.

Hospital Playlist Is Like a Warm Blanket On a Cold Night!
There have been a number of ""hospital shows"" over the years. And yet, with so many, Hospital Playlist is unique. Why? Because it sticks with its strengths: chemistry between the five leads and staying away from the typical hospital politics.

Instead, Hospital Playlist is about people. It's about how we, as people, can endeavor to treat others just a little bit better; to put ourselves in the other person's shoes rather than resort to snap judgments. If you remember Patch Adams, you'll find that--for these five doctors at Yuji Medical Center--the people matter more than the disease or injury. In other words, it no longer pays to be indifferent and to block out natural emotions.

Hospital Playlist is actually a fairly light show. Yes, it has some tense moments, but overall, it never gets bogged down in melodrama. Instead, it relies upon the unique chemistry of the five doctors who've known each other since medical school. And once a month, they get together and sing a song. Hence, the Hospital Playlist.

Each doctor specializes in a certain field. First we have Ik-Jun, who is a general surgeon but specializes in the liver and liver transplants. He's the lead singer of the group, and in many ways, he's the glue of the group. He's the first to crack a joke or do something humorous to lighten the tension. And Jung-Suk Jo is masterful at this! He's got as much talent for comedy as he does for singing. He never takes things too seriously. His job is important, but treating his staff and his patients with respect is always of utmost importance to him.

Next we have. Song Hwa who is a neurosurgeon. She's kind, dedicated, and a bit of a workaholic. HIlariously enough, she's someone who THINKS she can sing, but she can't. Actress Jeon Mi Do is actually a professional singer, so to see her purposely sing out of tune is impressive.

Seok Hung is the somewhat aloof but dedicated gynecologist in obstetrics. He's every bit as caring about his patients and staff even though it's not always obvious.

Jun Wan is the brilliant cardiologist who can appear cold but to characterize him this way would be a disservice. Underneath the tough exterior is a man with a heart who believes that hard work and dedication is a key to success.

Last, but certainly not least, we have Jeon Wong Ahn, the professor of pediatrics. Nurses and parents alike adore him for his unique way of handling children. He relates with them. He talks with them, and he never sees them as just another patient.

There are many touching and heartfelt moments throughout the series as we journey along with them through the days, weeks, months, and even years. Don't be surprised if you find yourself shedding a few tears one moment and then roaring out loud with laughter in the next. That's the Hospital Playlist. In the end, it provides comfort. It provides hope that people can still treat each other with respect, with compassion, and with empathy.

If you're a music lover, you'll find a cache of great songs, all sung and performed by the characters. At the end of each episode of Hospital Playlist, we are reminded not to take life so seriously. We're reminded that life is supposed to be joyous and fun.

At some point, I will definitely want to re-watch this great series. So, if you're looking for something that is light, with many feel-good moments, as well as many hilarious ones, I'm sure you love Hospital Playlist!

When I tell you this drama is what the word ""healing"" means, I am not exaggerating. It's a slice-of-life drama with a group of doctors that have been friends since college. This drama made me feel all emotions and pretty much made me cry every episode. It tells stories of a lot of patients that each doctor gets and they're all so emotional and make you think a lot about moral values. This drama even got the comedic aspect perfect. The characters, main and sub, all have hilarious moments throughout the episodes. And don't even get me started on the band scenes. Watching the band scenes makes me feel pure happiness and my mouth gets dry because of the smile on my face. I still listen to the OSTs and I would totally rewatch it until I die.

major friendship goal
●HOW I CAME TO IT
This drama was so hyped during the release, that I barely tried to watch it because of all the spoilers everywhere. And with the release of the second season, which is still running but I see no hype, I decided to watch the first season and I don’t have to wait for the second season.

●PLOT VIEW
Story of five friends who studied in same medical university comes to work at the same hospital. They form a Band as a condition of one friend to work at the hospital. This eventually keeps them together while juggling the hardships of daily life as a doctor. all of them gathering for food, music but the best was being there during the morose.
While there also touching snippets of patients which sometimes put the doctors in an awkward position and sometimes left them crying.
The hierarchy of the hospital is clearly visible but this didn’t make the series any dramatic, it was rather fresh seeing how the seniors resident poached the interns to choose their specialty. I reminisced my intern days in the Operation Room and how the seniors bossed around and super seniors asked to join the same specialty. The dreams of the medical student, to first OR experience as an intern, the first case, the first car just gives a meaningful peek of life of doctors.
The endless gossips in the cafeteria contributing to the fantastic five-story revelation was different which also showed other doctors are equally important hence a more progressive story is built with these characters.

●ACTING/CAST
In fact, the characters are all likable
Jung Kyung Ho as Kim Jun Wan is an excellent performer. His romantic track and all the humorous things he does are at point.
Jo Jung Suk as Lee Ik Jun is the first time I watched him and he took me over with his witty performance. He's believable and has a kind of goofy personality, clever and quick-thinking in his job.
Jeon Mi Do as Chae Song Hwa is a fine artist considering this is her first main lead work. She is talented and has a pace she will go a long way in the future.
Kim Dae Myung as Yang Suk Hyung portrayed his caring mama boy character with excellence.
Yoo Yeon Seok as Ahn Jung Won has seen him in other series as a doctor, he was cute as a pediatrician and did his job well. But considering how strong I have seen him, this was my least favorite one.

●MUSIC
The music was good, I thought it soundtracked each episode with due discretion, never overpowering the scene. All the songs were covers from popular 90’s tracks which also resembles the character reminiscing their university days.

●REWATCH
This drama is so light that I can watch it any day to boost up your mood. If you want you can just watch one episode and it will give warmth.

●FAV SCENE
Lee Ik Jun and his son's moments are my favorite moments from the show.

●APPRECIATION
There's an ever-present light undertone to the drama which I personally found charming. No trace of melodrama is to be found so that you can watch with due expectations. Rather than cliche life and death situation in hospitals, it emphasizes the humanism of the professionals.

●RECOMMENDATION
Anyone who likes friendship-themed series, this is highly recommended. It's also a good one to be watched with the whole family.

●AFTERTHOUGHT
Considering this drama can be watched with a single episode without any urge for the next episode I decided to watch season 2. yeah there are no spoilers which are excellent and also the season1 ended with a cliffhanger. So I am in time to watch season2.

Heartwarming slice-of-life show
It would be difficult to describe in works how amazing and likeable this show and these characters are. It definitely gives off a vibe of “I want what they have”. It showcases the better and more idealistic side of both the medical profession and friend groups. The musical score is very well done and they’ve truly gone all out creating an official band and recording cover songs in a studio. Shoutout to the female characters for being excellent portrays of strong, professional women.

There isn’t much to the plot really, it is mostly just a light, relaxing show. Something pleasant and enjoyable to watch after a long day at work and to forget your troubles as you laugh and cry with these beautifully crafted characters. It is certainly aimed at a more mature audience looking to unwind rather than the typical immature, unrealistic romance dramas or the amazing but time consuming plot heavy shows. HP was one the best shows I’ve ever binge watched, especially during a pandemic.

Reply 1988 but medical
[ Warning! This drama can be boring for some people who love complex or huge conflict in a drama ]
I regret it... I think I just missed an opportunity to have a wonderful time talking about this drama when it was still airing back then in 2020 (I was so into BL that I have no time watching K-dramas). I'm beyond glad to myself for deciding to watch and complete the 1st season when the 2nd season was still airing so I can hype this drama together with my friends and people out there. It is the kind of drama that will HEAL you, this drama itself is a HEALER! It's a light slice-of-life drama with small-fast-resolved conflict and a fluttering + heartwarming rom-com which I genuinely like.

STORY
I love how they try to portray a completely different type of doctor's life and just generally picture how's hospital's life. Its genre is slice-of-life and I really can relate to a lot of them especially when Jang Gyeo Ul often being misjudged by people because of her ""outer character"". That's harsh but it's really happening until this day in our society and could be even worse day by day. I also like how they brought various misunderstanding issues that always happened between doctors and patients/patients' families. It makes me understand both sides more. Not to mention how they also fed us with a perfect-strong-friendship kind of relationship that makes me missed my friends more than ever. In conclusion, this drama gives the viewers not only a story but also a lot of life lessons which is worth watching.

ACTING
All of them are BEYOND GREAT actors. The main characters can pull off any kind of acting, from happy, sad, crazy, angry, etc. they ALL nailed it perfectly, FLAWLESS. I really loved when actors could deliver their feelings through their eyes, that's how I know whether they are great, bad, or so-so. And OH GOD, all of their eyes could talk! Even the support actors and the guest actors are all AMAZING. Absolutely nothing to criticize.

MUSIC
I honestly not really a fan of that 90s-thing-music-genre, but I think that kind of music matches perfectly with this drama to bring us back to their university days and let us also feel how it's like back then with the help from their cinematography. It's nostalgic and somehow feels warm to listen to and watch.

OVERALL
I LOVED THIS DRAMA SO MUCH! It's no doubt my cup of tea.

Very possibly the best Asian drama of all time.
The best Asian drama of all time for me, surpassing even the likes of Reply 1988, The Untamed, Go Ahead, and It's Okay To Not Be Okay (all of which have a very special place in my heart). This entire show - the story, the cast, the soundtrack, the setting - it just makes you feel like home. There's no other way to describe it. It makes you think about the cycle of life and death, of what it means to exist. Being a medical drama, there's this misconception about it being all about the operations, the hospital drama/politics, the conflicts and whatnot. Hospital Playlist couldn't be any more different. While it definitely shows some of those things, the heart of the series lies on the concept of humanity. Of the intricacies of the characters and their relationships with one another. Of the endearing dynamics between the people working in the hospital. More than anything, it talks about life, about how it feels to live doing your best, hoping for the best, and being good and kind to the people around you, all of whom are facing their own struggles every single day. And this show is especially timely to our generation, considering the global pandemic that has changed billions of lives around the world. It is a reminder, a testament of the nobility of health care workers' professions, of the many things that they put on the line, of their dedication and hardwork, of their humanity. Hospital Playlist is akin to a tidal wave in a deep ocean. It presents itself slowly, calmly, quietly -- until, all at once, it engulfs you and pulls you into its depths. Its beauty lies in its stillness, and beneath that peaceful front is an entire ocean rich with story. The creator/s of this series truly has struck the perfect balance of everything that an excellent show needs to have. That feeling when everything just falls perfectly into place? THAT encapsulates what this drama's all about. Like a lyric from one of Taylor Swift's songs, ""This is the golden age of something good and right and real."" I can't emphasize enough how this show is a MUST-WATCH for anyone. This is such a special show, a once-in-a-lifetime celebration of everything - both the good and the bad, but hopefully, more of the good -- that life has to offer. A revelation. A cultural reset. A moment in history.

You've got to be in the right mood to appreciate Hospital Playlist
Hospital Playlist is an objectively good watch, but it's got some heavy topics and every episode can leave you feeling a bit down because it portrays the ugly, natural parts of life that we deal with on a day-to-day basis.

I tried watching Hospital Playlist a couple of times, but I never stuck with it - I just wasn't in the right mood to appreciate it. This last time I was finally in the right state of mind - I had to watch it casually and NOT binge watch it. Over the course of about 2 weeks I finished it.

The acting is good and the chemistry between the friends helps bring the mood back to less sad, but there's still a lot of real life dragging down the genre to a true melodrama.

At this time, I'm not committed to Season 2, but mostly because I don't want to feel sad while watching TV, not because I think the season won't be good.

***As a warning, some of the characters and the dilemma's they face can be very triggering for some people, based on context. For example, if you are someone who has experienced difficulties with pregnancy/labor, the Ob/Gyn scenes could hit a bit too close to home.

Just press play >
This review isn't going to be long; my rating above is a testament that I'll be unable to justify the beauty of this writing with a lengthy review.

My thoughts after watching:

I can’t understand why I didn’t watch such a beautiful drama sooner.

Each and every character has breathed life into the show and portrayed their role admirably.

Hospital Playlist has everything you need in a good drama: the music, the story, the characters and that 'slice of life' feel - and as the Korean title refers, this show portrays “the lives of wise doctors” brilliantly. Every single episode takes the viewer on a journey through, story, friendship and song.

Go watch this if you haven't already.

Trust me, you won’t regret it.

The five main leads were well casted!
Hospital Playlist's main leads were well-casted!!! Especially, Jo Jung-suk as Lee Ik-jun, he is hilarious, sociable, and a loving father; I would re-watch the whole drama to just have a good laugh. Aside from the comedy of the drama, the seriousness of every scene about onto the patients, residents, and professors are well-researched and skillfully written. The writer, Lee Woo-Jung, no only wrote the Reply Series but also the Prison Playbook, I knew that Hospital Playlist will be worth the watch and it is. I just found out that Writer Lee is the screenwriter of variety shows such as Youn's Kitchen, Youth Over Flowers, and many others. This drama has the feels that is truly relatable in many ways, as a student, patient, family member, etc. An incredible piece of art!

A heartwarming, feel-good drama for a chill weekend...
This drama was marked as ‘Not Interested’ by me and for ages, I ignored the signs to watch it. My dad watched it and loved it. My friends watched it and loved it. Even Netflix has recommended it multiple times since its release and I stubbornly refused to watch it.

It was only after binging Dr. Romantic and Dr. Romantic 2 in a week that I finally wanted to start this drama. But no! Season 2 was airing and I would have to wait until SEPTEMBER to watch Season 2 so no, I must not start Season 1. What if I can’t wait for all of Season 2 to air once I finish the first season? (I plan to watch the rest of S2 as it airs)

So I put it off. At this point, it was difficult. Netflix showed Hospital Playlist at the top of every list they could think up. As expected, who has that much self-control when the drama you want to watch is basically being served on a platter? So obviously, I watched it.

Upon further research after watching Ep 4, I found that the writers are the same as Reply 1988! It was yet another one that I had put off for YEARS until a few weeks ago and which I love as well, but I digress. And armed with this knowledge, these Easter eggs stood out more to me, from a few seconds of the OST or even a cameo from the Reply 1988 cast. It was nice to see them. My only gripe is the timeline of Hospital Playlist (set in 2019) and Reply 1988 don’t fit particularly well (so that character cameos don’t quite make sense) but I can overlook that for fangirling’s sake.

So what do I like about this drama? Honestly, the list would go on and on. Every scene was meaningful. I could feel emotions for each character, as minor as they each are. But most of all, I love that this drama is mostly slice of life. There’s no super-evil villain out there to destroy what our MCs have built up, and the plot mostly revolves around the lives of our MCs. It’s heartwarming and fun, almost like I’m with my own group of friends that I haven’t seen in a while. I like that it’s not ridiculously fast-paced and suspenseful like other medical dramas, but more realistic, kinda like how one would expect a doctor’s job to be like at a big hospital: dealing with anxious patients, irritating colleagues that don’t pull their weight as well as night shifts, emergency calls, etc.

The finale wasn't my cup of tea, but watching this in 2021, I know there is a 2nd season that will hopefully address the things that the writers left to the audience's imagination. But it wasn't too bad, definitely cheering on a romance between a certain professor and resident!

The *main* thing I don’t like about this drama is probably the fact that the cast is MASSIVE! I felt so confused keeping track of names and faces and honestly, I even forgot the names and faces of characters if they got an outfit change. However, it’s completely understandable why there was such a big cast though. A hospital as big as Yulje would likely have even more doctors, nurses and patients in real life, so I really can’t fault this drama at all.

Other than that, the acting is spot-on, I loved how the actors really brought out their characters, and I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack! Using a song in each episode was really smart! The songs picked really fit the main events in each episode, plus, I got to expand my music taste, so no complaints there!

As for watching it again, I would definitely go through it all again. For this watch, I would argue that I’ve binged it since I finished all of it within a week. BUT, if I’m going to watch it again, I would probably wait a year or so, and then go through the episodes slowly, maybe a few episodes every weekend or something like that. It’s definitely not one that I would binge again.

If you got to the end, thank you for reading this review, and apologies for all the faff…

A darn great drama
Alright i have rewatched this show like 20 times im not even kidding i really love this show so so so much

Honestly on my very first watch i was very very confused because the writers and director like to make things go slowly to make it more realistic that's how i intepreted it, so i was like oh alright

Then it all came together and i was like MINDBLOWN

I'm super shocked at how the writer can write all these stories out and make them all come together like wow what kind of talent!!!!!!!

I love how they don't add a cliffhanger to every episode's ending because 1 episode per week will KILL especially it ends with a cliffhanger.

BUT behold they ended the season with a cliffhanger pls i will take the episode end cliffhanger over a 1 year wait anytime i really suffered during the 1year wait Hahahah

THE OSTS ARE JUST SO DAMN GOOD i really love confession is not flashy so much its like my top 5 on spotify and this drama is just so different by making their cast sing the osts every episode, it felt like a flashback to the 1990's

Talking about flashbacks the flashbacks were sooooooooooo good

All the main couples were so perfect, but i have to give it to iksong, i totally did not expect them to be each other's love interest because ikjun was married at the start and songhwa was dating someone

Iksun and junwan were just so cuteetete

Bear couple was not very developed in this season but theyre cute still HAHA

Hospital Playlist is not for those who like makjang dramas.
I found this drama during the times that I am on the verge of giving up. This might sound generic to you but when I watched this one, I never expected that it will gave me that kind of belongingness despite of the culture differences. I owe my life to this drama and to the entire casts. Thank you for saving me. I love you!!!!!!!!!!

BEAUTIFUL IN ITS PORTRAYAL OF THE ORDINARY...
Though I do hate medical-related stuff, I am fascinated by the lives of doctors and residents working in a hospital and have never have watched a medical drama before though I have always been interested. Due to the rave reviews of Hospital Playlist on social media, I decided to check it out since it is on Netflix anyways.

Relaxing and comforting. Just regular people living their everyday lives. And that's what makes it beautiful. I get the same feeling when I watch Terrace House. It's beautiful seeing the deep relationships that form between medical students, residents, doctors and professors all working towards the same goal, to help better the lives of others. I cannot wait to see the second season!

I can see why some people were unsure to continue watching as this drama throws you right in the middle of the character lives, so you are kinda disoriented and confused, especially when so many names of people you don't know gets dropped. However, you quickly get used to it and are exposed to something ordinarily beautiful. You feel like you are a part of these character lives.

On a side note, it's an interesting dichotomy. Doctors are highly respected in society, but they can also be treated quite poorly, being at the mercy of their patients and their families, often getting yelled at and harassed by them. Sometimes, even having to profusely apologize for unintentional oversights or being unable to save a patient. This series shows both aspects.

Not your typical medical drama
I absolutely loved the drama. I rewatched it about 7 times I guess. This is absolutely not your typical medical drama. The drama depicts medical officers as ordinary people. Drama revolves around everyday life of 5 best friend doctors.
Don't let the first episode fool you. You might think drama is clumsy. But it is not. You'll get to experience different kinds of romantic relationships as there are 5 leads here. From mature relationships to lovebird relationships.
The drama has its own fun element too. You can laugh out loud. And you can cry out loud as well. The drama will give you an emotional rollercoaster depending on which episode you are watching.
The actors and actresses are doing their job well. Of coarse there are 5 main characters. So a lot can happen during a single episode. I feel very single character(major / minor) is important to this drama. They make the drama worth watching.I love their acting and their dedication to their roles. Leading characters had to learn musical instruments for the drama. And they all play the songs themselves. They even have a band called ""Mido and parasol"" now.
Speaking of musical instruments, I have to mention about the OSTs. They are absolutely amazing. I love everything single one of them. This drama has the best OSTs among 25+ kdramas I have ever watched. Every episode of the drama has a band scene. So you get to listen to a lot of music. Because this is Hospital PLAYLIST. And this is my fav playlist.
I can't wait for the season 2.

I must say, I'm not a fan of anything medical. I hesitated on starting this drama a lot and kept asking my friend if I should. I'm grateful she said yes.

I kept falling for each friend in the group! Probably had huge attachment issues to them so I could not wait for more episodes. Personally, I enjoyed this more than Reply 1988 just a little bit more because I love the stories between the patients and doctors (a huge fan of love between people -- weird way to call it, but truly what I most value in life). Hospital Playlist delivered, exceeded our expectations and probably changed our lives too.

In short, my all time favorite Kdrama.

When Scrubs meets Reply 1988
Just love for this show. This drama reminded me of the American medical sitcom Scrubs with a slighty more emotional touch (nothing too excessive, just the right amount). This drama's biggest plus I believe is the cast. The actors are so well-chosen and the whole cast delivers such a great performance that whatever future project the actors may act in, you will not be able to unsee their Hospital Playlist character. They didn't act, they lived their characters.

So realistic, so balanced, so well-written. And here I thought I'd seen everything medical dramas had to offer, but no Hospital Playlist taught me better.

my HEART. the FEELS.
My first review ever! :D
Not sure how this will go, but let's dive into it.

I've watched many dramas before, but Hospital Playlist is the first one I watched while it was airing. The first time I heard about this drama was when Yoo Yeon Seok got casted, and because I really enjoyed Romantic Dr. Teacher Kim, I was curious to see how he would perform in this one. So, I started watching the first episode on Netflix as per a friend's recommendation and was immediately hooked. In the span of that first hour-and-a-half-ish, I cried so much and laughed so hard. I knew right then and there that Hospital Playlist would become one of my favorite - if not favorite - dramas.

As the episodes progressed, I found that I really came to love each character featured in the story. I came to appreciate their roles in the overarching narrative of the drama, and especially loved the way writer-nim and PD-nim had them interact with the main cast (Kim Jun as Uju was especially adorable!) One thing that I really noticed was the chemistry between cast members. I think altogether they were able to portray a realistic and relatable story that truly truly warmed my heart.

Another thing that made this drama enjoyable for me was that there was no dramatic conflict-inducing incidents that are common in a lot of K-Dramas (i.e. hospital politics, a murder, chaebol families disagreeing to a relationship, etc.). The essence of this drama was really just the lives of the doctors and medical staff at Yulje Medical Center, and how they pour their hearts and souls into making sure that their patients receive the best care.

I would rate this show infinity/10 if that was possible at all. I cannot fathom how much I actually love this drama. I have the casting directors to thank for introducing me to such amazing actors - I'll definitely be looking out for more of their (future) work!

If you're like me and enjoy slice-of-life type dramas, and want an easy-going drama to watch, you would definitely enjoy Hospital Playlist. That being said, I can't wait for Season 2 to be released and to find out more about how relationships between some of the characters will develop <3

When the drama was first announced I was so excited because a) Yoo Yeon Seok, Jo Kyung Ho, Jo Jeong Seok are three of my favourite people in KDramaland, b) This was coming from the creators of the Reply series. I was like, ""Sign me up""!!

But several episodes into the drama, I almost dropped it. I'm not saying that I did not enjoy the drama, because I did. But it was just at the moment of watching an episode. After watching one, I had to find the motivation to watch the next week's episode. Why would I force myself to watch it if I don't like it? I usually would not have. But I really did like all the characters, Junwan was my favourite followed by Seokhyung, and I wanted to know what happened to them, to all the couples I shipped (Please don't hate me, but WinterGarden was not one of them). And when the final episode aired I was so relieved that it was over.

I tried to keep my rating as objective as possible because despite everything it really was a good drama, and I just happened to not like it as much as everyone else did.

A MASTERPIECE!

A rare medical drama that goes beyond the wall of hospital. This is a story of friendship and slice of life of 5 ordinary yet extra ordinary doctors. This drama will teach you a value of family, how to treat and be patient with other people, teach you to be more understanding, take a pause and be brave at the same time.

Kudos to the director, screenwriter, staff and the actors for a well executed drama that even the anticlimactic scene becomes exciting and enjoyable to watch.

The supporting actors and their characters are also outstanding that I even gets excited to get a glimpse of their story too. Never a dull moment in Yulje Hospital.

Music: 11/10 that's how good it is. Every week you will not just be waiting for the next story but anticipating for the next song.

This drama is legit a masterpiece and the story was simply amazing. This is the type of drama you can binge, but its also a drama that you can watch once in a while because it stays with you. Yes, this was a hospital drama, but it was way more than that. You get to see the everyday lives and hobbies of these doctors. Each and every episode was heartwarming, the friendship between the leads, the patients they interact with, and all the residents and interns they mentor and lead. This drama is the best hospital drama and one of the best dramas ever because the cast and their stories were memorable. I have a lot of favorite scenes in this drama, but I really love it when they had their band practice. Definitely, excited for season 2!

Wish I had friends like this, now I want to join a band.
First review! Hospital Playlist is about a group of 5 friends who happen to be doctors. A few of them were friends before they all met at medical school, and they come together when hiding in supply closet to avoid the usual ""talent competition"" section of their medical school Orientation. They form a band, and have been friends since.

It takes a while to learn about the separate personalities and each character's story, but I have to say it was easy to fall in love with all of them as they are all compelling in different ways. So the story and characters are awesome.
* Song Hwa, the only girl, is a superwoman. She has it all and does it all uh ... except singing well, in that area she's slightly challenged. She's smart, cute, efficient, gets things done and is also empathetic and kind to everyone. If I were a man I would absolutely be trying my best to put a ring on it.
* Lee Ik Sun is the genius in the group, gets the best grades without studying, is kind, funny AND a good father. The interactions between him and his cute, chubby cheeked son had me going awww numerous times, too adorable.
* Jun Wan the heart surgeon seems like a jerk at the start, but he's the most driven of them all, and is blunt when needed.
* Suk Hyung, the chubby obstetrician with the terrible haircut, has had the most DRAMA in his life, I'm sure not all of it is revealed but suffice to say his dad is a real piece of shit and has damaged the son to the extent the son doesn't want to be in any relationships ever.
* Andrea (Jung Won) is the sensitive, new age, super Catholic guy. He wears all his emotions on the surface and of all the characters I wanted to cuddle him the most, just to protect him from being hurt.

Then, there's the band/music aspect. One is a terrible singer, but Ik Jun is really good. I had the warm fuzzies during most of their band / karaoke sessions, LOVED Aloha by Cool (Light of my life), Canon Rock, many of the songs in this were fitting with the story. I don't know if these are pop songs or released for the show, but the soundtrack elevates this from a great drama to a 10.

Watching this I realized when I moved countries I lost my Karaoke friends and we used to drink way too much and sing a lot either in public or even in private rooms. I miss that a lot, it's been over 20 years since I've had a fun karaoke time like these guys had. I wouldn't even mind joining a band, except I have no idea how to find people to do this in the age of COVID.

Loved the drama. Please, give me season 2 as soon as possible. I need more.

""The Epitome of Korean Drama Perfection""
I've just done watching its last episode. Hospital Playlist S1 is a total package. The plot, characters, main events, virtually the entirety of the series has been portrayed in detail and with love. OSTs are the best! It is no surprising that the word ""Playlist"" included in the title has been justified. All featured songs have serenaded me throughout the 12 episodes. I can't help but search them on YouTube after listening to them in some scenes. The scenario of the professional world of Doctors are so realistic that the actors made me think they were doing the actual operations. Finally, the legacy it had left on me is the realization that the role of Doctors and front liners they played in times of uncertainty has been given emphasis. Thus, not only does the series merit good reviews and international attention, but it also becomes worthy and timely during the health crisis the 21st-century people are facing today.

Highly Recommended!

I was so excited when Hospital playlist first came out - the drama was written by the same author as the Reply series, and directed by the same director that shot the Reply series. It definitely lived up to and exceeded my expectations and I liked the series as much as, and if not more than Reply 1988, which has been high up on my list for years.

Story:
The story highlights the friendship between 5 college friends after they start working at the same hospital. It's a slice of life drama where you follow the daily lives of the main characters rather than a straight, focused storyline. But every medical case and patient story is realistic and heartwarming. The main characters always have each others backs, and their on screen chemistry as best friends is very natural. Its always fun to see them bicker and roast each other and makes me wish that I'll still have such a tight group of friends when I turn 40 too. There are so many funny scenes esp the Aloha karaoke scene LOL
Ok here's a warning the first 15 mins of the first episode starts off pretty slow, but honestly once you get past that 15 min mark you're good to go.

Music:
Covers: The main characters form a band and they cover a lot of old songs throughout the drama. It was surprising to see that all of them were actually really good at playing their instruments!! Apparently they met up weekly and spent a lot of time practicing for their covers, which were pretty good with Jo Jung Suk (former musical actor + husband of ballad queen Gummy) as the lead vocal. I was going to wait until the series finished airing before I started watching it, but after listening to Aloha I gave in and starting binging lol.
OST: As for the actual OST, overall I liked around half of them, but the songs went along well with the drama.

Acting/Cast:
Tbh I initially watched this series mainly for Jo Jung Suk. But after a few episodes, I found myself liking the entire cast - each of them was a perfect fit for their character and I wouldn't have cast it any other way. The main cast's acting was an easy 10/10.
As always, Jo Jung Suk did a great job acting out his character. As Ik Jun, the funny, easygoing friend/clown of the group who's literally friends with everyone, he always livened up the atmosphere and honestly the dude just knows how to crack the audience up. Chae Song Hwa is actually the first lead role for rookie actress Jeon Mi Do, but she did great job portraying the calm and dignified demeanor of a competent neurosurgeon who is dependable to her patients and also reliable to her friends. Jung Kyung Ho also did a good job acting as the confident and slightly arrogant cardiac-surgeon. He seems to be coldblooded with his prickly temper, but you end up seeing how much he really cares about his patients, which is really sweet. Yoo Yeon Seok did a full 180 from acting as the super evil guy from Mr. Sunshine to being an absolute softie here. I was so shocked like how is this the same guy LOL that's some good acting. His adoration for kids as a Pediatrician, his subtle pettiness, and his sympathetic and warm hearted personality was well delivered. Kim Dae Myung also did a good job making his character awkward and antisocial af and I also really liked the actress that played Ik Sun, Ik Jun's younger sister.
Keep an eye out for lots of big shot cameos lol they make the series all the better.

Overall:
This series lowkey made me want to become a doctor lmao. It's too late to change my major smh but man it was such a good drama. It doesn't matter what genre u normally go for just try it out and you won't regret it. If you like medical dramas though, great because this tops all of the medical dramas that's out there so far. (I think that its the best medical drama)
Also season 2 is coming out next year with the same cast so ALL IS GOOD :-)

Hospital Playlist reimagined medical dramas by viewing it through a different lens--and it's great!
Hospital Playlist is a captivating medical slice-of-life piece that devoids itself from the usual medical drama tropes. Lesser blood, lesser operation scenes, and no politics, yet I can confidently say that this is one of the greatest dramas of its kind with how it maximized its setting to create a profound drama that explores matters that revolves around the hospital and its people-- doctors, nurses, as well as the patients.

One of the common worries by viewers of this drama as it started is its seemingly ""plotless"" nature. However, I think this is the genius of the writers and the director that is working. They introduce these characters to the viewers and they focus on their unraveled stories and their improvements are given focused, being loyal to its slice-of-life nature. To further it, they tell various stories of the patients that the medical staff characters tend to. These characters add another layer which enrich the characters as well as reveal more to who they are and their personalities. From this point, the plot is getting developed. However, one of the greatest plot devices that this drama used is music. The well curated music that is showed every week is a way to make the viewers understand the motif and themes that are present in each episode. It also is a way to show and tell more about the characters in the drama as the lyrics of the songs can be related to the experiences that they encounter.

As a sucker to slice-of-life dramas, I love how the team made this drama very human and relatable. Every character in the drama explore varying facets of humanity by exploring human experiences, emotions, and relationships. At some point, viewers can see themselves with the material that they are consuming-- and that is a feat. I also loved how this drama humanizes doctors and medical practitioners. This layer is very important especially during these times when we are facing a pandemic. It gives us a huge room in order to understand and celebrate these frontliners who always aim to try their best with whatever case they are facing.

This story wouldn't be magnificent without the great characters and its actors. From the main characters played by Jo Jung Seok, Yoo Yeon Seok, Jeon Mido, Jung Kyungho, and Kim Daemyung (WHAT A STELLAR CAST), to the actors that played every supporting characters and the patients, everyone played a role to make this drama magnificent.

Can I just say how great the OST this drama has? It is a perfectly curated list of great Korean classics that are reinterpreted magnificently (my personal favorite being Confession is Not Flashy because yES WINTER-GARDEN).

The drama has only 12 episodes for this season. I give it a high rewatch value as I see this drama as a possible refuge whenever we are lost. This drama has a lot of lessons in life that we can take note for ourselves.

Overall, Hospital Playlist is a great drama that will take you into a wild ride of emotions. It will make you cry, laugh, and empathize with the characters. It's a healing drama not only for its humor but also with its capacity to enable its viewers to relate to it.

This is my first time to watch medical-related drama (because usually I don't get any interests to watch that kind of drama) but I have to watch this since it's Shin PD's drama lol. Aaaaand of course, I don't regret it. The story is just so beautiful. I love the story line, the characters, the details, it was amazing. I love their friendship. I love the way they handle their patients. I love how this drama taught us about humanity.

And don't forget the soundtracks are also amazing. The band thing was awesome! It was great because they can even play it live. How they also put some reply scenes related was hilarious, that was so creative!

I can’t even choose my favorite character out of the 5 people. I love all of them. I fell in love with Jeongwon’s kindness and his big heart. I admired Seonghwa’s time management. I found Ikjun’s cheerful character is so sweet. I liked how Junwan always say something directly and he really meant it. I adored how patient and kind Seokhyeong is.

Definitely can't wait to watch the second season!

It's been a long time since I have seen such an engaging show! It was a great pleasure for me to follow the main characters, appreciating the originality of the idea - to create an amateur (?) music band by a group of surgeons who arouse the viewer's sympathy.

I liked the emotional balance - there were funny and emotional scenes. I must admit that at times I kept my fingers crossed for residents. There are some common patterns in this drama, like the presence of a cardiac surgeon or neurosurgeon (can any series exist without these doctors?) or embarrassing romantic themes. I always feel bad when I look at people who confess their love to a person who feels nothing for that person. I liked the theme of Jang Gyeo Wool who was falls in love with a pediatrician. I kept my fingers crossed for her.

What matters most to me in this drama is this emotional balance. In such dramas there are often too many strong emotions, which makes watching the series difficult. I'm glad that the perspective of the characters themselves - their private dramas, arguments with their families or boys - wasn't stressed too often. I think it's too much. It already was!

I really liked the music in this drama. I love George Winston ""Canon"". By the way, I heard this song in a different version, this time in the Japanese drama ""The Forest of Love"". I recommend the violin version, it's really beautiful.

I have so many responsibilities, but this drama made me unable to stop watching it. It's really worth recommending. The frames are beautiful, I really liked the way the show was framed. The cast is excellent, no artificiality, just naturalness.

I can't wait for the next season!

So I started watching this drama a few days ago after 11 of the total 12 episodes of season 1 had already been released. BIG MISTAKE. Each episode of this drama is almost 1 and a half hour long. And it's worth every second so I couldn't help but binge watch. I was sleep deprived and exhilarated at the same time.
Hospital Playlist has a little of everything. It will literally cheer you up. The inter-relationship shown between different characters is perfect. Every actor no matter how minor their role was, portrayed their characters perfectly. Even though I didn't understand half the medical talk in the series I still enjoyed it.
The chemistry between the 5 main characters was off the charts.

Song-Hwa was like the fairy god-mother of the group. All the others seem to come to her for advice. She could do everything perfectly. All the mothers also loved her (Seok Hyeong and Jeong won's mothers trying to set them up with her was very funny). She was described as the emotional pillar of the group which was spot on but she herself, at times, seemed to require some emotional support. (which is why I shipped her with Ik-jun rather than with Chi-hong. While she took care and guided Chi-hong like she did with others, Ik-jun seemed to take care of her instead. He was just as much her support as she was his)

Ik-Jun was the comedian of the group. When things got too serious he would break the tension with some humor. He also had a sociable and likable personality and got along well with everybody. He could also be responsible and serious at times which showed mainly during his interactions with U-ju, Ik-sun and the other 4. He poked his nose in everyone's business and would help them out.

Jun-Wan was the moody and silent helper type of the group. He was a great doctor although with a prickly personality. He also didn't explain his actions to others. He would do good and endearing things but never take credit. He and Song-hwa had a sibling type relationship (If the writers would have suddenly said that they were siblings I would have totally believed it). His and Ik-jun's friendship was the most entertaining to watch (since one was secretive and the other nosy). His relationship with Ik-sun was surprising but turned out good. His character had the most development in the series (from playboy to committed man and from insensitive to understanding) .

Seok-Hyeong was the anti-social/introvert of the group (The ones who don't make friends but are adopted into the group). Despite his problems with inter-personal relationships, he was a great doctor, responsible, thoughful and generally nice. I had really wish that he had atleast given Min-ah a chance instead of flat out rejecting her (I was rooting for her since her feelings for him went from dislike to respect to resentment to finally liking him which was great development).

Jeong-Won was the adorable baby of the group. He was empathetic, sensitive and friendly. His character also developed so much. I feel like every person that watched this series was rooting for him and Gyeo-wool to get together. ( I literally hid behind a pillow when she confessed her feelings and then pumped my fists in the air when they kissed. Most.Satisfying.Kiss.Ever.)
Gyeo-wool's character also went from robot doctor to become more understanding towards others feelings.
Rosa and Jong-su's friendship and banter was hilarious and just perfect.
Seok-min and Sun-bin's pairing was also very sweet.
Jae-hak's growth from fumbling amateur to a responsible doctor was good to see. His and Jun-wan's relationship as mentor-mentee helped .oth of them grow.
The twins Hong-doo and Yun-bok as well as U-ju added so much cuteness and fun to the show.
The music was great. It didn't really hit the same for me since I am not korean but it was still fun (since most of the songs were old I feel like they were supposed to induce the feeling of nostalgia). The concept of the band was also good and unique.
In conclusion I would recommend this drama to everybody whether you like the genre or not .

The Good in People
This show focuses on how to bring out or see the good in a person. That's the central theme. It's carried by the friendship of the 5 99'ers, who support, challenge and correct each other. This makes the show different, cause there is no villain, not a whole lot of standard plots and plot devices and as a result will have some haters who want more of this or that.

But if you look at the craft put into each episode to show us how to improve on a bad situation or to limit the ripples on its environment, you can't help but gaze in awe. It provides perspective via hindsight. It shows the struggle of parents trying to prevent their children from making a mistake, knowing very well they are as stubborn as themselves. Learning how to communicate, what they would not have believed if an older person would tell them, at the age of their child.

It's also very refreshing to see Kim Kap-su in a roll as a lovable considerate teddy bear with a heart of gold. So many drama's he's been a despicable, scheming person - it must have been a joy for him to play this part and it shows. He does an awesome job and the banter between him and Kim Hae-Sook is one of mutual respect and admiration with a lifetime of experience.

Another very good point of the series is that you can see the couples forming long before they do, but you also understand that it will take time for them to clear the fog between them that prevents them from noticing the inevitable. That is where the true romance lies and for once, we don't have an abundance of 30 second shots full of repeats and slow motions presenting us the first kiss that so many Kdramas are overusing.

Ironically, I skipped over the musical bits - not my cup of tea. And while it's the glue of the series and surely gives an extra dimension for those who can appreciate the music, the series is still very much a pleasure to watch if you can't.

Looking forward to season 2.

THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST DRAMA IN MY ENTIRE DRAMA HISTORY.


Be it the storyline, the casts, the emotional ride, the OST, the filming angle, everything is just perfect. Each episode gives you both happiness and sadness and eventually a feeling of be grateful of your situation right now.

Their friendship of them 5 is just the beautiful thing ever happened. You may not have the same interest, the same vision but you're all still best friends who will always there in any situation, and it's the best thing ever.

No need to mention the casts are more than just awesome, starting from Yoo YeonSeok, Jung KyungHo, Jo JungSuk, Jeon MiDo and Kim DaeMyung. Each portrays their character perfectly and beautifully like no one else can.

each episode of 80 minutes is super exciting and kept me glued to screen like nothing else can, and made me curious about the next episodes. It is so beautifully made.

OST and how they are in a real band is adding a plus point to this drama, their voices is just beautiful and gives us 90s feel so much.

SEASON 2 WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU WITH THE EXACT SAME CASTS :))

Friendship is the best ship.
I started watching this during lockdown on Netflix. Honestly did not know what to expect. Was it going to be too medical? Was it going to be too much about the personal lives of the doctors? Too dramatic?

The reason I loved this show was because it’s a slice-of-life. It is just a simple encounter of the daily life of these five doctors, close friends and the lives of the other hospital staff around them.

I felt calm, happiness, so much laughter, little moments of love and most of all I felt as if I could relate. All the characters are simple human beings working hard and doing their best which is something I think all for us can relate to. The characters have also faced various ups and downs. They aren’t just born perfect doctors but they are individuals who became doctors by workIn their butt off to become the best so they can do their job properly. Looking at them working hard and all the other hospital staff supporting each other is definitely very comforting to watch.

Don’t worry though, it is not just a calm happy go lucky show. There are definitely moments of surprise plot twists that will leave you clicking for the next episode. If not, the cute little boy Woo-joo will definitely make you want to watch more. He is probably the cutest little kid I have seen on kdrama in a long time!

The friendship between the five characters is very dreamy. I don’t quite know how to explain it but the five leads are very much their own people, they are different to each other however, they always have each other’s backs, support each other, help each other, take care of each other and it is really nice to see that. My brother who is a med student loved this part of the show a lot and really hopes he will be able to forge great friends like these guys.

The medicine in this show is not a lot but i think this is good because the show shows you more than just individuals cutting people open and acting like a cool surgeon (I’m sure we have all seen those types of shows). Instead, you will see the doctors really understanding their patients, the difficulties they face when dealing with patients which feels very realistic, the difficulties different department doctors go through and you will witness the various emotions these doctors face may it be happiness, sad or excitement while working in this profession. The emotions in this show are very realistic that it really does get to you at times.

If you want to watch a show about five individuals who met in med school, became good friends, had each other’s backs through various personal and professional problems and then in their spare time to ease their stress, they started a music band that plays some really chill fun tunes then this is the show for you. I really hope this convinces you to watch the show!

I’m looking forward to the season 2 which I’m sure you will be too!

the show is about 5 best friends and their life as doctors.
it is a slice of life style show with amazing cast and down to earth little stories.
5 friends deal with their life issues and hospital typical lifestyle in a most tangible way for the viewers.
It is one of the warmest drama I have ever seen, the cast is amazing and each perfectly portraits the character they are playing. the soundtracks are on spot and their band practices are one to look forward to.

In overall, it is a show you watch and enjoy every second of it. Second season was a must and really looking for it.
I would give 10/10 without thinking. if you enjoy something light, with feelings and connected to medical world this is for you.

For me, this is one of the best dramas of the year so far! I loved every part of it, its characters, the chemistry between them, how human they are, and how exquisite the everyday life was portrayed... those delicate, little normal moments were made so beautiful; whether in the hospital or in their everyday life.
I laughed, I cried, I ugly cried and snort laughed, I got really emotional at times... It's been a bittersweet rollercoaster but I loved it, I would definitely see it again and I can't wait for next season!

Just recently watched and loved it. Totally recommended if you love watching doctor drama. Even though it was doctor drama which can be quite depressing with all the diseases and sometimes dead in drama it was really refreshing to see a happy doctor drama and is my one of the best doctor drama I ever watched. There were funny moments, sad and emotional as well as love story lines.
I think it was quite amazing concept to see all 5 doctors being friends and relying each others without love interest in this friend circle. Of course there were some crushes and so on but the drama doesnt concentrate on that. We got to see their true friendship and it is such a goal. It is also new for me in a doctor drama is that all of them were in different department and we got to see different aspects and stories of the individuals. There were no actual evil/bad character in the drama and even the characters who were rich were humble and fun to watch.
I watched on Netflix and sadly some of the medicine words were not translated as korean TV did and I had to google but still it was enjoyable to watch.
Lead Actor/Actress:
Jung Kyung Ho is one my fav actor and I watched almost all of his drama and this time too he didnt disappoint me. He played his character pretty well and loved it.
Jo Jung Suk is also a great actor and is there anything he cant do?He can act, he is funny, can sing and also dance. He is also married to one of my fav singer. He is so funny in this drama and it suited him so well.
This is the third drama I watch from Yoo Yeon Seok and I totally liked him since 1994. His character in the drama is one of my fav and I totally enjoyed it. He looks extra handsome too.
I watched many kdramas and know many actors and actresses but this is my first time seeing Jeun Mi do in a drama. Later i learned she is a musical actress but it was funny to see how she played tone deaf person in the drama. Overall she was amazing even though it was i think her first drama to act. Her character was funny and also charming.
I actually didnt recognize Kim Dae Myung was in Misaeng and was whole time thinking about how he looks familiar to me. My mother commented that he wasnt that good looking compared to others but I found him handsome and charming as the story goes on. I was charmed by him the more I watch. He acts slow and introvert in the drama but I totally liked his character.
They all did amazing job and their character were well written. The story was great too. We can enjoy songs as well as watch drama about medical field. I dont have any characters I hated or disliked. The drama is not fast paced drama but everything is paced well.
OST:
There were many songs played and sung by lead actors & actresses. Great songs.

This is my first review I just want to write what I thought somewhere

As a medical student in her final term exams I just want to say that this series saved me and gave me strength to keep studying and want to grow in these hard times.
I didn't have much motivation these days but it gave me what I needed.

Apart from the fact that the plot and the OST are a masterpiece, the medical stuff have been studied in depth, I can relate, they are so accurate almost in everything. I was really surprised.

In short, it was one of the best Kdramas I have seen over the years, and it is definitely a soul-healing series

I just want it to write it here and give a bit of strength to everyone who needs it, especially at this time. Take care everyone :) see you in season 2

Really loved dramas that take time out in developing each and every (main) character's personality, backstory and difficulties. HP took it a step further and created this enviable friendship that many of us would want to be part of (minus their hectic work life...) On that regard, the writers have also tried hard in imbuing and showing us that being a doctor is not all glitz and glamour, with numerous life & death decisions to be made on the spot, along with the numerous hours of work shifts put in (which there's also a hint that doctors who care tend to overwork). Felt that in the current circumstances, perhaps an episode or two could have been dedicated to infectious diseases (but that's just my wish at this point!)

Nothing to say about the band music tbh. Really excellent concept of finding all the catchy past hits and bringing them back to life. I also liked how the screenplay adapted with the flashback scenes giving us some Reply series feels.

Overall, really good series that you can enjoy comfortably. Looking forward to the cast's chemistry again in Season 2!

A gem of a show. There's nothing like it.
I've rewatched it FOUR times, thats how much I love it. The story is simple but captivating. The acting is superb. The characters are endearing. It leaves you pining for the past but hoping for the future. And the music!!! Where else can you see a drama where the actors are really singing and playing musical instruments, and actually being great at it?!

I am touched the most by IKJun and SongHwa's story. I cant wait for Season 2!

Please do yourself a favor and watch it. ?❤️

Outstanding, but infuriatingly unfinished
It's a brilliant, incredible yada yada show. The perfect casting meets with with the best creative talents the kdrama genre has to offer. There are plenty of 10/10 reviews very accurately depicting the awesomeness of the show, so I'll keep it short.

The reason why it's not 10/10 for me is because I have gotten into kdramas specifically due to the fact that kdramas tell a somewhat coherent story in 16-20 episodes & usually they are light on the filler and the good ones give the audience closure. This show has been written with a second season in mind & it ends with a cliffhanger. The cliffhanger itself is not that offensive, but two of the three most important storylines are hanging in the air, unfinished. So yeah, the last episode was quite the maddening experience.
I really wish Netflix stopped trying to influence how kdramas are made..

I'm absolutely hooked on this drama. I'm only on episode 6 right now, and not all the episodes are aired yet, but this has been such a strong drama from the start. There are no villains, and the story mainly focuses on the characters and their journey through life together.

One of the strongest points that I absolutely am in love with is that our group is all in a band, and the songs that they practice with are all OSTs. The show brings us, the viewer, through the characters' medical school lives in the 2000s, thus bringing up all the memories associated with that era. Although I was barely alive during that time, the way the director portrayed their friendship and the oldie songs just made me nostalgic for memories I never had!! This drama might resonate better with the older crowd and those who have childhood memories of life in Asia.

The only gripe I have with Hospital Playlist is the large amount of character introductions and world-building in the first one or two episodes, but that simply can't be helped with a story of this scale. Otherwise, this is on the top of my list of favourite dramas for now. The OST, the characters, everything brings a silly smile to my face.

I strongly recommend this as a light-hearted piece, though it may be a little hard to follow with the large amount of characters. However, once you're invested in them, you'd want to watch it again to catch the little details you missed the first time around. I never rewatch dramas, but I will definitely be rewatching this one, especially if season 2 comes out.

I just started this show and I already fell in love with it. The cast has great chemistry with each other and all are amazing actors. I love how it focuses on the doctor's lives as well as there outside lives. Meaning that it really goes in-depth with the doctor's interactions with their patients and as well as how there outside lives. It's not melodramatic as other dramas sometimes are.
I typically enjoyed the scenes were all five main characters hang out together and you can see how strong their relationship is.

Masterfully produced drama with the odd chinks in the armour
I deliberately waited for the hype to die down before I watched this but seeing season 2 is in the pipeline I thought I'd better get a move on. By the way, when I wrote this, there is already 12 pages of reviews so I don't expect mine to stand out but seeing that I binged the show in 2.5 days, I thought I should at least leave a few words for prosperity. :)
No doubt many of the reviews have highlighted the skilful story telling, the direction. the stellar cast, friendship, the feels, etc, etc. I totally agree with the bulk of the sentiments and it was an ode to the doctors, nurses and allied health professionals (standing ovation). However, I did find a few chinks in their shiny armour.
First of all, the show started very confusingly. The size of the cast and the physical setting was just too big. This drama had five central characters plus each had his/her staff and then you have administrators, other doctors (both senior and junior) and nurses in at least five departments (not counting ER). The hospital was also huge physically. You just don't feel like you know how the place worked. You were bounced from people to people, location to location. This did get better after a few episodes when you start to recognise faces and group them into cliques (this is from a non-Korean point of view).
Some reviewers have commented on this show being realistic. I am not going to argue every case but I found a lot of the time, surgeries were carried out on patients who literally had a consult the day before. That level of availability would be the envy of the whole world.
Finally, I wished the drama would deep dive into some of the issue de jour. From migrant worker health care to child abuse to injury/death by overworking (and more) were touched upon but almost all of them came and gone within a few scenes and not always with a resolution.
Otherwise, the show was designed to hit you with the feels and they definitely delivered. You would expect no less from the team that brought us so many top notch hit dramas.
BTW, it begs the question, was it a medical drama with a strong romance undertone or a rom-com set in a hospital?
Acting - fantastic.
Production value - excellent.
OST - loved it! You gotta laugh at the joke they played on the FL.
Rewatch - absolutely (maybe not every episodes)
One final thought, the last episode was extra long and I appreciated that they gave all the characters time and space to tidy up their own story arcs but while some questions were answered, more were left hanging so please bring on season 2! Ppalli ppalli!

A gentle, funny and thoughtful drama with a big heart...
Hospital Playlist is a gentle, funny and thoughtful drama with a big heart. The casting is perfect, being both age appropriate and believable as doctors and friends of over twenty years. I enjoyed how the writer gradually reveals the character and back-stories of the five leads across the twelve episodes.

The friendship between the five leads is well written and authentic. In real life, most of us have friends dating back to our student days despite not knowing every detail of each other’s lives or what they’re thinking. The writer has captured this, showing how the five of them accept each other without question. The one-to-one exchanges between the lead characters are quiet and thoughtful; and the eating, goofing around and band practice scenes with the five leads together are fun. I love the songs the band play each episode and applaud actress Jeon Mi Do’s (Song Hwa) singing - it can’t be easy for an accomplished singer to sing off-key without over-doing it.

Lee Ik Jun (Jo Jung Suk) is my favourite character; he's caring, selfless and the glue of the group. He also cares about his co-workers, his patients and their families, to the extent that he learnt sign language so he could communicate to his patient's young son. Time and again we see him putting other's needs before his own, first as a father, and as a friend and doctor. I love the scenes between Ik Jun and his son Woo Ju (Kim Jun). Woo Ju is totally adorable and the exchanges between father and son reveal another side of Ik Jun.

I also like the two mothers Rosa and Young Hye. In K-dramas the mothers of that generation are often portrayed as totally helpless with viewers left pondering the disconnect between their mothers' flaky characters and those of their children. But Rosa and Young Hye are both strong, smart and funny and would be the sort of mothers to have raised Jung Won (Yoo Yeon Seok) and Suk Hyung (Kim Dae Myung).

I dislike Jang Gyeo Wool and Ahn Chi Hong. The writer tried too hard to make Gyeo Wool special, for example, making her the only resident in a department of 8+ general surgeons – this is totally preposterous for a hospital the size and prestige of YULJE. There’s also zero chemistry between Gyeo Wool and Jung Won and the actress playing Gyeo Wool can’t act to save her life! Chi Hong is wet and his behaviour after Song Hwa turns him down is creepy and stalker-ish. Yuck!!

I enjoyed Hospital Playlist and seeing how and why Ik Jun, Jun Won and Suk Hyung became who they are. Since the characters Jun Wan (Jung Kyung Ho), despite his romance with Ik Jun’s sister and Song Hwa are still a mystery to me, I hope Hospital Playlist 2 will reveal more.

Ok IM AMAZED
I watched hospital playlist a while ago and I still can't seem to forget the characters. The characters and the plot had a huge impact on me. This drama made me laugh, cry and feel all sorts of emotions. I probably rewatched it like 3 times. Its that good. NOW IM JUST WAITING FOR SEASON 2!!! The main cast is just........ CHEFS KISS. And of course the supporting cast. My favourites scenes were those of seok-min and seo-bin. If you dont know who i'm talking about, its the neurology cheif resident and another resident who are always with song-hwa. I really wanna know if they end up together or not. I guess i have a huge thing for secondary couples.


Season 1 left us with many questions. What does song-hwa think about ik-jun. And why did ik-sun package the present back to jun-wan. Ahhhh im so curious.

Anyway, Hospital playlist is straight up FIRE. thats it.

Best Treatment I Ever Take
This is the best k-drama I ever watched!! This TV series will make you cry, laugh, smile, and want to fall in love.

As a person who visited many hospitals and spent hours as a patient, I would definitely say it is so realistic in terms of doctors and hospitals. I wish I could meet such good doctors like in the drama. The doctors here are not overdrawn as we see in other hospital-themed dramas. Yes, they are good but not inventing superpowers for treatments. What they do is what real doctors do in real life. How they behave is how real doctors behave who enjoy their jobs. The drama is not a love story or classic hospital or doctor stories, it is the life of doctors who are long-time friends. We see their personal life, personal problems, family issues, working periods, and their effort to end the day like normal people. This makes me understand their feelings, their thoughts, and I find myself in a strong empathy mood. I usually say ""yes, this is me"" or ""yes, I met such people and felt like he/she did"". You can find people who are existing in the real world and you can relate to situations with you experienced before. I found this drama when I was staying in hospital. I had real doctors but I also had them. They make me smile and respect all doctors who are trying so hard to help people.

{{$t('The only thing I will criticize is it is hard to keep going after starting to watch at the beginning. I know as a slice of life drama we are suddenly starting to watch their life and it might be complicated to understand what is going on. Therefore I would advise the new watcher to keep going. Do not give up watching. ')}}

Mixture of all things amazing!
This show, is AMAZING!
Depise the plot sounding unoriginal, 5 friends working at the same hospital while juggling their personal life's. Sounds boring right? Well, get ready for the laughter, romance and tears!

The show is about what I just said, 5 friends working at the same hospital as they've been friends for over 20 years. One word to describe their friendship, wholesome! I barely watch any youth shows since I'm a romance freak but the youth in this show with the 5 main characters is AMAZING!! TOO AMAZING TO EVEN DESCRIBE. The side characters were also great in their own ways too! Loved Gyeo-Wool, Min-ah, Hong-do and Yuk-bok!!

Acting? Geez, IT WAS TO AMAZING! Sometimes I even believed I wasn't watching a show!! The acting with the 5 friends, the patients, the side characters, TOO AMAZING! I even believed the wholesome friendship between the 5 main characters!! I really don't care if you hate this show, regardless, you have to admit the actors did their parts EXTREMELY well!

The music, OH MY GOSH. AMAZINGGGG AS WELL!! I loved the band! Their music sessions were so wholesome and sweet! Loved the OST!

Rewatch Value? VERY HIGH! Regardless of it's time duration being SUPER long, I would defo re watch this show for a lot of the wholesome moments between the patients, main characters and side characters!

In total, PLEASE WATCH THIS IF YOU HAVE REGRETS! I remember having this show on my plan to watch for SOOOOO LONG! I only first wanted to watch for Jo Jung Suk, although I loved his character in this show, all the cast MAKE the show AMAZING AS HELL!

Slice of life, heartwarming and hilarious.
As a medical student, this drama is a gem. The entire setting is in the hospital where you encounter life and death situations and how you handle them through your emotional and skillful understanding. If you are a medical student, then you'll learn many new things from this drama. Even if you aren't a medical student, this drama won't disappoint you. So now let's break into the characters and their nature.
Ik-Joon; he is the like the life of party. Funny, humorous with a good nature and a friend that everyone wishes for. He is serious at times when the situation demands and in other time, he is a goofball who can easily put a smile in others face. Song-hwa; the only female in the group, she is strong willed and very detailed doctor. She puts a clear line between her profession and hobbies. She is also like the mom of the group because everyone looks up to her for advices. Jung-won; his nickname is Buddha because he is very calm and composed as a doctor and person. He can understand his patients very well and connect to them. He is a softie that everyone adores. Jun-wan; he is very indiffernt and blunt to others but to his friends and girlfriend, he is the most sweetest and caring person. As a medical student I think that his attitude is very strong as he doesn't get swept up in emotions. Seok-hyung; an introvert and mamas boy. He is a very considerate person. He avoids talking to other people, knows his boundaries but when it comes to patients, he gives the best advice and emotional support.
This drama is a very calm and slice of life drama. You get to see what happens in the hospital and every doctor are trying their best to save their patient. Although this drama majorly focuses on hospital life, you'll also see how they handle their personal life. Every cast does their part very well. Not only the main characters, but also the other casts portray their roles very well. You'll laugh and cry because you'll connect with every cast whether they are a doctor or patient. The main person whom I loved in this drama is Uju. He is very adorable in every scenes. There are no dramatic or cliché scenes, just pure and real life scenes where you go with the flow of life. The most important lesson that you'll get from this drama is that no matter how tough your profession is, stick with your friends and family and enjoy your life as well as your job. Watch this drama, you won't regret.

Hospital Playlist: A Friendship Between 5 Specialist Doctors
Another slice of life series directed by Shin PD. A fun and chill series that you can watch anytime or in any situation. For me who don't like slice of life series that much, this series was neither boring nor too slow-paced. A great mix of romance, humor, family and friendship between doctors and workers in hospital. There are also surgery scenes and conversations about disease, patient, etc but not as intense as 'Romantic Doctor'. Late 90s-00s vibes feeled more real because the osts. Some osts were sang by the original casts as a music band. Every episode was worth the hype.

A story about friendship and the troubles of everyday life
This is a perfect show for you who don't want to think too much and just relax while watching.

When it first came out it was very hyped so I checked it out and I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't super into it and even dropped it after the first episode. But I gave it a second chance after a few month and I grew fond of it, so if you didn't like it at first, give it another chance ^^ Granted it took me a few episodes but watching one here and there is perfect for this kind of show if you don't feel like binging it.

Now what the show excels at is the friendship between the characters. It's not an overdramatic show so there aren't really any twists and turns to catch you off guard and I really like that. Not all shows needs to be surprising and full of twists. They all joke around with each other and care for each other when something has happened. The band that they have together is also really fun to watch and it's a great way to use the shows soundtrack.

Though, the isn't perfect. It lacks in the medical department in my opinion. I'm not expecting it to have cases like Dr. Romantic or anything like that but it felt that the show went maybe a tad much on the happy side of things. Now this is a happy show so I don't expect a lot of sadness but the show it meant to feel a bit realistic (I think) so it could use a bit of sadness. It does bait us quite often. There's a lot of instances where everything is looking grim and the episode ends. Then when the next has started everything worked out ok, and sometimes we don't even get to see what happened but only the aftermath after a day time skip or something similar.

When the show does have the sad ending the case, it is very impactful and I caught myself crying a few times.

Now this show is renewed for season 2 (and 3?) so I hope that they will fix the issues I had with this season for the next ones ^^

Let me start by saying this you can't essentially comsider this as a review this is more like my perspective on it.First of all let me start by saying this hospital playlist is not one of those typical medical dramas where there is one genius doctor,lots of blood,complicated cases and miraculous recoveries. It inclines more to the somewhat realistic portrayal of medical cases,more importantly it focuses on the life of doctors. It's about friendship, trust and love . The patients in this drama actually die unlike other dramas,which makes this different.The characters are so likeable that you cannot find those evil superiors or fellow doctors who have jealousy over your talent and that's exactly what makes this drama standout from the pool of typical medical dramas. The story is still to unveil more but you will fall in love with each characters. Although the dramas has 5 main leads the writers succeeded in making each character unique and you will fall in love with them. Whether its goofy ik jun or laid back seok hyung each will give some lessons about your life. The stories of patients and struggles of doctors gave this drama richness. The characterization in this drama is so good that you end up remembering each and every character. Nobody is a passerby every body has something to do with the plot that's what makes this drama really likeable .Now coming to acting the main leads are absolutely wonderful. Each of them made their character memorable. The thanos of the department jun wan seems to be a person who don't care but he deeply cares for his patients and residents.i am especially curious about jun Wan's love line with ik sun and how this will bring about changes in his relation with ik jun. Goofy ik jun is all over the place and his character makes this drama more enjoyable. Ghost song hwa is the pillar in this that everyone can rely on. I am rooting for song hwa nad ik jun in next season may my ship sail . An Jung made a 360 degree turn from being a God's child to geoul 's man . Budha speak hyung characterization is most interesting as he is the one with most problematic past ,present and most likely future. A special shout out to army buddies geoyul and min ha for their persistence and courage .May min ha also gets her man.coming to ost's liked the song which they sing for rosa and jung so more but all of the songs are apt for situations. I hope the other side character has more important role in next season especially the painter twins. The child actors in this drama are adorable ?. Since I already watched this drama twice ,I will give rewatch value as 10as I may rewatch it again. In conclusion hospital playlist is my favorite all time kdrama. I don't want to say it is flawless. There may be some medical errors as I am not well versed with hospital settings I will avoid it and i don't care much about . Hospital playlist has it's own flaws but it is beautiful, heartwarming and full of life that make you want to live a better life and make good friends for life. I will reccomend this everyone as it is healing. At last I would like to say please watch at least 4 episodes before dropping this drama,don't miss out a gem. With that i will conclude my pointless review happy watching !!!!

Overrated - Not worth the hype, time
Still wondering why both seasons of Hospital Playlist are so highly rated. I tried so hard to understand the hype, and eventually dropped Season 1 after 4 episodes, 9 months later. Heard from others that Season 2 was worse, so Season 2 is a no go for me.

I have enjoyed medical dramas, and was looking earnestly to this much hyped Hospital Playlist. Alas, it was such a let down from get go at episode 1 with repairing the flickering light in someone's house (p/s: 4 episodes on, i still don't register who appeared at the start of episode 1), and it didn't get much better from episode to episode, that i simply have to drop it.

This drama is both a drag and a struggle - at a 90min run per episode, there is zero plot, and perhaps just 1-2 sprinkles of slice of life moments per episode.

For endearing slice of life moments, watch Move to Heaven and Racket Boys - there are plenty of slice of moments in much compact, compelling run.

For good chemistry among the cast, the coaches and racket teams in Racket Boys sizzle with good camaraderie and positive vibes. The cdrama The Untamed (陈情令) is also a standout with a bunch of passionate cast and crew bringing each and every character to life, and the viewers on an emotional roller coaster ride.

For medical genre, watch HK drama The Last Breakthrough (天涯侠医) from 2004 on doctors without borders, or the more recent 2019 Big White Duel (白色强人) peppered with life at the emergency dept and medical politics.

Even Singapore medical dramas The Oath (行医) on western medicine and TCM, and You Can Be an Angel Too (你也可以是天使) and The Caregivers (Missy 先生) on nurses are much more watchable and enjoyable. (p/s: why aren't Singapore dramas included the MDL?)

The only takeaway from me is the two OSTs: Aloha and Canon. Yet, i had actually singled those two OSTs just from sampling (read: listening only about a minute per song) the OST album a friend bought, even before i started on the drama.

Let's state the obvious first, among a lot of incredible things in this drama, the cast stands out from the get-go. There's nothing more to explain about the cast; their acting was impeccable and I don't think anyone else from the list of actors/actresses can be replaced.

All of the music used in this drama was nice! I think most of the songs were covered, but nonetheless suited the drama best. I'd say even non-watchers of this drama would stumble upon the songs from this drama in youtube and add them to their playlists. So good in fact that one song sang by Jeon Mi Do managed to top the charts for a short moment at a time when IU, Taeyeon, Chungha, BOL4, and other musicians released comeback songs.

And lastly, the most important part, the story. The story was superb! I just want to clear things out, this is a light drama. Don't expect heavy episodes where you feel suffocated, and that's a good thing. I personally think that friendship-comedy dramas are arguably the best genre combinations out there. I just felt a bit weird that there was barely any turmoil and strife in the drama --mostly because I haven't watched enough dramas to watch something similar to this. The story was light but quite impactful, especially during times like this where medical workers hold a lot more responsibility than they usually do (COVID-19). You'll appreciate them more and get a taste of how medical workers sacrifice so much to live a life of saving people.

Honestly, this drama was just so nice and heartwarming. I actually cried a bit which usually entails that I watched a masterpiece. But the strange thing is, I didn't cry from something painful; I cried from how warm the story was -- which says a lot. Overall, I would definitely recommend this drama. The worst thing about this drama is that you'd have to wait a year for season 2 upon finishing the drama on May 28, 2020 ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ

(One thing's for certain, Jo Jung Suk has solidified his spot as my all-time favorite actor after this drama <3)

Heartfelt!
Totally realistic and heartfelt!!
This drama is a gem. As a seasoned drama buff who have been watching asian dramas for almost 15 years now. I can definitely confidently say that, this is one of the dramas we should not miss out on. I think the story, the direction and most definitely the cast are the heart and soul of this piece. I really can't think of anyone replacing any of the cast, not even the side characters. Talk about ..in the right place and the right time and the right people.
P.S I am writing this review after watching it for the third time.

DIFFERENT and UNIQUE
I have seen at least three Hospital themed K-drama and I can say that this gives viewers a very balanced vibe when watching each episode. It still gives you a depiction of Hospital life and reality (I may be wrong in my assumption) yet has a twist that takes you with the characters as they shrug off and unwind from the burdens and stress their roles in the hospital. Music appeals to all and has a healing effect regardless of your background, experience and personality. Really good option to spice up the drama and present uniqueness.

What I like most about this drama is that they really played the instruments and sang in all the band meeting they had. Unlike other drama and characters, some are a quick shot or blurry image of them playing the instrument. Each instruments assigned to the characters suits them well. Oh, the repertoire....so good that I have it in my playlist (even though I rely heavily on subtitles). The OST is superb....no bad apple!

Another thing I like about this drama, is that each character has a different take on their role as doctors. Whilst some may be perceived lacking with passion -- just the same as dedicated to the profession and patients. The various scenarios presented in the hospital scenes gives viewers an opportunity to relate with their own experience or even understand what others' predicament may be.

Romantic aspect of the drama is presented in a well-balanced manner, without having to dilute the theme (hospital, music and relationships).

I can't wait for the next season!

I love this drama.
My heart warming to see how interaction between all character. I really love how they're caring each other, how they're grow up together.

The story-line is good overall, but so many questions until the last episode, I'm very disappointed how they're just give us 12 episode, I'm need more, next year is too long.

As always they're veteran! The acting is soo goooddd! I love how Jeon Mido acting like she can't singing, honestly she's best singer.

THE OST TOTALLY LIT! Drama version or other artist version I love it, they're make us love the ost, not just the background of the drama, but I'm totally enjoyed all the ost.

I will rewatch it if I miss them, next year please come faster!

In Shin WonHo PD and writer Lee WooJung we trust
I've been looking forward to this since Shin Wonho PD announced the series in 2019. I've loved all of his dramas; Prison Playbook remains as one of my best life dramas and is a drama I re-watch at least once a year. I knew this drama would be the same because it is Shin Wonho PD and writer Lee Woojung after all.

And they delivered. Hospital Playlist was a humane, heartwarming, beautiful drama about the life of people in the medical field. The friendship, the growth, the bond they forged through the years reflect beautifully through the screen because the cast were great actors and the script was beautiful to begin with. It's so easy to cry with their sorrows, laugh with their foolishness, and be happy with their successes because the bond is so organic that you will readily root for all of them.

One of the things I've always loved with Shin Wonho PD's shows were the cameos and this series didn't fail to give me the nostalgia and warmth that all those previous characters gave me. Reply 1994? We got Go Ara still the strong independent woman and Kim SungKyun! Reply 1988? We got Choi MooSung and Kim SunYoung still happily married! Prison Playbook? My mans Kim SungCheol selling insurance and Jung Min-sung still being the family man who will do everything for the people he loves! And our favorite father? Sung DongIl comes back as a priest I am wheezing.

All in all, this show delivered and I will be looking forward to season 2! Now I'm off to re-watching NJTTW because of that mini-crossover lol

I've always been a fan of the team behind the Reply series and Prison Playbook. Shin PD and Writer Lee is THE dream team. They've made characters which both relatable and have the natural relationships with other characters. They are like people from your neighborhood you want to be friends with.

Whoever casted the actors should be given a pay raise, to be honest. It felt like the characters were written for the actors. I could not imagine any other actor who would perfectly convey the emotions and story of the characters so well. The relationship between the group of friends would be the envy of many. Each of the main leads could hold their own.
Lee Ik Jun is that crazy genius of a doctor and a solo father. Ahn Jung Won is a doctor who defied his catholic family to become a doctor. Kim Jun Wan is that arrogant, doctor. Yang Suk Hyung is that mama's boy but a very empathic doctor. Chae Song Hwa is the glue that holds their group. Everyone had their story to tell and I liked the fact that it was more of a synergy of stories rather than who's story is better.

Also, I love the scenes where they were practicing as a band. Thus, the name ""Hospital Playlist"". It's so funny to see the legend of a theatre actress Jeon Mi Do to act like a tone deaf vocalist. She is that good. And the time they invested to learn all the songs to make it as authentic as it ought to be is admirable. Especially the part where they practiced Canon Rock. That was hard but they pulled it off. But I think my favorite performance would be the song ""Met You By Chance"" which by the way is not included in the physical album. WHY??? Aloha will always have a special place in my heart. Them singing it in karaoke is reminiscent of how me and my friends sing karaoke. This is why their friendship is so convincing. They definitely had the friendship chemistry down to a T. Oh, and I especially love that Aloha is winning in the charts.

Can we just talk about the chemistry between Ik Jun and his son, Woo Ju? It's tooooo cute. They have the perfect chemistry. I really can't wait for the second season. 12 episodes is to short for me. I need more!

This review may contain spoilers
**This review was cross-posted on r/KDRAMA subreddit with a few changes

This was my first """"""medical"""""" drama (and Shin PD drama), and I gotta say that I was always interested in the human aspect of medicine, as I spent years studying animals. This allowed me to easily emphatize with the cast. But if there's one thing we probably have in common, its that some types of clients make us frustrated and drained lol. But at the end of the day, we have to try our hardest to understand where they are coming from. And at times, not all cases have a happy outcome. These circumstances, when combined, sometimes lead to burnout and compassion fatigue. I also liked how it was highlighted in one of the episodes that medical professionals always have to take responsibility for the things they say and do. Ultimately, the writers did an excellent job in depicting a typical hectic routine in a hospital setting, as well as the hardships medical professionals and even clients experience.

On the other hand, I am by no means criticizing medical dramas. I liked how HP was realistic and not overly dramatic to convey heartfelt emotions and messages. And I admire the efforts they put in to make the drama as accurate and realistic as possible. But I do understand that storylines may have to altered to serve the purpose of the characters and plot, as well as for entertainment.

The show wasn't something I fell in love with at first watch. Rather, it grew on me as we got to know more about the characters -- although I wasn't deeply invested emotionally in some of the characters as the show jumped from a multitude of cases. Anyway, I just love how its very wholesome and feel good. And the same can be said for its OST, which I think is incredible and one of the best I've heard over the course of dramas that I've watched. HP gave off a vibe that not all episodes were entirely connected, wherein the next episode picks up from the events of the previous one. It always starts off fresh, which was refreshing.

The star of the show was of course, the ensemble of five doctors, which all had a fair amount of screentime. Their chemistry and very close bond is just incredible. I also love how we get a glimpse of their varying personalities when they are together, and with their colleagues. And so it was HARD to pick a favorite character, though I always find myself sucking up to Ik-jun. This brought forth a newfound liking and appreciation for Jo Jung Suk. That said, I've always had an inkling that there was something between Ik-jun and Song-hwa. But I didn't actually expect him to act on his feelings. This storyline is definitely something I'll be looking forward to in Season 2. And I also thought that it was pretty comedic that they made fun of Jung-won's religious beliefs.

But but but I also have to give it to the supporting cast because they were stellar on their own. They were excellent in filling in the gaps, and giving us insights on the inner workings of the hospital and the 5 friends in its entirety. With this, Yoon-bok (Jo Yi Hyun) is also one of my favorite characters, partly because I can 100% relate to her when I was a student -- following doctors around like a sheep, absorbing new things like a sponge, and being downright amazed about learning (although a headache at times).

My favorite episode would definitely have to be the finale. I loved how they were able to depict and allowed the viewers to empathize with the different forms of joy and grief/loss, albeit through different circumstances and perspectives. I think that the complexity of these events is very unique in a way that it evokes the exact same emotion and message to a variety/multitude of viewers. A viewer may not be able to relate with one of the characters, but they could be a sobbing or cackling mess over another one. This may be the opposite for another viewer, and so on. While my heart broke for the mother who lost her child, with the expectant mothers holding their child outside the office -- y'all can bet that I cried the most when we got back to the med student (Yoon-bok) finding out that it was Song-hwa who operated on their mom.

Hospital Playlist is one of the best, if not the very best drama to have come out in 2020. I could see myself rewatching this if ever I need a good watch to soothe my soul.

An Interesting Medical Drama With a Bit of Everything
This is not a fresh from the oven review, I finished the drama eons ago and never felt like writing a review on it. However, I need to practice reveiwing for my book blog so here I am rambling, while trying hard not to get distracted. I'm failing it, I know.

[[[[ REVIEW WARNING ]]]]

1. I'm not a professional reviewer, so most of the time I couldn't care less bout the characteristics that a proper review must have.
2. I have no idea what I'm talking about. For example, I can't even tell the different between a bass and an electric guitar - and this will show through the entire review.
3. English is not my main language, so yeah, don't wonder too long over my weird wordings and stuff, because it is more likely that I myself also have no idea what I'm trying to say in the first place.

[[[[ THE STORY ]]]]

The drama was a medical drama featuring five friends who have been friends since their undergraduate days. They went to the same medical school and then worked at the same hospital (as for at the moment, previously? I have no idea..). And oh, they also formed a band for fun.

[[[[ THE CHARACTERS ]]]]

First, there was Lee Ik Jun, the single father family guy.
Secondly, there was Ahn Jung Won, the rich paediatrician who wanted to be a priest.
Thirdly, there was Kim Jun Wan, a friendly reformed playboy(?) who was secretly dating Lee Ik Jun's sister.
Fourthly, there was Yang Suk Hyung, a softie divorcee who was scarred by his failed marriage.
Lastly, there was Chae Song Hwa, the only girl in the group, a sweetheart everyone in the group swarmed to.

[[[[ THE DRAMA ]]]]

The drama featured:

1. Friendship. Everyone were friends and the drama brilliantly showed how they started and then how they grew as friends through the many years they were together. Each character was different but somehow they complimented each other. They loved each other and were always there to support and protect each other.

2. Romance. It was a slow burn romance and as with the writer's other amazing works, we were constantly left guessing as to where and how the romance will go. It is complicated, but amazing as well.

3. Medical Stuff. They were doctors and the drama portrayed their daily lives and interactions with their patients. It was never over the top like so many other medical dramas, it was more towards the realistic kind (not that it is really realistic (come on, it is a drama after all), just not absurd like other dramas). Every treatment was showed nicely, without making the doctors act like sought after doctors that were super brilliant and can magically heal everyone sent to them.

4. Music. I don't remember much of the music but I do admit that it wasn't grating on my nerve so it wasn't so bad. The actors sang the songs themselves, and many said that they were good at it. However, since I'm tone deaf and music deaf, I simply base my opinion on my taste alone. With that being said, I didn't like the music or the band thingy, it was boring to me.

[[[[ MY THOUGHTS ]]]]

Just like the writer's other works (they were all my favourites dramas), I loved this drama. It wasn't overly focused on romance and we were treated with heavy doses of friendship, humors and angsts as well. And the producers and writers were amazing good at what they do, portraying everything in a way that you enjoy every moments of it. And they don't only focus on the main characters only, they also paid attention to the side ones as well. I loved not only the main characters, but the side characters as well.

However, I won't go as far as saying this drama is my favorite drama ever (it is still Reply 1988) because I still find flaws that I couldn't accept. Nah, everything was amazing so these so called flaws were just my preferences actually. What didn't work for me (hence the not perfect rating) were:

1. The cliffhanger. Duh, life is short, I don't need that.
2. The characters' choices. Yeah, I know it's their choices but I choose to dislike them nonetheless lol
3. The episodes. Why so few, I need moreeeeeeeeee TT.TT

[[[[ THE CONCLUSION ]]]]

Hospital Playlist is an amazing drama, watch it. Or don't watch it. Just do whatever you feel like doing ;)

IT'S NOT JUST A MEDICAL DRAMA
as Hospital Playlist ended its run yesterday night, i'm here to say THIS IS SUCH A GOOOOOD DRAMAAA!! i have been having a kdrama slump and this drama just healed the slump. i just knew a drama from the Reply and Play Play producer won't disappoint. Hospital Playlist's main charm is that it's super heartwarming! it provides you warm friendships (BEST SQUADD), cute relationships, professional doctors who got golden hearts, and at the same time it presents you the reality of a hospital. life and death situations, unwanted outcomes, and of course there are some doctors with not-that-golden hearts (they're not being given any spotlight, thankfully). all the patients cases and stories are heartwarming and tear-jerking. [someone help i can't press the enter button :"")] STORY — for a medical slice-of-life drama, the story is super good. i can't say much bcs it's that good and i'm not the best at describing, but i can say it'a really really really good. there are always warm scenes, funny scenes, and sad scenes. every episode is really balanced. ACTING/CAST — the casts are chosen well. they are able to potray the unique characteristics of each character well. even the patients' families acting!! the happiness and the heartbreak they got from hearing the medical news are potrayed really well. MUSIC — OLD SONGS REALLY ARE SOMETHING ELSE! the songs make you feel things. butterflies, sadness, they chose the music well for each scenes! REWATCH — i would love to rewatch this drama someday later, i believs it'll produce the same heartwarming feelings i get now and of course i would comeback for the friendship and super super funny scenes! CAN 2021 COME FASTERR

Friendship so precious you want to be part of
I inserted a warning sentence before the part that is a slight spoiler :) after it the paragraph ends so you can know when it ends also :)
10 out of 10!
First of all if anyone asks me if they should watch this drama I will definitely say yes! It’s very beautiful story of 5 friends and their life as doctors. The first episodes might be a bit overwhelming with too many characters but soon you will get attached to them and know them all ^^ Honestly I thought I won’t like it when I first turned it on. But as soon as I reached even half of the first episode I loved this a lot. :) It's an epitome of my friendship dream! <3

Life in a hospital is not always sweet but it’s not always sour eirher, it’s not always easy but not always hard either, it’s not always cool with glorified doctors but it’s not always uncool either... it’s just life with it’s ups and downs and in this drama we see it through 5 main characters. Yes 5! Not a male lead, female lead and second lead, but 5 friends with different likes, different departments, different stories. Their friendship is the highlight of this drama and the most precious thing in this world of hospital playbook. This whole hospital life is not shown to us only through these 5 precious friends, but also nurses, some directors, and of course patients and their families. How each and every family is different, how doctors are in pain with their patients and are happy with their patients too.

Honestly I don’t like slice of life/ slow dramas. But this one is different. What I don’t like in those kind of dramas is the grey-ness and sadness they show. But here, they show that it’s not always bad, and even if the life can be horrible at the moment, there is always sun that will shine again later. They show that routine can be enjoyable too and even if it’s not it’s not that bad and can’t be just done. And that they can enjoy different hobbies! The next line is a slight spoiler but we all know how doctors can be called any moment and even if they get a call at night they have to run. So when Sung Hwa reaches her camping site and puts the tent she gets a call and has to clean up the tent right away and go back... she didn’t get to do anything but still she says that she enjoyed going there even if it was for a short moment.
And I just loved their band and jam sessions! It was always my dream so it was especially meaningful for me :)

Characters in this drama like I already mentioned are amazing. Each and every one is special, different and interesting. I love how this drama doesn’t have a villain. All of them are just people. And they are awesome people! All of this of course was possible by amazing directing, writing and acting! Actors did such a great job I got attached to each character and don’t want to say goodbye.

Yang seok young may seem like a boring loner and a mama boy, but is very sweet, had his own share of difficulties and is very strong, responsible and nice.
Chae Song Hwa is like a perfect woman but she too has her difficulties and her little hobbies she enjoyes a lot, she is also very strong and very nice.
Lee Ik Jun may seem like a crazy and irresponsible man, but in reality he cares for everyone and is very sweet, he doesn’t help only his friends but also absolutely everyone in this drama, friend of the world.
Kim Joon Hwan may seem cold and harsh but he also cares for everyone around him and does all the sweetest things without anyone knowing.
Ahn Jong Won may seem naive and week, but he has his own big special things that he is responsibly doing and a heart of big soft gold.
The nurses, residents and other staff had their share of screen time too which wasn’t even slightly brining. Each and every person was unique and interesting.
I love how they show us that you can start your career even later in life, even after you failed at another place. That you can find your love later in life too and that everything will be alright and life goes on.
I need to mention also parents of the main characters and other older cast. At first some of them are introduced in a tricky way making us think that they may be bad. But each and every one of them is so precious! I especially loved chairman’s Rosa’s friendship!
And of course patients and their families, we see all kinds of patients mean and kind but all in all everyone was human trying to live their lives.
Humor in here is another thing and I loved that even after the devastating tragical cases they always included comical scenes to not make the viewers sink in the sadness but give them some ray of light and hope that the sun will shine tomorrow and you can laugh!
Anyway it was really a phenomenal drama that made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I cried and laughed with them and was extremely jealous of their friendship!!!!

P.S. I never rewatch dramas so I just put a random number in there :)

Absolutely THE BEST DRAMA I've ever Watched
I'll just write the pros and cons here in a list form.
This drama is actually a slice of life drama. It's just like an anthology of short stories but the roles are the same.

Pros (not in any order):
I. OST-rich
2. No boring episode. Here, you have 5 main roles to watch, they are funny and are true friends.
3. This drama grants you a LOT of comedy in each episode
4. THE MOST REALISTIC KDrama I've ever found
5. This drama DOES have romance stories with perfect ratio (the drama isn't overshadowed by romance scenes).
6. This drama does NOT rely too much on past stories/conflicts. The past is just to explain that those 5 characters are friends since long ago and the history of how they became friends.
7. Rich of BEAUTIFUL LIFE STORY, no unnecessary plot twist.
8. WILL make you understand some of the medical terms and procedures.
9. THE BEST NATURAL COMEDY in K-drama ever. You will laugh just by watching their acts, in fakin' EVERY episode!
10. You will also be teary because of the kindness or sadness in the story. This drama's setting is in the live-or-die building after all.
11. It's planned to have the SECOND SEASON!!!

Cons:
1. It's too short. Only 12 episodes (1 hour ++) each. But, still not enough for me :(

First and before all if you avoiding hospital playlist because it's medical think again it's way more and unlike other medical drama which focus on showing doctors skills and how great they are in Operations , hospital playlist more about their normal life ..

Diaries like drama, in the start it look so simple like there are nothing on it but it have so much if you look more, so much relationships and so much love lines /ships ^^ and that's so reality if you work in the same place for all day and we all that hospitals have that much couples in real..

ACTING i think there are no need to talk about the mean cast acting they all known and proved how good are they.. but let me tell you literally everyone is good from big roles to small roles even the kids, maybe it's the power of Shin director he is known since replay even bad actress act well with him.. he is that good.

Music = Nostalgia , even though it's not from my young age not from my country it steal take me to that time . I enjoyed it the most and wait for the band gather scenes the most.

Lastly as expected from shin won ho and lee woo jung give us the best life , friendship , love and heartwarming feel all in one show. I want to thank them for that.

Realistic Plotline
Hospital playlist is a such a soothing and realistic drama, no unrealistic love triangle or fight over ownership or whatever. Though this drama won’t be everyone’s favorite, it might be boring to some people because of the plotline but I believe it’s a drama that is closer to reality, dramatic plots can be tiring also.
The acting, the OSTs, the side characters and how issues are addressed by the characters just hit different. I love everything about this drama and I hope season will be better

Truly, I loved 11 3/4 of this 12 episode series. I was angry at the end because I'm a person that desires closure and it was leaving me hanging. However, at the very end it tells you that season 2 is next year. I may change my review title after the anger subsides. :) I finished episode 12 a few minutes ago so it's still raw. Would I recommend you watch it? YES, and here's why.

In case you don't know Hospital Playlist is about a 5, 30-something doctors who have been close friends since college. The 5 of them let off steam by forming a garage (well basement) band. Hence the playlist part of the title. There are several stories woven into the fabric of HP. There are the patients, the hospital staff and their interactions with the core 5, and the core 5 themselves. The 5 have separate side stories that cris cross nicely. The same way all of our stories intersect with friends and family I would assume. Screenwriter Lee Woo Jung did a very good job juggling the stories, the sweet and bittersweet. The director, Shin Won Ho, did an excellent job as did his editors.

The cast is what truly made the drama special. Each lead actor brought something unique and different to the screen. The character's personalities were unfolded wonderfully. They were fantastic. Not just the lead and supporting actors, but the guest stars were wonderful. The guests I'm referring to mostly played the patients. From the children to the elderly, they were brillant. I caught myself wanting to console so many patients. It was ridiculous how many times I wanted to cry; how many times I was happy; how many times I wanted to kick them and yell snap out of it. OK I did the yelling part. My family just looked at with raised eyebrows. There really was no stand out acting among the 5. They were a true ensemble amongst themselves. I will admit Jo Jung Suk's Dr. Lee Ik Jun was my favorite from his first to last scene. If I had to pick one thing I didn't like, it was seeing the band in almost every episode. Thankfully, their stories moved along during the singing, but oft times I could have done without. But, honestly, it wasn't that bad.

The music was good. I usually don't pay much attention to it, but as I stated the 5 form a band and sing in every episode. All 4 of the men have great voices, especially experienced stage/musical actor, Jo and Yoo Yeon Suk. I don't know if Jeon Mi Do can sing, but her character most definitely can not! I have to say I did like the songs they sang. They seemed to convey the mood of each episode. I just wish it weren't each episode.

I'm not big on rewatching, but I can see Hospital Playlist having a large rewatch value for those that do, especially since season 2 will be out next year. Rewatch or not, it's definitely worth a first watch. It's emotional. It's funny. It's uplifting. It can be sad, but not depressing. It's addictive. Mostly, it's enjoyable.

Healer
Simple yet Extraordinary medical drama. I actually don't know how could I appreciate this drama with just words. Each episode will make you cry, laugh and you'll go with the flow till the end and didn't realize how quickly this drama ends. The whole cast ,each and every actor, Ik Jun is such a charming person and his cutie son U ju, Song Hwa's strong female character won my heart, Jun Wan and Seok hyung were perfect,and other supporting actor's expressions were mesmerizing. Music, stories of patients and friendship , love stories ( especially Gyo Eul and Jung Won ) relationship between doctor and patient... Can't describe how beautifully they depicted everything.Full package of healing.
At last this drama sets another level of medical dramas. Just GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS.

you just need to focus while watching this drama.
you just need to focus while watching this drama. maybe people are a little confused because of the many main characters and many people around the main character, you have to memorize the names of many characters, because this is a drama about medicine, you will also find foreign terms, I think that's why people get confused and unfocused. but once you focus on every scene and read every translation correctly, you will find deep meaning and find extraordinary experiences while watching this drama. especially about their friendship, their friendship was really envious and very meaningful. You will also reminisce when watching this drama. very highly recommended

I genuinely think of myself to be a little stingy when it comes to rating dramas. No matter how much I like it, if something small throws me off, I might just cap my ratings at 9.5, but for Hospital Playlist, I didn’t hesitate when I rated it 10/10. There is something about this show that makes you happy. During and after your experience, the happiness sticks with you for awhile. It’s been a day since I’ve finished it and I’m feeling very happy. I do hope the happiness sticks with me for a very long time.

Fundamentally, it’s a show about friendship that continues strong after two decades, but it also encapsulates the tough work those in the medical field have to go through daily as well as the pain of the patients and their family members when they have to face a difficult obstacle in their lives, which is to battle an illness. I have watched just a few Korean medical dramas, but because of the genre difference, I was for the first time in Hospital Playlist, rewarded with the opportunity to see for myself just how tough their job is, which other medical dramas seemed to fail to strike it in me. Doctors don’t just study for years and then land themselves in a supposedly good paying job. They don’t just sit there and prescribe each passing patient a random medicine and call it a day. For me, that’s what I’ve always known, but I’ve never really thought much of it and just brushed it off. But Hospital Playlist has excellently portrayed the hectic life of the medical field that made me reconsider my so-called apparent appreciation for those in the medical field. Watching them drop everything they’re doing — be it any meal they’re eating or any destination they’re travelling to — and without hesitation return back to the hospital was something very commendable, because I couldn’t imagine how many times they had to do it and how many plans they had to forgo just for perhaps the smallest malfunction that may not even require immediate attention. But then they would, with patience, return back to their personal lives like it wasn’t anything big. This was what I was rewarded with — the deepest gratitude I could ever have for you doctors, surgeons, nurses, etc. I truly cannot imagine the countless amount of sacrifices made and I’m forever grateful for it.

Of course, this whole fat paragraph I had just written wouldn’t be possible for the actors who have excellently portrayed their respective characters. Our main 5 was amazing and I don’t think anyone else could have played their roles better than they themselves. Fun fact: many of the casts are also theatre actors, and for Jeon Mido who plays Songhwa (one of the main 5), it’s her very first major television role other than 1 or 2 super minor ones and she seriously slayed it! I also want to commend the side characters who did an equally fantastic job. There were many touching moments in the show that rendered me a few drops of tears, but there was one particular scene that truly broke me. It was when Cho Yihyun who plays a female medical student Jang Yunbok, tells Songhwa ‘I miss my mother so much’ and then breaks down in her arms. I wasn’t awe-struck by her acting initially because her roles didn’t seem to have any proper room to truly showcase her skills, but that one line brought out some kind of pain in me I didn’t think I would have had. In that split-second, I suddenly missed my mother more than ever, even though she was just in the room next door sleeping. What I wanted to say is...every actor in Hospital Playlist is deserving of a proper recognition because they have successfully brought the script to life, in a very interesting and enjoyable way, and that’s what makes the show a success.

Hospital Playlist isn’t just a television series. It’s an eye-opener to the daily struggles of different parties, it’s a recipe to everlasting friendship and it’s a form of enlightenment to you, that there is beauty in this world, in small ways that has the potential to amount to a lot when you slowly build it up.

REALISTIC MEDICINE BUT MORE REALISTIC CHARACTERS
This is one of the best Kdramas i have ever watched.
Each and every character is special and has a variety of traits that make him unique. Even some bad traits are presented with humor but also with respect and they make you fell in love with flawed characters *cause no one is perfect*
This show will make you laugh and cry at the same time. The friendship between the five lead characters is one of the best i have seen and the chemistry is undeniable.
Also the love stories are super cute; we have friends to lovers, bestfriend's sister to lover and workplace romance.
If you like medical dramas you will love it, but even if you are not into them this show will make you fell in love with a new genre.

I recommended 100%
I look forward for season 2

the reason i loved the show is the perfect balance between friendship,profession,love,relation,and depiction of life of doctors.This drama is really fun to watch as it takes you on a ride of emotions.There were scenes were spontaneity which made me cry and filled my heart with joy.But they should have included the lecture scene.Other medical dramas tend to show unrealistic things which have no sense .But this was pretty close to the actual enviroment of the hospital.The nurses,residents,med students,interns,patients along with the main five as their chemistry was natural made the drama a masterpiece.This is one of the few drama that actually pleases the heart and gives a satisfaction.It also created the curiosity among the viewers by creating some of the most confusing yet intriguing previews.It made my quarantine Thursdays wonderful and worth waiting but the waiting part was also fun with al their bts. ,relays and swoons. The most beloved thing is the friendship between the five.It is so pure ,I wish i had such amazing gang of weirdos which consisted all types of personality extrovert to introvert,angel to heartless Buddha and balanced songhwa who is a talented lady!Their relationship stories were also fun to watch my favorite is Winter Garden !!!!!Drama should help ease yourself as it is part of entertainment !!So this is highly recommend!This is story of mature individual different from that of reply series but with same warmth.THE SONG THAT THEY PRACTICE AS THE PART OF BAND TELL THE STORY (DIARY CONTENT )OF THE PARTICULAR EPISODE IN FORM OF BEAUTIFUL SONG.At last can't wait for the next season .My exceptions have increased so much but sad to wait for 2021!!!

Unique
You know....after watching a lot of overly dramatic and crazy romantic dramas it was a huge transition for me when I started this drama. I didn't know what all the hype was about when watching this drama. In the beginning it might be a little slow but as I kept going and going it was honestly worth watching. I loved how these doctors aren't going through ""exaggerated"" points in their lives. It's more realistic and everyone can honestly understand what they are going through. Whether they connect with the patients or one of the 5 main doctors. Honestly it is an amazing drama. It is hilarious and it's one of a kind in my book. If you are considering watching it I think you should be open minded and give it a chance to open up to you.

Can't wait for season 2 :)

Hospital Playlist is a slice of life medical drama that talks about 5 friends stories while working in a busy hospital. This drama has it all! From stories between doctors and patients, doctors and nurses, doctors and family, friends and family, first love, hidden crushes, close friendships and the many hardships of those who come to the hospital and those who are working there.

What is so enjoyable about this drama is the rollercoaster of emotions the viewer experience in each episode. You experience laughter, sadness, empathy, curiosity, hopelessness and many other emotions while watching a single 90 minute episode. And you know what tops it all off, at the end of each episode, the 5 friends come together to play a song as a band as if to rewind themselves + the viewers what they all went through during the episode. The songs at the end of each episode really wraps up everything together and the song title represents the episode.

Story/Plot
The story is about 5 friends experiences while working in a busy hospital. Each lead is a professor/expert in their respective field and the plot revolves around how they tackle medical and lifes problems they come to face. This is a slice of life/ family drama. There are no villians, hidden political schemes or back-stabbing, etc. It is simply people and life. A perfect drama to just sit down and let the stories take you.

Acting/Cast/Characters
I could write a 10 page report on the Main Characters as the viewer is exposed to so much backstory and details. Nearly half the supporting casts has a backstory and even the cameo patients all have their own stories. Each character has their own story/goal and what they are trying to achieve. I tried to write a summary, but I just couldn't as I have so much I want to say, so in conclusion; watch the drama to learn about the characters. The leads are top-notch casts and their acting are superb. Two-thumbs up from me!

Music
Music plays a big role in this drama. Not only do the 5 friends play a song as a band near the end of each episode, but the songs also allows the viewer to reoganise their emotions and thoughts. Furthermore, the background OSTs during certain scenes really fit the story/scenes perfectly.

Rewatch Value
I will definitely rewatch this. I am going back to the start as I am writing this because of what occured in the final episode, just to experience it again. I am sure many of us will be too.

Why I gave the drama my current rating? (10)
The drama is great at showing what it wants to show compacted into 90 minute episodes. I feel like there was no wasted time or boring parts in the drama. The drama's production was very high quality and well worth the weekly wait of 1 episode per week. Did not regret following this drama for 12 weeks! Lastly, there is a reason why this drama is rated so highly on different sites, so give it a go yourself! Confident in saying this is one of top 5 dramas in my life and will highly recommend this to anyone. I cried so much in the final episode and it was so heartwarming.

Medical Drama That's Not Really Medical
When you read the title and the characters, you would get the impression that it would be a medical drama. But to me, this drama doesn't feel like a medical drama at all.
Yes, 90% of the scenes were in hospital. Yes, there were doctors and patients. Yes, they used many medical terms. Yes, there were diseases, illness, deaths. However, the main focus was not medical matter. Maybe because it was slice of life type of drama.
What I like about the drama? All of them.
Acting wise. The actors and actresses did really well to deliver their characters perfectly. They are perfect match for their own characters. The chemistry and relationship between characters are so great. The dialogues and banters between them were so great and felt natural.
Plot wise. The main focus was for the main roles' life stories, of course. But, the other stories were so great too.. Each of the patients' cases was so on point and unique. They complimented the main roles' characters and main stories.. Even though some of them were not really interesting (I skipped some of them when I re-watched it), but the other ones were so great and touching.
Soundtrack wise. You can say that this is kind of a musical drama somehow. Of course, the title already said it all. They have the best soundtracks. I'm so impressed with the casts because they worked really hard to play the musical instruments and sing the songs. They learned them diligently, and some of them learned them from zero. Even though the songs are old songs, I like almost all of them. It wouldn't be surprising when they win the best soundtrack of the year.
Plot twist. This drama broke clichés in drama history. First, while other dramas are about struggling to gain power, this drama was about giving away power. Second, there were many unexpected plot twists about the characters. When you thought that ""ah, it would be the case"" and the next thing you knew it was actually the opposite of it. Some of them are funny and some of them are heartfelt. Really unexpected but somehow satisfying.
Love lines. Every main roles deserves their own story lines. Hopefully, every one of them will have a happy ending and happy relationship in Season 2.
In conclusion, this drama is not a medical drama. (To me, the best medical drama is still Dr. Romantic, and yes, both of them have Yoo Yeon Seok as the lead, lol). But, this is one of the best drama ever for me. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me feel. Even though there were so many substories, it didn't feel boring to me.
This drama deserves every award they got, the hypes, the high ratings, the compliments and of course, Season 2. Personnally, I can't wait for Season 2. Hopefully, it will be as great as the first season.

Must watch show
It definitely became one of my favorites, the first episode did not seem so good to me so I drop it but after I decided to give it another chance and I got a surprise, I finished it in 2 days and I really loved it, the story was perfect and the love stories too they took their time to fall in love, it was not the typical kdrama that the second they see each other they already say ""I love you"" I really loved the stories and it show you the truth of what happens in a hospital, the characters were incredible ♥ ️ the songs goes so well with the history and the chemistry between everyone shows. I can't wait for season 2 ♥ ️

A perfect slice of life!! Lovely drama!!
I totally love this drama, the story is so good and original in its realism, without the unnecessary drama of some other series. Completely love the medical stories, albeit they were sometime heartbreaking.

Story:
It was a great story focused on the life of 5 doctor friends, who've been there for each other so much that they are essentially family to each other. I loved the interactions they had when together and how each one has their own style when dealing with patients and other medical professionals and staff. The medical stories were great, so well explained that a non-medical professional could easily follow it and so greatly immersed in the overall plot that was so well planned.

Now, regarding the love stories, it was fascinating how they were developed, from the get go we know Dr. Jang Gyeo Wool has a big crush on one of the big 5 (Dr. Ahn Jung Won), who is less than impressed with her people and empathy skills. She then proceeds to slowly change in the course of this first season and continue to grow as a doctor. On the other hand, we have Dr. Chae Song Hwa, which I will admit, at first I thought that Dr. Kim Jun Wan had a thing for her, but as the show keeps developing, we can see he always saw her as a friend, unlike the other 2 guys of the group, Dr. Lee Ik Jun and Dr. Yang Suk Hyung. In this case Song Hwa had already rejected Suk Hyung, and Ik Jun to not hurt his friend further didn't confess, but now as he divorces his cheating ex wife, finds himself falling again for Song Hwa, and now he cannot avoid confessing. It turns out that she already has a someone crushing on her, her resident Dr Ahn Chi Hong, whom she is at first unaware of his feelings and later on has to deal with him. I find very interesting how the relationship of Jun Wan and Lee Ik Sun will develop with her out of the country for years on her master's degree in the UK, hopefully they will not break up. I am also eating too see what Suk Hyung ex-wife wants with him and why he says he feels apologetic towards her, I honestly hope that at the end Dr. Chu Min Ha finds someone deserving of her, I think she is a great character that deserves someone who appreciates what she can offer. As anyone can see the relationships are complicated, but they get very well developed and one can totally see how they go forward. I am waiting impatiently for the second season.

Acting/Cast:
Great acting from all the main and secondary cast, even the guest actors were great. All the dramatic scenes were very well developed and managed to transmit the feelings that they must. I think that when a drama can make you cry watching it, it is a great one and a sign of amazing acting ability by the actors. They all show different feelings and do not remain static (like Jun Wan being tsundere all the time, he sometimes acts cute and silly), this shows amazing acting ability and allows the audience to see how far the actors can go.

Music:
So pretty and the message that they convey great for the scenes and episodes where they are used. The Ost consists of a lot of different songs, which I realize are oldies in South Korea, but are so good to the ear as they are not the typical K-pop songs we are used to now.

Rewatch Value:
Very High, I continue watching it because I love it so much.

Doctors risk their own health to save ours
I couldn't pull myself to watch the final episode because I didn't want it to end.

The most beautiful part of this drama is the beautiful relationships between the doctors and patients and also between the 5 doctors. Every episode you'll guarantee to cry because of the sacrifices doctors are willing to make for their patients and because of the pain that patient's loved ones go through when they see the patients die. However, you'll guarantee to laugh as well because of the doctors' quirky personalities and friendship.

When I watched the first episode, I wasn't ready for so much sadness so I thought I couldn't keep watching it but when I watched the second episode, I became so addicted because of the doctors and I became very curious of what a doctor's day to day life is.

After watching this drama, I knew how important looking after your loved ones and yourself is. We need to protect ourselves from the virus in order to protect our doctors that risk their own health that fight everyday to save ours.

Just watch it!
If you haven't been watching this drama already, it is probably because you haven't witnessed the magic that comes about when Lee Woo Jung and Shin PD work together. This season's last episode came out today and so I thought a review was in order. Don't worry, no spoilers :) (I hope...)

Let's start with the story. There is something so refreshing about this drama compared to all the other ones out right now. At first, I couldn't quite put my finger on it but now I can. Like their other works, this masterpiece is normal? There is no supernatural, no major drama or crazy accidents that usually appear in medical dramas. There was no real enemy. There is no exaggeration. It is simply the story and relationships (romance or not) of five very charming 40-year olds and their playlist through life. The humor did kill my stomach multiple times. There are just so many golden moments that highlight their dynamic.

The cast...the talent and hidden gems in this work cannot be rated. They were perfect. I can't imagine anyone else playing their respected roles. You can tell they prepared hard and well for this. They are all respected in the industry with many works under their belts. I always forget they are actually actors and not actual doctors going about their lives. Also, just to let your mind be blown a little more...their band? They are actually playing :) Such a talented group with this indescribable dynamic.

Next are the amazing Lee Woo Jung and Shin PD. Their works are a constant guessing game. I say that in the best way possible. It is a thrill when watching. They give you the hints and pieces slowly. You really grow to appreciate the genius behind the writing and it always amazes me whenever I see the parallels in scenes or just how they set something up. Their works are always refreshing and great pieces that may not drift you to a fantasy world but make you enjoy your current one. I always end up seeing a version of myself or an awesome group of friends that I would love to hang out with one day. The best part is you can't guess anything until it happens. Replay people understand :)

When we talk about music, it has to start with the band music huh. In almost every episode, we see the band play a song that usually wraps up the episode. The songs are chosen to fit the contents of the episode and are a pleasure to the ears. I get blown away by the cast's dedication and willingness to practice. The better news? I hear they are actually debuting. The OST itself is amazing and filled with such talented voices. I have been listening to it religiously since release. I am currently too while writing this :)

Rewatch value?! I have been rewatching it to gear up for the final episode and even just while waiting for the other episodes to come out. I also see myself coming back to the series so for me it's high. The series hasn't even ended yet and I have already rewatched it several times!

The only downside to this is there are only 12 episodes that means one was released a week. The pain of waiting ;-; But I did it anyway. I do this a lot for anime but almost never for dramas. To give you an idea, the only other one I remember doing this for is Nobody Knows and that had two episodes a week. I didn't really mind waiting though. Don't get me wrong it was painful but the quality of each episode made it worth it so I didn't mind. The good news is this is getting a season 2 soo :) Hopefully, if you guys watch it and give it some love, a season 3!?

I would say, if you are interested, give it a try. If it isn't for you, then move on. BUT if you liked Replay or just want something light to land on after some intensely long drama, this could be the one. I came for the amazing Lee Woo Jung and Shin PD but stayed for everything. This is actually one of my favorite of all time! I think I tend to review popular ones or ones I liked. This is the later. Well, I am going to go refresh Netlfix for the millionth time and hope the episode is out while crying about my empty life after it is over. (update: I finished ;-; )

Also...just wanted to put it out there....Ikjun is my favorite character in the Kdrama universe..I think. 0-0 WOW I didn't even have one before this! Well, why are you still here? Go watch it? Maybe? No pressure.

This show is at the top of my favorite list
I have watched everything that writer LWJ and director SWH created and I have become a fan since the Reply series. I have trusted their work because everything they created so far were all masterpieces. And so, even before Hospital Playlist started airing, I knew it would be a great show--and I wasn't a bit disappointed.

I won't comment on the obvious, because the writing and directing was undoubtedly top quality. I would want to commend the ensemble cast who did excellent work in making the characters alive. They felt like real people and their friendship and human interaction were so life-like. Every scene touched me. Every micro expression tells a story. Every band practice inspired me. Every karaoke moment reminded me of my friends.

This is a story about friendship and the road to life. It tells me that at 40, I can still make life-changing decisions and it's still not too late to find love.

I have so much love for this show. So much respect to the production team who gave us a show worth watching.

Don't you dare miss this.
It took me a while to start watching 'Hospital Playlist'. I didn't think I would like it this much and oh Lord, I was wrong.
Typical medical drama? Forget about that. This drama is a new way of seeing things. I wasn't expecting this at all. The comedy here is, omg, amazing! I laughed A LOT, especially with Ik Jun and Jun Wan. If you haven't watched this yet GO and do it NOW, or I'll make sure you do :)

Let me start a review the proper way now that I've made clear you should watch it, just in case you wanna know a little more.
The story develops amazingly since the first ep. At first, it may be a little hard to follow since they'll be introducing a lot of the cast, but it'll get easier. Still, it took me a while to learn all of their names (and now I can't get them out of my head). It's obviously a medical drama, but it's different from any other I have seen; they will form a band. I repeat, in case you didn't read well. They. Form. A. Band.
The band is one of the best things for me, but it may not be for everyone. However, you're free to skip the band scenes. In my opinion it's necessary for the drama. It's one of the things that make it different (and so good). I also discovered a lot of good music with them, so it's a plus.

If you ask me what I think is the main theme of this drama, I would say it isn't medicine but friendship. The reason I'm saying this? You'll discover it once you start watching (but it's not hard to guess, is it?). The medical parts are marvelously good, though, and they make sure to feed us well-written and emotional stories for each patient that we meet. I can't really say anything else without spoiling. There's obviously romance in this, but I wasn't expecting the 'couples' at all. Still, I screamed like a crazy b with them (cough, wintergarden couple, cough).

Overall I would say it's a drama that shows the daily life of a group of friends that just happen to work at the same place, but have different stories to tell. It's funny, not boring at all, knows how and when to make you cry, and also has a lot of heartwarming scenes (and couples). What more can you ask for?

This saved my 2020
This is from the same director and PD of Reply series. If that's not enough reason for you to watch it, then I'll offer you Jeon Mido, Jo Jung Sok, Jung Kyungho, Yoo yeon-seok, and Kim Dae-myung.

Aside from those mentioned above, I think this is one of the series that all of the OSTs are worth listening to every day.

So, watch it. If you're curious why I haven't said anything about the plot, this one, just like the other reply series, is not a typical drama. This is a story that depicts each one of us. Their emotions and struggles are ours too. We deal with it every day.

Plus, this also taught me to be observant in each scenes. Hahaha you'll understand why if you watch this hahaha

Super worth it!
I was hesitant at first because its a drama about doctors and i wanted to be a chef but i tried it and im glad that i tried it because for real, this is one of the best drama ever. No problems just a smooth story line about 5 doctors and their friendship. The casting was also great, all of them really did well in portraying their role!! The OST? do i have to say it? It was super good especially having Kyuhyun? Joy? Overall it was fun watching this! This drama made me laugh, made me cry a lot but it was all worth it! Can’t wait for Season 2

Emotional, Wholesome, Real!
When I started watching Kdramas almost a year ago to the date, I never thought that I would find a drama that I would rate with a perfect 10, but here we are. Hospital Playlist was almost perfect in every aspect , and keep in mind I do not like medical dramas mainly because I find them unrealistic and exaggerated, but I loved how Hospital Playlist kept everything real and it makes you really understand the struggles of medical professionals.

Acting: Amazing. Never seen actors fit their roles so perfectly!
Character/ Cast Chemistry: Out of the World
Plot: Emotional, Wholesome, Real!

I can see as to why some people why find it boring, but I found it very refreshing! Grown-up people acting mature, facing real life problems and going on with their lives. Each episode was almost 1,5 h long but it felt much less. All the character has a reason and fit each other and the story perfectly, not a single one of them feels out of place. At first it was overwhelming getting introduced to all the characters but as the episodes go by then each character gets center stage, and you get to know and connect with them and by the end you are emotionally invested in each one of their lives and stories.

If all you look in a series is Action, angst, drama and with a good guy wins over a villain, then this is definitely not for you, but if you are looking for a drama with real people, real stories that will make you feel a every emotion emotion and laugh wholeheartedly then this is definitely for you.

Masterpiece in every way
I loved loved loved loved loved it. So much. And it makes me so unbelievably happy that there is going to be a 2nd season, and that next year! What a blessing.
Even though they left a few things undone, it was still very satisfying and at the same time it keeps us excited for the next season. Honestly I was scared that they'd be changing the cast and story like they did with the reply series, or even Dr. romantic, but I guess I don't really have to worry about that!
I cried tons this episode. The first half was extremely heart-breaking and I still admire the way they convey their feelings, every single person who worked on this has contributed to this and I am very grateful!
1. I loved their friendship, it is just pure, fun, and so comfortable to watch.
2. I loved them as humans. Every single one of them. They all had their own personality, but two things that they shared was their friendship for each other and them being good to the damn core. I mean good as in morally and emotionally. They seriously inspired me to be a better person and also work harder.
3. I have mentioned this before, but I loved the fact that there were NOT the typical kdrama struggles and obstacles. No annoying chaebol (I mean there is Seokhyungs father but he appeared like once and he did not matter that much, it was more about how Seokhyung and his mother will deal with him). Actually... isn't this production team known for being fresh and non-cliché? Anyway, fact is. I love it.
4. I love the way they tell the story. I guess it's a pretty unconventional way of unfolding a story (ties with the point above), but it's just so unique and it works very very well. To me it seems more human and more like life? Things don't always get confronted at first, often a lot of time will pass and often it is not even that dramatic. There were no slow motions or like moments that they would show longer than necessary (maybe those moments were even in real-life time?).
5. I loved the heart breaks and heart throbs they gave us. It hurt when something bad happened, when a patient was doing badly, but it made me so much more happy when they recover. They did not drag a heart break for long. We move on in life.
6. I loved the relationships between the doctors and patients they showed. We saw that they cared deeply for their patients and always ALWAYS did their best in order to help them recover. They basically lived to save people. I was quiet moved by this and my respect for doctors grew again. Sometimes it even made me want to be one...
7. I loved that even though they gave their life for other people, they enjoyed it. It was the thing that they loved the most. And still, they'd try to find time to do other things they enjoy. To look after themselves. Seonghwas love for camping and food. Jeongwons love for God and his mother. Junwans love for golfing and Iksun. Seonghyungs love for his time alone. Ikjuns love for his son and being a social butterfly.
I am running out of ideas. There are definitely more, but I did not actually planned this comment out so idk.
Well, I will patiently wait for the next season which is going to be the bomb too. Ah and also... I am going to wait for this to finally appear on Netflix so I can rewatch it :)

PS.: I recommended this to my mom and she rewatched it for like 4 times already. That I call success.

This show is definitely one of the most heart warming shows I have watched. It completely changed how I view doctors and thier efforts. It changed my views on surgeries.I am actually a little bit (very) scared of surgeries, pregnancy and anything related to hospitals,but this drama made me feel less anxious. It basically opened my eyes towards so many things I chose to turn a blind eye to.
I personally dont enjoy the medical genre, it is a little bit too much for me. But this show is an exception. It depicts more real life of doctors than a fantasy that is often shown in many dramas. More than the medical aspects,it shows relationships of people. Friends, family, love and siblings is shown so incredibly well.
Our 5 friends are friendship goals. I love each of them so much! This is the purest friendship I have seen on screen, so cute and heartwarming.
The show is also so fun to watch,so many laugh out loud moments! The 12 episodes went by quite fast.
The music played during the show has the most beautiful lyrics and such emotional and nostalgic vibes. I love the band sessions of the friends.
The only issue I see is how the story keeps getting cut suddenly and shown in a later part of the show,I know they're to create an aspect of mystery but after a while I started to get annoyed. The ending has an abrupt ending, it ended like it was supposed to have more episodes but didn't. I wasn't satisfied with how most story lines had an open ending. I think there is a season 2 coming next year, so I'm excited for that!

Reply series creators, you're amazing
Firstly it's pretty rare but I watched this series as it came out instead of bingeing it once it finished. It was so good I spent the first 5 weeks just re-watching the series again from the start, every week. So by the time I'd gotten to the end, I'd watched the first episode about 4 times. That is crazy. It also goes to show how amazing this show is. The creators are so conscious of everything they show us as an audience, they are continually thinking so far ahead. Even when I know that and try to think ahead they outsmart me.

There was never any doubt but I love the friendships between all the characters. Like how in the Reply series they'd spent their childhood growing up together, here they've spent their adult life growing up together. I love how they're all different but connected with each other. The side characters are engaging, different and full of personality. It's to the point where it feels like there's 20 main characters rather than there being side characters. There was so much character introduction, which is why I had to keep watching the first episodes, but it was amazingly integrated in. Every line builds the character and the following scenes. It's hard to keep up with consciously but when I watched it again I would spot cues to a scene in the next episode.

Chae Song-hwa is my new girl crush, I love how Jung Kyung-ho is basically replaying his playboy Prison Playbook character. He's even hotter in doctor form and I've never appreciated a tsundere character until now. Jo Jong-suk of course delivers flawlessly his comedic and familial sides. There's so much depth to everyone's characters, only a great cast like this could pull it off so well. How they may do it differently but they all have their brash sides, their friendship sides, their relational sides, their caring sides.

How can I forget the Playlist part to this show? You'd think it's out of place but actually it and the lyrics to the songs they are singing are what tie the show together. Pay attention to the lyrics, it can only make it better.

Quote: Have you never had a friend? - Kim Jun-wan

ELEGANT !!
This show revolves around the lives of 5 doctors who have been friends since their college days. It's a brilliant portrayal of the everyday of the workaholic middle class. The writers and production team managed to concoct up a story that is satirical yet realistic, comedic yet emotional and sad yet joyful. Not only are each and every character relatable and unique, they also manage to reel you in and make you invested in their story. The beautiful friendship that binds them as they balance between their personal lives and professional lives is the foundation that hooks you in since the very first episode. I highly recommend this show. This is one of those shows that comes once in a while leaving a deep impression upon you. The acting is flawless, the cinematography and direction are exemplary and the music, perfectly blended. This is a must watch.

one of the best for me!
story

i think these types of stories aren’t for everyone, and that explains why I see some people find it quite boring. it was extremely light tho, and it can be seen that there is no major plot, just character driven.

the first few eps might've been confusing, but im glad i kept going on and watched it, because if i stopped watching it, i could've missed out on this great drama. its probably because of the enormous cast they had to introduce to the audience.

i loved the story though! i liked seeing their friendship blossom throughout the years, and watching this series made me wish to have a friendship like theirs.

the relationships in this drama were also so good please. i enjoyed seeing jeongwon and gyeoul the most, and that scene in the last ep got me so shocked! i didnt expect them to get together, the most i expected was at least a friendship between the two! im so grateful for that and I CANT WAIT TO SEE THEM IN THE NEXT SEASON. also, im an iksong shipper, and i’d like to see songhwas response to ikjuns confession in the next season. the scene when she took care of uju when he was sick was so heartwarming and i also want to see more of that!! i also like the other ships, but these two were the ones that made me super happy haha.

im also glad that it had 12 eps only for the first season. i’d probably be alright if this show had ten seasons, i just love it too much tbh. but i think the 12 eps made the story have the right pacing, nothing or things were barely too slow nor too fast.

ahh also, i like how this show is pretty relateable even though its a medical drama. whenever i watch medical dramas im always confused because of the terms happening hehe. it made me appreciate the medical field even more though. it showed the reality faced by the doctors. i know this show isn’t super medically accurate, but from what i heard it was quite accurate anyway. i’ve always wanted to become a neurosurgeon like chae songhwa as well though!

one of my favorite parts of this drama is also the band!! it’s so cool to see their band playing, and when i found out that the actors actually learned the instruments for this, i was even more impressed. i truly love mido and falasol, and want to hear more from them. i guess it held a closer place in my heart since i, myself play the piano and guitar. im not that good tho, but i was inspired to play them even more because of this!

generally, the story was so heartwarming, and comforting. it really holds a close place in my heart.

actors

okay so before this drama, i only knew jo jungseok honestly. but now that i’ve watched this, im a fan of a loot of the cast, even those supporting roles like shin hyunbeen etc. they all did so well, and props to them for that. im so grateful for this drama making me know them, thank you to the amazing people who casted them as well.

im impressed with their determination as well. as far as i know from their behind the scenes videos + band practice videos, i really saw how much they worked hard for it. whenever they record, they really take their time and make sure everything sounded great. the fact that they learned the instruments for the drama was also so cool! its pretty hard to learn instruments that quick and i remember mido’s bass teacher saying she learned it so fast that he was impressed. also for the rest, because it must be so tiring to practice that much! also props to mido singing off key when she’s actually so good at singing haha

they all surely gave justice to the characters they portrayed in the drama. their chemistry on screen and off screen is also so amazing! ive been watching all of the videos in the “채널 십오야” or na pd’s youtube channel, and im loving every single episode. its like a connection of the drama, but we also see how close the actors are nowadays!! its so nice to see them being all close :)

music
the osts of this drama were all equally goood!! i don’t have a favorite, since it’s so hard to choose because like i said they’re all good hahaha. i have their music on play most of the time, they’re part of my favorite songs! also, its so cool how some of their osts are sung by the actors who are in the show, its really so amazing!

rewatch value
i’ve watched some scenes again and again, but i can’t get tired of them. im attached to this show. im definitely going to rewatch this one day soon, and also another time before they release the second season!! im so desperate for the second season already, please come soon!! even if that comes im gonna rewatch the two seasons together hihi


but like i said, this show might not be for everyone!! but it was for me :)

Story

- The story is the perfect blend of hospital/work related plot points and the characters personal stories.
- It's not the most exciting show but that is makes it so great. It a comfort to watch.
- There is romance and my first ship in the early episodes of Kim Jun Wan and Chae Song Hwa did not sail. HOWEVER, there is another very interesting romance instead which I did enjoy after the episodes went on.
- My main gripe is the romance between Ahn Jung Won and Jang Gyeo Wool which felt a bit forced.

Acting/Cast

- All the male leads are seasoned actors with Jeon Mi Do being a newcomer to TV acting but a very well known stage actor. All of them were brilliant.
- The training and effort put in to learning each song for the music scenes could not have been easy.
- Kim Jun who plays Ik Jun's son is the most precious.

Music

- The songs are bops.
- From Me to You is my favourite and you all need to listed to the OST version where Jeon Mi Do shows her actual voice which is very lovely.

Rewatch Value

- This show definitely has rewatch value because it makes you happy.

So good, yet not for everyone.
I watched this drama when it came out on Netflix. And I gotta be honest I wasnt really expecting to like it as much as I did! I have never been interested in medical dramas/series and everything that comes with them; however this drama peaked my interest because of two things: i like the fact that the series revolves around a group of adult friends and because I'm a fan of Jo Jung-suk. So with those two things in mind, I gave it a chance, and i was quickly hooked. I loved everything about this drama: the plot is great, the acting is phenomenal, the characters are likeable and I think they break the mold of your typical kdrama stereotypes. I liked it that much, that this is the first kdrama that I recommend to my family and that they agreed to watch!!
My parents, brothers and I, watched it together and while my parents loved the show, my brothers thought it was boring.
This is why I think, this show is not for everyone. The pace of the show sometimes it could be very slow and it could become tedious, I personally didnt mind it that much but I noticed that my brothers were annoyed by it.
I think this show is a gem, its so different from your typical kdrama. Its serious, yet goofy at the same. It makes you laugh and cry.

Oh my, they really did left me hanging and wanting for the next season to air. The story is very great. I can relate most of it especially them being doctors. I really envy their friendship wishing I had like theirs. I really enjoyed most of their funny scenes. And the last episode, I really can't wait for the season 2. Really a good series to watch, funny, not too much of drama, just the right amount, and the story is somewhat relatable even without the hospital setting. A must watch.

**Bear with me for I am not great in writing reviews. First one actually. Hope this review will help somebody. =)

The slice-of-life drama I never knew I needed
There are so many things to love about this drama - from the soundtrack to the acting and the melt-in-the-heart moments. I find it really difficult to find a drama that's an ""easy watch"", especially as some days at work can get really stressful and all it takes is a drama like this to lift up my spirits. It highlights the struggles and joyous moments of each main character equally, but never ever lets either of those things drag on for too long. For example, in the episode after Ik-jun's wife wanted to divorce him, my gut feeling was that that would really impact upon his performance as a general surgeon, but that wasn't the case at all. Instead, those struggles were briefly captured when he opened up to a patient of his about being cheated on, thus allowing the patient to resonate with him.

I'm not sure if it was because the age difference between the characters and I was small, or that their problems and lives were so realistic but this drama moved me in a way I'll try my best to explain.

What was so loveable about this drama was the genuine friendship among the main cast. You could see that life had developed around them but they never let their friendship die. Jo Junk Suk was incredible as the superman single father with a successful career. Even as he struggled he never broke a sweat in stepping up and being the man others needed him to be.

What I also found endearing is how the main cast all dealt with their internal struggles and it shows that no matter what age you are, you're never too old to want to run away from your problems and take the immature way out. Ahn Jung Won and Chae Song Hwa were the biggest cowards of the group but one couldn't hate them for it. For many years their main focus was on their careers and they tried or more likely probably refused to acknowledge what would make them happy. I myself can say I am of guilty of this I mean how do you stop and smell the roses when work became the most important thing because of your passion. It frightening to look down something different when you've already given so much of yourself to your ambition.

There was also the elements of understanding oneself and coming to terms with the kind of person that you are. Jung Kyung Ho's performance was incredible portraying this. He knew who he was and knew what he wanted and he reached that place. I always love it when boyfriends are always supportive and never pressure their partners and let them decide what they want or how they need to move forward. it never feels like a sacrifice when it comes from that place. Kim Dae Myung's character was great at this element as well and in a way he seem like the wise mature guru of the group ready to offer pearls of wisdom that was often ignored by friends.

The connections among the group was unbelievably charming and it's everything you want in a slice of drama. The feelings of belonging and being accepted permeated throughout making it a wonderful coming of middle-age drama because at 40 we still have a lot of life left to live.

And lastly the playlist was awesome!!

Watching this drama is like collecting puzzle pieces on your path that comes together in the last episode. The end will give meaning to everything and make you think about your life.

The writers cleverly hid the real plot and tricked the viewers into believing it is a romantic comedy. They held our hands and pulled us toward a fantasy world that was funny and sad at times. All to ease us into the real story that is fascinating, deep, and heartwarming.

Main Themes:
- Bond between parents and their children, friends, lovers, and family members.
- Living through the hardships and enjoying each moment you have, instead of worrying about the future or regretting the past.

I am so impressed with the morals this drama carries and the amazing performance of all the actors. I am also happy that my curiosity made me complete the episodes, because I would have missed a valuable gem.

wow! I started this drama off expecting some light fantasy rom com cheesy drama but oh boy was I in for a surprise, comedy peaked at certain points, mainly from interactions with Hye Ja and Young Soo, but the melodrama really was a big aspect throughout the drama especially the last few episodes, a few times I got jumbled throughout the drama there were a few too many things going on that I couldn’t exactly figure it out or understand it. But there were tiny hints hidden throughout the episodes to help to understand the overall drama.
The acting was great, they really managed to convey the emotions and lay it on thick and raw, really outstanding, especially from support characters
Overall this drama was a real game changer with its sudden plot twist, it always seemed to keep me on my toes throughout the drama, it was enjoyable and really made me think how important time is and how you should spend it and the overall importance.

a collection of distorted memories - painful, yet dazzling
(It's hard to believe the MDL ratings for this drama because it deserves so much love.)

A friend recommended this to me and I immediately began watching it. At first, I thought of it as a slice of life, romedy - packed with a bunch of ridiculously funny moments. The first few episodes are definitely light, set with a good pace and a good amount of humor as well. The characters, especially Hyeja's brother had me rolling my eyes and facepalming at his antics (in a good way). The bond of friendship is cute, filled with some heartwarming moments. You'll never know what the story is about and what's the motive behind it all till you get to the last four episodes. At least that's what happened with me.

It is then when you realize that the story isn't coming to an end, it is, in fact, beginning to come around so well, that it leaves you in awe of the way it's so cleverly written and how beautiful it is. I felt the need to revisit all the previous episodes to see how the moments we saw have completely changed in their meaning. It flips the entire perspective around and suddenly things start to make a perfect sense.

(might contain some spoilers)

I will begin with the beautiful symbolism of the watch. How it is seen as some time-traveling device but actually turns out to be more meaningful and connects you with a painful memory. I never could have thought that a watch will make me cry so much. The moment you find out its significance, things become sadder. It's just like what Hyeja's son says - that she goes back and relives the happiest moments of her life. And now we know why she is seen traveling back in time and why the watch is shown as some time-traveling medium (cue tears).

The strongest point of this drama, for me, was its beautiful, larger than life moments. The cast is so brilliant, their acting is honest and heart touching. At times it even made me tear up. My friend discussed with me how there are some powerful scenes where there aren't any dialogues but the expressions convey their feelings so well and I'd agree with that.

Hyeja's character, despite all of her struggles, is so inspirational. I absolutely fell in love with Kim Hye Ja and how she beautifully portrayed her. A woman who is struggling to hold onto her memories and her memories resulting in that vague, distorted ones that we saw. And yet, she believes that all those memories, even though they were painful, were full of light. And I believe in her words. I believe that she cherishes them so much because it is visible in the way those moments shine and I loved how they managed to capture them so well.

I couldn't stop my tears for Joonha's character. He left such a deep impact that it wrecked me. Nam Joo Hyuk is a phenomenal actor; I always love watching him on-screen but this is his best acting till this date. He really shone as Joonha and was so radiant.

There is this scene where the old people look at the setting sun and seemingly reminisce about their youthful days. And it made me think of how the title ""The Light In Your Eyes"" is so apt. We often think of old age and relate it with death, but at that moment, their eyes shone so bright and they looked so alive.

The drunk conversations between Hye Ja and Joonha, the fun times with their friends, the old people making us laugh; I think 'The Light In Your Eyes' definitely had its bizarre moments, but despite all of that, what it really meant to me was this beautiful collection of distorted memories - painful, yet dazzling.

This drama will surely make you think about what is important and how to hold onto it forever.

I'd like to end this with this beautiful quote from the drama - ""Even if you are struggling right now, everyone alive has the right to enjoy this every day. Even if one ordinary day is followed by another ordinary day, life is still worth living. Don't waste the present regretting the past and worrying about the future. Live this day beautifully, you deserve it. To all of you who was a mom, a sister, a daughter and yourself.""

The Light in Her Eyes!
'The beautiful journey which keeps you engaged till the end, giving you pain still you have a smile left on your face.' if someone asked to be to describe this show in one sentence. Well, it's an emotional roller coaster where you experience every emotion itself, you cry, you laugh, there's pain, you'll shock, in short you'll experience everything in this small ride. But the main thing is you'll get more than just entertainment, bitter truth, or reality you can say. Surely it's not a fairytale but none the less than that.

The story itself was phenomenal, you cannot predict anything, and the twist you get near the end was more than any surprise. I've seen in any thriller, suspense drama. The execution, the direction was perfect. Characters their emotions, sentiments were amazingly conveyed. The humor was to the point till not absurd, nothing was perfect, every character had it's pro and con, and that's the specialty of this. Its realisticness opens our eyes to see the real world where we live.

Hat's off for the acting, Kim Hye Ja absolutely nailed it, like this role was made for her. I can say I saw a really good change in Nam Joo Hyuk's acting he did a great job portraying his character and last but not least Son Ho Jun wow he's gonna be one of the characters which made me laugh most.

So this was a whole package having a great story, cast, execution, beautiful cinematography, and more than just a drama face to the reality which can teach you the real value of life.

This drama is not what it says on the tin, but in the best way possible. I'm going to keep this one short and discourage you from reading reviews until you've seen it because you will enjoy it all the more the less you know about it in any sense. It's brilliant in every way. It's unlike any other drama i've seen. It's hard to watch, but watch it you must.

Han Ji Min and Kim Hye Ja deliver stunning performances.

Some really great characters, I thought the brother was a really different character and I really enjoyed the playful relationship he had with Hyun-Joo.

Nothing in the sound track particularly stood out, but it wasn't bad either, I think it's more a sign that what was going on in the story drowned everything out emotionally.

I think it's definitely got to be worth at least one rewatch, because once you finish it you'll probably want to watch it again to see if, knowing how it ends, you understand what goes before it differently.

So good.

I have seen a good few dramas with Nam Joo Hyuk as the main lead and while he has quickly become one of my favorites, I was not expecting this kind of maturity and over all amazing performance. I wish I had more adjectives to describe my surprise at his development as an actor but at the moment I can't find any. Just know, dear reader, that this performance deserves an award. Like, I mean an academy award. I may be a little in love with him at the moment. If you are interested, please read my blog where I wrote a review on this series at: https://www.dramaaddictscorner.com/blog/dazzling.

Nam Joo-hyuk is a favorite actor of mine (one of many hahaha) whose career I have been avidly watching. When I saw he decided to star in this very serious melodrama I was intrigued. Netzins have accused him of poor acting which I disagree with. Koreans are also very fascinated with twisty time travel which Radiant explores!

I'm not really a fan of actress Han Ji-min so I was quite worried to watch Radiant. I needn't have because we spend a lot more time on screen with her elderly counterpart Kim Hye-ja who is a wonderful elderly actress (not to be confused with their character with the same name!) Yes, there is a bit of a supernatural twist involved. Of course, Hye-ja's family and friends are greatly effected by this change in her. And we explore this effect alongside her estranged relationship with Lee Joon-ha who she is forced to emotionally abandon even though they fall in love.

Radiant is a very odd story. We assume from the first couple episodes that it will be a supernatural romantic comedy... and it surely has all of those elements, but it is more of a melodrama than anything. The twists start coming hot and heavy in the last handful of episodes and it totally changes how you view that beginning. Yes, there is a roller coaster of emotions that we go through with Hye-ja and Joon-ha, and the end is rather poignant rather than strictly happy, but the journey makes Radiant worth the watch.

Kim Hye-ja and Lee Joon-ha sell me. I was totally on board with this couple. They connected on a visceral level in those first episodes that I really related to and wanted to see play out to the end. Alas a family tragedy totally derails their love affair and we watch Radiant with bated breathe wondering at the promise in that beginning. It's quite heart breaking and Hye-ja works hard to stay close to Joon-ha even as his life spirals out of control. All is not as it seems.

I thought it was quite fascinating how her family and friends play into Hye-ja's story with Joon-ha. Even though we don't learn much until the end, I was fascinated by Hye-ja's parents relationship. There was history there we don't learn about but can feel the effect of. And Hye-ja's own relationship with her father was quite pregnant with emotion boiling under the surface. It was the later episodes though that put all of these moments in perspective. Like I said all is not as it seems but the reality is just as authentic once we know the truth.

Radiant is a true melodrama that wrings your heart out! Romance lovers and non-romance lovers will enjoy this as its authenticity to real life touches your heart despite the supernatural elements that allow us to explore Hye-ja's life. The twists and turns make the journey worth the watch as the truths inherit in Radiant give you a vehicle to ponder your own life.

This drama wrecked me
In a good way. A really beautiful story that takes you on a journey and hits you with truth and a little pain when you least expect it. Definitely one of my ten, need to update that list...

The acting is superb, which is no surprise and I loved seeing a drama featuring an older woman as the star that wasn’t written solely about or for an older audience. This show will open up your mind and help you see the world and others in it in a new way, a more honest and complete way. Helps us remember there’s good and bad about every stage in life, and never dismiss others based on age, young or old.

I expected the usual romantic comedy drama, but this took me for a long ride. It made me feel like I was a part of the show, living through the moments with the characters. This is something that hasn't happened in a very long time. I cannot express how good this drama is. It shows how the elderly feel and makes me appreciate my family even more. I just finished watching it but I just feel so overwhelmed that I cannot come up with words to describe it because I don't feel like the words do it justice.

The 2019 JTBC drama The Light in Your Eyes (Eyes Are Dazzling/눈이 부시게 ) is a stunning viewing experience. In the span of its 12 episodes, you will laugh, you will cry, you will fall in love, you will be on the edge of the seat. But even more importantly, the series leaves us with a profound reminder of a few things.

The first is a common reminder that we should live our lives to the fullest and to live every day like it is our last. The other is perhaps the more important reminder. That is the dignity of human life and how far too often, senior citizens are robbed of that dignity in their twilight years.

The Light in Your Eyes begins with a supernatural bent. As a child, Kim Hye Ja finds a watch that allows her to rewind time. She uses this power for little things like learning to avoid her brother’s teasing or maneuvering a better score on school exams. The catch, however, is she ages faster with every turn back of time.

Now as 25-year-old woman (played by Han Ji Min), she uses the watch to repeatedly go back in time in order to prevent a tragedy. But after she is finally successful, she wakes up as a 70-year-old woman (now played by veteran and acclaimed actress Kim Hye Ja).

Hye Ja must now navigate this peculiar situation. She is now older than her parents. She can pass as grandmother to her older brother and two best friends.

There are many fun and amusing moments as Hye Ja struggles to adjust. But there are also many sad and poignant moments that reveal truths about our everyday lives and today’s harsh world.

The still-25-year-old Hye Ja meets and falls for the handsome Lee Joon Ha (Nam Joo Hyuk) who aspires to be a reporter. In addition to the extraordinary circumstance that befalls Hye Ja and Joon Ha’s relationship, Joon Ha’s relationship with his grandmother in the first third of the series gives a taste of the kind of emotional and heartbreaking stories we will see over the course of the series.

Things are not as they seem, however. And saying much more will ruin the experience.

But things take a breathtaking turn in Episode 10.

Everything leads up to this incredible episode that is equal parts fun, thrilling, action-packed, shocking, emotional and heartbreaking. It is arguably one of the most stunning episodes of television I’ve ever seen.

Everything converges in this episode and The Light in Your Eyes finishes up its last two episodes with several immense emotional punches that have everything coming together and falling into place.

The Light in Your Eyes focuses on many issues that the elderly face in today’s world. It also touches upon the effect those issues have on the elderly themselves as well as their loved ones. But the series also discusses life in general in interesting and unexpected ways.

The story is absolutely engaging and it rewards you with some stunning twists and performances as it reaches its climax.

The amazing ensemble cast brings this multi-layered and emotional story to vivid life

Han Ji Min is able to balance the young Hye Ja with moments when she must be the older Hye Ja appearing as the younger version from time to time. Nam Joo Hyuk shows off his versatility as Joon Ha. There are heavy moments where he truly shines in the series. Ahn Nae Sang as Hye Ja’s father shares a nuanced portrayal of the character that pays off in the end.

Son Ho Joon as Hye Ja’s brother Yong Soo is absolutely hilarious, especially as he is often tasked with the most absurd and funny situations. But he too proves his versatility when he must shift to quieter, more dramatic moments. Still, his riotous performance helps lighten the mood when other parts of the series get much heavier.

Lee Jung Eun delivers an excellent, award winning performance as Hye Ja’s mother. Another nuanced portrayal has her navigating the conflicting emotions of her daughter now being older than her, but also the struggles of her own life and family.

But most certainly, the star of the series is veteran and acclaimed actress Kim Hye Ja as the older Hye Ja. Her fun and cute display at first turns into an absolutely commanding and tour de force performance later on, especially in the final arc. She leads the series and is the heart and soul of the story. An unforgettable performance by one of the best. And her 2019 Daesang for this role proves it.

The Light in Your Eyes is almost an essential viewing experience. The series presents some profound and thought-provoking reminders in a fun, but breathtaking and incredibly emotional way. The series’ depth and sincerity have you easily caring about these characters while keeping you guessing and fully engrossed in the twists and turns of the story.

A truly unforgettable and enlightening experience, The Light in Your Eyes is a must-see.

My entire prediction about the story was completely changed in the last 2 finale episodes.. From The Beginning to end the mood of this drama was too melo dramatic sometimes you feel few laggy scenes especially in the first 5 episodes. But that wonderful plot twist was brilliant and somehow it may be an unpredictable one. That was a real turning point of this drama because everyone will feel, the concept of the time travel part was bit of illogical. The emotional scenes in the finale episode was just magical and heart touching.

The story is about a middle class young girl named kim hye ja. When she was a child She got a watch from the sea side with an supernatural ability to travel back through time. She used that watch helself many times in her life for her own purposes, but some unpredictable and mysterious events happened in her life and the things are changed over a night.

Initially the whole story where entirely predictable and there where nothing new but after that plot twist it will surely surprise you . The acting of the lead characters was superb especially in the finale episode emotional moments. I think this is a worth watching emotional drama and you should give just a try..

I have a lot of mixed feelings about this drama and even months after finishing it, I'm not sure where I stand in terms of liking or hating the plot twist. Yes, the message is beautiful and all, and yes, that last episode had me crying, but I can't say whether that's because of the writing or my feelings towards Alzheimer's after experiencing it through my grandmother.

And, while the message is important, I would have cared so much more if I knew going into this drama what it was about. Sure there are some people who would choose not to watch it because it is a heavy topic that affects many people in real life. When someone has Alzheimer's, its effects radiate. It affects their family, their friends. It even showed as much in the drama. But the choice of whether or not to watch it should be theirs to make. For some people, dramas are an escape from the hardships of the day. They go into dramas wanting to forget real life and to instead invest in characters that they get to slowly learn and care for. So if they go in wanting an escape, it could be considered cruel to throw away the story they developed over 10 episodes for a topic that hits close to home for many. At the same time, I do understand what they were trying to do and respect that. I'm just not sure I agree with the implementation of it.

If the show was honest from the start, I may have loved it. But it wasn't. It feels like those 10 episodes weren't needed if this was the story they were going to tell. All of those story threads and all of that time invested to get to that point were just thrown away in favour of a slice of life melodrama. The show made me care about the delusion of Joon Ha, and I just didn't care at all for the real him because of it. The fake versions of the main couple were a lot more compelling to watch, and I really did care about them, no matter how absurd the story around them was. It's a kdrama, I'm used to the absurd. But the reality of them just made me numb to it all. When I should have felt the most and been hit the hardest, I didn't feel it. A part of me regrets watching it.

And yet, at the same time, I respect the premise. I think that Alzheimer's should be talked about and discussed more often, especially since early intervention is very important for treatment. But I don't think this story pulled that off as well as it could have. Judging from the polarizing reaction to it, while some appreciated the message, a lot are just upset at wasting their time.

So I'm torn on whether to recommend this or not. I do feel that the surprise is unnecessary, and that going into it understanding what you're going to find at the end is the best approach. You can't be disappointed if you know what's coming, so go into it with an open mind and steel your heart.

The Plot itself is very good and well thought off. The Acting was really good it had successfully conveyed the feelings and the message that is being shown. Watching this drama at the start gave me a fluffy feeling. The comedy and drama at the start is a very good balance. It made me laugh while seeing the main's chemistry.

As the drama transitions into something that touches your heart ,even you still don't know the truth.
The fact that it fooled many viewers about the plot and gave us a shocker!
One of the best Kdrama I have watched Plot wise.

First I'll write about what merited it an overall score slightly leaning towards the positive side:

The Light in Your Eyes shows a lot of the contempt and belittling that old people receive. The story deals with this often in a wide array of situations, trying to reflect what it feels like to be old, and at times how age becomes a sole reason to be disregarded.
Even more interestingly, it gets to show it from an audience perspective as well, and that’s really infrequent in pro-youth, always glamorous K-drama. I saw lots of comment from people who were just waiting for the old version of Kim Hye Ja to go away (seeing all she did as wrong) and the 25-year-old to return, refusing to believe that the “grandmother” is the main character (and also despite the fact that Kim Hye Ja is a better actress than Han Ji Min. I do not intend to take away from what Han Ji Min does, but the skill from the older lady really shows).

In fact, after it seemed her old version had done all she could for the story, even I was eager for the protagonist to go back to her younger self so that all the characters could have a better life. It’s a pretty sad symptom, but it’s good that Dazzling is able to bring it out clearly.

As it happens there is a lot the drama wants to bring out—on the sad side. Scamming, solitude, neglect, bitterness. It communicates these aspects of real life well enough that one can actually learn something from it, despite the inconsistencies visible in the plot if one looks away from it as separate, isolated scenes or cases and sees it whole.

And there are many inconsistencies.
Dazzling is unredeemably slow. I thought it was about to pick up after episode three, but it didn’t. And this happens with a lot with many things in the drama. When a character is about to make sense, something happens that changes them and it’s as if we didn’t know them at all. When it looks like the plot is going to progress at last… the turning point never comes. The episodes throw one bait after another to make you look forward to a scene, or tell you “this will solve it!” and it never comes, it doesn’t work out like that. “Bad guys” get away as they please and do what they want, the good characters are certain comic relief at times but often don’t do more than that.
Neither the changes of pace nor the connection between one event and the next are well done in the slightest, and it really hurt my patience to find out things such as a couple of episodes being spent on a “lost” dog to then find out that after that dramatic problem was “solved”, the dog was just never brought up again.

Examples like these are later pushed aside due to more important events, but it makes the episode-by-episode watching frustrating nonetheless.


Summarising over the categories, in “Story” it’d be helpful to be able to differentiate between premise and execution, because in a case such as this one I’d definitely use that. The soundtrack doesn’t stand out at all, and on the other hand the acting is great and for many characters it gets better and better as it goes on (Han Ji Min’s which I mentioned above, for instance). And I’d never think of re-watching this drama.


Overall, this drama is strange. The premise isn’t the reason as much as the uneven, tremendously hole-filled plot of inconsistent tone, content and pace. It’s especially weird because most characters do earn a place for themselves and are sensitively defined even among all those fragrant issues.

I would decidedly not “recommend” The Light in Your Eyes because it’s actually really hard to watch. It takes constant patience, it’s tremendously boring every few scenes (it brings your interest back up in-between so that you still watch) and often I couldn’t convince myself that I wasn’t just plainly wasting my time, and there’s something that will test even the most tolerant viewers. (Something which I’m leaving out entirely in this review and that would change the context of some things I’ve written entirely.)

However there is good in this story as well, some of it rare and a lot of details very worth-watching. And depending on how you take the plot-choices, watching it whole might actually make you love it more, rather than less.

This is my first time writing a review for a kdrama! I personally started watching this drama as I am big fan of Han Ji min not for her looks but for her acting. As the story , as it progressed it was filled with joy and then slowly transcended to a sorrow and sad story! The meaning behind this drama is ethically beautiful. The plot is heart wrenching and heartwarming all at the same time but it simply touches the soul.

The last few episodes deliver the crucial blow - that's when this rom-com drama turns into a slice of life drama! It tries to deliver an important message - live every moment, enjoy every seconds of life no matter how mundane it may seem as the most precious thing to you as you would age would be the memories you preserve. This is exactly the message being conveyed by the main female lead hya ja as she tries of imagine a better life which is in stark contrast to the reality she is living in. Even though she suffers from Alzheimer's, she would never let go of her precious moments with her husband.

The very ending delivers the most crucial message! It might have been the moment of death for Hye Ja but seeing them ""reunite"" on the beach with the sun setting while hugging was away of interpreting they both lived a tough life but in the end they found their way back to each other and everything turned out okay. The quote is what really set the tone at the end, it was said and written beautifully.

A beautiful story with excellent cast and direction is what makes this drama unique and inspiring.

I dropped it but picked it back up and finished
I don't know if I would have disliked this drama if I had binged it all the way through. I got through the first 8 episodes months ago, and then paused and didn't think I would finish. I don't know what made me decide to go ahead and finish it up.
This is a very slow story and has a twist to it that wasn't wholly unexpected but not completely how I though it would play out either. I don't want to give it away, but this show ended up being pretty raw and ended up making me cry in the end. I don't think it's for everyone, so I can't say that I'd recommend it for everyone. I feel like some people will hate it, and some people may appreciate it for personal reasons like I did.

Kim Hye Ja is a great actress and really carried this drama. Nam Joo Hyuk seems sort of awkward, and for Han Ji Min, I don't think she got enough of the spotlight but did a good job with her role.

You’d actually think it’s your typical light hearted rom com with a slight dark background, but it ends up driving you to an unexpected destination, leaving you feeling blessed and grateful about life...

First, the writers were brilliant. This story was well thought of and planned, you can conclude that every story in the series was carefully considered. They successfully conveyed the hardships of time passing by, people leaving, and our tendency to take each other for granted. Wow.

Second, the actors were too brilliant. I never really appreciated the “background” characters... but here, they turn out becoming the main stories in the end. It’s such a joy to reach the end and see everything make sense. (again, writing was... wow)

Third, it’s my first time seeing a drama dedicated to our beloved grandmas and grandpas. I’ve always had a soft spot for old people, and this one just spoke to that side of me too well.

Fourth, just the fact that you thought it was about this story but it ended up becoming about another, all along... it literally made me gasp, confused for a split second, then gasp again at the realization of how beautiful this series was to actually focus on family and life. It’s really not just a love story.

I’m really in awe.

this has been one of the most amazing dramas i have ever seen. so different from the ones airing right now, with a story that grips you, takes you along a journey and teaches you so much in the short span. the end became unbearable for me as the drama condensed into its few last scenes. the sheer beauty of it left me speechless. the script, the themes of family, love, hardships were so beautifully portrayed in the small span of the show itself and nothing felt incomplete, no loose ends. absolutely beautiful. it may not appeal to all audiences but i believe it deserves a watch from everybody. stunning and amazing.

This show has the biggest plot twist I've ever seen. The slap of cruel reality hit me so hard that after watching the show I'm completely speechless. The feeling I got from the show can't be described. The story was so cruel yet real, I couldn't accept it at all. I was hoping the pain to be less but I was wrong. I cried so much at the last 2 eps. The leads were the unluckiest characters I've seen. The show was dazzling along with amazing cast & story. I realized the feelings of old people & how beautiful today is at a great extent. Life is nothing but a mere dream but even an ordinary day like today can bear the happiest moment of our life without our realization. Don't think about the past or tomorrow just live today because today won't come back again. A must watch show to understand life.

I can't even imagine if there is any other content like this!!!
Never I saw a drama like this. From beginning till the end, I was in awe of the characters, story, writing, music and the cold and chilly sadness of this creation.

There was no science fiction, there was no time travel, it was no fantasy. It was a story of a women trying to figure out her life, after such oppression of time.

She grew-up poor, loved by family, fell in love with the most loneliest person. Their life was short lived but she was so in love, that after he was taken away...her love turned to stone. She couldn't love anyone, not even herself, she suppressed her emotions and wanting to forget her pain, she did the worst possible thing - turning her back toward their son, the only thing she could have really loved. She froze in time, broken all the way inside, not knowing the light she needed was always there, but perhaps there was too much darkness notice that. Now old, and suffering from the incurable illness, she try to relived her life, as could have happened, if he wasn't taken away. She was finally able to save her love this time, going back and forth in her memory to help him live. In last hours of her life, she was able to convey her love, she hid from his for 50 years. Even after such sadness and unhappiness, she was content, she choose the happy moments she had in life. In her final moments, she crosses that bridge of ""light"" and succumbs to her love in the end, and they both embraced each other for eternity.

Acting: Kim Hye ja is an acting godess of Korean cinema so no comments on her further. But this young actor Nam, made me fall in love with his acting this time for this drama, he had for his age, toughest scenes, and he nailed every scene of his, and as always Han Ji-Min did what she does best. Hats off to this drama.

"" Others might not think much of me, but for me, i mean a lot to myself.""

I am so in love with this show! It takes those subtle, little, tiny moments, and emotions of one's life, the struggles, trivial or otherwise, and makes you see them, really see them, and appreciate their place in your life.

Show teaches you not to take anything in life for granted, and be aware and thankful for what you have. :)

The storytelling is top-notch.. and so was the acting.

There were times when i considered dropping this due to:
1. It got really really depressing in the middle.. felt like the story was just dragging on without leading anywhere
2. Acting by Hye-Ja's parents and Nam Joo Hyuk.. compared to the old Hye Ja, it felt like they were not upto the mark.. felt lackluster..
3. I felt they would get no real romance..

BUT... as i finished the drama i realised I WAS SO WRONG!!! There was a reason the above (1,2) was portrayed as such. You'll know when you finish exactly what I'm trying to say.
As for #3, there wasn't a whole lot of screentime for it, but we do get to see the romance ;)

And that plot twist.. it was placed and executed PERFECTLY. :)

(This is my first review ever. I tried to express how much i liked this drama without spoiling anything. If there's an edit option available, I'll use it in future to better what I've written later on)

This drama shows a very interesting topic that i have never seen before. I was so touched with He ja's story and totally believed it even though it wasn't realistic enough but i just empathized with her deeply. Also the plot at the end explained everything for me as a viewer so it was comforting. What made me LOVE this drama is that it is super realistic and it really shows a whole different and hidden side of old people. It gave me a whole new perspective on how to see and treat them. I actually learned a lot from this drama which makes it the BEST because beside being a very interesting drama it is very informative for a lot of people who've always had misconseptions about growing old. I highly recommend watching this drama, i promise you won't regret it.

""your eyes. they shine so bright. i want to save their light.""
I don't know what I liked or disliked about this drama. All I know is that I cried a lot, especially in the last episodes. This drama made me question a lot of things and this drama also made me realize a lot of things.

No one wants their loved ones to die and no one is ready to see their loved ones' death. And I realized that soon after watching this drama because something similar happened to me. It made me realize that we, humans, are nothing without feelings and I am one of those of human.

Maybe, this drama is not that deep and I am being biased. But if you watch this, then I believe you will relate to a lot of these things. Honestly, that is what I like about 《The Light In Your Eyes》. It shows the most usual human emotions with a dramatic effect. At times, the dramatic effect can get a bit too much and make the drama seem rather ridiculous. But the emotions picks it up and you will be ""in-touch"" with the drama no matter how weirdly dramatic it seems.

The qoute I wrote as the headline is not from the drama, but I think it pretty much sums up all the female lead's feelings for her loved ones and the male lead (he is also her loved one) and most of her goals in the drama. She wants to save everyone she loves and she wants to live with them like she did before. She wishes to see the light in their eyes for a long, long time.

The female lead, in the first few episodes, might seem insecure, jealous and somewhat selfish. But as the story progresses, you will end up liking her and will find her somewhat relatable.

The male lead doesn't do much, but his presence is sad and bittersweet and his interactions with the female lead, both as young and old, are sweet, motivating and hilarious.

The romance between the female lead and the male lead is not like the other melo- romance dramas as there aren't many intimate scenes. But they became one of my favourite couple.

The family members of Hye-ja are another focus of the drama. And their interactions keeps the story going not making it boring, but rather hilarious and sad. They care for eachother, love eachother, and they gives the most comedic relief in the drama.

All the actors are known faces for me and no one disappointed me. Lee Joon-ha became my favourite Nam Joo-hyuk character and I don't think any other character can replace him. This was my second Han Ji-min drama and this made me fall in love with her acting. Her acting is so natural and she can potray any emotions just perfectly.

The music was somewhat unique because it had a classical mood in it which I don't usually see in such dramas.

I think re-watching 《The Light In Your Eyes》 would make it seem boring as the storyline would be known to you. But I feel since the drama itself mostly focuses on emotions and human growth, it will be a decent drama to re-watch.

""even if one ordinary day is followed by another ordinary day, life is still worth living. don't waste the present regretting and worrying about the future. live this day beautifully""

《The Light In Your Eyes》 wishes to follow the same goal as the quote which is from the drama. And it does a great job creating the right mood for a scene and the right emotions are provided in that scene.

When you watch the first couple of episodes of The Light in Your Eyes it seems like it is a fantasy, sci-fi, time travel, romantic comedy drama but as you continue watch it you find out that it is not. The Light in Your Eyes is a Korean drama about family bonds, friendship, love and life. The ending was very emotional and it brought tears to my eyes. The story was cleverly written like a puzzle that you had piece together to get the whole picture. The cast was great, and the soundtrack fit the drama well. I would recommend this drama even though it made me cry.

i expect some melo romance, slice of life kind of drama, but then it turns out to be centred around struggle of an old lady. it was okay and heartfelt but it was so slowwwwww. freakin slow. i had to really push myself to watch till the end since other reviews kept saying about plot twist. then, almost at the end of the drama, when the plot twist I wasn't like super shocked. more like I was conned :( like i wasted my time watching 10 episodes. and it was still slow. well, i cried a lot during the last episode, but, hmm. imo, this drama is better off as a movie. anyways, the acting were good and the message was beautiful :)

I've never cried so much while watching a drama. I was watching this drama and never thought that it would end in the way that it did and it really messed me up. I thought the worst was during the drama but the last episode had me sobbing. It honestly gave me chills and had me feeling empty when it was over. The cast's acting was immaculate; from the comic scenes to the sob-worthy scenes, from the main characters to the sub characters, they had me feeling every emotion. This is NOT for the weak hearted and this is coming from someone that rarely sobs during a drama.

live your life radiantly.
yes. i would give 10 again even if this drama had lots of mistakes. was there any hole in the storyline? i don't know. maybe. but i was so immersed that i couldn't see the bad parts. perhaps that was no bad parts, it depends of the eye (and heart) of everyone. mine was totally feeling the drama. since i was a kid, i've always feared time. the terrifying and precious time. so the sinopsis really attracted me. a 25 year old girl used a clock (kind of a time machine) so many times that all her youth was taken away. could you imagine saying goodbye to 50 years of your life? could you imagine not being able to grow up like everyone else? not enjoying the time you have? well, this drama taught me that we don't have time, but time has us. and it's okay. youth is as beautiful as old age.

when you become an eldery, you're still alive and have all the right to enjoy everything, everyday. ""an ordinary day passes, and another ordinary day comes. but life is still worth living... please, love today radiantly. you have that right."" i'm gonna take this quote to my life, it touched me deep deep deep down.

this drama has my heart. yes. i would give 10 again. was there any hole in the storyline? i don't know. maybe. but getting to understand life as an eldery, to see why youth is so refreshing and old age is beautiful and, most importantly, face time, was one of the best gift i've ever recieved.

p.s.: i loved the plot twist.

WATCH THIS LIFE LESSON, ""The Light in Your Eyes"".

There is no light in those eyes...
The Light in your Eyes is the most depressing drama I’ve watched. It is depressing because the heartwarming scenes were always followed by heart wrenching ones. Every episode was designed to make me cry. This was an emotional roller-coaster I would have preferred not to be on.

The drama is about the life of an unfortunate woman and the way she deals with ageing. The acting gets better as the story progresses but I just couldn’t get over the number of unfortunate incidents that a single family suffers through. I felt everything was a bit too over the top.

The plot in the last three episodes confused and irritated me. The plot twist was superfluous and made the previous episodes an unnecessary drag. While 12 episodes is short I felt they should have condensed it further to 8 and I would have probably appreciated the story more. This was a struggle to finish because I am not a fan of crying all the time.

I decided to watch this drama because people have been raving about it but I just couldn't get myself to like it. Overall this is a tearjerker and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone for an easy watch cause it’s anything but easy. Unless you want to be depressed and bawl in every episode, this drama is not for you.

Unexpectedly great
I only watched this show because I happened to spot Nam Joo Hyuk in it. I had no idea what to expect, but from the description I thought it would be a comedy like the movie Big. This show certainly did have funny moments, funny enough to make me laugh out loud. However, this show is definitely an intensely emotional rollercoaster and not a comedy.

The acting was amazing. Nam Joo Hyuk especially stood out to me because while I enjoyed him in the Bride of Habaek, he was completely different here, and I was unfamiliar with the other actors. This show goes to pretty dark places emotionally, and really takes viewers on a journey that will change their mindset.

To me this doesn’t feel like a normal show. It feels like a long film that should be nominated for an Oscar or something. I’m not saying it’s flawless, but I’m not the type to dissect every little imperfection. The ending of this show will be hated by some, but I think it’s very fitting. I can’t remember the last time a show made me tear up so much, or haunted me for so long after watching it. This show is an experience that will stay with the viewers for a long time.

Make sure you are in the right mood

Spoilers ahead.

I feel conflicted about this series. It was recommended to me after 18 again, bizarrely. I think this was due to the fantasy element. On this vein, I was enjoying it as fantasy drama, including and up to when the FML accidentally ages herself. From here in started to go downhill for me. The plot appeared to drag and the FML spent most of her time moping around. Even Nam Joo-hyuk's visuals couldn't keep me engaged. The emotional scenes were well acted but the story felt very dreary.

Part of this I will blame on myself. Normally I like to watch k-dramas because they are positive, whimsical and romantic. Occasionally though, a series like Youth of May will demonstrate that k-dramas don't have to be tropey or fluffy. Unfortunately I don't feel like this series got the balance right. The romance didn't feel fleshed out enough and I struggled to route for the characters.

By the time the big reveal came I was already pretty exhausted with this series. The promise of a big twist kept me going but for me it just seemed to add more dreariness to an already dreary drama. I will guiltily confess that I was enjoying the fantasy escape from the care home.

I don't want to sound too harsh though. I think prior to watching this series it's important to manage your expectations. It's not a particularly happy or thrilling watch. It does however deal with a timely issue that many will face. The acting is solid, particularly from Nam Joo-hyuk and Kim Hye-ja. It's also unlike any other kdramas I've watched.

I started watching this drama because the time travel plot caught my eye. I went into this drama expecting a light-hearted romance with some comedy thrown in. What I didn't expect was a heart-wrenching mystery. This is one of those dramas that you start watching not expecting too much but you end up watching possibly one of the best dramas of the season.

The plot is what attracted me to this drama. I love a good time travel story. I actually rarely read reviews before watching a drama unless the rating is mediocre because I am afraid I will accidentally come across some spoilers. So, I went into this drama without knowing much aside from the plot summary. I'm glad I didn't read anything on it beforehand as it would have ruined the story for me. Just know that this is the kind of story that will make your heart hurt and wonder what you would change if you could time travel. This drama is now one of my favourites and I would recommend it to everyone. If you love watching dramas where you will root for the characters and bawl your eyes out, then this is the drama for you.

One of the key plot points of The Light in Your Eyes is the stigma against elderly people and the loss of youth. This can be seen when Kim Hye Ja wakes up as an old woman and doesn't know how to change back. You are able to empathise with her and her family as they struggle with living with a daughter who could pass for her own grandmother. In this drama, you can also see the struggle that both Kim Hye Ja and the other elderly people have with the loss of their youth. I don't really want to give much away but this drama gives the audience an insight into how older people live their lives and the things that they have to give up. It is a very jarring realisation and helps you to appreciate the older people in your own life.

Aside from the plot, the other thing that made me initially watch this drama was Nam Joo Hyuk (Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo, The Bride of Habaek). I have seen some of his other dramas and I love watching a drama where I recognise at least one of the actors. I believe that The Light In Your Eyes was perfectly cast. Nam Joo Hyuk did an excellent job of portraying someone who is just coasting by in life and not actually enjoying it. Han Ji Min (Rooftop Prince; Hyde, Jekyll, Me) and Kim Hye Ja (Dear My Friends) both did a great job of portraying the light-hearted and sorrowful aspects of Kim Hye Ja's personality. For once, I don't think there was any character that I didn't like. Although some characters did not have the most loving personalities, it was easy to understand their pain and why they were that way.

The music is very mellow and calming. It suits the whole different era aspect of this drama. The music alongside the actors' performances, helps with the emotional aspect of this drama. As you progress through the episodes, you will actually find yourself tearing up when a specific song is played.

I would rewatch this drama again but since has a puzzle-like theme, I would wait a bit until watching it again. Aside from that, I would highly recommend watching The Light in Your Eyes.

The light in your eyes- a game changer!
I love Nam Joo- hyuk and therefore wanted to give ""The light in your eyes"" a chance. I was not disappointed: the plot amazed me, the cast was brilliant, and I was rarely bored. The drama gave me a realistic representation of the life of the older generation. I learned to appreciate being able to walk up the stairs without having to sit down the rest of the day because of exhaustion. I learned that I should enjoy every single beautiful moment in life- you never know when it´s gonna turn. I learned to love every single character in the drama- I cried with them, I laughed with them, I was happy for them etc. Seriously if you want to watch something else- something far away from the stereotype- then ""The light in your eyes"" is for you! I never regretted watching it.

I like a good plot twist, but...
I like a good plot twist, but I felt like 'The Light in your Eyes' didn't need one, thus I felt wanting more than what I received. However, with that being said, the story was still enjoyable, especially in the first eight or nine episodes. My favourite thing about this drama were the stellar performances by the cast, alongside a sweet and subtle OST that I will most likely listen to for a while. The re-watch value is low only from the fact that I felt the last two or three episodes drag like hell - the overall rating would've been higher also.

The plot twist wasn't terrible, don't get me wrong. I just would have preferred something different. Han Ji Min is now one of my favourite actresses and I was surprised that I enjoyed Nam Joo Hyuk in this role!

In Which Time Traveling gets Fairly Angsty about the Passage of Time
""The Light In Your Eyes"" is a fairly deceptive take on a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease that fits pretty well into the how the disease robs people of their memories and sense of self by exploring the idea of an imagined life. Before that, the series masquerades a time travel rom-com about an aspiring announcer who uses a watch that can manipulate time, but accelerates her aging as a price.

While not comparable to the likes of Sarah Polley's ""Away From Her"", the show - toward the end - does get pretty heavy once it reveals it hand and deals with the subject on more than a passing level. If the aim was always to tell a story about aging and how the elderly are treated by their community (on a whole), then hiding it behind a fluffy rom-com was certainly one way to see it through.

However, it gets to a point where that I think the constant barrage of melodrama honestly detracts from the message, and borders on comical (unintentionally) at times.

There aren't a lot of dramas I'd recommend, but if I had to choose a show for someone to watch, I'd choose this one (on the pretense that I'd spoil the twist, because I think knowing beforehand will simply make the story better).

Now if y'all excuse me, I'm gonna watch a salary man fight zombies. I'm sure that won't break my heart.

Story:
It may start off as any other drama, but as it goes on the story gets deeper and just develops so well. It can feel/be slow at times, but I think that adds to the story. For those who may get bored but want to finish the show because of friends' suggestion, watch up to ep 10. That gives you the full experience and story of the series with a great ending. The two episodes that follow are just nice packaging of the drama and closes the drama in a nice way.

Acting/Cast:
Everyone did such a great job acting especially Kim Hyeja, she killed this role, I will definitely check out her other works.

Music/OST:
I don't remember the soundtrack, but I had to have been amazing because this drama was and forever be amazing

Overall:
watch this show!!

I just finished watching this last night (binged it actually). It was possibly the best watch ff the year 2019 Q2. My only problem with this is that the synopsis was very misleading and the drama definitely ruined whatever expectations I had going into it.
My expectations were to watch something light hearted because life was going to be really stressful for a period of time and I wanted something to cheer me through it. I was not expecting to be brutally sucker punched in my face by reality (especially with the topic that came about in the last two episodes. It brought back many sad feelings and memories). I wished there was a tragedy tag because the drama is something I wouldn’t recommend watching if you watch to escape reality like I did.
Putting aside the sucker punch plot twist into reality, the story was very true to itself. You can see a lot of thought and deliberation went into the episodes before the plot twist that made so much sense after the twist. But it wasn’t without any clues that we arrived at the plot twist either, perhaps having the notion that this was a fantasy drama that helped excuse those inexplainable moments which made the plot twist heart breakingly cruel.
The cinematography was superb. The way the lights and the angles shot of from. Even the acting was amazing, no surprises there. The actresses playing Kim Hye Ja absolutely mind blowingly excellent in their portrayal that I was tear eyed a lot through out. Not only that but the actors who played Hye Ja’s parents were extremely good at portraying their emotions silently, it was both heart wrenching and heart warming feeling their emotions through a screen.
Overall I give a nine. Why the minus one star? For conning me with a misleading synopsis that brought back a lot of things I’d rather not remember or think about.

When I started watching this kdrama I wasn't really expecting what I was getting into. I will not give any spoilers but I will say you will laugh, cry, and really become deep in thought while watching this kdrama. It's eye opening, and it gives you more appreciation and understanding towards people especially the elderly. I think this kdrama is a lot different than most, it's sentimental and meaningful. I would definitely recommend this drama for people who can handle some tears. It definitely has a well written plot with twists in there. A must watch!

I really liked this drama. All the actors did such a great job especially Kim Hae Ja absolutely nailed the role of the main protagonist which definitely wasn't easy because her character went through so much. There were so many different emotions she portrayed them all so well. Truly appreciate the creators and the cast for making something like this. The plot was really interesting and it was definitely a good dose of melodrama with a good script. And the ending was just perfect. Definitely worth checking out.

Beautiful Heartbreaking Story.!
This is a story about humanity, its sorrowful and impactful.It makes me introspect my own life while thinking deeply about the meaning of aging.!!

Nam Joo Hyuk (as Lee Joon Ha) is the reason why I started watching this drama. My one and only favorite K-actor. Haha❣️ His acting in this drama made me think how much he grew as an actor. He's good in this drama. He did it so beautifully and tastefully that my heart broke with his..:'(

The drama started as a fantasy, love, comedy and a bit weird but ended with a fascinating and heartwarming realistic story :'( Watching those grandpas and grandmas struggles and how people take advantage of them were heartbreaking :'( The writer cleverly hid the real plot and shocked us with a beautiful heartbreaking big twist that I'm sure no one expected it..!!

If you're looking for a adorable romantic drama, then this isn't for you^_^ There is no charming prince in this drama.! There are no rich big families fighting for a company, there are no typical Kdrama scenes, it really differs from the majority of Kdramas I've seen❤️

If you're looking for a short drama with life lessons, then this can be the perfect drama to watch on your spare time. Trust me, it's that good^o^

I'm still in the process of trying to accept the fact that I'm already done watching 'The Light In Your Eyes' :'( It truly touched my heart and I will remember it for a long time?

A very heartwarming slow-paced drama.
One of the best melodrama! The story is very precious itself because it talks about a certain life of a person and how it deals to be a person living with both happy and sorrowful moments beautifully. A very slow-paced melodrama with a bit comedy and romance throughout the series, the plot is very relatable and interesting to fulfill. The whole cast did an exceptional job especially the main leads which are Kim Hye Ja's both the 75 year and 25 year old and also Lee Joon Ha and Kim Yeong Soo. Although the OST's are not memorable but it has its way to capture peoples hearts and soul. KUDOS TO ""THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES"" TEAM.

I fast-forwarded through most of the drama, but even I have to admit it was beautiful..
Those who expect a romance or a romcom will be sorely disappointed - but you will be rewarded with a powerful social message and beautifully written characters and storyline. It makes you cry A LOT, but the slow pace of life shown reflects the actual message from the series - life is quite mundane and ordinary most days, but we must find the beauty and meaning from it where we can.

I didn't know what to expect so I found the early episodes quite slow and boring. But after Episode 8, I started appreciating the message the writers were sending us - that when we are young, we refuse to accept we will get old and we take things for granted.

Overall, I would recommend the drama, but only if you are ready and willing to go through some powerful emotions and accept the slow pace of unfolding. Yes, and do watch out for that famous plot twist!

This show is so different from normal dramas, it focuses on topics never seen before on small screen, in the most perfect way. You can never guess what is going to happen next while watching especially last 3 episode left me so shocked and made me cry so many times. Its really a heart warming story with top class actors.
It talks about the older generation of people, the"" neglected"" generation. This show has so many light moments but the heavy side of it really REALLY hits you. It talks about relationships between family,friends and people in general with special attention given to the older generation. It also touches on korea in 1970s.
What is so amazing about this show is that it perfectly disguises itself as a rom-com, with fantasy aspects but completely turns around and makes you view all the episodes differently.
I have to give special mention to nam joo hyuk who did a splendid job in portraying his character. Almost all the actors were really amazing to watch!
The only issue i have with this drama is that it is extremely confusing, like i needed a whole year to comeback and finish this drama, just the last 2 episodes. I think this maybe because it was nothing i have ever seen before, the unfamiliarity made me stop watching it. But after completing it i felt really warm and appriciated it more!
a story not for everyone, only the once who are looking for something heartwarming and are willing to spend time and watch patiently how this drama unfolds :)

I've come out of review semi-retirement just to write this, such is the intensity of my feelings toward this show. I could waste your time (like this drama wasted mine) going on and on about how worthless, hateful, and often dull this show is, but I'll instead attempt to be brief:

Please do not watch this drama.

Watching ""The Light in Your Eyes"" is like settling down in front of a campfire, ready for the storyteller to begin his story, but instead, he starts spitting in your face and laughing at you while shouting ""That's life, SUCKER!!"" That's not storytelling, that's assault. And that's what you're basically signing up for by watching this drama.

You'll spend hours and hours watching characters be miserable, slowly start to grow and learn lessons, only for the writers to throw in a twist at the 11th hour that renders meaningless every single episode that came before. This drama takes great pains to establish rules, characters, and moments for you to become invested in, and then completely throws all of them away, amounting to nothing but wasted hours of your life. The sudden shift in the drama's direction is so jarring that I wouldn't be surprised if the writing team was completely changed halfway through. A perfect example of what I'm talking about: they literally change the main character of the show in the last episode. The first male lead actually disappears; no resolution, no ending, no future. He finishes the show as an unimportant side character who we barely know. Important plot elements set up at the beginning are, by the end, either 1) completely ignored and given no resolution/explanation, or 2) handwaved away with the laziest and most trite writing cliches in existence. It's so bad that I can't read the MDL synopsis of this show without feeling like it's nothing but a collection of lies.

I'm baffled that anything this inexcusably poor, this aggressively disrespectful to its audience, could ever make it to the airwaves. What's worse is that there are aspects of the production that are high quality. 77-year-old actress Kim Hye Ja is amazing, bringing energy and believability to her role, despite her age and the demands of a full drama shooting schedule. Kim Ga Eun portrayed a character who was rather like an island in the storm for me in this terrible drama, as almost every scene with her was great, even though most of them were completely pointless, just like every other scene in this show. Episodes 10 and 12 were fairly well done, and Ahn Nae Sang absolutely hit it out of the park in 12.
Other than those things, positive aspects to this show are very few and far between.

So again, I beg you: please, please do not watch this drama. Show yourself a little love, put it on ""Not Interested"", and never think about it again.

this is my FIRST TIME WRITING a review

The thing about this drama that, at first it attracts a particular type of viewers (anyone who enjoys romantic, happy and funny stories) i definitely thought that its gonna be a romantic / sad and inspirational drama with a bit of science-fiction on it. but almost everything changes after the first episodes, and it becomes really sad and tragic in my opinion.
i had hope that things will be fixed within the episodes ( mostly between the two main actors that i personally want them to be together so bad LOL ) ...

The story is interesting nothing to brag about. The storyline brought to the screen the awareness of Alzheimer's. This debilitating disease can burden families and some families put their parents in a nursing home never seeing them again. They figure if they don't remember them why bother with them. Some families feel their parents died when Alzheimer's began. I didn't rate this a higher rate because it confused the heck out of me in the first 5 episodes but than I caught on. I love Han Ji Min and Nam Joo Hyuk, which they were awesome. This is a sad story and I hope one day there will be Alzheimer's cure.

The Light In Your Eyes is a drama that fed us all the expectations that would make us excited, and completely twisted us on our heels and left us feeling something we didn't expect to feel after watching it. It's fresh, emotional, and absolutely made me ugly cry at all the different hours of the day.

STORY:
At first, I would've thought the plot was something very The Girl Who Leapt Through Time-esque. I came excited for the romance, but then found myself invested in the poetry hidden within the story; although the progression was always slow in the story, and I couldn't comprehend why she immediately accepted her fate at first without even trying to find other ways to return to her original state, I found myself reflecting on human life and how this drama has made me want to respect elders more than any school play or kids show I have ever seen.

The infamous plot twist was something that took me completely aback at first, in a partial negative manner. This was probably because I felt as if I wasted all my emotional investment on the characters from the original story the drama was following, only to find out the truth of it all after the twist that seemed to make no sense. However, it avoided dropping the bomb and leaving it there for us to gawk at it, and presented itself in a way that made slightly more sense.

The story overall is well thought out, and knew exactly how to leave an audience in tears. The final monologue in the last episode is something I absolutely needed the day I watched it, and it made me appreciate being alive and young in the slightest.

ACTING/CAST:
I would be lying if I said I didn't decide to watch this drama because of Nam Joo Hyuk, because I feel like most of us did. And who knew he looked great with a mullet.
Thee entire cast gave an exceptional performance, especially the elder actors who made me feel their struggles and pain through the screen although I couldn't exactly relate to them. Because of this drama as well, I now know that the beautiful Han Jimin (and Kim Hye Ja) exists, and will be looking out for them in future dramas.
Everyone's acting touched me greatly. The contrast between Yeong Soo and Min-Su was so great, and the way the actor made them appear so different successfully made me laugh.

MUSIC:
It didn't have the same repetitive Kpop song playing whenever a touching moment happened, which I appreciate. I loved Song Sang Eun's voice and loved whenever she sang, even the older version of her. The music perfectly fit the aesthetic of each scene and the entire drama as well, and although this may be biased, played the exact type of music I listen to and love.

REWATCH VALUE;
I feel that the emotional and poetic value of the drama may be ruined for me if I rewatch it, knowing what's going to happen. It's like I'll be watching it hoping it ends differently, or the way I originally expected it to be. Perhaps I might watch certain scenes again, but not really the whole drama.

OVERALL:
A beautiful, bittersweet ode to life and all its wonders in the little things. This is one of the first dramas that made me full on Japanese-romance-film-ending cry, both happily and sadly. Life isn't as long as I thought it would be, and this drama teaches you to hold on to the small moments that may hold so much meaning to you in the grand scheme of things. The romance was in just the right level, and the overall drama felt very heartfelt and genuine, with gentle comedy to soften the blow, and a message that'll keep you smiling for quite a while.

The light in your eyes is an odd, surprising drama. It is not what is seemed to be. The story started as a comedy, then it turned into a fantasy drama, and, eventually, it all made sense. The dramatic, melodrama element was really good and the family dynamics touching and strong. The comedy element, however, could have been a bit less, as the story was very dark and sometimes it didn't blend well with it. I also enjoyed the slice of life concept. But the highlight of the drama was the performances that were really good by everyone in the cast, though the younger version of the leading lady kind of didn't match with her older version. Finally, the twist in the ending was probably one of the best twists I've ever watched. So, 8 out of 10.

A picture is worth a thousand words, and they fully expressed that as profoundly as possible. This is my ultimate, most favourite Kdrama of all time. It might not suit everyone's tastes, but it was the first time I cried because a drama ENDED. Finally a drama that is beautiful and breathtaking from start to end.

I guess if you're the type to prefer fluffy, lovey dovey, Kdrama cliche type of dramas, then this won't be for you. My Mister is completely different in terms of the ""Kdrama formula.""

After watching each episode, it's fulfilling, yet you are (extremely) hungry for more. This drama gave me the biggest comfort whenever I feel down. Ironically, the drama itself, is depressing, gloomy, and melancholy. You know how whenever you feel sad you want to see things like rainbows, and puppies, or eat good food in order to make you feel happier, yet none of that truly comforts you; or sometimes it might even irritate someone even more. My Mister is that person that would sit by your side, cry with you, hug you, and allow you to release your emotions so you truly feel comfort. It's not a stress reliever, it's something that makes you embrace those emotions and let you move on from them.

I've never seen a drama that portrays depression as realistically as My Mister, heck, I've never seen a drama that actually has depressed leads. Between each and every character, there is a special bond that is strong and meaningful. The relationship between PDH and LJA is not family love, nor romance, nor friendship. It's a different form of love that it's hard to wrap the head around, but the best way to describe it is human love. Human emotions, comfort, and acceptance. Personally, my favorite parts are the interactions between Lee Ji An and her grandmother. I cry in every single scene because it's so beautiful.
Honestly, during the painful scenes, you cry. The touching scenes, you cry. The silent scenes, you cry. And the happy ones, you cry. Maybe I'm just overly sensitive when I'm watching this drama... It's painful but heartwarming.

I think many people who don't like this drama probably thinks: the brothers are annoying or the drama is too slow. You can't really fully immerse into the drama unless you learn to appreciate the brothers, and what they symbolize. Although it feels slow paced in the beginning, trust me, 1 hour 20 minutes feel like 30 minutes.

The cinematography is stunning. Just like how many people said, it's like you are watching a movie within each episode. It's stunning in a way that is effective to convey the story and mood, and the beauty of each character. There is not one character I dislike, not even the bad ones, because they are all so compelling.

Edit:
For anyone who aren't feeling up to expectations, a little disclaimer. Don't dive into the drama expecting to be blown away or be on the edge of your seats the entire time. I watched it week by week, so the drama itself felt like it was very well paced. If you try to binge watch the beginning episodes, it might feel very very slow, eventually losing interest. But the best way to experience the high expectations, is for sure you really need to immerse yourself in small details, and focus on every single aspect in each scene. Sometimes it might even get a bit mentally intensive. As for me, watching it week by week allowed some breaks in between before fully going into analyzing mode. It's kind of like you have to critically analyze every detail in order for the viewer to meet its expectations. If all else fails, then it might just not be your taste and that's all okay :)

Edit Oct 2021:
I think what kept me coming back to stalking this drama is because somehow they were able to make the most depressing and mundane of things feel exciting and alive again. It's something that not many shows I've seen can do, which is why this show still has a special place in my heart.

(Slightly) EDITED:
“A story about three brothers in their 40s and a girl in her 20s facing the hardships of life and helping each other through the process.” The initial description of “My Ahjussi” was something along these lines, and as far as the storyline goes, that is enough to tell you the essence of it. A look at the daily lives of three middle aged men and a young girl. How interesting could it be? What could possibly be happening in their lives that makes it engaging enough to have a whole show about them? Is it something extraordinary? Definitely not. Is it something you have never seen before? Not really. But, is it worth watching? Oh god yes.

This show has fascinated me more than any other K-drama so far. If you ask me why, I probably won’t be able to tell you a specific reason. After all, what is so fascinating about going to work, walking your co-worker home, and drinking in a bar with your friends? What is so fascinating about 2 brothers running a cleaning service together? I don’t know. But after you see this show you will see that it most definitely is. “My Ahjussi” got me hooked since the first episode. I found myself waiting for the new episodes each week just to see three brothers suffer at work during the days and drink away their nights. There is no one particular thing that is special in this show, but all the elements of it put together make an extraordinary masterpiece. The actors, the characters, the music, the atmosphere, everything fits so perfectly. The story is not abrupt, it doesn’t have many dramatic moments, yet it can go from heart-breaking to heart-warming in an instant. It is not this fast paced show that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to end, but it is rather this soft field filled with snow that you will find yourself falling in more and more with each episode. And after it ended, of all the things that can be said about “My Ahjussi”, all I could really mumble was….WOW. You know a show has been exceptional when it makes you feel so satisfied that you watched something so beautiful, yet leaves you with a void in your heart, because it is over and you won’t get to see any more of it.

If I would say all the things I have to say for this drama, this review would be really, really long, so I will just try to touch upon everything I didn’t get to mention. First of all, the three brothers. I really can’t tell which one of them did a better job, they were all phenomenal. Each of them with a different, yet still similar path in life, each of them facing their own problems, yet managing to get through them just because they are together. You could see the pain in their eyes through each and every scene, even in the scenes when they were laughing. This is especially true for the oldest brother, it seemed as if he could break down in tears in any moment. Just by looking into their eyes you could almost feel the burdens they are carrying. And Lee Sun-Kyun…well…I really can’t see anybody else portraying the “Ahjussi” role. He was born for this drama. Everything he did was just so perfect. A friend worth keeping, a son that makes you proud, a brother that is always by your side, and a husband….yeah, I’m not quite sure how to put that last one. Nevertheless, all three of them managed to play their parts so well that you just see the characters, you forget about the actors.

From all the K-pop singers that I’ve seen in dramas, only one left a positive impression on me, and that was Lee Junho. And after this role, IU is the second one. Some may say that you don’t need much acting skills to just walk around with a frozen face and your head down, and barely say anything, but I think that that was definitely not the case here. Quite the opposite actually, she gave away so much by saying so little. You could see that she was full of emotions behind that emotionless face, and the way she managed to show us that was really unique. Small, weak, fragile at first glance, but tough, dedicated to her goal, and ultimately warm-hearted as the drama progresses. “The girl that is always underdressed for the weather” as Ahjussi described her, perfectly portrayed what it means to truly care for someone. Every moment of screen time with her was a pleasure to watch. I haven’t seen her in any other dramas, but for this drama, IU, I salute you.

All the other characters did an amazing job as well. Lee Ji-Ah gave us a mixture of emotions going from extreme hatred to even, believe it or not, sympathy at some points. The CEO and his helpers easily made us despise them, while Jung Hee and Yoora (Nara and Nara) were loveable from start to finish. Even the monk, which we didn’t see a lot of, felt like he had a big impact in the drama. That is just a hint of how good everybody was.

When it comes to the atmosphere and the setting, I usually prefer shows that are set in the countryside, or some aesthetically pretty places, rather than the city, but this one was just so well done that I had really no problem with it, it actually made me like the city a lot more. All the typical city places we see in numerous shows, the offices, the bars, the high class hotels, and middle class apartments, all have so much more meaning now. And the soundtrack…oh the soundtrack… all the melancholy songs this show had actually make me happy when I hear them now, simply because they remind me of “My Ahjussi”.

I could go on and on about this for hours, but let’s wrap it up. Time flies by in a second while watching this show. The world around you feels different while watching this show. There were 16 episodes of it, and it feels like I could watch 16000 more and I will still enjoy it as much as I do now. I long to see a drama that will touch my heart as much as “My Ahjussi”. All the other K-dramas feel so distant, as if they were of a different kind. And they probably were. “My Ahjussi”...is truly…one of a kind. And no matter how much more of this I write, the true beauty of this show can’t be put into words. Just go and watch it. Live it. Hats off.

Sometimes a show comes along that is so insightful, so unexpectedly profound and so transcendently beautiful that you are left without adequate words to describe it. This is that show.

Lee Sun-kyun plays Park Dong-hoon, a numb middle-aged engineer in a tired marriage who finds himself entangled with Lee Ji-an, a very young, almost unsocialised woman played with an extraordinary subtlety and quiet intensity by IU. Ji-an has been tasked to help get rid of Dong-hoon by the CEO of his company, Do Joon-young (Park Young-min) who is having an affair with Dong-hoon's wife. Ji-an wiretaps Dong-hoon's phone and finds herself identifying with his unhappiness, even as she is drawn to his inherent kindness.

Surrounded by a cast of unhappy and dissatisfied people, this is a show about middle age and about failure but in the end about how our lives are enriched by kindness and community. Ji-an is a damaged young woman who has endured almost unimaginable tragedy but through her relationship with Dong-hoon they are both able to heal and to finally pursue happiness.

The performances of the entire cast are extraordinary but it's the sparse script, off-kilter cinematography and haunting pensive OST that give the show a sensibility that's hypnotic, almost mesmerising. It’s melancholic and a little weird – but in the kind of way that people are a little weird. It’s grim and there’s very little joy in it but the tone and lack of joy is presented in a way that makes it analogous to the disappointments and mindless drudgery of middle-age.

But beyond the themes of failure and the cold darkness of winter as a metaphor for dissatisfaction, this is a show about the triumph of kindness. Portrayed so often as a weakness, it is instead Dong-hoon's kindness that is his greatest strength. It is kindness, community and love that is celebrated and through that celebration this show finds a beauty that transcends mere television.

It is, for now, the best show of 2018.

I usually enjoy fluffy romance comedies like Weightlifting Fairy and Goblin. Mother, Signal, Tunnel etc are great, but I'm unlikely to rewatch them. So of course the only reason I started watching this grim looking drama before it ended was because of IU. The first episode took my silly ""personal preferences"" and crushed them under the most beautifully crafted and executed cinematic experience of my life. A story about 3 old men had me shooketh. My Mister takes an unfiltered look at life, serving us the violent, the depressed, the mediocre. But it adds color to this dark narrative by showing us the beauty of human connections. It shows us that all you need is one person in your corner. I'm so thankful to the cast and crew of My Mister for having created this masterpiece, because I learnt so much from this drama, about love, patience, and especially about compassion. It's a must watch, please don't miss out.

A story about life goes a long way
This is clearly not the best drama of 2018. It is the best drama of all time. Before delving any further, if you're wondering if there are spoilers in this review, rest assured there are none (or just a pinch of it at most).

Story and General comments:
If you are looking for fantasy, this drama is not for you. If you are looking for a typical romance drama, slowly walk away now. The beauty of My Mister is in its simplicity. What I mean by simplicity is that it's not a typical k-drama involving a rich chaebol falling for a poor normal-life-living girl, or the male lead having super powers or some crazy disorder. It is just a story between one Ahjusshi, one girl and one (hella great) neighbourhood. If there's one spoiler-ish statement in this review, it'll be this one - Though as many of you may have read from comments and reviews, this story is not about romantic love between the two leads. That said, I have never personally felt more love between two characters in any other show (not limited to just k-drama) as I did in My Mister. That's the power of great story telling - the love between two people that transcends the conventional love and romance of what we know and have come to understand. And yet, there is so much more to the story; something you will have to experience for yourself as mere words are just inadequate and will not do the show any justice.

Acting:
Another concern that many viewers had before the show aired was about IU's acting. Though she has improved along the years, her acting is good at best with some occasional great moments. This has changed with My Mister. IU's acting was simply exceptional and her performance in My Mister is hands down the best out of all her dramas. And as for Lee Sun Kyun, must I say more? His acting is and has been exceptional and it is no different in My Mister. Poured his heart out for the role and the viewers felt every breath of it... literally.

Music / OSTs:
One big factor for me personally is the Music / OSTs of a k-drama. Yes a drama may be well written and well acted, but if the OST is not up-to-par, the drama will just end up being forgettable many years down the road. I kid you not, I was playing the OSTs on repeat the whole day for weeks and even up till today, I am still listening to it on a daily basis. It is just that good. Props to Sondia, Vincent Blue, O.When, Jung Seung Hwan and even IU (she wrote the song for JeHwi) for creating what has to be one of the most memorable OSTs of any k-drama.

Conclusion:
What more can we ask for? A story that shatters the proverbial glass ceiling of k-drama standards; acting performances that exceed all expectations; music that will stick with you on repeat for a very long time. My Mister is not just another k-drama but an important precedent for k-dramas as it is not afraid to revitalize the conventional formula and reinvent the storytelling wheel.

I would like to end this review with one word - Masterpiece.

I maybe the first one to give this a lower score but in all honesty as much as I want to give it a 10, I couldn't. I give this a solid 8.

This had all the recipe that I look for in a drama. it is dark, moody, raw and sad.I got hyped when I found out that it was the same director as MISAENG and SIGNAL and especially when I checked that it beat SIGNAL as the top rated drama here in MDL. But it wasn't depressing enough for me. Yes there were scenes that made me tear up but it was just like a scratch, I want it to be skin deep just like what MISAENG, DEAR MY FRIENDS and LIVE did where scene after scene it kept piercing my heart all the way through. Although that wake scene at the last episode made me cried buckets of tears, that's what I've been missing throughout the drama, give me more of that emotional-punch-to-your-soul scenes.

The major hold back in this drama for me is the love story of his brother and that actress, to me it was lackluster and took too much screen time, it was like my tears are about to fall from the leads'scenes and then it gets cut by their lousy romance story. it was well acted though but TBH it was unnecessary to highlight their story in which I wished that they could've put the spotlight more on Jang Ki Yong's story.

Jang Ki Yong's character's story was the big miss. To me his story is much more interesting than the two brothers honestly. his inner conflicts within himself is so captivating to watch. The way his character developed and gradually finding out why he is living that way was not stretched enough. I wanted more from him.

But man what a departure this is for IU from her previous roles. I think this type of character suits her personality more that's why she was able to pull off a stunning performance. And can we talk about Mr. ahjussi for a moment, why does he always get cheated on by his wives? first on MY WIFE IS HAVING AN AFFAIR THIS WEEK and now this, poor thing.

p.s. that OST is golden! I would recommend y'all to listen to every song, it just breaks my heart.

Hands down the best drama I've ever watched. Even my all time faves Signal, Punch, and Secret Forest can't make me feel the way I feel watching this drama. I think it's better if people go into this drama knowing as little as possible. The title, the summary, it can be misleading and I know it deterred some people away from watching it, but TRUST. This is the most well made drama in all of my 12-13 years of watching dramas. Every character serves a purpose, and every character has a story that won't be abandoned by the writer. The writing, directing, acting, just everything is beautiful, realistic, and compelling. And oddly enough, no matter how dark, how quiet, how melo it can get, it's never boring. This drama makes walking home from work it's freaking runway. I can confidently say that this drama has changed my outlook on life and humanity. I want to be a better person because of it, and I think this story will resonate with a lot of people who are going through rough times in life and comfort them. IU and Lee Sun Kyun were exceptional in this drama, and their chemistry together... WOW. Not only were there sparks, but those sparks ignited into a blazing flame. If you told me 2.5 months ago that IU and Lee Sun Kyun would have such amazing chemistry together, I'd scoff at the thought. These two have SO much compassion and understanding for another in such an undefinable, profound way. There's no romance between the leads but there is LOVE. My heart literally aches thinking about it. Anyone who is hesitating to start this drama, don't hesitate and jump right into it. It's practically an injustice to describe this drama in words. It must be seen and it must be heard. Most people get hooked around ep 3/4 and from there on there's no coming back. Also, don't skip parts! The attention to detail is really important, even down to the sounds. So crank up your volume and discover why My Mister is an all time favourite.

I want to live in that neighborhood too.

As I write this I have tears. This is one of the best dramas that I have seen in a long time. The writer and director somehow drew me in and I began an emotional roller coaster ride. I think they bring to light that most people force their selves through life. Sometimes we forget that the most important part of life are the lovely moments with our families and friends. The characters may seem like ordinary people living ordinary lives, but there are so many layers to each of these characters. The story has an extra marital affair, corporate intrigue, child neglect and some violence. here is plenty of suspenseful moments, heartbreaking realizations, and pleasant surprises. I am particularly impressed by the well written character, Park Dong Hoon. All of the extra characters are also very much needed to make this story complete. Some people may think that this drama is slow, but it totally works that way. I can't explain why the characters of this drama touched me, but I cried and laughed and stared blankly.

I like it that Lee Sun Kyun plays Park Dong Hoon with strength and conviction. I had honestly forgotten about this actor since Coffee Prince. He was made for this role. At first I admit I wasn't sure what the big deal was about these brothers, but each episode shows more depth of character until I was totally engrossed in their lives. People talk smack about idol actors and also say that she didn't have to do much talking or acting. To that I say you are so wrong. IU had a quiet strength that was palpable as Lee Ji An. I didn't know what to think of Ji An at first, but I felt sympathy for her and wanted her to succeed no matter what. The other actors are good also.

The music is good.

I may rewatch this sometime.

No matter what genre you usually prefer, I recommend that you watch this drama.

This show is the first show that made it absolutely an obligation for me to leave a review. 4 years watching korean dramas and having watched a crazy amount of them, this is the first review.
IT WAS AN HONOR TO WATCH THIS SHOW.

For those who are wondering and debating whether this show is worth it, it took me months to convince myself to watch this considering it's about middle aged men and i'm in my 20's and had no romance, sci fi, thriller tags. but how glad i am i finally did! So please watch this. This is a must watch. There is NO korean drama like this. It's the first of it's kind and i wish with all my heart this becomes the standard of korean dramas from now onwards. this is a therapeutic show in my eyes.

This show is all sorts of beautiful. This show is not about solutions, not about how life should be, not about closure or happy endings or sad endings or a directed story told in a few episodes. This show is a chunk of life shown of people at different stages of their life. This show is the most realest show i have ever watched. It made me laugh and cry. The storyline, the direction, cinematography, the music, everything was just perfect.
This show not once glorified life. It showed it how it is. That's the beauty of this show.

The emotions in this show are so overwhelming it's crazy. I felt so attached to the characters it's so sad this show ended but what an ending it was. It makes me believe. Makes me hope. It taught me so many life lessons. Seldom is a show this beautiful made that encapsulates life so beautifully by keeping it 100% real.

The love in this show is the most deepest i have ever seen in any. It is a show with the most meaningful love and it didn't even have to be a romantic drama. Everyone can interpret love differently for this show. I choose to interpret it as love between a man and a woman who felt their souls being attracted to each other. Without any skinship, any cheesy romantic words, this show was able to show the love that if one finds it in life, they have it all. The most purest of all loves. The two souls who met each other in their most broken states, healed, filled each other despite. Souls that helped each other grow. The love in this drama is unlike any other. Most deepest, most heartfelt, most relatable.

The cast was beautiful! absolutely perfect. the best acting i've seen. IU's role was so different than her previous ones and she proved how good of an actor she is. she was FANTASTIC. Lee Sun Gyun was a treat to watch. This was the first i saw of him ever since Coffee Prince and i knew instantly why back then i had a second lead syndrome. He was INCREDIBLE. His every nerve expressed emotions. His eyes spoke millions, his walk, his talk. He was a show stealer. Plus, he has the best voice ever. Calms your soul and his character with that voice just melted me. (considering i'm in my early 20's, Ahjussi, saranghae :P ) .

VERDICT: WATCH THIS SHOW. LEAVE EVERYTHING AND WATCH THIS SHOW. this show is LIFE!

Thankyou screenwriters, producers, directors, the entire cast, the entire team behind this show for making one of the best shows ever and thankyou for giving us this masterpiece that is full of life lessons. I repeat, it was an absolute HONOR to watch this show.

At first blush this drama seems to be dark, depressing and sometimes slow, but taking a deeper dive, this drama completely blew me away. The way My Ajusshi was able to tap into some incredibly deep life truths is so very touching. This drama centers around characters where life has left them behind. Downtrodden and facing failure, these characters will learn to overcome those insecurities in pursuit of their own definition of happiness. There are times that this drama just shook me to the core in how it handled these truths and how it encourages its viewers that there is always hope.

This drama’s strength is its characters. My Ajusshi portrays deep and nuanced characters not only in Park Dong Hoon and Lee Ji An but also in their supporting characters as well. This drama delves deep into the concepts of love, marriage, family and community.

I did want to address the love between Park Dong Hoon and Lee Ji An. The love between these two is not a romantic type of love, it transcends that. Dong Hoon refers to Ji An as someone who knows him completely just from observing him, someone who almost shares a soul with him, a kindred spirit of sorts is my interpretation. I personally refuse to see their love in a romantic light. Their love is too pure for that!

This drama is incredibly beautiful and able to encompass an aspect of life unlike any other drama I’ve seen before. Though it may have a darker framework, it’s uplifting and encouraging message is so very rewarding! This is by far one of the most encouraging dramas I’ve seen! My Ajusshi is a beautiful story about salvation, redemption and rebirth! What are you waiting for? Go watch this now!!!!!

I believe this has to be one of my favorite dramas after Stranger/Secret Forest. I decided to watch this drama because of tvn- I was impressed by Stranger/Secret Forest. Initially I did not like Lee Ji-an or Park Dong Hoon but they have to be one of my favorite couples onscreen now. This show not only is great in cinematography but it actually has a story. It shows love of three brothers. the misunderstanding of a couple who's love is lost, cheating spouses, issue of us humans not treating each other equally because of status (Lee Ji-an), losing first love due to love taking the route of spirituality and God, the mindset of corporation and the business world. I haven't seen a Korean or even a American drama which shows accuracies of what people go through everyday. I completely could relate to Park Dong Hoon and what has caused him to be the quiet, suffering soul-someone who at the end of the day reminds himself, it's not a big deal. This drama shows how people are suffering quietly in their everyday lives and sad reality of Korea on how people drink away their problems and stress late into the night.

It shows a rare, unlikely connection/bond between two people who are from different walks of life and how they end up befriending each other and helping each other out knowingly and unknowingly through out their hardships. These type of people are true rare gems of life and they are often those who you never thought you'd be friends with. I believe this show has written normal life situations and problems so easily which I believe anyone could relate to.

I would strongly recommend this drama and its OSTs, and I applaud to those that are involved in the making of the show.

This drama exceeds everyone's expectations despite the controversies even before filming started until it has finally aired. There are 2 episodes left but I'm already writing a review simply because whether it has a good or a bad ending, I want to encourage everyone that this drama is really worth watching.

A Masterpiece-to-be , said the director of 'Misaeng', 'Signal' and 'My Mister'; Director Kim Won Seok. A drama that heals everyone who was having hardships in life. A drama that will touch our hearts. EVERYONE, please listen. This is NOT a romantic drama. It is one of the issues that this drama faced prior to its airing. Lee Ji-An, a girl in her 20s experiencing hardships in life portrayed by IU, Park Dong Hoon, a married man in his 40s portrayed by Lee Sun Kyun together with his brothers, Park Ki Hoon(Song Sae Byuk) and Park Sang Hoon(Oh Dal Su; later replaced by Park Ho San because of the rape allegations). Controversies regarding a man on his 40s developing a relationship with a girl on her 20s surfaced before the drama aired. Allegations on Oh Dal Su that affected not only him but the drama as well, until he was eventually replaced by Park Ho San. But behind all of this, they never failed to deliver.

Story: This is the first time I'm watching a drama not because I'm a fan of IU, but because I want to watch something different. Something unique. As a person that is currently having hardships in life, this drama attracted my attention. Not a romantic drama, not a thriller, not a Rom-Com. But instead, a healing drama, no romance at all. How many times have you watched dramas with a cliché plot? My Mister showed a different perspective in life. Even though we're experiencing hardships and problems, there's always a light of hope. With your family, with your colleagues, and that special someone that has been on your side ever since.

Acting/Cast: I've watched all of IU's dramas since I'm a fan and I can see how much she has improved all through this years. Some people doubted if she can pull of cold, and tough woman since her past roles showed a more bright and fresh image. Well, she proved them wrong. Her acting in this drama is probably the best out of all her drama. Lee Sun Kyun on the other hand for me is somewhat underrated. Since some(not all) based their preferences on looks but not on their acting. This is somewhat irrelevant but if you come to think of it, Lee Sun Kyun is one of the Ahjussis in Korean Entertainment today but has been overshadowed by other actors(not going to drop names). I believe that if other actors took this role, this won't be as good as it is right now. Lee Sun Kyun perfectly portrayed a middle-aged man who is trying to survive despite the hardships and challenges that life has given to him. Believe me, once you watched the drama you'll get goosebumps every time his scene comes up. Song Sae Byuk and Park Ho San complimented the character of Lee Sun Kyun really well as his brothers. Their chemistry together is really amazing. And to think that Park Ho San is suddenly casted because Oh Dal Su has to leave, he really fits the role as the eldest brother and believe me, you wont feel much difference, you wont even think that Oh Dal Su was supposed to play this role.

Music: All of the OSTs. as in all of the OSTs is truly captivating. The way that they are played during some certain scenes gave me chills. For me, my favorite would be OST Part 2: Sondia - Adult (??). Every time this OST will be played, you can really feel the weight of each scene. Also, IU wrote lyrics of one of the OSTs. which is OST Part 4: Dear Moon.

Rewatch Value: I only gave this 9/10 because the heavy plots in this drama is definitely not easy to rewatch. Once you watched it the first time, the emotions will really kick in. This is one of the dramas that made me cry. Because I can relate and I can feel how heavy it is. Well, it's not actually bad if you rewatch it a few times, but that excitement, that surprising plot and cliffhanger on some endings of each episode makes it really worth the wait each week. Once this drama is finished, I will be rewatching it and I sincerely hope that every episode will still give me the same feeling that I have felt the first time I watched it.

Overall, a 10/10. One of the best Korean Drama ever. Trust me, it will be worth your time. The Cast, Cinematography, Music and Story is truly stunning. I hope that this drama will not be underrated and receive recognition as much as other titles. It may have received a lot of controversies and issues along the way but it truly stayed to its track and captivates the heart of the viewers. Thank you so much and it has been an honor watching such a masterpiece.

EDIT:
Last two episodes: As I said in the earlier section of my review, I wrote this review while there are still 2 episodes left and no matter what the ending would be my verdict will still be the same. Out of all the episodes, these last two episodes probably is the best. Now that the drama is finished, please do me a favor and share this masterpiece with your friends. ""Even if you're having hardships in life, just hang in there. It's no big deal"".

Melodramas are my guilty pleasure. All that intensity wrung from convoluted stories and LONG drawn out stares: those fierce moments captured so we can revel in their glory (and for me live vicariously through bringing joy to a soul numbed by unforgiving trials.) However this drama has changed the game completely. It shows that you don't need melo for intensity. That fervour, and passion can be portrayed through the vulnerability of humans, through spiritual connections, and through delicate stories that hold true to life. This drama is spectacular.

Bruce Lee said that love is friendship on fire and the slow burn in the relationship just kills you - with that bittersweet edge that keeps you wanting more. Just like why I love melodramas for that 'good kind of hurt' this drama kept me enamoured through natural dialogues, understated performances that had powerhouse resonance and intricate stories that never felt laboured - piercing my soul and setting wild my courage, hope and love for the potential of the human soul. There's actual character development and not just people changing their minds or procrastinating.

IU has never been better, Lee Sun Kyun has made me a huge fan of him and the writer and director are now on my watch list forever. I cannot recommend this drama enough AND I'm saying this with one episode to go... Honestly no matter what the end, I'm just so happy with this drama. Like I said this drama has changed the game for me because normally (always) how much I love a drama is so much dependent on the ending. You're so satisfied with scenes of beauty, and strength that the journey itself becomes the destination.

I'll still tune in for my melodramas but this drama has just opened my eyes to a whole new world. It's shown me what dramas can be in the hands of gifted people. Highly, highly recommended.

This review may contain spoilers
I think I'm the only one here who didn't enjoy this drama as much as everyone else. I just feel like this drama, in some way, romanticizes (or if not romanticize, definitely not criticize) Ji An's actions. She had no real consequences for her act of stalking and wiretapping Dong Hun. And of course, us viewers sympathize with Ji An so we naturally don't want anything bad to happen to her either. I guess, I just couldn't put that aside.

I mean, of course, initially, there were people who were really upset with Ji An for wiretapping in the first place but quickly that turned into support. Every time Ji An listened to Dong Hun's personal life and got very emotional, I think it is supposed to be a very touching scene but instead, to me, it's just creepy. Dong Hun's privacy is invaded for 24/7. No one seems to be mad at Ji An for that, instead, they support her.

And then there's Kwang Il. So many people actually SHIP Ji An and Kwang Il... like HELLO? Kwang Il is the same person that beats the living crap out of Ji An. Yeah Kwang Il is messed up and I pity him but he needs HELP. Him being mentally unstable is NO EXCUSE for him beating Ji An up.

I just feel like this drama portrays very controversial topics in a positive light and I'm not a fan. My reasons for not liking this drama as much as other people could very well be the same reasons why they love this drama. After all, this drama definitely explores more controversial topics in a deep manner. I am a fan of dramas that aren't cliche too, but I just don't like the way this drama went about it.

I reallyyyyyy really liked Dong Hun's neighborhood though. I think that alone made me stick with this drama to the very end. 6.5/10 rating.

I normally write long, well-thought out reviews. All I can say about this drama is it's perfect. It is a drama about redemption and kindness and humanity that will make you feel hopeful. It's also brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed, and flawlessly written. Do not deny yourself the pleasure of watching this drama. It is a lifechanger.

The music and cinematography are also excellent.

And since I need to fill 500 characters, let's just say that Lee Ji Eun is fabulous. I knew she had it in her because I saw Producers. But her performance in this is magical: one of the best, if not THE best, lead actress performances I've seen.

Maybe it's because of my current mood, having had a really difficult year so far, but this has been the only drama that has been able to completely hold my interest until the end in a while. I had no expectations when I started watching. I wasn't even sure about what genre it was... mystery? romance? melodrama? All I knew is that from the very beginning it caught my interest, and kept me curious about what would happen between these two almost strangers with seemingly nothing in common.

First, I have to say that I was so impressed by UI in this role. There is no sign of a pop persona or cuteness. As Lee Ji An she is equal parts tragic, and bad@ss! Her poker face kept me guessing. Her tears broke my heart. Whether she was the villain or the hero in this story didn't matter to me. She really was a great and intriguing character. She's a survivor, with a huge and understandable chip on her shoulder, and UI did an amazing job.

Ui is matched with Lee Sun Kyun as Park Dong Hoon, who I've been a fan of since Coffee Prince. He is the ""Ahjussi"" obviously, and perfectly cast as an underdog character who you can't help but root for and crush on. In this role I am reminded of his charm while playing totally realistic and down to earth characters. I will admit he was my main reason for being curious about this drama in the first place, and he didn't disappoint.

The story mainly revolves around the relationship between Park Dong Hoon and Lee Ji An, but do not expect a traditional romance. I was actually afraid that the drama would take that turn, but instead it was truly a story about connecting with someone in a much deeper way. There are suspenseful actions that bring them together initially, and there is great, although often awkward, chemistry between them. By the end it's more about the ways they were able to affect each other's lives, a theme with all of the characters actually, and the quest for personal happiness.

Speaking of the rest of the characters, the entire cast is amazing. As much as I loved Dong Hoon's brothers, and loved to hate the loan shark, and the CEO, I really can't think of one weak character in the entire drama! Even the smallest roles were great! It would be easy to just see these characters as depressing, but it actually became comforting watching how they came together for each other. I also like that the characters were all imperfect, which made them all very relatable, including some of the most villainous characters. Each individual supporting character's story was interesting on it's own, which is a nice bonus to the story overall.

Eventually all the initial suspense in the story does give way to a more melodramatic feel, but the story stays strong until the end. It also feels like the story changes along with the characters, and since this is a character driven drama, it works well!

Would I watch this again? Definitely. Some of the initial intrigue would be gone, but there's enough substance to make the story worth rewatching. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack, and thought it matched the mood of the drama well.

Overall, despite it's often generally somber mood, I really enjoyed this drama a lot. This was a different kind of escapism for me. The kind that made me a little more grateful for the good, and the bad, the grief, the disappointments, the achievements, and the relationships we make in life along the way. I felt very empowered by the grandmother's words in the last episode, and that alone would make me recommend this drama. I also really loved the ending scene. I cried a lot during the last episode, which is a warning for those who don't want to be in their feelings watching a drama, but the tears actually felt healing. If you are looking for a drama with substance, I highly recommend this one. It may not be the genre I normally seek out, but it was exactly the drama I needed to see.

I still Don't Understand whats so SPECIAL about this K-Drama!
How can this Drama be a masterpiece?
There are so many problems in the story.
For instance how is it that Ji Ahn is able to break the law and get away with it? How is it that she is easily forgiven by everyone for invading her co-worker's (male lead's) private life. Through wiretapping and stalking. Stalking and invading a person's privacy like that is not okay. So many people claim this to be a realistic Drama. Far from reality!

Imagine if the roles were reversed, and Dong Hoon is the one stalking Ji Ahn and wiretapping all her conversations with her husband for example. Isn't that creepy? What happend to double standards?
Also let's not overlook how Ji Ahn is constantly being beaten up by Kwan Ii, and no one else seems to notice and do anything about it.

It's really irritating when this drama focuses so much on this depressive aspect! There's no real end goal towards the end of the story. Like goals to achieve for the main leads.

And the brothers are not interesting at all, they are drunken bums who adds very little to the story, just comical. While the Drama is pretty dark itself, and a lot of the time the characters are like depressed. And basically stuck in their situations. The pacing and story is really boring, at least include something interesting about the brothers.
I appalud them for not going the romantic way, meaning Ji Ahn and Dong Hoon were not ending up together.

Also Ji Ahn should have at least seen a psychiatrist at this point! Instead of taking all that abuse and hardships. She could have done something earlier! But all she does is cry half the time on the show, there is no real growth with her till like the last episode when we see her after the time skip.

Well this Drama is definitely not for me! Waste of Time!

Started watching this drama with no expectation, thinking it is just another slice of life drama. I have to say at the beginning like at least 5 episodes it did somehow feel as such, a drama that totally people in general able to relate to and even a bit slow, boring with the many conversations in between characters and with the focus on office politics. However if you stay on and immerse yourself into any of these characters as they move along with the story plot, I guarantee you will feel rewarded on the experience of what relationships between humans really are and how we are all just surviving and thriving (or failing) in the act of being in relationships with one another. This drama stays true to its theme on exploring and unfolding human relationships - love (also self love and care), belongingness, betrayal, forgiveness, acceptance, letting go, and I can go on and on because I'm amazed by the writer nim's ability to pack so many things in 16 episodes and yet it all fits accordingly and not overwhelming the story plot at all!

The existence of the male MC, Park Dong Hoon in this story and the way it is being written really carried all the other characters so well throughout the plot - he is really just an ordinary genuine ahjussi, at some point in your life, you wish you get to meet in real life or perhaps you have even met such a person before. He has his own shares of life frustration but always chose to do things that would determine the outcome of what already happened (staying in control) and not wallow in what already happened (e.g., blame or accept his 'destiny'). His attitude of if you see it as nothing then it will become nothing and life goes on, is really a good learning point in life. Try putting yourself in the shoes of the female MC, Lee Ji An, and experience the tough life she had to go through (someone who accepted her 'destiny') and understanding her reactions and actions as well as what made her blurred the line between gratitude and romance because in the end how do we, as human beings express of our love to someone whom we see as angel sent to us and telling us life is what we made of, instead of destiny.

This drama not only developed strongly anchoring on these two characters but also the entire characters in the neighborhood detailed in the drama. I see it as every single characters revealed in this drama are as equally important to showcase how we all influence one another when we gather together in our lives. From relationships among family members (siblings, mother-sons, grandparent-grandchild) to brotherhoods who stay in same neighborhood (the extended society family) to the 'family' at work and to the point that even a monk character speak volume in this drama - all depicting the sense of belongingness in human beings that is so reflective of reality world. Their interactions in this drama are gems, teaching you the many perspectives of life.

I am just so grateful and satisfied with this drama that lived up to its title and for the writer nim who preserve the beauty of the relationship between the two MCs without tainting it with the usual reciprocating romance theme. The most memorable thing from this drama for me, apart from the awesome casts' performances, is to slowly decipher and digest the meaningful conversations between the MCs especially with the constant illustration using metaphors. Oh and the music and bgm throughout the drama are like, prefect to the core. The whole wire tapping and listening to the audio along with Lee Ji An - every single sound was crisp clear and really made it feel as if the audience is transported into it. Also up until now there are still various vivid scenes from the drama that keep appearing to me visually, such as the walk home at the neighborhood between the MCs and the subway train ride.

This is definitely one drama that will leave a big impact to you if you take a chance to watch it. It hurts a lot at certain point to come to terms with reality of life but it hurts so good because that's how you grow to be a better person.

Wow, where to begin? This is what I would call a ""once in a lifetime"" drama. Some dramas just cut deeper than others. My Mister left me laughing and crying, all at once, and the slow pacing never bothered me – in fact, it just drew me in even more.

This drama is so exquisitely written, from how tightly the plot is drawn together, to the perfectly uplifting yet melancholy dialogue. I love how carefully this drama redefines what an ""ahjussi"" is and what a meaningful relationship looks like. This drama has so much pain in it, but it heals you through that pain.

While the plot wandered, it came back to center, and the character development really shined. Every single character had a duality that made them so empathetic. The main cast is written with dimension and duality; we see them in moments both problematic and progressive, pathetic and admirable, weak and strong. I think that while it's easy to admire a perfect hero, it's the characters that invoke both pity and joy that we can relate to the most. The only thing I would ask for if anything, was for Dong Hoon's relationship with his son to be more clearly written, but this show wasn't about parenthood really, so it's understandable.

The filming itself was done very well — you could tell that the crew put in the time to make it quality. The editing was a little bit awkward for some episodes, likely due to time crunch, but these are minor issues.

The best part about this drama was probably the casting/acting. Lee Sun Kyun just has a look that breaks your heart and warms it at any given moment. His empty stare and heavy sighs echo louder than any of his yells, and each tear he sheds feels like a waterfall. Less is more in his case, and I bought into every moment of his performance. IU really surprised me this time around with Ji An. Ji An is already such a mysterious and complex woman, and IU really gave this abstract character grit and darkness. Seeing her with Son Sook as her grandmother was also so sweet – they had great chemistry.

As for the soundtrack, they absolutely nailed it, 10/10.

I loved this drama. It taught me two things: good storytelling and how to cope with the traumas of life.

I really tried to delay as much as possible writing reviews of shows that I have liked, just because I want the 'high' in me to die down and give them a proper review. It's been months though, and the 'high' in me regarding this show is still there. It's now tied for my all time favorite drama, and this is coming from a 21-year old foreign exchange student who shouldn't be liking melodramas yet. To think that I was even asking then if this show was as good as something in the rain (which actually turned out to be a really average drama), makes me feel pathetic for not realizing sooner. With that, for everyone else who hasn't watched it, I advise you to watch this.

Also, don't read the fucking synopsis or initial plot because it really does a bad way of describing this show. ""3 brothers blah blah blah...."" how the fuck will that entice viewers? It seriously doesn't do justice.

It should've been ""A story about how life will fuck you over continuously, and how you'll realize that some unexpected people are the ones who are actually helping you breath.""

Story:
There it is. My first 10. My favorite drama of all time, Goblin, didn't get a 10 for me because even after thinking hard in myself that it should have, some details and parts of the story wasn't properly closed. This show is perfection at its finest though. Just looking at it makes is seem so unfair. You would think to yourself how the hell were amazing scriptwriters and an amazing director dare work on a single production? It's just beauty from start to finish. It's a melodrama, but it will keep your eyes on the screen like a rom-com and make you feel fear and despair like a thriller. The thing that I liked most about this is how they were able to accurately portray the unexplainable reality of life. Nothing will ever go your way if you don't let others in. You'll only grow as a person, if you help others and let them help you. The protagonist was a really poor girl who had nothing but hate and sadness in her because of the rash, unfortunate events she had to go through growing up. In a nutshell, this story is about how her heart warms through the voice of a man who is a sincerely good person by heart, but is just as pitiful as she is in other aspects of life. That story is mixed with other bitter-sweet storylines from supporting characters which all lead to point to one lesson: ""You won't always get what you want in life, but it shouldn't make you stop working from achieving it."" I won't spoil anything in this review, but this drama is tied (if not better) for the award ""Best Ending"" in a drama with Tomorrow With You (another melodrama)


Acting:
I hated IU's acting before, but this drama changes it. That's one hell of a jump in terms of acting level. Would honestly not come as a surprise to me if she ends up racking all possible awards for her role in this show, because she nailed it. Everyone else nailed it too, from 'Mister' Park Dong Hoon, to his 2 brothers, to the bar owner, to the douchebag wife and her surprisingly young looking but actually old lover, to Ji An's mother, everyone else seemed so natural and adept at the roles they portrayed. They all showed us complex characters who reflects real life people; they are all unique characters, just like how each person in our world really is unique in their own little way. If I were to pick out my favorite character from this show that excludes the two main leads, I would pick Yoo Ra. Kwon Nara continues to surprise me with her acting. She only had 1 previous show where she had significant screen time and I honestly thought she nailed it. Her acting on this show however was superb because she was able to showcase one of the hardest personalty of a character in this show; a tragic actress who has failed in life, but was able to garner strength once again upon knowing that someone important to her was also at their lowest. She was incredibly cute and strangely precise. Lastly, I believe this is borderline cheating; having a really good script for an already stacked cast only does the show good. Their lines suited their personas so much

Music:
The music was beautiful and accurately represented everything in the show. However, as a musically inclined person, what I'm looking for in an OST is something that I can listen to outside of the show and still feel connected to it, both thinking of the characters of the drama and not thinking of them at all. In a simpler way, both the tune and the lyrics of the songs should be dynamic enough to be able to stand on their own without prior knowledge from the drama, but still make you feel connected to it in every way. Goblin had that kind of OST and although I'm half regretting saying this, the tragically awful Uncontrollably Fond also has that kind of OST. I only felt it, and cried while at it cause the genre and message was bittersweet, at a single song in the OST of this drama and that's Sondia's ""Adult"". I'm not saying the OST is bad, because it is actually good. I'm just saying that it didn't have a wow factor for me to remember it outside of the show.

Rewatch value:
Hands down, the one and only melodrama that I would probably be happy rewatching. So many quotable scenes, even for such a slow paced show. If I want to be bored to death by the slowness of the pace of a drama, I'm only willing to do it crying and smiling like an idiot to this show alone.

Overall:
Even if you're a rom-com lover (most kdrama fans), a comedic type of person, someone who prefers thrillers, likes a legal setting (i belong in there), or basically someone who doesn't like melodramas, give this show a chance. It will change your perspective in melodramas, and you'll have faith at humanity again. Who knows, you might even start searching for your own mister after watching this show.

""I continue to live because I need to. My heart wants to go somewhere else, but I force myself to live. Just because I need to"" From that sentence uttered by the main character of My Mister, Park Dong Hoon, I ask what is the heaviest burden you have carried in your lives? Regardless of your answers, I feel compelled to answer that, for some, the very act of living, going through the days, is too heavy, because loneliness and uncertainty in the face of other people's lack of understanding of their feelings lead to the complete emptiness , a situation in which even breathing becomes unbearable. And life as we know it becomes a succession of events, faced apathetically, because suspended from ""reality"", we lose what can be defined as the true meaning of existence, if anything like that exists. Immersed in such a ""feeling"", if we can define this absence (of meaning) are the protagonists, Ahjussi Park Dong Hoon, a structural engineer, and young Lee Ji An, who only has her grandmother as a relative and a lot of debts, which are recognized and understood from a relationship that does not begin in a conventional way. Well, Lee Ji An times after joining the company in the company in which Park Dong Hoon is general manager, begins to act as a spy for Seu Ahjussi's rival, Ceo Dung Yeong (lover of Dong Hoon's wife), who moved by vested interests plans the downfall of those who bother him. However, what could become an ill-fated encounter started a journey of self-healing, as these two broken souls find the comfort they had never achieved before. For some to hear that he is a good person, finding someone who will not flee when confronted with his past can be a harbinger that the end has not yet come. For others, finding a balm for their wounds that hitherto remained ""hidden"" can show that, even with so much pain, it is possible to be happy. And it is precisely this ""encounter"" that makes it possible to feel (yes, to feel, because when dealing with a script that accounts for the frustrations experienced by us, human beings, it is impossible not to immerse in such an ""atmosphere"") the true meaning of understanding, of love, which we all, in some way, seek.

Good Premise but Flawed Execution
What I liked:

The premise: Middle-aged man with relatively affluent lifestyle and well-established career encounters poor, miserable young girl and the two form an ""unlikely"" bond because they relate to each other's suffering. Also, a meditation on all the different types of suffering -- of a man being cheated on by his wife, of a girl victimized by society and circumstances, of a lonely aging woman deserted by her lover, etc. Suffering is something we all share, in one form or another, so it is a universal theme.

The slice-of-life scenes: Really adds warmth and light to the dark world of this drama. I loved the relationship between the brothers, and the late-night walks around the neighborhood, the happiness tinged with sadness. Sometimes a bit overdone, but generally well-made.

The mood: Not everyone gravitates towards darkness, but if you are in a particular mood, this drama hits the spot. The heaviness and sadness interspersed with lightness and warmth, that play of chiaroscuro, make for a really satisfying tone.

Some of the dialogue: I really, really loved the little nuggets of wisdom dropped here and there, about people struggling all their lives to chase after a goal that in the end does not bring real happiness, about the futility of proving yourself to other people, etc. I also liked the addition of the Buddhist monk. These almost saved the whole drama for me, but not quite.

What I didn't like:

First and foremost, the fact that Ji An is never really made accountable for the things that she does. The viewer is set up from the very start to empathize with Ji An, to feel her suffering, to view her as a victim, and to understand why she does the things she ends up doing. Set up is the right term to use though because the pathos is laid on thick from the very start -- sick grandmother, having to eat other people's leftovers, being hounded and beaten repeatedly by a loan shark with a grudge, having only stolen instant coffee as a small comfort and pleasure against all the darkness of the world. Yes, yes, and yes. HOWEVER, as the drama progresses, we see Ji An committing dastardly deeds -- stealing money (bribe money, yes, but still stealing), offering to ruin people's lives and reputations in exchange for more money, blackmail, wiretapping, stalking, and generally just a total disregard and disrespect for other people's privacy. Yes. She needs money. Yes. She is taking care of her sick grandmother and she is desperate. Yes. She was and still is being victimized by a loan shark. Yes. She indeed has a very unfortunate life. BUT THAT IS NO EXCUSE TO HARM, DISRESPECT, OR VICTIMIZE OTHERS. Everyone has a story. Everyone has some aspect of their lives that is relatable and pitiful. Even serial killers. Even mass murderers. That doesn't mean they should not be held accountable for the things they do. It is one thing for Dong Hoon and his guilty wife to understand Ji An and even to instantly forgive her for listening to their private conversations whenever she wanted to (heck, she could even have eavesdropped on their lovemaking. ""Luckily,"" they were having marital issues). It is a totally different thing for them to act very irresponsibly and to even help her get away scot-free without being held accountable for everything that she did. Stalking and wiretapping someone ARE SERIOUS INVASIONS OF PRIVACY. In the drama, the wiretapping is used as a tool to get Ji An to fall in love with Dong Hoon, and so the scenes of her listening in on him are portrayed in a tender, loving light. But in actuality, she is committing a grave crime against his person, and it is all very creepy and disrespectful. The writer could have had her do some time in jail, or do community service at the very least, but having Dong Hoon instantly forgive her (seemingly because he just was desperate to see her) and even help her after he finds out is, I think, poor writing and horrible decision-making. Whatever kind of bond they formed, a wrongdoing is a wrongdoing and should be treated as such. Even parents reprimand their children when they mess up.

The nature of the bond between Ji An and ""her Ahjussi."" I understand the writer wanted to establish a deep, undefinable bond between Ji An and Dong Hoon, but in the end it became very obvious that Dong Hoon was feeling more than just fatherly or brotherly love, friendship, or affection towards her. There were too many scenes of him scanning the streets for her, missing her, almost being obsessed with her. This could have been done very well and much more subtly. The bond need not have been romantic of all, on either side. It could just have been that -- a deep bond -- and need not have crossed any lines. One good example of this, done right, is in Leon: The Professional. Or they could have opted to add subtle, ambiguous hints. It is not necessarily just the age gap nor the fact that Dong Hoon is married that made these scenes cringey for me, but definitely those did play a part. Personally, I thought it was unnecessary to add romance and desire to the mix. There could have been, maybe in their last scene together, something, a ""maybe,"" in the way he looks at her or holds her hand, but even that may be too much. It just was...cringey and inappropriate somehow, and, as I said, totally unnecessary.

Overall:

The drama definitely has shining moments, especially in the slice-of-life scenes and some of the dialogue. It certainly could be very compelling once you get into it. But the last few episodes really broke the deal for me. The resolutions were awkward and hurried. And, as discussed in detail above, I just disagree with the direction the writer chose to take, both plotwise and characterwise.

From the director of ""Signal"" and ""Misaeng."" That should've clued me in. One of the best dramas so far. So well-written and carefully directed with attention to detail. IU just nails it as Lee Ji Ahn, and Lee Sun Kyun is great as ""Mister."" No worries folks, this is not a ""love"" story in the traditional sense in case you are concerned about the age gap between the characters - it's NOT what you think, at all. There is love but not in the common sense you may find in other dramas. This is the type you see in Signal or Misaeng. It's a mutual love and respect for yourself, your family and for other human beings. It's a story about everyone who feel a weary and tired of life (one of my fave quotes from the drama: ""you feel like you've worked hard and struggled all your life, but you look back and you see that you have accomplished nothing, and you don't even have happiness""). And it's like a pat on your back to say, it's ok. You're good. It doesn't energize you like Red Bull - filling you up just for the night. But it's a gentler green tea kind that let's you think about life, about yourself, about life's realities and how to talk about that. It's overall a human drama. And I just love that about this drama.

The characters are written very subtle. No giant dramatic moments here (as the main character says in one of the episodes, ""people don't go around slapping people. that only happens in dramas. in real life, it's the kind of thing that happens maybe once in a life time"") but just every day life written in a quiet but profound way. There are also great laugh-out-loud moments here too. How the director just changes an otherwise heavy scene by adding a bit of comedy or wit to dissipate the heaviness. It's so superbly executed that I don't know what else to say about it except everyone should go see it. Just when my faith in K-dramas have started to dissipate, here comes this drama to charge me up. Like green tea.

I started watching my mister while it was airing in April 2018. The past couple of years were extremely hard for me, personal problems, battling with myself, and on top of that health issues manifesting. The saddest part about me while being in this tough place was that I started losing interest in things that used to make me happy, watching dramas included. My mind would be screaming way too loud for me to pay attention to the show. In spite of that, my mister was compelling enough for me to follow it. However, I put my mister on hold in its 12th episode, despite me loving it while airing due to the aforementioned issues. My mental stasis wasn't strong enough to watch such a serious drama.

A year and a half has passed since then and I find myself now mentally healthy enough, in defiance of every day problems, not only to watch and finish it but also to rewatch the whole thing from the beginning. In retrospect, what exactly put me through hell weren't really the hardships that may, or may not, had come my way, but the feeling of being lonely, scared that nobody will understand, afraid that nobody will like the true sad face behind this ever-glowing smile. Little did I know, and little had i understοοd back then, this was exactly what my mister was about in the end.

My Mister isn't just a drama, isn't, probably, just the best drama that i have ever watched, it is life itself. Trying to delve deep into My Mister and then convey its meaning in written form ends up being a challenging job as I have taken so many notes in order to write this review, and yet nothing really makes as much sense as the feeling while watching and as I have finished this peace of true art. Therefore I'll start backwards and prompt everyone to watch this masterpiece. It doesn't really matter what genre you like, what mood you are into, what type of person you are, if you have feelings, are romantic or dead inside, my mister will open and warm a beautiful place in your heart with its rawness, its beauty, its soul, its reality.

The drama talks about the hardships of adult life and how they shape us, directing the way we live and the type of people we end up being - good or bad. Problems, sucky lives, faking it till we make it, facing horrible, selfish people, emotional draining jobs and a rotten society that makes good people feel worthless for being fair.

The goal of the drama is to show us how to battle the inescapable sadness that attacks the earnest people and eats them alive while showing several personal life issues, always putting in the center that everybody has it hard and that should not make them evil, but rather more caring instead. Survival, strife for money, unfulfilled dreams, giving up hope, career problems, society demanding and accepting only perfection from us, failed marriages, wrong choices, family issues, fear of failure, fear of being misunderstood are only glimpses of what my mister has to offer as reasons for sadness in people's lives.

How to survive? Two ways are offered by my mister's profound writer, or are they offered by life itself?

The goal is to not let all that destroy us, destroy the hope, the confidence, the faith, the optimism in our lives and how we get to do that? How we get to stay afloat and survive, just a little bit? Just enough to get through the day? Friendship and family. Family, those people who will always be there no matter what, no matter if you want them or no, the people who will be summoned at once when you kneel. And of course friends, the family we choose from ourselves, the people who will put a smile on our faces even when the whole world around us is crumbling, who will listen to all our stupid shit no matter how tedious they might be, just because they care. People who, around them, it's ok not to be ok, it's ok not to be perfect. Not being alone is the goal. People's support is the key to happiness and survival. A beautiful soul once said ""every person in our life has a purpose and what we should do to repay them is to live a happy life"". Let's all live a happy life, let's all be grateful for the people we have in our lives that love us and thank them! Happiness is small things.

And then in midst of all that, that may or may not turn us in complete passive doormats trying to survive in the sidelines or crazy dogs trying to fight our way through, a special magical person will appear who will, without trying, maybe even without even wanting, tap deeper inside our soul, see us for who we really are, understand us respect and love us for us. A person who will be there, a person who will see you being vulnerable and will stay, a person who will see you cry and won't bat an eye, your person. The drama is about finding our person, that one special person, around whom, we can fully be our perfect broken down selves and that will be ok. Our person!

The drama teaches us the importance of forgiveness, empathy, understandings, meritocracy, of acceptance of others, of ourselves and our mistakes and so so on. Hell, it even showed a great, magnificent example of what transformational leadership is like! I have a MBA and this drama did it better than managerial books (lol). It seriously compells you to watch, it touches your heart, it shocks you and simply moves you with its beautiful message and pacing.

Plot-wise you are thrown in a company with some serious scheming going on and you get to witness how the two main leads seamlessly grow closer together without any cliche happening, without any classic romantic scene by the book. The plot, however, was mysterious and pretty dark without it being makjang though. It might be argued that it was slow, but the build up and the development was so well thought out, I cannot really point out any flaw or any plot hole or any actual dragging or plot slower device or sub story of filler episode. Even the comic relief was so, so meaningful. This is one smooth drama.

Moving on to acting, ""life work"" has been called the actors' effort in this drama and It is totally, absolutely justifiable. IU shut a lot of mouths with her work here and I'm so glad for that. She can pretty much act solely is silly rom coms from now as she has done this! Her performance was shivering in every way. This is truly a life's work for IU who ended up being my favourite actress after this.

Lee Sun Kyun didn't really need to prove anything, however I firmly believe this is one of his best works so far and he will be remembered for this. His character and his portrayal was luscious and I'm Thankful for him acting in this role.

The whole support cast was marvelous, an overall standing ovation. No character was there simply as a plot device, even the antagonists ended up showing deeper complexity by the end. Having such multiple layered characters is just so unique, especially when the cast is so big.

At this point I want to thank and mention the writer, Park Hae Young outdid herself. This was beautiful, the most accurate and simple word I can use. I wish i had a more sophisticated one. This was truly beautiful. Thank you.

Finally the music was excellent and purposeful as well as absolutely appropriate.

The drama gracefully doesn't reduce the concept of ""my mister aka my person "" to just romance, your person can be a friend, a relative, a family member, a lover even a co worker. Your person can be anyone who can see you for you without trying, that special person. Here's to all of us finding that special person. I found him, and God, I'm happy, for the first time in my life I've been alive, so yes, my mister did that for me, and I wish that to all of you. Let's hang in there! Fighting!

I have watched a lot of shows in my life and I have not come across one quite like this. They say that it’s all about the journey and not the destination. This phrase is especially true for My Ahjussi. The journey that each and every character goes through to get to a place of happiness in their life is what makes this show enthralling.

This show is about friendship, kindness, family, community, forgiveness and so much more. Honestly, I would not know how to describe every beautiful moment within each episode. Topics such as adultery, greed, depression, loneliness, etc are dealt with such finesse. It doesn’t feel like a trope used to force a situation or outcome. It’s real and raw and handled very intelligently. More shows should use this show to understand how to portray difficult topics such as the ones shown.

My Ahjussi is beautiful and delicate and wraps you up in the stories of everyone involved. You'll find yourself crying, smiling and rooting for everyone in the show. Each character is developed fully and you get to see their journey throughout the series. The cast did an excellent job in telling their characters story and making the viewer understand their actions and emotions. Oh the emotions! In scenes with hardly any dialogue, you know exactly how each character is feeling. Especially with IU’s character; she doesn’t talk much but you can see the pain and worry and strong resolve in her facial expressions and body language. Lee Sun Kyun is a standout actor in portraying the inner turmoil of Park Dong Hoon.
The scenes with both IU and Lee Sun Kyun feels so natural and you can feel the chemistry that flows easily between them. Their love for each other feels so untainted and pure. It's the kind of love you feel when you truly and wholly know a person, the good and the bad. It's different from what is normally shown on tv and yet it's just as beautiful and heartwarming.
This is not a love story though, rather it is a life story. How the life of someone can be changed by showing kindness and respect. The values shown are so important and yet so simple that we take it for granted in our everyday life.

The soundtrack is captivating. I especially love ""The Man"" when it’s played for the two brothers. The mood set when it's played is fun and mischievous, perfectly capturing the adventures of Sang Hoon and Gi Hoon. ""Grown Ups"" is a song that when I hear it, I’m instantly reminded of the moments I’ve spend watching My Ahjussi.

My Ahjussi is a drama that will tug at your heart strings. I don’t think there will ever be another drama that’s quite like this. It’s unique and will be my No.1 drama for a very long time.

I would like to state that, this drama is a human piece type of drama. Many make it out to be a depressing drama but honestly, it is so hopeful. The bonds and relationships are the core of this drama, from Dong Hoon's family to Ji An's struggles, each person mattered. Dong Hoon and Ji An are the foundation that really connect you to this world. They make you invest in them and wish lovely things for them.

I went through an emotional roller coaster with the characters and came out of it, not regretting a single thing that happened. This was truly a drama done well.

""MOST TOUCHING,REALIST AND PURIST DRAMA EVER""
finishing this I have literally no words that could explain how good this drama is, I can't find any flaws at all! and let me tell you that never happened.
the only flaw it has that it made it real hard to find a drama or a series to top this one. and let me tell you why it's that good.


1) Unique story:
I could easily say that this is the first drama where the story is written this deeply and detailed, blah blah it's about 3 brothers and a girl, but that's not even close to what this story is about, it has much more depth! it has a very believable characters and other than being very likable you really could relate to each character on the story they made the story about families, friends, relationships.. but it's much much deeper than your typical love stories that only scratches the surface of ""real"" relationships, this drama doesn't fu*k around with that, it shows authentic feelings and it shows you how do people around us could be thinking and feeling.
what I like most is that it focuses on really valuable relationships that are noble and just simply beautiful. I don't usually like dramas that makes me cry, even when I cried buckets on this one but it shows you the brutal world that we live in and how some people are struggling each with their problems, HOWEVER, it wasn't depressing by any meanings in fact it gives you new perspectives on life that really could change how you view things.

2) Hilarious comedy:
you might be surprised by this, sure there was some struggling moments you'll see, but man did it make me laugh so hard on some scenes!
specially the three brothers relationship is hysterical yet so real, each character of this drama has this unique personality that could end up saying the most hilarious thing ever, I liked how sarcastic and self deprecating the jokes are.

3) Relate-able characters:
if there's something good that this drama does it's hitting those ""too real"" moments on these character's and how they live, let me tell ya you'll find alot of that ""too close to home"" moments.. and it was the best thing how you could be attached to all those different personalities all at once.
and I find them to be all likable despite the ""bad guys"" obviously but they're all designed really well and will get you in love with some and wanting to stab some others.

4) Cast/Music/Cinematics:
the ost used here is just too beatiful and emotional, to the point where my eyes would bawl automatically the moment a song plays even when nothing happens yet lol..
and the cast is really spot on, they all fit their roles really well, IU's acting and sun kyun mann it's so good you almost forgot they're not real!! and all of them even the supporting characters have a really good acting skills.
the cinematic and everything technical was really well done in this drama everything is feting there is no cringy voice affect that some drama has, it's just perfect.


5) Good pace that will hook you up:
you might be familiar with the dramas that has comedy genre and will introduce you to the story with the best set up as you can imagine, it will be light-hearted and funny, it will be the best... up to the 4th episode ish? then they decide to make everything so forced and dramatic and then you would be like I didn't sign up for this shit. what is even this? right.
well, this drama doesn't do this shit, it will not fool you to like it, its starts with as much drama building the same tension that it has on the rest of the episodes, and there's even some very sweet episodes that would feel like rewards that you didn't expected!

6) It's not DEPRESSING! it's actually positive!
believe me I'm the last person to watch a depressing show and I'll easily drop a show any moment if it was remotely sad, so this drama while being very real and shows you the struggles and hardships alot of time, but in almost each situation they'll end it on a positive note, and it's not forced or fake or anything, in fact it will actually teach you lesson or two on life, also how to look and value things differently.

so YES YOU WILL CRY BUT BELIEVE ME IT'S WORTH IT!

let's live happily now !!
so there are already a lot of reviews for this drama so then why am i writing another ...you can assume i have a lot of time to kill ...so this is gonna be a long review...if you want it short then i'd probably say the synopsis is all you can tell about the drama everything else is just a spoiler ...this show actually has no story but it makes a hell lot of sense ....go watch it don't waste your time reading reviews ...

this show is juat so pefectly done that i could even justify his wife's affair ...it doesn't have a central story line or nothing more than what you read in synopsis ...but then after every episode you want to know what's next , what more can you explore with such a narrow plot ...by the end you can connect all the dots and almost everything that happens makes sense ...i don't know if i'll call it a happy or sad ending ...cuz not everything can be described as either balck or white ...the cast was on point , dialogues i think that's what the drama is about ...
it's not something that will keep you at the edge of your seat but it's something that will leave you yearning for more ...


i'll brief you (just in case you want to know a bit of details )...SPOILERS AHEAD....

Ji An our FL is a murderer she behaves coldly to everyone around because she doesn't want to be a burden or be hurt by anyone , she doesn't like two faced people and mostly spends her time alone working part time jobs in order to repay lee kwang ll whose father is the one whom she killed ...the story passes by as the ML and FL's characters get more involved after the bribery incident and things come to the point where she starts working for joon young (ceo) and ends up tapping ML's phone following his life everyday ...as the story unfolds you get to know why the characters are doing what they are doing ...

it's a heartfelt story ...be ready to shed tears as there are great lines coming your way that are going to hit you hard ...
the story is basically about bright side of ordinary people ...it's close to reality where cold behavior of characters makes you feel warm ...even the side stories do a great job as a matter of fact

as to now why is it a 9/10 and not 10/10
I am not a very patient person ...i skip scenes whenever i feel like ...as to i did that with this drama as well ...i wasn't able to connect to park gi hoon's character that was to the point i started avoiding him on screen ...
at some point in the middle of the drama i started to wonder why am i still hooked on to them ...i don't know why even till the end but other than that i think i don't have any issues ..and i'd also add that i have never had such a satisfactory ending for any show yet ..it's just the perfect closure to a masterpiece
the show brings in real emotions ..tells you what it truly means to be a family ...i am happy that it doesn't create any unnecessary bonds and does not create a definition for relationships ...the characters always stay in limits but reach out beyond limits ....as a matter of fact human emotions will always remain complex and the show potray's it beautifully ...

the show leaves you wondering if you know everything about the person you claim to know ...do you really know what's going on in the life of people close to you , the people who are a part of your everyday life ...it tells you not to judge anyone and asks you to go and reevaluate your relations , address your fault , communicate and to hang on cuz things will get better .

There are lines that i just want to hear on repeat a 1000 times as in the emotion they hold just makes them shine and makes us value them and not just look at them as a mere collection of words
i'll quote some of them ...""the feeling that i am not the only one rolling forward "" ..... ""no matter what i am subjected to it doesn't matter as long as my family doesn't know ""...the kindest words i have ever heard him say are "" want me to buy anything on my way home? "" ......"" you are the only person who helped me more than 4 times "" and all the small interactions between Ji An and her grandmother ...

so as to sum it up this show stands up to it's ratings maybe it deserves more ....keeping aside the regular cliches and bringing us our own everyday life is what this show is about ...it's gonna make you cry along with the characters and you'll empathize with them , you'll feel happy when they do ...
tip : just skip the scenes in the first few ep's if you don't like the pacing ...don't give up on the show as a whole ..it's a good journey marching towards the end ...this has a whole different vibe something of it's own don't expect anything and dive in ...you'll learn to swim with tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ...and remember it's the story you are in for ..it's the characters try to feel them ...you'll have a better experience !!
it's not a must watch but it's definitely a worth watch ....
i don't rewatch shows and i won't say i'd rewatch this but if someday i rewatch something then it would probably be this one ...
forgive me if i went a bit overboard cuz this is my first review ....i hope you enjoy the show as much as i did !! have a good time ...

I'm really having trouble sorting out my thoughts and feelings about this drama. I seriously don't know where to start.

I was excited for this drama because IU starts in it (I'm a fan), and decided to watch it because of that fact alone (Oh and the director also because of Misaeng). I didn't even read the synopsis or anything.

This drama is just... everything. I have finished all episodes and yet I still don't know where to categorize this under. Maybe it deserves a new category on its own. Maybe it doesn't need to be.

Perfecting the trifecta of directing, writing, and acting is a given in every well-made drama. This drama did that and more-- its story is seemingly bleak and gloomy but strangely... refreshing. How they were able to make each line and each character greater than the sum of its parts was way beyond anyone's expectations.

The ending was one of the best I've seen, I was contented, and everything was beautiful, but I didn't want it to end. I'm still craving. I still want to see them go to their workplaces every morning, then to Jung Hee's at night. I'm just thinking that there's a parallel universe out there where Ji An buys Dong Hoon food (and drinks!) for the first time, and the neighborhood gang still stuck together. Just seeing them live their mundane lives... (After the credits finished rolling I was still crying, half because of the overwhelming feelings, half because it's truly over).

Another new thing this drama brought to the table was Ji An and Dong Hoon's relationship. Words are definitely not enough to describe how simple and complex their relationship is--at the same time. I wouldn't delve into this further because I honestly don't know how to; it is best enjoyed and witnessed first-hand. I'm just sad whenever some viewers reduce this pair into a typical 'romantic' one, when they are much, much more than that.

If I were to describe the overall theme of this drama in one word, it's humanity. That simple... yet arduous to define, what more to put into a drama. Yet this crew did it, and with flying colors.

My Mister is definitely my insaeng (life) drama.

This is the first time I am writing a review. First of all, I been seeing about this drama on twitter a lot but never actually read the summary or watched the trailer. I know this drama got quite a positive review and is hyped in Korea but I never thought I would really loving watching this much.
I watched it on Netflix without knowing what the story was about. I normally dont like Idol as lead but I like lead actor with his dreamy voice and I don't mind IU acting that much so I decided to watch it with my mother.
Already from the first ep I was hook in the drama and I find the acting IU did was really amazing that I even forgot that she was IU. She played her character pretty well and I could totally sympathize with her character as the story goes on.
For the lead actor, his acting and character were also astonishing. This drama is one of the few drama I didnt skip scenes, which means everyone and every scenes were worth the watch. The drama might be slow for some people but in my opinion it was just right and not boring. Even the minor characters were well thought and executed. What makes the drama amazing is that we could see the character development as the story goes on. There are funny scenes, sad and emotional scenes as well as some love stories. Everything is included in drama and is overall fun to watch. I finished this drama in 3 days and watched till 3am in the morning.
My mister has really great OSTs too. I ended putting few of them in my playlist. Every time I listen to them I was filled with emotions, end up thinking about the drama and how much I loved it.
If you love dramas like Miesang or Prison Playbook, you will totally enjoy My Mister too.

Worth every single second of your time
I watched this drama last year, early 2019. At first I’ve only watched it only because IU was in it and I stumbled upon the OSTs of the drama but I was by the end of it, I didn’t know I would get this attached. This drama got me extremely hooked on the main character’s plot the whole series, though I have to admit I wasn’t that interested to the other character’s scenarios. I even had a point in the drama where I skipped some of the side character’s part because I found it a bit boring. However, I laughed, cried and smiled all throughout this drama. It made me feel different variants of emotions all throughout the series.

Now its 2020 and we’re in the middle of a pandemic which made me rewatch this drama again and it honestly feels like Im watching a whole different drama.

“You’re all decent people. May you hang in there until you find comfort for yourselves.”

This was the production team’s message at the very end of the drama but for some reason, even the statement made me cry. For months, ever since I first watched the drama, I’ve held on to this statement without knowing why. For some reason it brought tears to my eyes.

And after finishing the drama again today, it was the same. I cried when I read it. However, the thing that changed the most is that I finally understand, the reason why the statement made me cry. It was because it brought me comfort. For some reason, I cried throughout the most scenes that lead towards the ending but when the ending scene actually came up, it only made me genuinely smile. Without even knowing it.
The bright smiles of the two main characters was truly very fulfilling to see in the end especially when I saw the struggles and the frowns they almost seemed to wear all throughout the series. Their smiles was comforting.

This drama brought me such a huge comfort in coping with my own struggles. It helped me understand the people around me, I honestly never thought I’ll get this attached to a drama like this but it’s definitely worth every single second of watching it!

10/10. Haven’t been able to start another drama after this, My Mister has left such strong feelings it’s so hard to move on!! Its almost a month on and Im happy that a lot are stil unable to move on too ????.

Loved JiAn and DongHoon together. True definition of soul mates. Should you watch it? I think you’re definitely missing out on something amazing. Its a kdrama not like any others. It felt like a genre of its own.

And I made an account just because of My Ajusshi! Now, to start my rewatch...

My Mister was a surprise on almost every level, poignant, beautiful and most important of all life-affirming.

Coming from the writer of Oh Hae Young Again, I personally had not a lot of expectations, since that drama was not to my taste at all, but I decided to check it out because I have loved the director's and actors' previous work and wanted to at least give this a chance.
And immediately I was blown away by the acting and cinematography. It took me a bit longer to appreciate the writing due to my apprehensions, but even those were quickly laid to rest.

The strength of a Slice of Life story like this is in its characters and their emotional journey and this show gave us that and much more. Lee Ji An truly is one of the most unique main characters in recent memory. Her struggles are not unfamiliar to the regular drama watchers, but the way these struggles weigh on her and how she deals with them is not something you often see in dramas and IU portrays her magnificiently and I don't think there are any actresses who could have done this any better.

Lee SunKyun for Park Dong Hoon was perfect casting, since LSK has always been an actor who excels at making small facial expressions have so much meaning and it comes to the forefront here, because Park Dong Hoon is a character who internalises most of his issues and without someone capable of showing that this show would have been much lessened.

Too often in shows are side characters paperthin charicatures who only exist to serve plot advancement and thus make the show feel hollow and insular with the world being reduced only to protagonist and antagonists and maybe a few family members and I am glad that the show does not go this route. While not every character in this show has a plotline the world still feels lived in filled with people who have their own struggles and issues and friendships and families.

This show reminds you that it is important to have a support network, but that you can find this support in the most unexpected places and that it doesn't matter what age you are, you always need someone to be there for you, who will see you for who you are and accept you anyway.

This show is extremely highly recommended and should be on most (if not all) best of lists of 2018 for the year. It certainly is in mine.

From the crafty hands of writer Park Hae-young and director Kim Won-seok ... once again they have created a masterpiece. Combined with the terrific acting from Lee Sun-kyun, IU as well as the rest of the main cast, I'm glad to say that My Mister has become one of my favourite dramas.
Despite having really gloomy scenes and a dark theme in general, the show managed to catch viewers' attention through initial suspense involving Park Dong-hoon and the bribes. The drama then further moved into office politics without being boring at all. The theme of healing was strong throughout the drama as Ji-an and Dong-hoon quietly root for each other's happiness. And hey, there's no forced romance, which is totally awesome!!
Apart from the plot and famous lines, I really, really enjoyed Kim Won-seok's directing style here. This was shown in both Misaeng and Signal but here in My Mister it is more prominent, that certain scenes and emotions within are so subtle that it is impossible to understand it through merely words (through recaps), you really have to watch the actual scene. Kudos to the actors and actresses as well, who have played those tiny emotions so well.
Overall, brilliant drama!

After Just Between Lovers ended, I didn't think I would find another story that could hit me right in the feels like this drama did, at least not that fast. I wasn't even sure I wanted to because it takes some time to recover from such an emotional ride.
But then I started My Ajusshi, which portrayed - once again - messed up characters and unbearing pasts, though in a very different way.
What is truly wonderful about this drama is the realistic way everyone is described. The point isn't to simplify or beautify, but rather to show us raw emotions. People in their weakest moments to understand how they're inclined to react differently or where their strengths and weaknesses are coming from. There is a darkness lying deep in each character, being intensified by equally gloomy environments, and that's what I love about it. The conflictual thoughts and desperate actions. The will to help and protect facing the sense of self-preservation. This is partly what human nature is made of, and it's good to be reminded of that once in a while.
The most faithful representation of this idea in this drama would be Kwang Il. The duality in this character made him one of my favorite protagonists in this show - maybe even of all dramas combined. He truly was a captivating character, conflicted between his old memories and his current situation. The way he found to cope with this duality was wrong in so many levels, and made me wonder even more what he could have been.
As the story goes on, we learn more and more about the characters, pieces of information being given to us progressively until, getting deeper into the story, we finally grasp the whole picture.
This is why IU has done such a great job portraying Lee Ji An. We knew very little about her in the beginning and her repulsive actions could have made her really dislikable. But somehow she managed to pique our interest. And there was so much more to this character than her cold demeanor. Constantly trying to push people away, she conveyed such strong emotions while maintaining her blank face, I could never understand it. Whether it be an attempt to appear strong or to hide the feelings or thoughts tormenting her, we could almost always see past the surface and perceive the purpose of her actions.

All the characters influence each other at one point or another, and the relationships forming are so complex that it wouldn't be right to try and put a label on it. Lee Ji An and Park Dong Hoon have had a rough start, but their strength is that they understand the other and recognize the purpose in each of their actions.
In the end we're left to feel like we've grown along with the protagonists, and it is one of the main reasons why I would recommend this drama. Well, along with the beautiful OST and the unique characters depicted.
This drama is definitely worth it.

My Ahjussi got me hooked since the first episode. It might not favor everyone’s taste, but it was one of the best drama I have ever seen. Perhaps you might be wondering what is appealing about to see the roughness and truth of life, but in this drama, it will lift and encourage you to choose a life according to your own definitions of living and happiness.

One of the strengths of this drama is the characters portrays each of the protagonists. The way the emotions and frustrations executed are all flawless. It was so deep that you will cry and sympathize with them. All the supporting characters steal some moment too, the sense of community and loyalty has been build up to make the story warm amidst the struggles.

The plot is so well-written, the story is consistent and unpredictable. The relationship between the two leads is extraordinary, nothing is overdone and offensive. The concepts of love, family, and marriage depict the sense of reality in a very delicate matter, and that’s what I really like about.

While watching this drama, I realized that my life is somehow far better to compare, and I am thankful for that. Yes, it’s okay to be lonely and pitiful, everyone has this dark hour of battle. And when we fall into the hard time sides of our life, let’s think, “it’s okay, it’s no big deal, hang in there until I’ll find comfort for myself.”

I tried so very hard to like it considering all the positive reviews.
I think it was definitely overhyped. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either in my opinion.
I won't go into details of the plot since I don't want to give away any spoilers but I just couldn't get into it.
It's hard on the darkside which I usually prefer but the whole thing just felt so miserable like everyone had just wasted their life.
But since most people seemed to like it I would still suggest giving it a try maybe it will be your cup of tea but it just wasn't mine.

This drama is one of the best series I have ever watched...regardless if it's Korean or not. Where do I start? The story itself is heartbreaking but in the way that sometimes real life is. The nuance performance by IU and Lee Sun-gyun deserve enough recognition to last a lifetime. I also especially enjoyed the storylines of the 3 brothers that fight and bicker but most importantly, love each other so much. I don't want to say too much but I wanted to write this review and encourage EVERYONE to watch this treasure of a story. You will thank me later!

First couple episodes are quite slow, but you'll regret not watching the whole series
Wow - what a turn around this drama was after a couple of slow episodes at the start! Acting and plot thickness was a delight to behold, the music was intense and gripping, the big-time production helping bind all the greatness together - what a drama!
I also like the originality of the characters, something you would find really rare when considering the normal personality traits that main characters show in a drama. Supporting characters are also great as you will definitely find some emotional attachment to them too.
Overall I strongly suggest you try this show out - 'My Mister' is an underrated gem.

Short: An absolute masterpiece. The pacing, the story, the cast, the music, the direction, the writing. Without any need for cliffhanger tricks, the story and the cast compel you to move to the next episode each time. Absolutely brilliant.

Detail:
This is the second drama i've seen with IU, the first being Hotel Del Luna - and the second of her dramas that's gone right to the top of my ""so glad I watched that"" list. It also introduced me to Lee Sun Kyun who was an excellent actor in this, he has such a unique bass to his voice.

Whereas in Hotel Del Luna, IU is loud, proud and a bit of a brat, in this she's quiet. She probably doesn't say as many words throughout the whole drama as she does in the first episode of HDL but she doesn't need to, she proves beyond any doubt her acting skill through her actions and expressions, combined with the amazing story.

Ji Ahn (IU) is downtrodden, she's in the gutter, when you're the lowest you can possibly go you learn to distrust and dislike everyone around you. Everyone has let you down, discarded you and hurt you in the past so you learn to expect it from everyone else. She's in trouble with a Loan Shark who beats her up, and she has a no-good brother that she supports. Worst case scenario.

And yet... she soldiers on. If there was ever a story about a strong woman then this is it. She's lost the will to trust others, but no matter what life throws at her she just keeps pushing on. She hasn't lost the will to live.

Dong-Hoon seems to have it all, high flying in the corporate world all he wants to do is a good job, to put safety first in his role as a structural engineer. Corporate politics come knocking and the knives come out in his direction, suddenly he's being attacked from all fronts and then finds out even more devastating news that rocks him to his core.

This story is about these two completely different, but equally broken people who find and heal each other.

There are other characters such as the two brothers, I loved the relationship the three of them had together, they were good moments in the story.

There were a couple of side plots that just seemed extraneous for the most part, the actor and the monk - the actor I guess I kinda get as a motivation for one of the brothers but the monk was just out of left field and I don't think the story would have really differed if it wasn't there, so it was a bit odd.

The music in this drama is excellent, several really top quality tracks that were good to hear each and every time they came on and were on my mind even when not watching.

The general tone of this one is quite slow, it has a mix of high and low points, but overall I found that I wasn't wondering how it was going to end. For me that's always a high mark for a drama, if the journey is so good I just don't care how it ends that's a great thing and I put this one in that list.

Highly recommended.

If I try to describe it in words this drama come from other earth , it's not like anything watching ever , Amazing acting .. Great Music .. Simple story with deep meanings dug deep into my heart ..

My Mister successfully touches on universal themes of brotherhood, friendship, perseverance, selflessness, accountability, forgiveness, acceptance, and letting go. The stellar supporting cast makes a frank exploration of these themes not just possible, but deep and poignant, adding to the already rich narrative. Much like adhering to strict building codes, these friends and family members resemble pillars which boost each other up in good times and bad

So somone plz give this show all the Korean Oscars known T__T
hope everyone start this drama without read any synopsis , just start watching and enjoy with everything in screen ❤

Oh my God. This drama transcends anything I've watched, and honestly, probably anything I will watch. Normally when I see reviews with perfect 10's across the board, I just think to myself that they're overly exaggerated, just blinded by some aspects of the drama, but right now, that's me. The pros so heavily outweigh the cons that even after 3 days since finishing the drama, I can still only see positives.

Story - The drama tells the story of an apathetic structural engineer and an impoverished young lady and the hardships that they face with their respective families. It takes you on a long and emotional journey depicting the bond that grows between the two main characters. At first, I thought it sounded kinda boring. I didn't think there would be anything special about the interaction of two different people, and I've never been so wrong in my life. In retrospect, the story can be said to be predictable, but this drama isn't about the twists and turn. Rather, it's about being human and overcoming life's obstacles which is something everyone can relate to.
Honestly, I don't cry often, but this drama made me bawl. Hard. I never thought I could feel this much emotion watching something. The writers get you hooked onto the depressed and broken character of Lee Ji-An to the point where you can completely and realistically feel her pain and absolutely empathize with her. Same goes for the character of Park Dong Hoon. They're just ordinary people, yet there's something so appealing and engaging about their stories, you can't help but be emotionally attached. The setting and cinematography were also so fitting and masterful. Some scenes and shots were truly gorgeous and breathtaking.
One small downside I can think of would be the interaction between one of Park Dong Hoon's brothers, Park Ki Hoon and an actress Choi Yoo-Ra. Even though they received a decent amount of screen time, I wasn't able to deeply connect with the two and could not find any substance to cling onto. Nonetheless, the extraordinary main story completely overshadows any dull plot points, making them really insignificant.

Acting - The chemistry between IU (Lee Ji An) and Lee Sun-Kyun (Park Dong Hoon) was heavenly. How could anyone come up with such a perfect pairing for these two roles? IU man. Lee Ji-Eun man. Saying she was perfect for this role is an understatement. I've been a long time fan but seeing how well she embraced this role heightens my respect for her. All her moments of silences in this drama spoke volumes. Her soft voice, her facial expressions, and her tears were all so heartrending. There was one scene towards the end where she said one line and I completely lost all ability to hold in my emotions.
Lee Sun-Kyun was a very fitting Ahjussi for this role. A reserved, intelligent and kind-hearted man who sparingly shows his emotions. When you do get a glimpse of his emotions, you can feel just how heavy his burdens are. What a fantastic character, and an even more fantastic actor.
All the supporting characters did an excellent job, but Song Sae Byuk played an unbelievable brother. Although, as I said before, I didn't really feel his chemistry with Kwon Nara, certain dialog exchanges between him and LSK were incredibly moving.
One character that I felt didn't give me the emotion I wanted at times was Lee Ji-Ah's character, Kang Yoon-Hee. Some emotions felt a little forced and unnatural, but given that her character was very tough to portray, she did well.

Music - There's not a single thing wrong with it. I don't know what else to say... Every piece fits so well, seamlessly into the drama and enhanced the already powerful emotion that the actors drew out. The main theme - ""Adult"" by Sondia truly captured the essence of the film. The lyrics were so deep and powerful and really brought the drama to another level.
Besides the main theme, a couple of other OST/BGMs really stood out to me. ""Feel Guilty"" by Jeon Se Jin is a dark, eerie and melancholy piece which, for a strange reason, really worked with those ""guilty"" scenes. ""My Family"" by Lee Yun Ji is a really heartwarming piece that contributed to a lot of the tears. It was played at just the right moments which killed me emotionally.

Some people are asking for a second season, but that is definitely a no from me. This drama ended perfectly. Like legitimately, perfectly. The last dialog and scene were perfect. I know I keep using the word perfect, but that's the closest word to my feelings. If there was a word better than perfect I would use it. I think it's always good to leave some room for interpretation and thought. I tried my best to describe this drama in words, but honestly, I can't do it enough justice. Even now, I'm still at a loss for words. My Mister is just a drama you have to watch for yourself. Really sit there and watch it. Remove yourself from reality and really place yourself into this world when you watch it. You will laugh and you will cry, but you won't regret it one bit.

Understated and thoughtful
I enjoyed the way in which this drama brought me on an exploration of internal human struggles in a mature way. From office politics to abusive relationships to just hanging on through daily struggles, it handled these issues with a quiet, understated, and thoughtful approach.

Lee Sun Kyun plays his upright but anxious white collar character with depth, and IU plays the struggling young secretary in a way that resists manipulating our heartstrings just for the sake of easy sympathy. I appreciate the writing and directing to this end, making it more realistic and a true exploration of the characters for their own sakes, not for the audience's sake. Some would call the execution of this show boring because of the lack of overt emotional manipulation, but if you watch closely, you get absorbed into the quiet struggles of each character. So you need to be in the mood for the pace and details in order to enjoy it.

One thing I loved about the show was the element of the supporting characters who meet at the community bar to drink together. Their collective nostalgia and comradery is used as a blanket to support each other, and they warmly adopt IU's Lee Ji Ahn into their circle. Despite their hardships, they care for each other with unspoken kindness.

This was a slower paced, detailed, and satisfying show. There is rewatch value here in which you could do detailed character studies and notice the way in which the dialogue shows character growth and personal insights.

The Best Ever Made
It cannot be overstated, how masterful the acting performances were in this drama. Each and every actor, no matter how large or small their role had moments where they moved me in some way. IU may as well have been Ji-an, she so perfectly embodied Ji-an’s misery and loneliness which eventually gave way to acceptance and peace. The way she let go of her unhappiness after Grandma’s funeral was so subtle yet so powerful, I had to stop and collect myself before I could go on watching. Jang Ki-yong as Kwang-il made a similarly deep impression on me, somehow making me care even for such a violent man, even if it was mostly to mourn for the loving person he could have been if he hadn't trapped himself in his unfortunate circumstances. And of course, Lee Sang-hyun, Lee Ji-ah, and the rest of this amazing cast gave what I would call performances of a lifetime, each bringing something special to the characters that made me fall in love with each and every one of them (Okay, maybe not Joon-young). But even he did a stellar job with his role.

It may seem overly dramatic to those who haven’t seen My Ajusshi, but I think that those of us who have been graced by this beautiful drama will understand when I say that this drama is a precious gift. It reminds us that what’s important in life isn’t material things, or appearances, or even whether we find perfect happiness. It’s the relationships we share with others, whatever shape they may take, and how we treat those around us that give our lives meaning. As Grandma said: “If you think about it, each and every interpersonal relationship is quite fascinating and precious. You must repay them. Live a happy life. That’s how you can repay the people in your life.” I don’t think it can be said any better than that.

If i could give it more than 10 i would. As a kdrama fan i never was touched more than this time. Couldn't imagine that i would be amazed by a drama about everyday life but at the end i was speechless. The beauty is in all the relationships in there, how fragile the emotions are and how sincere the acting is. At the beginning ist's hard to get the story but by the third episode it becomes all clear. The touch of darkness in the scenes is genuine and expresses the sadness. As the end approachs the scenes become more lightened which expresses that things are going better.

A beautiful healing story of kindred souls
This is the first drama or movie, in any language, that I started watching for the second time as soon as I finished it.

Normally I try to avoid dark, realistic, depressive story, especially ones with violence and infidelity. I started this months ago simply because of IU, who played Jang Man-Wol in Hotel del Luna. I couldn't get past half of the first episode, and switch to Crash Landing on You and It's OK to Not Be OK.

I continue My Mister and after the episode 4 I just couldn't stop. It made me cry, smile and laugh, both with compassion and happiness.

The production is great. PD really paid attention to every minute detail.

The Story is extraordinary, and like they said in the interview, it's not a love story, but a human story. It is anything but cliche.

All acting are excellent, from lead characters to all the supporting characters. The dynamic of three brothers, the similarity of lead characters and how they came to understood and healed each other as the story progress.

The visual effect is good, I like the makeups, costumes, and uses of traffic lights to indicate relationship status (not sure if that's intended).

OST are outstanding, particularly Adult (Grown Ups), Dear Moon, and An Ordinary Day. I don't understand Korean, so I have to get the translation and found the song ""Dear Moon"" so accurately describes Lee Ji-An's feeling for Park Dong Hoon.

The ending is very good. Yes it's an opening end which leaves the viewers to decide the real ending themselves.

To be honest, this is one of the best korean drama I've watched BUT I won't repeat watching it again.

The story, the cast and the soundtrack are great. I know that IU acts well and convincingly, but she did extra great in her role in this drama.

I won't watch it again because this drama is too heart-breaking to watch again. I'm so surprised I surpassed those heavy drama scenes. I cried myself like a baby even on those little scenes.

Please do watch this drama. You won't regret it.

""My mister"" is different from everything that I saw on dramaland until now. The layers of this story, built in each episode, take the audience to a deeper level of tension and expectations. So many things happen in one episode that makes you feel as if you're watching a whole movie. At the ending of episode one, I was fissured about what the hell would happen with Park Don Hoon and why Lee Ji Ahn seems so weird. With the following episodes, the story goes even more dark and strong. Guys, what a drama!

I will talk about the actors and I have to start with IU. As I said in the ""first impressions"", sometimes I have a little prejudice with idols that acts, but this woman makes my heart flutter with her performance and I think that was the best female acting that I saw in a drama until now. The personality, the devotion, the deep look on her eyes... Everything communicated about the character and makes us understand a little bit of Lee Ji Ahn and all her shadows. Lee Sun Kyun also did a great job as Park Dong Hoon! I could feel the kindness and peace in his expressions, but in the moments of anger, he just transformed himself. I the first blow-up of the character my mouth couldn't close, I was totally in chock. The chemistry between them both was amazing and made me sigh many times... Not in a romantic way, and I don't know how to explain, but I think that their relationship will communicate something different to each person that watches it.

I won't spoiler it, but I have to talk about the ending. Guys, I never cried like this since ""Goblin"". Don't take me wrong, this has nothing with ""Goblin"" and the reasons for my cry were pretty different here. Follow the development of each character and their relations made me cry realizing how life is full of changes and how one person can make your story totally different. I never realize this with so much strongness. The most powerful to me was the ending of Lee Kwang Il (Jang Ki Yong). I think that I never hated a character as I hated him. Every time that he shows on the screen, I was nauseated... But the conclusion... God! I cried like a baby realizing that I'm pretty fast to judge, but nobody does something without purpose or reason. We are products of the environment and, at the same time, we are totally responsible for our acts. As I said... This drama was a life lesson.

Just to say something that wasn't so amazing, I will talk about the relation between Choi Yoo Ra (Kwon Na Ra) and Park Gi Hoon (Song Sae Byuk). I just understand what was happening after the revelation on episode nine (I guess), but, after that, I just thought everything very weird with them. For me just didn't much sense. But after all explain, I started to love them.

So, this isn't a funny or soft drama, this is a drama for you who loves to immerse and to face heavy themes. I laughed, I cried a lot, and I think a lot about many things... For me, this is a chosen one for sure! (★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★) Do a favor to yourself and watch this with an open mind and heart, thinking about your life and the value of the things and people to you. You won't regret it!

See you soon!
XOXO, Mari.

My Mister greatly shown the reality of human condition. It tackles the existential life and social realism: poverty, office politics, abuse, familial issues, and communal interconnectedness. I was extremely impressed with this series' writing that it has become one of my few and ultimate KDrama favourites. My Mister was not a romantic love story, but it made me ponder of my own heart's state. To be human is something that is not easy to do nor understand; to love, as in for the sake of humanity and not of emotions, is a great thing, only after you know what it truly means. As I have told myself always, a person who loves with their feelings are never to be trusted.

I am in awe with how all the characters were created or personified; they were not flat and most importantly their personas and imperfections were not romanticized. They were all just outright human beings with interesting, but realistic back stories. Though, with the exception of Ji An's techie gamer friend, I wish that there was more background regarding his life.

Furthermore, what made this series even greater was that it's not meant to be emotionally happy neither unfortunately tragic (or perhaps that's just how I comprehended it). There was no sense of longing or nostalgia (I, personally, dislike regression, myself). This series was made for healing and closure and to remind all of us that there is nothing too tough for us, in our past nor in our present, to build a new beginning and a greater future. Everyone, let's keep moving forward.

While My Mister was on my to watch list for a very longtime, I decided to finally give it a go and I was happy I chose to do so. I have rarely watched a drama that was as good organized as this one in which two characters, who both hit rock bottom, live a life and due to bad circumstances are in touch with each other which develops into a lovely relationship in which both profit and cheer their life. The only thing I would've liked to see being developed more was the cause of the relationship between jung hee and gyum duk.

IU did a excellent job at her acting as usual, but I was positively surprised by Lee Sun Kyun, who did a thorough job as a sad, yet quiet person. The music was also of a very high level, so I would definitely recommend you all who did not watch it or are doubting to watch it, simply to watch it!

Love in Its Purest Form
I just finished watching this drama and am now in a state of post-drama blues. This drama shattered me emotionally. I cried and cried while watching the last few episodes.

It really does epitomise the most purest form of love. Love without definition. Love which is unconditional, where each party gives everything they have to keep one another safe, while expecting nothing in return. This kind of love isn't strictly romantic or platonic, but is a delicate balance of both. It's the kind of love that remains within social boundaries, and transcends it, all at the same time.

I place the relationship portrayed in this drama between Park Dong-hoon and Lee Ji-an among my favourite literary couples - Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy, Margaret Hale and John Thornton, Mister Stevens and Miss Kenton, Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. It saddens me that I cannot share my deep empathy for these characters with anyone I know in the real world, and it saddens me further than this kind of love is so rare in this day and age.

I hope these words find their way to someone who is considering watching this drama, and convinces them to take the leap. Highly, highly recommend. My favourite Kdrama yet!

Best Korean drama, hands down. It is very much a highly sensitive, raw, honest drama about vulnerability in human relationships. It's about humanity. And it's crafted to such a high quality and I just haven't seen the two together in a kdrama before.
The characters are written with such sensitivity and care. They are complex and are neither good nor bad, just as in real life nothing and no one is good or bad. IU's character is such a memorable character. She is strong in a natural and realistic way but also soft at the same time, in the most natural way. Park Dong Hoon is also unforgettable. There aren't many characters I can forget from this drama, and it's been a year or so since I've watched it. Their relationship is something I hope I will one day experience. It is so so precious. It is what humanity is about. No bullshit, just understanding, empathy, honesty, and most importantly vulnerability. Such a beautiful relationship.
I honestly could go on but I'm deciding not to, because I'm scared that in describing it I will oversimplify its weight and complexity.
I find it incredibly hard to get back into kdrama now because I can't help but compare anything else I watch to this, and I know that's silly because not everything has the same genre and themes but I think the show has changed me and my relationship with and taste in kdrama so much that I find it hard to watch the kind of (sorry-- just imo,) shit that comes out these days. It kind of makes me sad because I've been watching since a young age and used to be able to enjoy the superficial stuff but this drama (and a couple other good ones mind you) has honestly changed the kdrama scene for me, and probably for others.
""It's difficult to be around a person you saw so vulnerable.""
""Promise that you'll pretend you don't know if you find out about me . . . I'm scared.. I feel like you'll know without telling.""
""It's easy for people who live well to be a good person.""

[I see some commenting that the show is ""too heavy"" which, yes, it is definitely heavy, but what's interesting is that it does have this brutal honesty that I understand most will shy away from. Because entertainment predominantly exists for escapism and forgetting life's heaviness. Interesting though, because the sheer amount of those comments really says something about fiction vs reality, and how we turn to entertainment/fiction to seek ""something else"" in attempt to escape the mundanity and pain of life. (Margaret Atwood refers to this as wanting ""something to happen"" more than the ""breakfast"" of life in her speech, 'Spotty Handed Villainesses') Which is what this drama is shedding a light on. In my opinion, the best pieces of art hurts, confronts, shocks, shakes, and questions you and your beliefs.
“I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to."" (Franz Kafka)]

PLOT: This drama may be more on the slower side (even seem a bit boring at times), but it's SO worth to watch! It deals with questions like what is good and what is bad/evil and is there really just one or the other; it shows various forms of mental illnesses (especially how broad the spectrum of depression can be) and it has a beautiful moral, leaving you with a bittersweet but warm feeling in the end.
CHARACTERS: Deep characters which took me a while to become acquainted to - since it's not often you have such seemingly ordinary and almost plain (and due to that realistic!) protagonists in a drama - but soon I had them feels for almost all of them (even for the ones I didn't expect). And the acting is outstanding!
SCENERY: Dark and soothing and a bit repetitive. Paired with the nostalgic music, it gives you good old-school vibes.

Would recommend to someone who: is interested in ethical topics and wants to watch a drama to take something away for herself/himself. When you watch and listen closely, this story teaches you a lot!

A timeless masterpiece that I definitely recommend!
My Mister was truly a beautiful rendition of a time of melancholy, everyday life, and finding peace within ourselves as we go through life and cross paths and build relationships with those around us. I definitely recommend this drama regardless of what age you are. I'm currently 24 years old and the feeling of empathy and connections I made with this drama was truly healing and reflective. I know when I re-watch this drama again I will learn more and feel more. I hope that regardless of what obstacles we face and no matter how hard and hopeless life maybe let's cheer up and find the peace that will lead us to happiness. This drama was definitely a 10/10 the story, characters, fabulous cast/acting, and Slice of life of it all was truly genuine and poetic.

This drama is simply a masterpiece. The script is poetic and yet totally relatable. You will laugh, cry, grieve, heal, and just celebrate as each episode unfolds. And the characterization so solid and consistent it seems youve known the characters for decades. And the actors embodied them so well they just became the characters they portray. The musical score, set design, costumes, everything just helps tighten the story. And LSK's distinct voice just feeds into the storyline. This drama is made for him.

Simply put, this drama is a great work of art.

(Btw, it is highly recommended that you read discussions about this drama in forums like soompi so you will gain more info about minute details about this drama, that you may have just glossed over. You will be amazed by how much more interesting this drama is because of those imbedded details from one episode to another that ties everything up like chicken roast being prepared for Christmas. The tandem of this writer's piece and the director's vision and the actor's commitment to their roles seem to be a match made in heaven.)

This drama was so different...and I mean that n a good way. Every now and then I watch a drama that is not so romantic and funny (which are genres that I love). I usually enjoy them for a while and then drop them... when they get too boring. But this was different. I don't exactly know what it was but it drew me in from the first second (which is what most dramas do)... then is kept me watching. The relationship between the characters (even the soccer club) was beautiful. I cried soooo much. Honestly I took a while to watch this because many people mentioned it being dark and depressing... but to me is was so beautiful and I embraced the heartbreak because it made the characters stronger. As many have already mentioned, the love expressed between Ji An and her Ajusshi was just breathtaking and it made you cry. Whether it was a happy moment or a sad moment whenever they had a conversation I was crying.

I am just so happy to have found a drama to love, It's been a while.

I would say don't let the reviews about it being depressing turn you off. There is this hope that you get as you watch letting you know everything will be okay.

Very realistic, has moral lesson, story is so refreshing , new and not typical one. A series worth watching, not boring to watch. All characters fits their roles and make the story come to life. Support Characters and soundtracks are a plus as they enhance the emotions and feelings of every story line.

Comedy is on point, lead characters are perfectly fit in every role.

My Mister is the rare series that succeed on almost every level, where each character, scene, costume, and joke firing on all cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings.""

""Let's really be happy"" Park Dong Hoon
and therein lies the seeming simplicity of this drama, it's brilliantly executed and showcases the beauty and fragility of the human condition. This is a story about kindness, grace, love and finding the humanity in all people. The story is meticulously intentional and self aware, highlighting that for most people life is a constant balancing act between internal and external forces, and that our hearts don't move based on logic.

This is a story about a collection of broken people who are somehow not sad, but happy despite it all, soldiering on with the help of childhood friends, family and colleagues. This happiness doesn't apply to our male lead Park Dong Hoon however because he is someone labouring under the burden of his perpetual internal ennui which has become a part of his persona. So we journey with him to find happiness and contentment and it is his interactions with Lee Ji An which begin to thaw his heart and in return his kindness towards her helps her regain her humanity.

Dong Hoon's unconditional kindness to Ji An has a ripple effect which ends up positively affecting almost every character in the story. His elder brother Sang Hoon learns that being selfless is more rewarding than pandering to shallow ambitions and similarly, Kwang's perception of Ji An comes full circle.

My Mister is definitely not a romance story but it is a story about love, Dong Hoon and Ji An's love defies labels, it's not romantic or familial love, its much more than friendship, it's love in it's purest form where each recognises the other's essential humanity and responds to it. Their selfless consideration of each other is heartwarming and that's what makes this show so special.

The entire cast of this drama is excellent. I believe that this is IU's best performance of her career to date. Lee Sun Kyun's interpretation of Dong Hoon is contemplative, melancholy and ultimately triumphant in the pursuit of happiness and contentment, the smile on his face in the last scene of the drama is unforgettable.

The mood and world that this show creates is uniformly immersive and absorbing. The music, camera work, sounds, silence, and everything that makes up this story is well thought out and never misplaced. This is the first time I have actively looked for the score of a drama, you know those instrumental pieces that usually play in the background, yes those, I went and downloaded the entire score, it is that beautiful. The entire OST is a masterpiece and was used brilliantly.

There are very few dramas that I rewatch, and I usually wouldn't rewatch a drama of this genre, but My Mister defies this rule because as soon as I finished it I immediately wanted to rewatch it. I restrained myself and am now happily looking forward to the time when I can relish this show again.

The most deserved 10 out of 10.

Okay so I've mixed feelings about this one. I'm going to be totally honest even though I really want to just tell you how extraordinary it is. It's realistic, let's begin with that. It's not a romance, though. Then what is it? I'd say it's life. That simple.

''My Mister'' would probably be tagged as slow-paced, but I think it's more than that. Even if it's true that its pace isn't the fastest, things happen when they're bound to happen. They are not forced and that's really appreciated.
When I first started watching this drama I have to say I didn't like it that much. I thought, ''what's so extraordinary about watching some people just living?'' and I just dropped it. Months later I just couldn't stop thinking about restarting it; those people lifes had stuck with me for a long time telling me to keep watching, to see what happens next, and I did. Best decision in my life.

This drama is harsh. It portraits reality in such a beautiful but heart-breaking way it may blow your mind. I cried when it ended because every character was a part of me by then. How would I fill that empty space now? I simply didn't. Not a single drama has made me feel this way about their characters since I've finished it, and I have to say I've watched quite many. The atmosphere, the cinematography which isn't that marvelous but definitely felt like it was, the acting, the OST, the personal scenes of every character... everything together makes this drama what it is: a masterpiece. I'd never been so happy to watch something 'till the end and I've never missed a show this much ever.

Every character has its importance. All three brothers have really different lifes but they compliment each other so well. They are the best definition of brothers I have ever seen: together 'till the end even if they're all facing different struggles, fixing one another silently while drinking at Jung Hee's bar after work. Their acting is extremely good, too. You can see their pain even in their brightest moments. Differently from other dramas you don't need a sad background song to feel the pain; their eyes alone are enough. About IU's acting, some may differ, but she owned the role from the 1st second. Unlike what it may seem, portraying Ji An's character, a cold yet warm character who is constanly hurting and enduring, is a really hard work. Ji An is silent so IU has to show her feelings without words, only with body language and her eyes, and you can feel it. Ahjussi will always be Lee Sun Kyun. He owned this role, too. I just can't visualize anyone else.

I have to go back to the thing I enjoyed the most and which I can't speak enough of: its realness. ''My Ahjussi'' teached me a lot. While I was watching I wasn't feeling my best, and unlike what many people say, a happy and funny drama just wasn't what I was needing. I needed THIS and I'm so glad I found it. In the end, this drama teached me that no matter how hard life is, there's always hope; that you have to endure (Ahjussi) and hold on to what you have (Ji An's grandma); that happiness isn't something permanent (Sang Hoon) and that no matter how happy some people lifes may seem, you can't simply judge by what you see (Ki Hoon with Yoo Ra).

I'd just like to say this drama will stick to you forever. No matter how many dramas you watch, you'll never forget ''My Ahjussi'' and its characters. I could continue writing about without end but I guess you should go and start watching it now. I may go and re-watch it, too :)

perfect in every way!
Have been watching Kdramas for years but never felt the need to write about it.
This is a quiet but intense drama about people living their lives as best they can. Learning that there is more, that not everyone is out to get you; that if you give those around you a chance, they will come through and save the day. Every character is a story on to his/herself, while, at the same time, being part of the ever weaving tale.
The acting is superb, not a wasted word, a wasted motion still. so much is said with a nod, a turn of the head, a phrase not said.

Amazing, Amazing Amazing. What a story. So beautifully told and so meaningful. Finding one's heart, holding on to it and enduring are so critical to happiness. This story was about all of that. It was incredibly potent. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
The acting was spot on and the writing was seamless. What a beautiful piece of work. Congratulations and thank you to the creators of the story, the directors and the actors! Best combination and nothing left unanswered! Beautiful ending. Watching shows like this one gives one hope that there is good in this world. Ji An was scarred from a terrible childhood yet she, with the help of Manager Dong Hoon was able to rise above her terrible situation. I loved this one! Thank you, thank you!! Grateful!!!

i skipped a lot of scenes in each episode. it was a compelling and grounding drama. it wasn't overdramatic when it could have easily been. it's a drama that defied the drama genre in that the plot was dramatic, but not at all convoluted. it wasn't over the top and it never bordered on that. I think the female lead was rather bland. The male lead was strong! I saw him in Coffee Prince and the movie Parasite (2019). I saw this show after Parasite (2019). The actor has range.
He played his character really well. You could see his turmoil under his quiet demeanor. There were times where the actor had the potential to become melodramatic or underwhelming at times, but he did NOT! His acting is what makes this show strong.

The rest of the cast was ok. Chemistry was ok. The female lead was pretty bland. I saw IU in that Scarlet Lovers show. Her acting abilities did not improve. The role she plays here is the same role in Scarlet Lovers when that character becomes all sad. I think Park So Dam or Kim Go Eun would have added dimension to the female lead's characters.

not a re-watch.

My mister is an odd drama with an interesting, unique plot. The first two episodes were so confusing, that I had to put it off and actually concidere dropping it. Fortunatelly, I didn't. The plot grows thick and everything falls in place after episode three, when we get to see the characters, their struggles and their real personalities and figure out what everyone seeks for. Ji Ahn was a nice character. She was poor, and she had given up on escaping her situation any time soon. Her mister, the boss of her department where she works part time, seems a simple guy with family issues but eventually, everyone around him plot for his fall. All the characters of the drama were unique and interesting, though that actress was kind of annoying at some point. I also enjoyed the fact that the story didn't follow any romantic twist, but stayed true to its dark, slice of life focus. So, great performances, great story and great characters.

Possibly the best k-drama I have watched so far but it's actually quite difficult to write anything because ultimately this drama just left me speechless ...and satisfied.

I have nothing against the tried and tested formula of a romantic tale of love set against a backdrop of serial killers, hospital politics, school life, royal life in the Joseon dynasty, chaebols, vampires, gumihos, aliens, witches or time travel - but how refreshing it is to see a relationship based on purely caring about another human being.

The plot lines were all interesting enough to carry the characters through without relying on big dramatic moments, not that there wasn't any intense moments, but the series as a whole seemed to have an energy that reflected the reality of life. The relationships all felt authentic and for the most part, the backstories were believable.

One of the reasons I enjoy Korean dramas so much is the portrayal of emotion. Anger and grief can often come across as forced or over acted but the more sensitive moments reel you in completely and I often find myself thinking that if this same acting and emotion was in an American show, it would be an Emmy Award winner.

If you're looking for another love story with hopes for the gorgeous couple to walk down an isle together, there are plenty out there I'm sure you'll find what you need, however if you're interested in a tale of forgiving others, of forgiving yourself, of loyalty in love, of strength of moral fibre and perseverance against the tests of life, then I challenge you to be disappointed in this. I only wish I could watch it for the first time again.

Best. Drama. Ever.
It would be an understatement to say that I loved this drama. It's just...WOW.

Story:
I enjoy stories that explore the hardships of life, but it usually comes with the price of something being portrayed inaccurately or unrealistically. This is usually fine, but let's face it - sometimes you want a story that truly embraces the themes of reality: love, loyalty/disloyalty, honesty/dishonesty, true friendship, depression, loss, betrayal, poverty, overall humanity (or lack thereof) in someone, and so on, without the coat of sugar. This drama explored all of these so perfectly that I can't describe it. I was expecting at least one cliche or a predictable ending - but I didn't get any of those. And just as an aside here: the Psych. major part of me LOVED this, too.

Also, this is probably the first drama I've watched where I was heavily invested in the side stories. I was eager to know how they all ended - and I wasn't disappointed in the end.

I don't think I've ever cried so much over a drama.

Characters:
I'm not one to get super attached to characters, but my gosh I got attached to these so quickly! I even felt bad for characters I wouldn't usually care for, which is a difficult thing to achieve in a story for me. The backstories are unique and I felt like there was a twist to some of them that made them feel a bit original. Also the relationships/connections between characters are some of the best I've watched in a while and they really tug at the heart strings.

I always like to find that one extra favorite thing in dramas, and in this one it would have to be the relationship between the two leads. It's hard to find people who truly care about you in the way that is portrayed here. I like the beauty of it.

Acting:
No complaints!

Music:
Outstanding and emotional - one of the best drama OSTs

Wrap-up:
This turned out to be more of a thought piece than a thorough review, but hey some things are too extraordinary to explain. If you're putting off watching this, WATCH IT NOW.

this was a very slow-paced, slice of life drama. i like how its very realistically portrayed but it was too depressing for me. i usually can emphatise with the characters if i cant seem to relate with the characters, but this one was hard for me to imagine myself being in the characters’ shoes. idky and the fact that its a very slow drama to me makes it even harder sooo yea. but like its not every single scene, some scenes were so emotional and they touched my heart too. and the storyline was okay and it still made me wanna know what will happen to them but yea tulah not so many conflicts or things happening in the storyline, but its just same issue with diff problems hahah idk if that made sense but yea that was how it was to me. quite boring and i kinda had to push myself to watch the second half of this. i knoww a lot of people like this one, but it was just okay for me, no more.

Slow, almost depressing melodrama
I question the standard (moral and ethical) that this drama upholds. The wiretapping is an invasion of privacy but was justified by the story bec of the female lead’s intent (?). The male lead, a married man at that running after a young woman and allowing himself to be emotionally involved speaks of emotional adultery. And “failure”’is almost celebrated; yet the brothers are defensive about being failures - got confused there. And while not a justification for cheating, ‘family’ became a reason for marital problems, and this was just dismissed.

It truly moved me to tears at the end, because it was such a beautiful story and journey to go through. I 100% recommend this, without a doubt.

There is no need for more words so explain the greatness of this drama because it will do it injustice. Just watch it yourself and enjoy every minute of it while it lasts.

I would like to add that the acting was great, and the music especially brought out the exact emotion from me as it was expected to, which is something that one should always appreciate. There wasn't any unnecessary drama and it does not feel elongated at all; it was quite the contrary, you would want to stay going on for longer. The last words at the very end also console the watcher, pulling you into the depths of its story-line, making you an intrinsic part of its very core. It is very real and rooted in reality, making it a great watch because you can ultimately relate to it as a human-being and the moments where there would, in reality, be no music to mask the awkwardness or the tension, there isn't. It shows you real life in the surrealistic nature of a TV show. And at the very end, you truly feel happy for everyone, as though they are real people.

I know this might be too much but it truly touched my heart and I thank everyone who worked on this drama because it has made me happier than I have been in a long while.

There are great dramas, then there is ""My Ahjussi""
After finishing “My Ahjussi” (My Mister/나의 아저씨, 2018), I’m certain there are no words that can possibly do it justice, but I owe it to this absolute precious gift of a drama to at least try. First of all, I hesitate to even refer to My Ahjussi as a K-drama because it doesn’t feel like one; it’s more like a movie in 16 parts. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen and I agree with the K-drama sunbaes who say there may never be anything like it ever again. It’s that rare of a gem.

It took me a while to build up the courage to revisit this — I watched just three episodes a few months ago and paused — because I thought it might be too depressing. I’m glad I listened to my friends who said that despite its heaviness, it’s actually uplifting and satisfying. They were absolutely right: in my eyes, My Ahjussi is THE definition of a healing drama. Its message is simple, clear, and beautiful: that kindness has the transformative power to heal even the most wounded among us, that relationships are precious and amazing, that love in any form–even in ways that are hard to label or define—can help us get through the struggles of life.

Every aspect of this wonderful story came together beautifully to deliver that message: the thoughtful direction, the lighting which is a character on its own, the delicate OST, the insightful script, and the powerful, career-defining performances from its leads and supporting cast.

Lee Sun-kyun inhabited the character of Park Dong-hoon, a kind, upright, and compassionate structural engineer who quietly bears the burden of middle-age, with dignity and strength. Although he may be extraordinarily kind, he is no pushover and will not hesitate to defend those who need defending.

Lee Ji-eun (IU) is breathtaking as Lee Ji-an, a cold, hard, and cynical young girl who carries the weight of a “30,000 year old soul” in her diminutive frame. A temporary office worker at the same company as Dong-hoon, life’s unjust cruelty towards her keeps forcing her hand, driving her to cunningly manipulate people and situations in order to survive, regardless of who gets hurt.

I also grew attached to Dong-hoon’s family, especially his two brothers whose constant misfortune burdens their mother, and his tightly knit neighborhood community. All the characters are sad and broken in their own way, but the middle-aged antics and drama of his brothers and the rest of the Hugye ahjussis and ahjummas, their habit of ruminating over their troubles over soju, provide levity and comic relief. It never feels like you’re laughing at them, but with them.

I think what sets My Ahjussi apart from the rest is its realism, rawness, the melancholy that runs through it, its “flawless depiction of the human condition”-- in the words of Paulo Coelho. For those who are interested in Korean culture, look up “han” and “jeong” — two uniquely Korean concepts that are perfectly embodied here.

My only problem with My Ahjussi is that I’m afraid it’s going to ruin everything I watch from now on. I’m just going to have to keep reminding myself that it would be unfair to judge other shows by the impossibly high standards this has set — otherwise I won’t be able to enjoy anything else.

One of my greatest simple pleasures from the past months is getting personal messages from friends who’ve enjoyed the dramas they watched upon my recommendation. Because it brings me so much joy to share my happiness, I've made it my personal mission to get as many people as possible to watch this masterpiece, my new favorite show (not just Korean, but of any origin).

The Best Drama I've Seen So Far
I normally don't write reviews, but now I'm compelled to because of how amazing and breathtaking this drama was.
I'm glad I watched this drama after all this time. I found this drama awhile ago, but I never watched, it probably wouldn't have suited my tastes when I was younger. But, when I started watching it recently I was hooked. I binged watched it in a few days.

This is by far the most realistic show I've ever watched. Each character you can feel their emotions perfectly that's how good the writing and acting is. I never related to the main leads in a drama as much as I did in this one.

If I had to describe it briefly, it's about humans and their emotions.

The music is also fantastic, my favorite song from the OST being There's a Rainbow. With the rewatch value, I can see myself watching this again sometime which is huge for me since I rarely ever rewatch dramas.

I recommend that everyone gives this drama a chance. It's truly brilliant.

This review may contain spoilers
It took me a long time to come and watch this show. I knew it would be good so I wanted to give it the respect that it deserved by slowly watching it ,savouring every moment of it. This drama is a treat for the soul. It's so deep, nuanced and meaningfull that it has climbed on top of my favourite dramas if all time list .It has been a week since I finished it , and I wouod still think about this drama and tear up as a mix of emotions roll inside me. There are not enough words to describe how i feel about this drama but I'm gonna try.

One of a kind story of how two depressed leads find comfort and assurance in each other. Tagged as a non romance story,it was he most romantic non-romance i have ever watched. It was a romance of the soul for it didnt even need a touch to make it real. It felt real ,and that's all that was needed.

IU's depiction of JiAn who somehow survives everyday ,her despair ,her pain was so perfect ,it felt like she was born to do it,like she didnt even act,it was all so real. JiAn felt like someone walking in a deep dark tunnel without an end at sight,who is completely exhausted but must keep on going. In her smallest movements and in her eyes you could feel the struggle she has endured and her scars that she she keeps hidden with her silence.

Lee Sun Gyun as the ahjussi shined in his role as kind and gentle person who bears through life while being hurled into a cruel mix of betrayals and politics. At times it felt like all thats helping him keep his head above water is the knowledge that it would all be over someday and his brothers and friends who make it all more bearable.
The music is melancholy and sweet. Its bittersweet vibe goes well with the washed out and mesmerising cinematography .
The hardest part of this drama is to describe why watching two people struggle through life is so wonderful. Its wonderful because its not. Its real and thats where its true beauty is. If i could describe the vibe and mood , it is like sitting on an armchair,watching the fire burn and feeling warm,safe ,comfort ,almost happy even ,while a storm brews outside.
It is how some people bring a warmth and glow to each others lives simply by being there ,by listening and understanding in a world that is cold and harsh.
I cried as much for the charachters as i did for myself as their warmth comforted my lonely heart just as they comforted each other.
Please give this gem of a drama a chance . Its beautifully captivating and heartwarming.

Rewarding drama with an incredibly moving soundtrack
This drama has been on my radar since it first released but I put it off for 2 years. Why? I couldn't get past the first episode where we first get a glimpse of Ji-Ahn's miserable life - her getting her grandma home by pushing a hospital bed through the streets in the dead of night because she couldn't afford the nursing home bills. It was too unbearable to sit through and I much preferred bubbly happy dramas to help me escape from my own reality.

Now that I've finally gotten round to watching it, I'm finding that a big part of what makes this drama beautiful. It tells life like it is - it doesn't sweep the shitty parts under the carpet and gloss over it with positivity. It's a drama that shows you life can be made beautiful by the people and relationships you have in your life; a rewarding drama full of life lessons if you're ready to receive them... with an incredibly moving soundtrack to boot.

One of the best
It's all been said already, this show is a masterpiece. Yes it has IU in a standard sad-girl trope but never is it done with this level of grit. Nor does the sad girl suddenly turn into a vanilla princess completely helpless without a man to save her. She stays true to character throughout, finally! Sound track is great, especially the Sondia tracks. Dark, moody, violent at times, sad for sure, but played beautifully by both leads as well as the supporting cast. Credit to the writers/production for staying true to a vision from beginning to end.

A Masterpiece
Originally, I had put this on my watch list because of IU. I had no idea what it would really be about as the description I read didn't sell it as something great. The poster for the drama is also quite deceiving as well. I also had really no expectations of the acting as generally most people who are singers are not great actors. I can see why people say this was IU's best performance. Though her character doesn't speak a ton of lines, but when she does, it's blunt, cold, and of few words, but you can feel every emotion portrayed by her words and actions. I never cry when I watch dramas, in fact, the last time I cried in real life was at a funeral, but there were so many scenes towards the end that made me well up in tears.

I finished it over the course of two days and I can say it's by far the greatest drama I've seen ever. It'll be very hard for anything to top this for me. The plot is not cliche like many other dramas out there and while it might not be for everyone's tastes, I'd say it's a shame if you didn't watch this if you're a fan of dramas as a whole. The music is also great and really enhances the emotions behind some of the scenes.

This is a drama that depicts two people at rock bottom in their lives who find comfort and healing after meeting each other. A story of everyone on the verge of having nothing to redemption in their own way. It shows you what empathy means.

Rather than focusing on the relationships between the leads as most people normally like to do, we should look at the overarching message this drama is trying to send...to find happiness. We have Park Dong Hoon on one side where he seemingly has a pretty decent life with a stable job, money, and family and in contrast we have Lee Ji An who has no stable job, no money, and no immediate family other than her grandmother. When you have money, it's not a problem you worry about, but when you have no money, it's all of your problems. There are many people in this world who can relate to both these characters, if not maybe some of the supporting characters, and their situations they portray in the drama.

Yes, this drama moves slowly at times, so it depends on the kind of drama you like to watch. If you're someone who loves the slice-of-life type show that lingers on moments of reality, then this could be your type of show.

I started this show because the director is behind two of my favourite dramas of all time, Misaeng and Signal. I loved those dramas because of the realistic way in which they depicted human relationships, and My Mister is no exception.

This drama features a lot of stories around loss, as well as the aftermath and how different characters cope with loss. All of the characters felt relatable in the ways that they dealt with loss. As I mentioned earlier, this isn't one of those dramas filled with thrilling moments of action. Certainly the corporate drama has some tense moments, but at no point did the drama fall into the trap of using overdramatic cliches to drive the story along, despite having some familiar elements (the ones you may expect in a typical corporate drama, where characters are vying for higher positions). The ending was appropriate and realistic.

In terms of the main characters, I have to commend Lee Sun Gyun and IU for playing their roles well. Their relationship is likely my favourite platonic relationship in all of drama land, in that it really highlights how each character grows with the relationship. It is certainly not one without imperfections and power imbalances, but I was never disappointed in the direction the drama went with these characters.

The family and friends are a really lovable crew when it comes to supporting one another, and they make the drama a heartwarming one to watch. Like any family relationship, the brothers have their ups and downs, and they have their likeable and unlikeable moments as well. By the end of the drama, I was left with an appreciation for the different character dynamics and how they came to be who they are now in the current timeframe, in which we get a glimpse into the lives of their small community. My only complaint is that the workers at the company are more two-dimensional. (But then again, if you're looking for a really good drama focused on company workers, there's Misaeng.)

Music choice was also well done.

Overall, I would strongly recommend this drama if you're a fan of this director's previous works and are looking for a drama that really does a good job in depicting the nature of human relationships. It was at times very serious, but also heartwarming.

If you're looking for something lighthearted, a romance drama, or something filled with exciting action, I would give this one a pass.

I didn't think that a drama can give me hangovers . It's been almost an year since I finished this drama but yet to get over with it. A lot of things made me hesitated to watch this one . The main reason was Lee Sun Gyun as I haven't heard about him before. Well, after watching this drama, he became one of my favourite actor in Korea, along with his voice.
I didn't knew that platonic love would give me so much pleasure and this one was so memorable and heart wrenching that no other drama could give. Watched over a hundred dramas and still nothing could come close to this beauty. IU is ❤️. She is a baby faced assassin. Her performance one of the best by a female lead actor I have seen in kdrama.
Whenever a scene is played along with the OST 'There is a Rainbow', I goes deep into my heart . Sondia is beautiful as well but my favourite is the former. I have been hearing this OST over an year and it still doesn't bore me.
Every charater has their own identity and the actors portrayed it in the best way they could.
This is a must watch drama as I think this is one of the best if not the best .

A beautiful story that will break, mend and break again your heart
There are only a handful of shows on here that I've rated as 9, and only one that I've rated above that. My Mister easily stands as one of the best shows I've watched, and not simply in the Kdrama genre.

This is a show that combines beautiful storytelling with terrific acting from IU and Lee Sun Gyun. My Mister is a powerful tale that is essentially about family, both when caught in its trappings, and when it acts as a safety net. The two main characters embody this: one who is burdened with a big family that provides him with a constant presence of comfort and love, yet masks its own fractures and pains. The other is a young woman burdened by the absence of one, abandoned by her mother, forced to look after her deaf and ailing grandmother by herself. The rarity of human warmth and kindness makes it devastating to watch when she tries to process Lee Sun Gyun's character displaying kindness without an ulterior motive. To say that these two have chemistry feels insufficient to explain how they decorate the show like a painter crafting on a canvass. They paint the show with a deep myriad of emotions that ranges from heartbreaking sadness, laughter and an underlying longing for something more. My Mister is a story that subliminally speaks of the importance of human connections, and the little yet utterly transformative imprints it can invariably leave on someone.

The show is rich with a tangible and tragic sense of quiet despair undercutting our lead characters. Both are grappling with the overwhelming realisation that this is life and it is not enough for them, but rather dysfunctional to the point of slowly disintegrating them where they exist in the company of others but only really come alive when with each other. They fear the possibility of hope for a better future but desperately crave it. The sense of oppressive depression that emanates particularly from IU's Lee Ji-An is palpable. This is a woman who is, figuratively speaking, dying slowly, day by day.

IU's acting is peerless and she delivers a breathtaking quality to her character, a morally ambiguous young woman whose actions are reactive, born from the need to survive and protect her grandmother. There are these small little moments that the show litters throughout that illustrate just how abandoned she has been, how badly she has needed a helping hand during her life, and never had it until she met Park Dong-Hoon. And from telling him early on that she isn't at all curious about his life, her days and evenings slowly revolve around being close to him in his intimate moments, however unethically. She finds something in this that goes beyond a job. This was beautifully written and wonderfully acted.

Lee Sun Gyun is also terrific in his role. I thought his character was sometimes too much of a martyr but his desire to keep peace and pretend everything is all right is a realistic portrayal of people who cannot confront their problems and admit things that are too difficult because of how it will unravel their lives. The show depicts this very well. Park Dong-Hoon prefers peace over conflict but often at the expense of his own sanity.

If I had any issues with the show, it would probably have been around the side characters. Park Dong-Hoon's family, especially his brothers, take up an awful lot of screentime and whilst they are likeable characters, they're not nearly as interesting as IU's character. Sometimes I found myself just waiting for their scenes to end just so we could get to moments with Lee Ji-An and or Park Dong-Hoon.

I would absolutely recommend this show, but be prepared for its emotional heaviness. There aren't many shows that are remotely comparable to My Mister.

Good drama..worth watch
One of the best korean drama I watched recently....It starts slow phase and slow scenes..I thought to drop after 2 episodes but once you get into the characters you will definitely start loving it mainly ""Lee Jin An (IU)"" character she killed her acting mainly when she runs to restaurant and to the bridge both scenes were my favorite.Even after the end of the episodes still thinking about her character... and in final episode when park dong hoon cried I almost cried and it's painful to watch him crying.. finally it's definitely worth watching drama don't miss this...

This drama is about healing and finding solace even if it’s two different age groups.
I think the last drama that made me cry this much was uncontrollably fond. The storyline of the drama is extremely hard to pull of and only a few set of people could tell this story. This cast did an amazing job and I can see why it won a lot of awards and had a lot of recognition. I always look foward to the performances and the screenplay the official soundtrack and the directing. But I got lost in the relationships portrayed in this drama. It gave so much comfort to see not just a family but a neighborhood be so warm and welcoming, not only between the two main characters but with the people surrounding them. A lot of dramas tend to shift from the importance of connection between the leads and their supporting roles and tend to dwell on the things happening around them forgetting the real story of their relationships, but this performance was so deeply connected and given to the audience in such a raw way. Presented in reality, this drama showed the issues that go on in people’s lives and it felt so real, their pain felt so real. They tried their best to pour out the deepest of their emotions and allow the audience to be drowned in it. Everything about this drama is wonderful. A big hand to the actors for their surreal performance I think it’s one of the best melodramas yet. This drama focuses on healing real healing and I loved the fact that the relationship between the two leads was on that line of romantic and yet platonic it’s so hard to find dramas that not only focuses on the chemistry but in the friendship built with love .I could say so much more but that might take away time from you starting this drama! just watch it and appreciate these performances. The first 3 episodes might not appeal to a general crowd but the real essence and treasure is in the latter. Enjoy.

The best thing about My Mister is its character driven plot which alternates between nail biting suspense and quiet scenes depicting the tenuous and deep connections between its characters. Ji An, a down and out young woman, involves Dong Hoon, her unwaveringly decent and morose boss, into a precarious situation of intrigue and brutality.

The pacing is varied. Many scenes feel overly drawn out, but each episode manages to move the plot forward in unpredictable fits and starts. It is well acted throughout. Some of the side characters bothered me - particularly the female characters, Jung Hee the bar owner and Yoo Ra the actress. They are so over the top pathetic, it's annoying. They take up too much screen time.

Its actually a little surprising to me that I watched this drama all the way through because its not really my taste. There is an oppressing bleakness that permeates everything in this drama - literally shading their world a dismal bluish gray in most every scene. Everyone is having a hard time here - the young, the old, the rich, the poor, the good, the bad, the successful, the defeated. Basically the overall message is that it sucks to be human. At times this message feels pretty heavy handed. There are several too many monologues about the bitterness of life by its many characters. But quality storytelling and character development win out and this drama drew me into its dreary world from the first episode.

Sympathizing with these characters, often stirred up my own feelings of fear and inadequacy that sometimes keep me up at night. Don't watch this if you are looking for a feel good show or are having anxiety in your own life. But I couldn't help being drawn in and hoping that these characters would eventually find some solace or maybe even happiness in their connections with each other.

THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF QUALITY DRAMA I'VE WATCHED SO FAR,

The story is so good. The characters are really good. IU really have improved I lot, I've always loved her.
I can definitely vouch for the interesting storyline. Tho not bias since I also work for an engineering company, but the development of the leads are what's the word? Profound? I just love how the story developed and especially the resolution. The ending is satisfying. My top annoyance on potential very good dramas is one, the ending. Haha but this drama pulled it off so well.

It was such a great show but they ruined it so badly in last 4 episodes that I wont reccomend it to anybody who loves cinema.
Story- 10/10 I am giving 10 because main heart of the story was mid life crisis and all other mental problems faced by middle class adults of all ages. It was frighteningly real. I will not go into romance part bcoz I will not even consider it in actual story.
Writer - (7/10) Park Hae-Young wrote such a wonderful script but in order to write a romance she ended up ruining it. It could have been a perfect masterpiece but it felt short of it bcoz of Romance. Writer lost her sense of purpose in last 4 episodes. In first episode it has been clearly said that without romance drama couldn't be successful thats why they included woman in the drama and it actually felt like it, romance was the most unnecessary part of this drama and that's what ruined the last 4 episodes. They could have easily skipped the romance part and presented as normal healing relation bw boss and employee. I will deduct 3 points out of her work because I feel like she forcefully added romance to make it a hit, either she was forced or decided to earn money by sacrificing a great story. She is such a big writer she could have easily held her ground and would have decided against it but she didn't.
Camera work: (5/10 ) Camera work for such a great drama was not upto standard, felt like somebody has employed novice to the work. In the first five minutes of drama they chose shaky effect but it was so shaky that I felt dizzy and in later episodes it was quite lacking too. In one of the episodes where ML enrters in the restaurant to meet his ex director, just when he opens the door, his face is covered with foggy apearance and not clear bcoz of shitty camera work. Effect chosen for the Drama are of some1 who is new to effects.
Director- I didn't find much of reason to criticise the direction, director pretty much held the drama together.
OST- 10/10. I have not found a single drama where IU has acted and OST want good. Every IU drama makes me wanna search for OST.
Acting-7.5/10 Although Acting was decent on everybody's part but some stalwarts like Park Ho-san seriously failed to give his best, he is such a good actor but I felt like he never really felt like acting in the Drama hence he decided not to put his heart into it. This drama made good actors look bad. And dont let me start on actress Lee Ji-Ah, her acting never looked good in front of great actors. I dont get it who decided to emply her for the role.
Makeup artists, Costume designer- (4/10) in last 4 episodes it felt like even they have given up on drama. They dressed the ML so badly in last 4 episodes that it felt like ML has changed to some other actor. To make IU look too miserable, they chose a makeup that would look good on a person who has been forzen in ice, I mean what's up with too much red undereyes.
Apart from that a great story depicting the realistic lifestyle of Korean middle aged men, Hardships in life faced by both young people who didnt get to meet right persons in their childhood and Hardships faced by adults even after trying living their life the way society expects them to be.

This drama says the real meaning of this sentence : the true love is when he loves you while you don't even love yourself !
Indeed, if someone has a man like Park Dong Hoon in her life, will never be hopeless in life !
But I thought Kang Yoon Hee should will get a bad luck in her life cause of the treason... It's not justice to continues to life like nothing happens !
And about IU, this cute girl i've to say, she is perfect ! But i think she could use more feelings in her character as any person !
Overall, it's one of the most amazing dramas I've ever seen ! <3

I don't know how to react to this drama. Surely, the cast is great. The acting is also superb. The story is very unique...but sometimes too unique.
I don't like how unclear the ML feelings for FL, if there's any. Like I know he's just too decent and kind, but sometimes his actions lead me to believe he indeed fell for the FL. Other side characters also affirm to my thoughts but he never did put blatant actions to pursue her... and that ending too. It's fine if they didn't went to that romantic sides too but at least be clear.
It's nice to watch it but I won't probably rewatch it. It's just too painful that my soul is still feeling the pain.

I was always wondering how this drama could have the highest rating here since it is a melo and not many love this genre, yet somehow this drama managed to win the hearts of many. How? I've put this drama on-hold for many months and finally decided to give it a try yesterday. As like my previous two times of trying to watch it, I was ready to drop it within the first ten minutes. The drama seemed too dull, depressing and the cinematography also gave me that stressful feeling. But I forced myself to continue as I loved the actors of the leads.

I've watched the main lead before in coffee prince and 'My wife is having an affair this week' and the female lead was an amazing actress despite her young age of just 25. She has received many criticisms for being an idol actress but her acting is far superior than many veterans I've seen. She managed to deliver her lines and portray the characters in her previous dramas: ""The best lee soon shin"", ""The producers"" and the best of them all: ""Scarlet heart"". She always managed to capture my attention regardless of whether she was the female lead or not. I was a bit hesitant when I heard she was playing a depressing, mature and witty role this time as I was so used to her cheerful characters in the above mentioned dramas, but she really proved herself to be a versatile actress in this drama, one I'm really looking forward to seeing in future dramas :)

Anyways, once i got to the middle of the episode, I was totally glued to my screen and unable to divert my attention elsewhere. The cinematography, the A-list actors, the story, the characters, everything made me fall in love with this drama. And before I knew it, i had already reached the end of the episode and was once again awestruck by IU's acting and found myself clicking the next episode, and the next, and the next, till I had already reached the end. The ending was also perfect for me.

The chemistry between the leads was also surprisingly good. I thought it would be difficult to show romance since ML is already married and FL is too young but man, their actions, expressions and their eyes when they look at each other were enough to tell me how they feel for each other. No words were needed. Now, this is what I call amazing acting skills!

A must watch for all K-drama lovers, regardless of whether you like this type of drama or not. Just watch at least until episode 2. If it still doesn't catch your interest, then just move on to another drama.

My Mister was the most realistic and moving drama I've ever watched. There's no glamour, the characters are all sad in their own way, the mood is subdued, the colors are dark, the music melancholy, it's slow, and nothing much happens. Yet, My Mister turns all of these things in to positives, into strengths. If you are not someone who can handle slow dramas with no action then this is not the show for you. However, if you are the type of person who desperately wants to feel with your whole soul the very essence of what it is to live then this drama is perfect.

Though each character is pitiable in their turn they all have human faults and strengths. Each is relatable not because you can see yourself in them but because you can recognize their humanity. It was incredibly slow at first and difficult to commit to for that reason. It is also not a drama to be binge watched. Instead My Mister should be taken slowly so that it can seep into your skin and down to your heart. But if you can get passed that it is worth every minute of your time. You may ask what is so captivating about two brothers running a cleaning business, a poor girl harassed by debtors, a cheating wife, or a middle aged salaryman and I would answer that it is their humanity. This drama so perfectly captures the human condition that it at times frightened me with its understanding. I cried so many times over this drama. It moved me in a way only the best novels have ever done before.

Don't let your misconceptions about the age gap blind you. This is not a romance. It is simply about people. People struggling to live and being forced to keep going no matter how much it hurts. And it was beautiful.

The most boring drama ever saw
I watch 50+ drama in this years and My Mister was TOTALLY the worst. Maybe The School Nurse Files was worst, but no problem. I was convinced by the high votes given to this drama. The overall rate is totally FAKE. I love IU but i cannot understand why her fans give to this boring drama the highest vote.
The cast is very good. IU is outstandind. But the story is so low, the brother history is so boring. I thoght to drop it but I kept tough.
I suggest to not to see this drama. Really. The myDramaList rates can be study only on drama with no IDOL in their cast.

""You're Nice"".
There was something profoundly heartfelt about My Mister. This is a drama - a true drama - about pitiful people for pitiful people. Our main characters are essentially losers, outcasts, jokes amongst their peers. However we learn vital lessons through their actions, we hear healing stories as well as heartbreaking ones.

Park Dong Hoon is the man everyone wants to be while also being the man no one wants to be. No one is more genuine and honest than Dong Hoo, but that affects his life in a huge way. No set of brothers are so close to each other that when one is sad, they are all upset by proxy and feel guilt at any form of happiness. That bond is unbreakable. And thus, this affects his home life with his wife feeling isolated, lonely and, herself, an outcast. Of course, this leads to her being unfaithful with one of the few people Dong Hoon dislikes. But My Mister is so much more than a story about infidelity. It's about the hardships of life. Nothing is more evident than his relationship with a subordinate, Lee Ji-Ah. A broken person who is stuck in a life of debt, pain and frustration. Lee Ji-Ah spy's on Dong Hoon because of the affair under the orders of CEO Do Jun-Yeong, who is sleeping with Kang Yui-hi, Dong Hee’s wife however she develops love for Dong Hee in the process and begins to help him in this struggle. Is My Mister about romance? No, but there is a clear returned love between the two characters, as shown through dialogue and visual storytelling in Dong Hee’s case. But again, there is a maturity to the relationships as well. My Mister is so multi-layered in that regard. Outside of our main story of lust and politics, there is the comonardary with the brothers and the neighbours friends of Dong Hee. And the subsequent stories that are splintered off and are given just as much meaning and purpose to the story as Dong Hee’s climb to the top. There were so many characters, so many plots that were quite frankly perfectly executed and mapped out flawlessly.

Every episode felt like a movie in itself. There was a long run time with each episode which was risky because it can feel long winded. However the lengthy time run only made me feel more immersed in the story. It made me feel a part of everything. When it was sad, I felt it. When it was happy, I was happy. My Mister played with your emotions. And that was thanks to the immaculate performances from each character. IU and Lee Sun Kyun especially. Kim Young Min as Jun-Yeong as well. It's difficult to pick out certain people because this was truly a team effort.

My Mister was very sentimental, sad and euphoric at the same time.

Must See
Several months after My Mister came out in 2018, it showed up on one of my Asian drama streaming apps. I should've watched it then, but I didn't. When it recently showed up on Netflix, I watched it right away. The timing was perfect. I absolutely devoured it, binge watched the entire thing. Easy to understand why it won best drama 2018. Moving, touching, sentimental, maddening at times, and always tugging at my heart. Very well done. The ending is also beautifully done. Intentionally enigmatic and rightfully so. It's the kind of ending the viewer brings their own emotions into account..., imagining the next step to be whatever suits your sensibilities. To answer some inquiries about 'do they love each other?'..., of course they do. Love is not limited to social constructs of dating, sex, or even marriage. They absolutely love each other, but without feeling compelled to make it anything else. Deeply caring for another person, wanting their happiness, wanting what's best for them, is love. And so well played in an amazing drama. I'm not given to cry much, or even tear up..., but I did both..., and often with My Mister. Great job, Director Kim Won-seok. Great job, IU, Lee Sun Gyun, and the entire, fantastic cast. Khamsa Hamnida.

I am not sure if I was the only one, but I was crying at the end. I didn't know why until I realized I was happy crying. I also finally understood what Dong Hoon and Ji Ahn relationship was and was happy for both of them! They loved one another and not in a romantic way, maybe in the future but as friends.

the feelings conveyed in this drama deeply touched my heart. we all have different experiences but we share similar feelings of and understand too well the emotions of human suffering, pain, loneliness.. this was a very comforting drama. i loved many scenes but one scene that comes to mind at the moment is the ending...when the waters calm and the storm clears. i also hope to reach that place where the sea sleeps.

love, empathy, vulnerability, resilience..

FL is an outstanding character; her resiliency is inspiring. i really appreciate ML's presence and the comfort he brought. their relationship remains very dear to my heart. i loved the way it developed and changed and grew. and tho the relationship wasn't necessarily a romantic kind of love, i personally accepted the hint of romance at the end.

also, i grew to...not love..but feel a bit affectionately towards the character that collected her debt (I'm bad with names lol). if only the adults around younger FL and him were kinder and more understanding, things could've been different. none of his actions were excusable and I'm not trying to romanticize his character but i feel sad that a lot of this could've been prevented. I'm glad the writers gave his heart some peace at the end.

thanks to the old cleaning guy and the grandma.....thanks for showing FL kindness and love. thanks to ML's friend who owns the bar, and thanks to the support system surrounding ML (tho i didn't quite like the whole aggressive masculine thing going on with the men..lol sigh)

i said i wouldn't write a lot but here i am lolll anyway,,, thank you to IU and Lee SunKyun for bringing their characters to life. their performance with the story gave me some comfort and kept me company. tbh I'm left speechless bc I'm so touched haha

*i would've given this drama 10 stars if not for the glorification of the drinking culture and i also didn't appreciate several aspects of the family/gender dynamics depicted. usually i can overlook these things but they hit closer to home so i couldn’t bear to give it the remaining 0.5 oops

**also, while I'm at it, here's a few things from the top of my head that i want to mention (these aren't reflected in my rating bc i can overlook all this in dramaland lol). i wish we were given more backstory to FL's ""best friend"". i wanted to like him more, i really did, but i couldn't bc i didn't know enough about him. i also wanted the writers to show more empathy towards ML's wife. i don't justify her cheating on him but i do empathize with the pain and loneliness she felt. honestly i skipped some of the scenes with the monk friend and i skipped most of the scenes with the celebrity friend and the ex-assistant director brother.

I've come across this drama many times, and for some reason, I always put it off. Maybe I needed a good enough reason/review to watch it? Maybe I needed to be strapped down to a chair and held against my will just for the first episode, and then after, be given the choice to cotinine voluntarily? Who knows. But I did watch it. Willingly, if I may add. So here's what I'll say to you, WATCH IT ! To put it blankly, it's a weird one. A drama that will have your head FIGURATIVELY spinning with so many questions, comments (cough, cough), and emotions, but in the best non-nauseating way! All of the characters will leave an imprint in your existence, whether you forget it is up to you, but the two main characters will probably leave the most impactful influence. It's been two days since and I still think about Ji An and Dong Hoon and the other fabulous characters we were gracious enough to meet. If you want a quality drama that will leave you with a better understanding/sympathy for humanity and existence, give this one a try.

Wholesome. Comforting. Heartbreaking.
This drama will forever hold a very special place in my heart. Some will argue that it's slow paced, but I believe that's what the drama needed. The range of emotions portrayed in this will take you places.. The heart-breaking back stories and the hardships that are so real and rawly portrayed was beautiful to me.
I never thought I'd enjoy watching a bunch of ajjussi's living a very mundane life after failing to meet society's expectations, but to my surprise it was so heartwarming, cozy and... comforting?
The dialogues were so well written, the soundtrack was perfect (I'll probably always feel a pang in my heart whenever I listen to it) and the acting!! You just see what the characters are going through without them having to say anything, and you feel it deep deep down.
I loved this drama so much. I just finished it and so my thoughts are all over the place (as you can see from how disorganized this review is) and I've never bothered to write a review before because everyone else pretty sums up how I feel about every other drama I love. This one is no exception either, but I really wanted to leave a review here because this drama... well I don't know if it took something from me or added more to me.. I just love it.
It's been so long since a drama made me cry and cheer so hard for the characters. And just how relatable their feelings were is beyond me.
I don't care if I'm the only one in the world who loves it or feels this way about it. All I care for is that such a drama exists.

I didn't give the rewatch value a 10 only because some things are so precious when you watch them for the first time that a second watch won't be as awesome (I wish it would be though)

wahhhh...by far the BEST drama I have watched...it was a nice way to end my kdrama 2018 journey. The writer deserves recognition and the cast was superb! IU was phenomenal in this and I think she should continue her acting career because she is so talented. The cast had perfect chemistry! At first, I laughed at the concept of this drama but for some reason, I just decided to watch it. I always find the dramas that I overlook and revisit several times turn out to be THE BEST!!! I highly recommend. I cried, laughed and truly learned so much through the story. It really made me reflect upon my own life and to be thankful. These kinds of life lesson dramas are what make KDRAMAS totally worth it to watch. I ditched the Western dramas because they are all garbage and they make everything so dirty and perverted and they all have no substance or value. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!!!! You will be captured by the first until the last episode!

A Masterpiece, but a few complaints on the characters
This is my first time writing a review and I created an account just for this as well. I was having such a huge k-drama burnout but this drama really helped me get back to it. This is literally such a masterpiece, at first I read the summary and it sounded so boring but after reading a few reviews, I decided to give it a watch and it did not disappoint me at all! I have never cried this much and been this invested in a drama.

However, I have a few small complaints that doesn't matter much but I just wanna rent about it a little. I feel like they could have added more character development and backstory to many side characters. Personally I actually felt pretty bad for the characters that were perceived on the ""mean"" side in the drama.


(Spoiler - just my personal rent about this)
I honestly wanted to get to know the wife, the CEO and the mean guy who kept beating IU's character more (sorry i'm extremely bad with names). I feel like the more I watched the more I pitied the wife more. So many people are gonna disagree with me here and im so sorry to say this, but I kinda understand why she was having an affair, the main lead guy is also kinda at fault. I mean he wasn't that great of a husband either and barely talks to his wife. They kept talking about how trash the CEO was, and maybe that's just from my own perspective on things, but I didn't really see anything super wrong or bad with him. He just seemed like an adult who hasn't grown up mentally yet, like a kid's mind in an adult world. Lastly, the ""abuser"" ill call him. His story actually made me really sad honestly, he never learnt how to express his feelings, mostly because of his abusive dad, so he just kinda grew up like the only adult he saw, his dad. Idk he just made me really sad the more the drama went on. Anyways, I think they could've added more story or told more backstory on them.

Maybe that's just me for another thing, but I think they could've made this drama even more focused on the normal daily life of everyone (aka more backstory of side characters) instead of focusing so much on the plot of bringing down the main guy.

This makes it seem like I hated the drama now that i'm reading this again haha. Other than my small complaints, this was a really wholesome drama, much different from the typical format, and I will definitely rewatch this when im in my 30's and maybe I'd have different opinions, reactions and feelings about it than now :)

Not a drama, more like a medicine: I re-watch this series once in a few months
If there was an option to give a show more than 10, then I would definitely do so for this show. After watching this series one time by myself, I managed to convince all my adult family members to watch it and everyone said the same thing after they finished watching - thank you for showing me this. And I think this is the best summary of the series.

I honestly think calling this work of art a ‘show’ or a ‘series’ is a serious downgrade of its quality and its ability to capture all of our lives and showcase it on the screen. This isn’t just a show - this is life. And the beauty of this work is that it manages to capture each and every one of us so we can all relate to at least one of the characters in it.

Never in my life have I ever said about something I watched that ‘it changed my life’. But this was all before I watched My Mister. I guarantee that watching this will change your life for the better, in one way or another. Give this show a chance and you will not regret it.

My Mister is about life. The sad and harsh truth which is life.
The message My Mister wants to tell is that even though life is this difficult, everyone can succeed and find a way to be truly happy in life. The perfect MC for this is Ji-An who lives a life which probably couldn't be any more difficult and cruel. We follow her steps into what is called ""life"" and uncover many lessons to be learned.

Another masterpiece, and ranked No. 1 on MDL, by director Kim Won Suk, who already followed his principle about life-telling stories in Misaeng (2014) and who is the director for the 2nd highest ranked drama show on MDL - Signal. He clearcly does his job right and I will be looking forward to future works of his. IU and also Lee Sun Kyun are doing wonderful jobs acting in My Mister and several of the supporting actors and actresses are doing an utmost, perfect job and are fitting right into this setting and story. My eye personally stuck to two here: Song Sae Byuk as the youngest of the three brothers aswell as Oh Na Ra as the bar owner Jung Hee. Both of these characters go through each their own struggle themselves and they are very charming. I don't know what I could add to other reviews here, but IU and Lee Sun Kyun are perfect in this drama and no one could have fitted the roles better than they did. They make a very charming and real relationship in front of the camera and give this story the kind of meaning it deserves. This might easily be the best acting IU has done so far and I hope she will continue her road of success - she truly deserves it.

t’s dark, it’s intense, it’s depressed – I like it. First I thought this will be an ordinary drama. And I was a bit sceptical and hesitant to watch it because I thought the age gap between main characters is bigger than in usual dramas. But it doesn't make this drama unpleasant to watch.

What I can say for sure is that this in this drama a lot has been thought on a is very good cinematofraphy. Because DETAILS. Every frame is art – it’s beautiful, “movie - like” and aesthetic.

The story is refreshing because there aren’t so many dramas like this.

Best part in this drama is ability to have thoughts and emotions exchanged without much actually being spoken. Body language and facial expressions are showed amazing.
But I got heart eyes for Lee Ji An who is played by IU already, since the episode one. And let me tell you, I think this is the best work she has done in her acting career. Also, her character in this drama isn’t the usual one she is given to work with. Which was refreshing.

I can put my hand on my heart and say that IU’s character is one of the most strongest female leads I have ever seen in a K- drama world.

Lee Sun Gyun as Park Dong Hoon really has a talent. The way how he showed how “broken” his family life and his character is broken is amazing. And what I love the most is that these things he has been through or is going through is said in drama but the audience its self has to notice it or pay attention to these small details.

Note: What has stuck to me the most in this drama is how bare or raw it is. Producers really went all out to show poverty, the infidelity, corporate wars, hard work / job life, bonding of opposite gender with a big year age gap.

My Mister touches your heart in every possible way. As you watch another episode, it enchains you and makes you a part of the Trio.
In this drama, there are 3 brothers whose lifes are in trouble. They face the hardship of life, but try to overcome with their obedience and love for one another. However, they are also alone and abandoned in a way. These aspects are combined with a spectacularly portrayed character Lee Ji An who is another desperate with a darker past and seemingly hopeless future.
This drama is a masterpiece. It is not like a drama, it is so much more like life itself, characters are real people and audience is an invisible visitor for this lovely neighbourhood.
In the earlier episodes, you should get to used to the characters but it makes itself familiar quickly, so you don't have to wait for many episodes.The story is unique and makes you wonder what will happen next. Characters are perfectly depicted by the actors which makes the drama magnificient. No more words, watch and see!

You may not be the same after viewing My Mister
My Mister is a compelling drama about community, family and friendship. Of all the K-Dramas out there, this is the one you must see.

It has been several months since I watched My Mister, and I still find myself pondering the events, the characters, and their challenges. When I linger in this reverie, I am overwhelmed with deep emotion… even now.

In the film, As Good as It Gets, Melvin (Jack Nicholson) confesses his love for Carol (Helen Hunt). Melvin sums it up, ""You make me want to be a better man.""

That's the feeling I get after watching My Mister.

This is the first time that I can't find appropriate words to review a drama I watched. My recommendation is: go and watch it. See for yourself how it makes you feel.

I couldn't decide on how to rate it for a day. There is something profoundly sad about this drama and it leaves you changed, even though the tone and the general message of it changes a bit later on. People say that it is a story about hope, but to be honest, I haven't seen hope in this drama. What I have seen is the power of people to dramatically change people's lives, be it for the better or worse. The vast majority of the characters had their life significantly influenced by other people's actions and those actions are what keeps them either going or being stuck in their lives. Then again, I do understand why some people see it that way.

Honestly, the story is about so many deep issues that there is no point listing them here. It is also very unique, even though it uses a lot of usual storytelling techniques and themes. It is a more mature drama in a way. The dialogues are intelligent and engaging, and the character development is so on point. The main story is amazing and engrossing. I also love Jun Hee's character and her story. At the same time, I didn't quite get into the brothers' side story. Also, the secondary romance in this show and the whole story of the actress wasn't interesting to me at all. Nara's character actually annoyed me here. Maybe I shouldn't even use the word secondary because, how some people pointed out, this is not a romance, although in some way I wish it was.

I can't say anything bad about the acting. All actors did a phenomenal job, but IU completely and utterly blew me away. What an outstanding performance.

i've watched all of iu dramas. big fan of her. when my mister announcement released, i thought i will watch it just because of iu. because the role didn't seem suitable for her. and boy i was so wrong. my mister is the best of all korean drama that i've watched. the story and the plot is amazing, the casts fit their role and perfectly directed. every scene has it's purpose, there is no scene that is too cringey. this drama will make you cry while you laugh, and laugh while you cry. the ending is sufficient. they thought well how to end this drama. it's not easy to end a drama without making it weird for too much closing and unfulfilling that didn't seem to be finished. but they did made the ending very well.

A masterpiece
It's been a few nights since I finished the drama, but my tears are not over, this is a drama that affects your life and morals, so be very careful, iu will be the best actor in his life in this drama, and he has a flawless direction. If you are a depressed person, please be careful, what fascinates you the most is the lack of dialogue of the main character of the story, but at the same time, this lack of dialogue has become a very important role in the film and makes every word that JN's mouth comes out, nails you and makes you cry

A Writer's Dream
One of the lines that has often given me comfort whenever I face hardships in life is not to worry myself too much since, ""it's not like I'm trying to save the world.""

Adulthood comes with a lot of pressures and we easily find ourselves in depression when we can't seem to cope. For the beautiful portrayal of adult life, I could give this drama a rating of 1000/10. Note that I used the word beautiful to describe a drama full of sad scenes that will have you soaked in tears. The tears are worth.

I would like to applaud the writers of this show. If, in this life time, I manage to write a story like ""My Mister,"" I would live the rest of my life thinking about how awesome I am. I would also like to give credit to the directors, the editors, and of course the cast! Every actor in the show gave the performance of a lifetime. I highly recommend the show.

Heartbreakingly Beautiful
After keeping this drama on my Plan to Watch for almost 2 years, I finally got around to watching it after a coworker watched it and could not stop talking about it.
It was exactly what I knew it would be, the reason it was in my plan to watch for 2 years, heartbreaking.
Each and every character in the drama had so much pain inside them.
Ji An with her past, crippling debt and a world of burden on her young shoulders. The Park family who are going through a difficult due to the unemployment of the 2 sons. Dong Hoon with his lonely life.
The beauty of the series was the way Dong Hoon and Ji An healed as they found some one who understands them. It was impossible to not be invested in all the characters and see them as real people as the story was so realistic.
I could rave on and on about the story but it is best experiencing their story in person.

Sad people felt this drama was for some reason overrated. Like howw?! The writers wrote a solid story about realistic hardships people sadly go through, and how some but not many people may overcome them. Nothing overrated about that in fact it’s such a refreshing and different drama from typical Korean dramas. It really was a healing drama for reason, and I was a crying mess throughout the whole drama. I truly felt for every characters hardships and the second-hand pain those around them felt too. The acting was so good as it was able to make me cry every five minutes ;__;

Watched it three times and I still can’t get over how good it was!

This series haunts me
It's been a few days since I've finished this series. In that span I have binged Move To Heaven and Oh My Ghost, both excellent shows in their own rights. But My Mister truly haunts me.

It is a gripping tale of depression, suffering, pain, catharsis, forgiveness, and peace. I was so immersed with the featured neighborhood and the characters that I did not want it to end. When it did, I was left a hole in my heart which I long to fill. I have so many questions regarding what happened to the main characters after the last episode, but as in life not all questions are answered outright. Most times, you just have to figure it out for yourself.

I stay up late at night thinking about the question ""Have you found peace?"" I pray that the day will come when I will be able to confidently say Yes.

Give this a watch. You won't regret it.

This review may contain spoilers
This is a drama that I began a while back, but then dropped. So, if you've found the first few episodes to be slow, maybe like me, if you keep watching, you just might begin to connect with it.

Park Dong Hoon is a righteous man who doesnt seem to care about materialistic things, nor does he care about competing with others. He lives a diligent life, at least by the standards of others. But, hes not happy. Often, he expresses how he doesnt know how to live and how hes forcing himself to go to work, and forcing himself to live. He puts on an act that everything is fine, and doesnt confront his problems by conveying what he truly wants. As for the female leade; In many dramas I've watched before where the main character is poor, they are usually portrayed as a bright person who can act cheerfully regardless of their circumstances. Ji-an is an example of someone who is unable to do that, and it's important to have that kind of representation because not all people are able to put on a happy face when the world has beaten them down. And that shouldn't be seen as wrong or pessimistic.
To be a good actress, you dont have to be the best at acting melodramatic. At crying loudly. At screaming and acting over-emotionally. Sometimes, it's the roles where you have to convey your emotions with the least lines that end up captivating the viewers. This was true for both the main characters. The fact that they were both reserved and quiet made it more noticeable and impactful when the slightest change occurred in their facial expressions. I was both eager to know what they were thinking, and also able to connect with them on a profound level.

At first, I wondered what kind of relationship the main pair would have. Exactly what kind of events would bring the two of them together, and create such a strong bond? The more I watched, the more understanding I had of this relationship.

""Once you know someone, there comes a point where you dont care what they do. I know you.""

This phrase sums up their relationship, basically. They come from completely different backgrounds, yet they feel as though they understand each other more than anyone.

The relationships in this drama were very realistic. The conversations felt real; awkward silences, outbursts between siblings, heartfelt exchanges. The lease realistic thing, although it was the basis for the story, was Ji-an eavesdropping on Donghoon. It made me question the relationship between the two leads, and how negatively those actions could impact this relationship. On the other hand, this was an integral part of the story, because through these moments, Ji-an began to change for the better. In a way, she was doing what she does best; listening. She listened in on other people's lives to soothe her own loneliness. So, I cant completely hate her for it.
The bond between the three siblings was my favorite bond apart from Ji-an and Donghoon. The way they get so worked up when something happened to Donghoon; how they cry with him, and walk home with him, and sit with him. I loved that aspect so much. Nothing beats family.

Broken things can be mended. ""This life is ruined. How many times do I have to be reborn for things to go right?"" That kind of thinking is broken in itself. When this life veers off track, it's our job to put it back and turn things around, so we dont end up wishing our lives away. The end ties everything together well because Donghoon finally decides he wants to be happy. This life is not ruined. There's hope.
""Being humiliated? People talking about your life being ruined? Those are nothing. I can be happy. I wont let this ruin my life. I'm going to be happy. I'll be happy. "" - Donghoon

Coming into a drama with two main leads, many people ask whether there's going to be a romance between them. No, there is none. Their relationship was more than that. And while I still found myself hoping for more, I am completely happy with the way their relationship unfolded. I still found myself happy to see the profound, meaningful interactions between them.

Overall, this is one of those dramas that have a wholesome set of characters. I loved hearing about all their stories, and was delighted to witness the events that occured in this neighbourhood.
I wish there were more scenes of everybody walking home together.
I'm gonna miss the soccer team who are always on standby; whether it's to beat someone up, or attend a funeral.. and play soccer. If there were a season two, I'd definitely watch it; even if just to see how the characters are doing with their new lives. It didnt feel like a story that ends once the curtains are drawn; but like the characters will continue to live their lives in search of what they're looking for, if that makes any sense to you. Hopefully that's how this drama makes you feel too. I know I'm going to keep thinking about it for a long time.

Sorry I'm Late
I have never watched a Kdrama with a more satisfying conclusion. Making the dismal ordinary life of a structural engineer somehow compelling was no easy feat. I don't know of any other Kdrama that I have connected with on such a deep emotional level. 'My Ajusshi' is the gold standard by which other dramas (and not just Kdramas) should be judged. A slow burn with an inspiring, uplifting, feel-good payoff. The performances were so convincing that I found myself in tears at different times and loudly cursing at my television.

warmth is all this drama leaves you with.
IU is a great actress, as the story says it revolves around a girl and a man with a great age gap. This drama’s got suspense, love, friendship, affection. All this drama leaves you in the end is with warmth. You’ll feel GOOD after watching this drama! Don’t get fooled with the plot and the posters, cause I did. Watch the drama. It shows the importance people will have in one’s life. How significant it is to have people around you. It shows that there are still good people out there, a lot of them. You just gotta look for it. Never think that it’s the end of something cause there’s always a door open when one is ending. It gives you very good feeling.

A different breed of k-drama
After watching this I needed one whole week to let it completely sink in. This drama is one of those that makes you ponder and ponder and ponder long after the credit rolled.

I'm not going to get into the drama itself, because other viewers have aptly described and dissected, but I'll just put this out there: I might need to redefine my own rating system because all those 10/10 I've given to other dramas may need to be knocked down a few notches because My Mister is truly on a level of its own. Different league.

The reason why I ""only"" gave 9.8 for Rewatch Value is for the simple reason that this show is quite emotionally taxing. It's a delivery of rousing performances and not something I would watch after a long day and wanting to unwind. Rich in sad pathos, I'll come back to this when I need to better understand some situations and people in my life. Or when I just wanna cry for the heck of it.

So simple but lovely ???? . It's a warm drama that make you laugh and cry and enjoy and everything . The story has not a lot of events or some suspension scenes but it makes you wanna watch it till the end . The drama was a mixture of love friendship comedy family melodrama it's definitely a worth watching . The most thing I loved about it is the end coz I was one of the few people who don't want a romantic love story between IU and the ajjushi I preferred that their relationship stay like that : a precious relationship that includes friendship love and familial ties where they fear and care about each other without being in a Romantic relationship . Same thing about her and the lender , I actually liked their chemistry but a love story was impossible between them coz their feelings was mixed between love and hate it'd have been really weird that a love story consists between them so that was amazing that the director didn't make a nonsense storyline . Perfect Ending on a perfect Drama . Worth watching .[Excuse my English it's not my first language] .

I know I’m in the minority with my rating and some of my critiques of this drama, but none without a reason so hear me out.

PSA: this review doesn’t contain spoilers, but it would make more sense to someone who has finished this drama.

For starters, this drama is real, almost too real. It is a melodrama in every sense of the word. Throughout the show I was left wanting insight and conclusions that might have been too unrealistic. That’s not a big flaw on the shows part, but more with my expectations. Also, there were some characters I wanted to know more about and other characters I wanted to know less about. For instance, I wanted to know more about how Song Ki Beom (Ji An’s friend who played video games) met Ji An. I wanted to know what happened to that old man who was a father figure to Ji An. I get that I can come to conclusions about those things myself, but I thought it would have been a nice touch to see things like that added in to tie up loose ends. Personally, I wasn’t too interested in Choi Yoo Ra (the actress), she seemed a bit awkward and towards the end I was more interested in what would happen to other characters, like Jung Hee. So my overall problems with this drama are the screen time distribution of certain characters, and loose ends that could have made the end amazing if tied up nicely.

All of that aside, this was a decent drama. The acting was impressive all around. The soundtrack was magnificent. The song Rainbow (Band ver.) by Vincent Blue set the tone every time. For the most part the story was good, aside from me wanting more from it. The cinematography never disappointed me. For me, the characters are what drove this drama. It could have had any plot with these characters and I still would have watched it. Will I rewatch it? Probably not. Although, it was nice to watch once.

If you’re looking for a slow paced, realistic, melodrama, centering around a tight-knit community, then this show is for you.

Can't deny how good it is
So to be honest I have dropped this drama at ep13, not because it was bad but because personally, it made me quite depressed thinking about life and I may pick it up again another time.
My mister is one of those dramas you either love or hate, and even if you hate it it's not because it's not good but because it doesn't fit your genre style well. If your a hopeless romantic or into high action this may bore you. But if you love deep meanings or genres that reflect everyday life with character depth then it would be a perfect fit.
I love that the ML isn't this perfect guy who has life all figured out but he is a normal working man with a crazy family, struggles and hardships and he makes mistakes but is so good compared to those around him. The FL takes no crap and fights for herself but also allows herself to open up to him. There's no romance and if there was it would have ruined it.
Just people finding friendships and learning that life sucks but it's a little easier with others around you.

I am not gonna say much more about the rest of it. I wouldn't re-watch because It's one of those dramas you carry in your memories.

This story was so beautiful. I enjoyed every aspect of the drama. BELIEVE ME this is a must watch. This drama gives you all kind of feels and i loved the line when it said, "" she said she liked the neighborhood but to me it felt like she liked you"". This line is so beautiful and got stuck in my head. My friend recommended this drama to me and i now recommend this to everyone too. greatest K-drama EVER.

this drama gives you all sorts of feels and give a better understanding of how bonds hold so much POWER in it. That it can do MIRACLES too.

Multi-layered
“People will forget what you said, will forget what you did but never how you made them feel.” Maya Angelou’s quote was on repeat in my head throughout this drama. If you ever meet Park Dong Hoon he will strike you as a gentleman, quiet and kind through and through. He thinks of others before himself whether you are his kin, friend or even enemy. So why his wife decided to cheat on him is beyond me but that’s how this sad drama began. Despite a stable job, a solid marriage (before he knew about the infidelity) and a very supportive network Dong Hoon feels the heavy weight of the world on his shoulders . He was slowly dying inside. Although he doesn’t show it, he is miserable, very lonely and has no one to tell him “it’s no big deal” like his dad used to. That is until Lee Ji An came along. She is his unlikely saviour in the most unusual way...and him hers.

This drama is unique in that it has so many layers. You see I’m a binge watcher (reader) for entertaining dramas (books) but this one is so jampacked that you can only take /watch so much at a time. The brothers’ storylines are a treat, reminded me that boys will always be boys no matter their age. My fave actor of all time Lee Sung Kyun delivered yet again, his last crying scene is the loneliest scene of the decade. IU was a pleasant surprise, I think she made a good career move in picking this project.

I liked how each character have their own raw and honest story to tell. There’s a lot of lines that resonated and will stay with me, “do machines work in this company?!”, “You are the first person who was kind to me over four times” “the feeling that I’m the only one not rolling forward.So, sometimes… I sit outside near the door, early in the morning. Because I want to feel as if I’m rolling forward with them, too” are some of the few. I will also not forget “I...like Lee Ji an” and “I can’t die today...I don’t have expensive underwear” and “other people’s food taste better” among the light ones.

I don’t like how Yoon-Hee’s reason for infidelity was shallow but love how how Dong Hoon’s kindness embodies the ripple effect theory. I would recommend this drama if you have time for substance and in the mood for a good cry.

This is the epitome of kdrama, an expressive art that transcends escapism and entertainment. Realist and minimalist dramas are gems that are often overlook by mainstream audience, so I would like to give credits to TVN for taking the risks of distributing this masterpiece. IU had graces me with one of the most memorable performance. The one and only drama that shook me to my core. Every characters are well crafted. My mister is by far the greatest kdrama I've watched, and I'm skeptical if a kdrama like this will ever come by again.

The usual formulaic kdrama elements are non-existent here, just pure transparency. Due to the nature of the narrative, it may be slow but never was a dull moment. You'll savor every sequences. I literally don't mind another 16 episodes of it. My mister is must watch, an exotic species in the ocean full of cliche stories.

Amazing... I've never felt like this after finishing a drama before, not sad, not happy, just.. wholesome. If I had to describe it in 1 word I'll choose ""Pitiful"".

The main lead was a female in her 20s that grew up with no parents to teach her how to live and enough hardships for her to mature before some 40+ years neighbors, and just as she gave up on life she meets someone who even SHE felt that was more pitiful than her.
Behold how the story of the 2 most pitiful people play out.

Story: Main plot was unique, drama touches sensitive topics like cheating and depression and shows that people mature at different ages depending on their circumstances, I was very touched by the story and felt like I could understand all the characters actions from their point of view, for example there was no bad guy just for the sake of having a bad guy, his actions made actually sense.

Cast: I'm slowly becoming U.I fan at this point, good lord I felt so touched by her acting if they showed one of those ""based on real story"" messages at the end of the drama I would have believed it. Never heard about the other main actors before but I believe they were also great.

Music: Amazing! I love it when the music lyrics can relate to the drama story, that way when I listen to it whenever I can feel flashbacks of the scenes the music played in during the drama, that was also the case for ""Because this is my first life"".

Rewatch: I'll definitely rewatch this in couple of months when I miss it.

Overall: Purity at it's finest, definitely check this gem out for a change from the usual kdrama plots.

""Just hang in there.""
This series tells the story of a midlife crisis: career challenges (career stagnation, office politics, threats of being fired), finding another love; all of which stem from the background of each character. The series also talks about how the ""good"" character faces problems in his life.

Each character of the character has many layers of past stories, which are patiently peeled off in each curve of the scene. Many stories are told not in straightforward dialogue, but through pictures, the expressions of the characters.

The two main characters of this drama: Park Dong-hoon and Lee Ji-an - who have a boss-subordinate relationship in an office - are the people who are pressed by their various problems. The situation forces them to be in opposing positions. But Dong-hoon is attracted to Ji-an's ""kindness"" and vice versa. At the end of the day, these two people were strengthening each other, supporting each other in a unique way - and I found it beautiful.

I was attracted by the character Dong-hoon, a building construction engineer who is honest in his work and life principles, not talk too much, but his words have deep meaning. He is trapped in dirty office politics, and he who is considered the weakest politically is the figure who is most easily sacrificed.

The warmth of Dong-hoon's closest community relationships: his mother and two brothers (who also have their own problems), and his fellow villagers help strengthen Dong-hoon (and ultimately Ji-an). The scene of Ji-an's grandmother's mourning ceremony in the last episode was touching.

This is not a romantic romance series even though it tells a lot about love. This is also not a dark series even though it tells a lot about the tough challenges of life.

""Even if you're having hardships in life, just hang in there. It's no big deal"".

Hugye!

Top drama on my list. Park Hae-young has really produced a masterpiece of a drama.

Although one can't proclaim the main story as something new (wife cheating on man, office politics etc.) - the way My Mister took time out to dive so deep into each character, teasing us on their back stories, showing us their vulnerabilities, was very refreshing to say the least. What made it stand out from other slice of life series imo was how relatable each character and their problems were. It made it so easy for a viewer to understand and immerse into each role, imagining themselves in it and feeling all the emotions. The drama also made superb usage of sounds (including silences) which managed to create an image of 'closeness' and helped to capture the viewer's imagination (e.g. LJA & PDH's farewell scene at the end. So little was actually said even though we could all see how much both parties wanted to tell each other). I also loved how Park Hae-young focused so much on ensuring each dialogue was meaningful and not just some filler noise (so many inspiring and relatable quotes in each ep! - ""It's no big deal"" - I'm sure many of us would at some point in time hoped for someone to tell us this sincerely) Personally, my favorite (most touching) scene was when LJA's grandma wrote on her book that she can finally die in peace to PDH - it was so sincere and heartfelt that I just drowned in tears)

Casting was also excellent. One of the few dramas which I felt each and every role was casted perfectly. Everyone acted so well and the emotions were so raw and real that, again made it easy for the viewer to connect. There were many concerns earlier on IU's 1-D acting but i sincerely felt she acted LJA to perfection - especially Ji An's hesitations (which i felt made her more real). Really love the portrayal of all 3 brothers as well - you could see the loneliness in their eyes. Even the side characters such as the LWI (loan shark) was great.

The OSTs were also brilliant and the editing made full use of it with great placement on important moments, adding on to the atmosphere.

Rewatchability was rated highly as I felt everything I rewatched the series, I discover new meanings in the dialogue or understood it from a different perspective, which makes it very refreshing despite already knowing the plot and the ending.

Overall, I highly recommend anyone who hasn't watched to give this drama a try. You would not regret investing the time. My only regret was not watching it earlier.

i followed this drama from ep1 aired. wait patiently, then looking at korean tv rating, week by week. it's too low! it had to be above 9%. i feel weird. coz the first time my prediction is far off, and for me this is the best korean drama next to Signal.
looking now at the rating, yeah i wasn't wrong. this masterpiece is just too good for korean.
if i watched this drama 6 years ago, it would be boring af. after years of experience, watching various film from several country. i can say that this is masterpiece.

Okay, I quite literally just finished watching and I feel so warm and fuzzy inside that I'm going to write this right now even though it's 12:30 AM lol.

First things first: the story. From the first episode, it honestly grasps your attention and curiosity right away. Questions begin to flood you about Ji An's story, Dong Hoon's life, and generally the interpersonal relationships among everyone living in Hoogye. The entire drama ultimately leaves you desperate for a coalition of loving friends and family that will truly support and help you whenever you need it. And, although I'm quite the romantic and a large inkling of me wanted to see some romantic action, there were no drastic plot changes in the name of love. It was realistic, and that's just another central reason as to why I enjoyed My Mister so, so much. After just completing Goblin, I didn't feel good. The story seemed off, and I realize why now: because it was completely unrealistic, and not just because the main characters had magical powers. It was because the story really didn't make sense. It pulled the laws and realities of what is reasonable too far and made the relationships created across 20 episodes seem very fake. For My Mister, the relationships are real, run deep, and do not betray what real life can look like.

The acting was PHENOMENAL. Every actor/actress played their roles diligently, and I, never for a second while watching, did I question whether that was their real personality or one they took on. There was one scene with Ki and Sang Hoon, where Sang Hoon was unimpressed with magic tricks and Ki Hoon exasperatedly asked, ""Why do you cry when you watch TV shows then? It's all just acting."" My Mister, surely one of the best magic tricks I have ever seen, took my breath away. I think basically all of the characters that I originally found annoying grew on me by the end, which is really rare for me and TV shows lol. However, I was IN. LOVE. with IU throughout the whole show, and her relationships with her grandma, Kwang II, Ki Beom (only fault: I wish they expanded more on this relationship), Jung-Hee and duh Dong Hoon made me love those characters and their acting even more. I loved Dong Hoon's relationship with Team 3 and even the CEOs. I loved the acting in My Mister!

I didn't even question that the music would pull my heartstrings when IU is the main lead. The OST is gorgeous and the song choices for specific scenes and people fit very well. I don't know if I can say much more than that for the soundtrack, but just like everything else with My Mister, it was thoughtful and well done.

Overall, I really recommend that you watch this show, whether it's for specific actors, an enticing and unique story, or just to see a glimpse of what real humanity looks like. I guarantee this: you will feel good inside after watching. If you don't, my sincerest apologies lol that I took away 16x80 minutes of your life, but that's highly unlikely. It's a uplifting drama with great actors, great music, and a fantastic plot.

Heartwrenching at certain points
I honestly have to say that Jang Ki Yong totally stole the show for me. From his first scene, I knew that he and Ji-an would have some sort of history, and indeed he turned out to be the most layered and gray character. He had one of the best development arcs I'd ever seen, and the acting was top-notch.

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the development between the leads as well, but it just didn't captivate me the same way, save for a few scenes that were actually really touching.

I wish I could rate this higher but it actually took me so long to get through this drama, and even mid-way it was hard to find the motivation to keep going. I think part of this was the amount of time dedicated to the side characters — while some did grow on me, especially when they interacted with Ji-an in later episodes, for most of it I didn't care much for many of their scenes and it just very disjointed from the main storyline.

I feel like all my reviews these days start off with me saying that this type of drama isn’t USUALLY what I watch, but that’s only because I’ve really been pushing myself out of my rom-com comfort zone. My Mister was a drama I kept hearing about, and one day, when I was unsure of what to watch because of my long-ass watchlist, I went on r/kdramarecommends on Reddit and put up a post that I will watch someone’s favorite drama, because I probably already have it on my watchlist anyway. It’s a long watchlist. I literally just don’t have enough time in my life for all the dramas that I want to watch. Anyway, the very first person to comment on that post told me to watch My Mister, and at first, I was like, really? The last non-romance drama I watched I ended up rating a 5/10, and oh, look at that, the one before it was also a 5/10. For some reason I am fucking incapable of being interested in dramas that don’t follow some sort of romantic storyline. But oh, man, My Mister sure is one hell of a trailblazer in that regard. I do admit the first episode was boring as hell to me, and I had to rewatch it because I kept spacing out and was very confused when it ended. The more I got to know each of the characters in this drama, you could not have physically pulled me away from my laptop, because I was INVESTED and needed to know what happens next. By the way, this is coming from a person who sincerely believes that she has some undiagnosed mild ADHD. I just cannot for the life of me sit through this much of a kdrama on a normal day, but there was something about My Mister that just captivated me so much that I didn’t want to stop watching. When the drama ended, I sobbed for about 10 minutes straight (this might be a tad of an exaggeration) and sat there for a little while, not knowing what to do with my sad life now that my only source of entertainment in a while is finally over. I loved all the characters of this drama (even the “evil” ones) because none of them were written to be completely good or completely evil. Our main leads, even, have done some questionable things in this drama, however this type of unexpected behavior coming from seemingly predictable characters is what added the depth to their personalities. I could relate so much to the less moral characters, because as fucked up as their actions were, you could understand where they were coming from. There aren’t villains or heroes in My Mister. There are just regular people who do what they need to do for their and for other people’s happiness. The OST was absolutely incredible, and I loved the atmosphere of this drama quite a bit. The pacing was on the slower side, but this was totally okay and still engaged me throughout the whole series. If I have any parting words, it is to just watch this drama even if you don’t think you’d like it, because I, too, was incredibly turned off by the seemingly boring synopsis that MyDramaList provided. This Kdrama will be one I will not forget for a long time.

This is the same director that filmed ""Signal"" and ""Incomplete life"", so of course, I had to watch it. Ever since he filmed Sunkyunkwan Scandal(in which Song Joong Ki and Yoo Ah In and Park Min Young won their popularity), I had my eyes on him. Any mediocre actor will win popularity through this director and Yim Si Wan is one of the many! This director has a knack for making every story so personal and special yet a different chill will run through your spine every time you watch his works. This film was a little(?), maybe a lot different different than his previous ones and I think he is the type of man who goes for challenges. I loved all of his films but this one in particular, I couldn't watch without crying from episode 6, and you will understand why.
This film was, compared to his previous ones, more deep and you will learn to hope and how to be a proper adult in the midst of hardship in life and what it means to be a real hero. He has a special way to resolve struggle and obstacles and deliver you to perfect climax and resolution. I highly recommend it and I hope the subtitle will be able to deliver the subtle yet strong message, and the beauty of this film.

Best Drama of all time!
The first is the story. The story of this drama the story is well made. The second is Acting/casting. I like the Cast of the show especially IU, why? Because the way she portrayed her character is so good and I also liked all the cast the way they portrayed their characters is not only good but GREAT! The Third is Music. Boy The music really fits the drama especially the song ""Rainbow"" that song is the emotional moments of the drama. The Fourth is The Rewatch value. I gonna say this, I gonna admit it gets a bit boring in later episodes but when you try to understand the episode then you will enjoy it I watched this a lot of times already, and it's not boring at all. The Fifth is The Overall. Overall the show is just so great the writers of this show should be given o much credit because the way the flow of the drama is the flow is slow but I think a slower flow is better for this drama I personally hated slow-paced dramas but for some reason in this drama, I liked it But recommend this drama I personally enjoyed it and I hope you guys enjoy it too.

A series that tell people's ""failure"" which would made us think twice about failure definition itself. At the start the story bonding up the viewers to each of the characters so the viewers would sympathise them, even for the loan shark (played awesome by Jang Ki Yong--strangely, I truly loved him in this role). My heart was painful by watching what they're dealing with and started to understanding every choices each character takes. Eventho the ending gave us ""a happy ending"" vibes (and I feel happy for that), it can't stop me from thinking this. Life's a marathon, not a sprint. As long as we're living in this world, there is always problems coming out to our face asking for a solution. But all we need is living our sucks life and find our comfort. Just like the Ahjussi's last dialog, ""Ji An, have you found your comfort?""

It would have been an amazing movie didn't need 16 episodes for such small story
I've watched this drama after a lot of recommendations from my friends and others ,, they said it's the best
and I had high expectations then it let me down
The story itself isn't bad , it's kind of realistic not romantic or fantasy but it's not actual reality story
Yes ,, there are girls similar to the female lead in real life and there are few good men such as the male lead also but even a righteous man has his breaking point not that passive about every thing happening to him ... the writer didn't bother to give more effort on the story and add more details about every character ,, she just focused in few characters then put them in a bar and repeated the scenes of drinking , eating , sulking and crying hours and hours through the episodes
we didn't get to see the Ajussi's son at all or how he feel about his parents ,, we didn't ge to see the older brother's family and how they treat him ,, we didn't get to see more details to the cooperate corruption of the company ,, we didn't get to see what happened to the gangster who bullied the female lead all the time ,, we didn't get to see more of the happy ending if we can call it that
she just stuck with the most boring annoying scenes of drinking and eating at the bar most of the time wasting hours not minutes ,, they were too much ,, I skipped a lot
I've pinged watched this so I've noticed that a lot
all I've said after finishing it ,, that would have been great movie ,, why did I waste hours of my life watching grown men repeatedly crying ,, drinking and eating at a bar sulking about their Misérable lives
Over all for me this was a boring drama with nice sad story stretched out

Reality
Not gonna lie, My Mister for me was a bit boring at the start. Since i rarely watch KDramas, i really don't know what to expect. But hell.. i surely wasn't expecting this though.
Having to watch a slow-paced KDrama for the first time really made my mind clear that not everything has to be done in an instant. Sometimes, you just have to spend more time to experience every detail there is to offer. A bit boring at the start but slowly gets interesting as they finish the backstory and starts with the main problem. And then i got completely hooked.

What i like about this drama is that, reality isn't always a pleasant one. I, as a big fan of shows that showcase reality finds it really interesting. Depression, Betrayal, Violence, successfully portrayed while still having the audience feel like they're in the Main Character's shoes. That with a mix of their godly cinematography, really is breathtaking.

Acceptance.
Sometimes, reality is so cruel that you just have to let it happen and deal with it. Just accept it. It is what it is.

Other than the harsh reality, the Main Character's progression of their friendship is also the main thing that made this drama excels. A solid evidence that not every relationship needs romance to bloom.

I must say this, what i enjoyed the most from this Drama is their neighborhood. Personally, I just find it really beautiful that they have such a connection with each other even though they're not related or anything. A simple relationship, yet so powerful.
Don't even get me started on Dong-Hoon's relationship with his brothers :)

Overall, 9/10. A bittersweet story added to the collection. I might rewatch this in the future, just so that i can experience this amazing series all over again.

Depressingly comforting - a real take on life’s ups and downs
Story
A story of mediocrity, suffering and human weakness - sure to tug at your deepest fears.

My Mister explores the layers of everyday people. The slow pace was deliberate and meticulous forcing you to feel the frustration and complexity of human decisions. It is uncomfortable in its real-ness where the viewer cannot simply draw the line between good, bad, admiration or abomination.

This drama explores themes such as:

1. An adverse childhood and how it shapes adult demeanour and decision-making
2. The hopelessness of a stale marriage and decisions it drives
3. Love and piety to family
4. Seeing yourself in another disguised as compassion for their suffering
5. Finding meaning in living and being content
6. A mother’s unconditional love and support

Acting:
I enjoyed Lee Sun-Kyun’s restrained portrayal of Park Dong Hoon. Best scene - confronting his wife with his bottled up anger and despair on full display.

Also intrigued by IU’s take on her character. The coldness and steeliness one would need to survive the harsh realities having nothing.

Reflections and learning:
In the greyest moments of your life, there is hope, solidarity and love. You only need to take a closer look.

A Korean Gem and Masterpiece for the times
When I first watched this drama, I couldn't even finish the 1st episode because I thought it was really boring. I wasn't much of an IU fan back then.

However, somehow I decided to watch Hotel del Luna (another masterpiece from IU) and that brought me back to this drama.

It was then I started asking myself ""how the heck did I almost miss this greatness of a show?"".

To think a couple of years back I used to dislike IU because I thought she was too overrated and only sings those teen songs. How wrong I was. Now I'm her biggest fan. I practically went searching for all her songs , downloaded all her tv shows and films.

Going back to this drama, it's just utterly touching and amazing. It's so realistic and full of life lessons. Don't even get me started on the awesome soundtrack by Sondia.

A drama turned me from an IU doubter to a huge fan. Seriously this girl can do everything entertainment wise. Her acting is just out of this world here. You will hate her at the start, sympathize with her in the middle and love her in the end.

Having a hard time in life? Maybe you should just try telling yourself ""it's no big deal, it's really not a big deal"". It might do wonders at times. Watch this. You definitely won't regret it.

Beyond my expectation!
When I started watching the first episode, I was surprised why this drama got as high the ratings as it did. This was one of the most depressing dramas I've ever watched to date. But as I started to watch more, this drama pulled me in further. The acting is good, I'm no expert, I just liked what I was watching. It makes such a refreshing change from other kdramas who show all lovey-dovey scenes and unrealistic happiness all the time. This drama shows what life is all about. It's not all happiness all the time, people are struggling with daily lives. And that's fine. Every once in a while, we need a drama like this. I loved watching this and this will be one of my favourite kdrama to date. Try giving this a watch, it may just surprise you.

WOW! Just WOW!
I've watched so many dramas already. I always go for the usual romcom but I started watching the top-rated dramas recently regardless of genre. My Mister....wow... I laughed, I cried, I got angry and even depressed at times. I went through all sorts of emotion. There was no real romance per se but the love the two leads have for each other can not be denied. It wasn't a romantic love, but it was so much deeper, transcending time. I admire it and am also in awe of it. Beautifully portrayed through the actors, the music and the cinematography. It's a must-see for drama lovers even if you don't like this kind of genre. It's finished now and I am sad because I want to see more. I want more of the characters. I would gladly just watch them living their daily lives out because I've become so invested in them. To me this is what makes drama great to me.

Prepare your hearts and give it a watch. the ending is truly satisfying.

MY MISTER: Heart & Soul
MY MISTER (Naui Ahjusshi) was a k-drama that defied my expectations and left my predictions hanging out to dry. It is deep, layered, and so full of heart. At times it was tragic and heartbreaking, while others it was laugh-out-loud hilarious. It was always quirky and fresh. I can’t begin to express how touching this was. There is something just so beautiful and deep about it. Wonderful acting, brilliant writing, gorgeous music, quirky realistic characters, down to earth vibes, heartfelt plots and themes...everything was so great. This show has so much heart and soul.

The acting was fantastic. The entire cast gave stellar performances and all left lasting impressions. Lee Ji-eun (as Lee Ji-An) and Lee Sun-kyun (as Park Dong-hoon) were both so great and relatable. You truly feel for both of them, as people, and their trials and tragedies impact the viewer deeply. I loved Lee Ji-An’s relationship with her grandmother. I also really loved Park Dong-Hoon’s deep bond with his family and friends, but particularly with his brothers. The trio were so relatable and lovable. The entire side cast was fantastic as well.

This drama is close to real life. It is such a beautifully complex show and all the characters are so well-rounded and realistically portrayed. There are layers of emotion and subtext between the every day lives and events of these characters. There was so much going on that kept me watching, even though the overall pacing was fairly slow and it had an almost dreamy, melancholy vibes going for it.

Some viewers might not like the lack of typical romcom themes (over-the-top-silliness, unrealistic stories and excessive coincidences, mushy-gushy love at first sights, overly perfect looking cast, HEA endings for everyone, where everything is neatly tied up in a bow and everyone unrealistically gets their own sparkly magical happily ever after.) Nah. This drama brings home the feels. It brings home a meaningful story.

There were so many sensitive issues and life lessons learned in this short series, such as seeing the beauty in life and in the little things, the importance of family and friends, empathy for others when we don’t understand their secrets and sorrows, supporting one another through thick and thin. Overall, this was a great series, especially for more mature viewers.

Hai zoombie's
If u were looking for light hearted drama please change the channel.. it's not for you.
Story starts with man of mid 30's and women of early 20's..
At first i watched 1st eps and put this on hold ... After someday i go for it..
The way they showed the melo was different genre.. it's not normal touchy kisssy romance, it's pure.. no kinship among our leads but u can feel what they r longing for.
They try to support each other with all their willpower..
They way they see each other, care for them and protecting them and making distance with each other will clearly show us what they r feeling..
U can find company politics, familyship, brotherhood, fighting for broken dreams, affair, senior junior mindset, inferiority complex, heart breaking love.
FL is so strong in this drama, ML is so warm hearted. Go for it..
The way the drama ends will hold 100 percent reality.. End was so real and we can feel fulfillment in their smile

If I could watch only one show/movie for the rest of my life, I would choose this!
It's one of those drama I wish I could erase from my memory so that I can watch it again for the first time! It's an almost perfect show for me, I wouldn't change a single thing.

The thing I love about this drama the most that there's not much dialogues. The way they conveyed their emotions through their eyes was just awesome. You take one look at their eyes and you start crying. The slow burn also helped. The more they build up to the scene the higher the pain. It also gives you time to process all the emotions and doesn't rush things.

Except the CEO guy, each and every character was so good that you just can't help but fall in love with them.
It was my first time watching IU. She was so good that now every time I see her on social media or on the news my heart just aches. I just want to give her character a tight warm hug and cry with her.
The big brother, the cheating wife and the bar owner.. I just love each and every one of them.

There are two types of sad dramas, one where you just cry and other one where you feel so much pain in your heart that you feel like you're having a heart attack! This drama falls in the 2nd category.

The only part that wasn't perfect was the ending conversation between. It didn't feel like two people who care about each other a lot meeting after a long time, it felt like a divorced couple who forgave eachother and moved on are meeting after a long time. Still I wouldn't change a thing.

Unique drama. I have never seen anything like this, everyting is so different from what we're accustomed to. The realism makes it so it ensnares the viewers feelings and experiences, like a lot of show you would say, however, it's a natural realism where you can't say ""too much"".
Words weren't needed in lot of scenes, the way it was filmed succeded in making us interpret the acting of each actors. The story revolved around Lee Ji An and Park Dong Hoon, both having pitiful lives, though each in differents spectrums. In addition, a terrific ensemble cast, where individuals stories were not boring at all and were very much welcomed.
Fates intertwined, both of their existances were significants in each other's life. One taught self love, one loved.
When a happy ending doesn't necessary encompass one having their way. The aftermath of the show leaved me full of expectation, I couldn't help but imagine their future further more than what's shown. An open ending with multiple possibilities laid out for us to envision.

I especially loved the message at the end of the final episode: ""you are all decent people. May you hang there until you find comfort for yourself."" I felt a genuine positive message coming from the cast, producers...etc.

Occasionally, in this drama, we're taught how to relativise problematic times. They used concepts like reincarnation, implicating we'll get other chances at life. Bad things happen in life, that's nothing. If you did something shameful but you deemed it to be a not shameful thing, it's not a big deal. This lifetime, enjoy it the way it is, do your best, be kind to people which, by the way, is also displayed through the male protagonist's unparalleled kindness, he seeks justice and only justice and can't stand Lee Ji An's outstandingly unfair situation.

It is certainly by far a one of a kind drama that I doubt will ever be concurrenced. Acting on point, plot greatly developed, a purposeful cliffhanger, powerful and emotional scenes.

Tragedy is explored, they find confort in the outcome of their tragedy. So, although there isn't a happy ending per se, it is a happy life they're living.

These are my thoughts and others can interpret the show differently. Main point is give this drama a chance and watch it, it's a beautiful story. It's about humanity and hope.

I’m reading reviews and symbolism regarding the drama and I’ve missed a lot when they explained what those symbolism mean and while I agree on some there are parts where I disagree too. But then this drama does leave a lot of the interpretation to the viewers.

First time, I’ve watched this drama and I was bored with the first 3 episodes but after episode 4, the story starts to step up on the pacing and keeps me interested in watching it. First 3 episodes cannot be skipped though, that’s where the plot and stuff are laid out for the use of the whole series. These are important episodes, groundwork so to speak.

The first time I’ve watched the whole series, it’s very difficult for me to see Dong Hoon and Ji An as a romantic couple even at the end, it’s an open ending where viewers may choose to interpret on where they’ll go from there, it’s just not easy for me to think them as such because of how Dong Hoon behaved with Ji An, he drew a line when it comes to what he allows their relationship to become considering as well that he is married and has a kid and she is really young for him, someone who is just starting her life. He got to know her and understands that she already went through a lot and they have things in common. Dong Hoon is very clear on his life though, on the boundaries, that’s why I did not think they’ll become a couple at all.

The second time I’ve watched it though, I’ve noticed more things in their interactions with each other and suddenly the thought before that they cannot become a couple has been diminished with my realization that it can actually happen. It will not be sudden but there's a possibility.

While I think Dong Hoon and Ji An’s love for each other is hard to define because I really think it’s the purest form of love; a love that accepts and just strengthens over time. It does not matter if they become romantically linked, all that matters is that they are with each other. That they are together as friends, companion and just be in that person’s life, that’s enough for them. As long as the person is happy, they are happy.

I may just watch this again to focus on the symbolism mentioned by other people and how they interpret the interactions with Dong Hoon and Ji An is very interesting. To have different POV and interpretation from other people makes me think, have I missed something? The show is brilliantly produced, directed and I’m sure the script will be even better if one understands Korean as the full impact will be more felt. I do think there are cases when translation just does not get the full impact of scripts written in their original language.

In terms of the cast, they are all brilliant; this drama does not make me think of the actors, they were the characters which are amazing. They made root for them even if their characters are not the easiest to digest; they all have flaws after all. The realism of the scenes and interactions is so relatable too which makes this the best drama I’ve ever watched. This drama may not have made me cry but the impact of this drama to me is big, the fact I’m still thinking about it after I’ve watched it twice in a matter of 2 months is an amazing feat. It makes me think and it’s been a while since a movie/drama made me keep on thinking about it after I’ve finished watching.

I’ve watched this drama because of IU and I’m curious what kind of drama it is, I was hesitant because I really do not like melodrama that much and the synopsis seems to be that. It was not actually melodrama, there is drama but it’s a depiction of an everyday life. Slice of life story, while I enjoy them, I do not actively search for it since sometimes it just makes me sad. And I tend to watch films/dramas that will relax me. IU was a revelation on this drama, I mean I’ve watched Hotel Del Luna first and while I think she improved a lot since the last drama I’ve watched of her which is Dream High, she did steal the show as Jang Man Wol which made me interested in trying another drama of hers. I was not expecting much when I started My Ajusshi but she became Lee Ji An and I really think she succeeded in her acting because I really cannot think of any actress that can portray the role of Lee Ji An. She was Lee Ji An. It showed me the potential of her as an actress and I cannot wait for her next movie Dream and how she’ll take on the role, I hope it’s something I’ll love.

Lee Sung Kyun, I’ve first watched him in Coffee Prince and I’ve liked him since then and watched a movie of him. He was really good on this role, the nuances, his voice and his acting is brilliant and like with IU, he is Dong Hoon. I was also curious on how IU and LSK will have chemistry in the drama since he’s older than her by 20 years. It’s an interesting combination and I wanted to try another drama and I’m so happy that I did because this drama is a blessing.

The drama is just beautiful, the acting is amazing, not just from the main leads but all cast have significant contributions in the drama and I enjoyed how everything just meshes so well together. If you look at it and read about the casts’ characters and the story, you’ll think what’s so good about this drama like why do you like it so much.

I agree with a lot of people who watched this that you just need to watch it to understand how good everything was and how everything flows well together. Everyone who contributed to this drama, the director, producer, script writers, everyone behind the scene and the actors, they delivered a masterpiece and I’m so glad I took a chance and watched this drama.

my mister seems like such an average drama overall when you look at it outside point of view but when you start to watch it you find yourself caught up in all characters lives in so many ways. the drama goes on slowly but just right because you get to feel the scenes and how the scenes should make you feel perfectly. i like it that it points out the hardships of ourselves or people arounds are having yet we are so oblivious. we dont know a single favor could make such a difference in someones life and this drama embraces the power of empathy. if you are looking for a comedy or action drama this isnt either of them but i am sure everyone will love it even if its not in their interest. if you are in the dilemma of watching or not watching you should def watch!!! lastly the cast and their acting are amazing there is not a single flaw i could say and iu did such a good job playing a challenging character

This drama is not a cheerful one. It has a dark and depressing mood and a mature tone to it. This makes it different from mainstream dramas out there. It also explains the lower re-watch stores.

It follows the hardship of a few characters and how they keep going on and finding comfort and encouragement in each other. It's a beautiful story of an unorthodox friendship that is beautifully told. The actors did a great job and you really get to see a different side of IU.

The music is this drama is also well fitting and contributes to enhancing the experience.
Overall, a series worth the watch if you are looking for this genre of drama. If you prefer cheery uplifting dramas - stay away.

This show highlights Chief Oh and Geurae's (Misaeng) relationship x10
I didn’t expect this show to be about business politics like Misaeng and a bit like Healer hehe.

But at the same time, it’s very meaningful. It also teaches a lot of life lessons.

The main girl is so smart and so strong. She is willing to do anything for her family but at the same time, she’s so street savvy, quick on her feet. I love how she doesn’t let anyone tear her down. She always fights back with the upper hand.

It hurts so much seeing her have to live in poverty and look after her grandma and have a loan shark beating her up. Even with so much hardship, she still has enough strength in her heart to care for a nice stranger.

I finally understand why these 2 characters are the main leads. The guy is nice to everyone even to those that have wronged him and the girl is blunt and says and does things that he is unable to do because he is too nice. He is nice to her and everyone whilst she is willing to stand up for him. They stand up for each other. They are like each others’ secret soul mates.

I’m addicted to their scenes. I’m addicted to how they’re in so much misery but how they are able to care for each other in spite of that.

Far out! I feel like the more you rewatch this show the more you’ll understand how they feel and cry with them. Their relationship is so special that you can’t put into words. The most love a person can give is when they care for you despite what others say about you. When they fight for you. The way they fight for each others’ internal and external battles, I think that is the most pure form of love that anyone would die to have.

One of the best relationships in kdrama history and one I would be willing to rewatch time and time again.

a great piece of work about love in all its various forms
this is a master piece, a very moving film, the script writer Park Hae Young is a deep thinker about human beings and their social order, especially class and gender in South Korean society. The film plays with love taking the form of romance but shows love to be much more complex and bound up with shared memories and shared forms of pain. I was addicted to the unfolding of the story and I am glad it did not end as a celebration of romantic love but showed the convoluted, self-destructive aspects to love as well as its capacity to make life bearable and enjoyable. A complex film dealing with the permutations in human emotions but never removing these from their embeddedness in workplaces, cafes and restaurants, homes, neighbourhoods and kinship networks. truly superb

Nothing to dislike... the drama is on the edge and brilliant
I have watch a lot of kdrama series over the year and this one tops all of them... if you liked iTaewon Class, Shy Boss, The Heirs, Mr Sunshine, Crash landing, The King.....:: the one is right up there!!!
It portrays of struggles during life as a kid, what difference it brings when we are just kind to one another and not necessarily judge because of difficult upbringing...
The music soundtrack fits the pace of the movie.
Movies series like these korean dramas, makes you urge for more...

Real emotion of human beings...
First I doubt if I will watch it or not because I thought it's a LOVE STORY of a younger woman with the older man but Thanks it's not about romance and I am really satisfied how the story and the characters ended.

NO ROMANCE: One of the reason why I give this 10 because if they end up together I am really gonna hate this drama.Honesty until now I don't know what kind of love they have but I am glad there's no romantically involved.

I love this kdrama because it's about the emotion of human beings.. While watching this kdrama I feel strong emptiness in my heart because you realized same with them you're a human too, You also felt emptiness sometimes.Each characters showed the struggle of human emotions. It's not  about money or status that will make you excepted in this kind of emotions. The two main characters delivered the two aspect of loneliness.Two different people. Two different lifestyle but both of them were felt empty. I satisfied about the ending of the two main lead.They became more open to their own feelings and more happy to their life. They learned to be more confidence for what they want.

This is the first time I watched IU. I am not familiar to her but now I know her better because I start to like her after watching this drama. I am really amazed how she handle the character of Ji-an a gloomy girl. Lee Sun Gyun is great as Dong hoon, one of the best scene was the confrontation to his wife.. I love Kang Ji Yong. He is the one of the best promising new actor. Hehe..

THIS KDRAMA DESERVED A DAESANG AWARD

It really was a life drama. There wasn't really any romance and that's what I liked about it (unlike Goblin for comparison).
The story was really well developed. It had one major plot line but it never felt rushed or too slow.
OST was good. There were definitely standout songs.
I haven't watched other dramas where IU was the lead but she did amazing in this role.
The ending surprised me a bit because it was so positive compared to the rest of the drama. But I guess we needed that.

Lots of relateable quotes in this drama. I thought it was a very realistic drama overall except for the ""son"". It didn't really make sense to me that the son was studying abroad by himself and both the parents didn't seem that engaged. I know it wasn't the focus, but still.

I don't think I would rewatch this drama just because it's quite heavy up until the very end.

This drama really is a masterpiece.
My mister has its originality, beautiful story and well-written characters. it makes me cried so much. its so realistic and also heart-breaking. The story line is relatable because many of us facing so much struggles and hardships in life. The actors and actresses really play their roles so well. The only thing bad about this drama is it END. i really hope there will be season 2. It really makes my life feels empty for a while after it ends. Thats how much i love this drama. Kudos to the scriptwriter, actors and production.

This drama...

...is heavy.

Imagine Misaeng (Incomplete Life) but more depressing and hopeless. Kind of like getting sucked into a black hole and not dying.

And now that I've made you feel terrible about life, let me explain to you why you should watch this drama for Exactly this reason.

You're going to become attached to these characters. Dong Hoon and Ji An's lives are heartrendingly bleak and miserable and unfair, and the drama does not shy away from this fact. Instead, this is the driving force behind everything that happens in the story.

You're gonna hope anxiously that they will get some sort of relief, respite, redemption, restoration, justice. (I wish I could think of a word starting with r that means the same thing as justice.)

And you're going to find yourself frequently disappointed. Sometimes outraged.

What I'm saying is you're gonna feel bad while watching this drama, but you're gonna like it, so you might as well go ahead and watch it already.

So just go ahead and watch it already.

IU's acting was superb!
I wasn't supposed to watch this since it's a drama series but I always see this on my VIU App as recommended.

When I saw the poster, I actually got curious about how IU's acting. By the way, this was her first drama that I watched. It was a good decision watching this after all.

My initial judgment was when I thought about this as a Rom-Com series. But hell, I was wrong! It was drama from beginning to end. It's not a melodrama with exaggerated line deliveries and scenes. It's subtle but sincere. I never thought I'd finished this in 1 day. That's how much I got hooked on to this. I really recommend this!

My first 3 drama reviews here, fair enough I gave a 9.5 rating. Well, they are all well deserved! :)

The Story of Him, A man
(It's morning, I just completed the show, nd this is first song on utube reccs, so I m pretty tranced while writing the review)


When I first opened MYDRAMALIST I was like wtf, such high scores, even such avg lookin and sounding (aynopsis) have all have rating of 8,9 etc

And the top position always changes, nd whatever the best that year it becomes in the TOP SHOW, based in all criterias, at first I thought it was like imdb, where a large group spams scores, but then I understood, unlike anime

KDRAMA is an ever evolving entity, every quarter a much better version comes in form of a show


Now speakin of the show, uffff well what to say


First a lot of things linked up even before I saw the show

It was aired just after MOTHER(the show I saw last week) , so like they have slot of 9.30 to 10.30, thirsdats and fridays and their r 4 quarters,

Jan to March was taken by MOTHER

MARCH TO MAY or I think June was taken THIs show

nd the rest of the year it gave the most popular of shows


secondly the person playin the main character, was the same actor as the rich guy in PARASITE

Coming to the actual show


I was confused of the show's first 40minutes , now the shit is unlike anime, kdrama's drama content and twists happen within just first two eps

Lemme give the example by reciting the synopsis of the show


""""""
CHARA A is a middle-aged engineer who is married to attorney WIFE.

However, his life is not that happy as he has two unemployed brothers, CHARA C and CHARA D, who rely on him.

Moreover, his wife is secretly having an affair with VILLAN A , CHARA A's college junior but current boss.


One day, CHARA A receives an unexpected bribe and notices that his co-worker, CHARA B, witnessed the incident.

CHARA B is a young part-time worker at CHARA A's company who is drowning in debt and left alone to take care of her ill grandmother.

CHARA A then gets entangled in his brothers' struggle to get back on their feet

and the company's internal rivalry between the company's CEO VILLAN A and the people opposing him.

All the while, not knowing that VILLAN A wants to get rid of him,

CHARA B is working for the CEO VILLAN A
""""""""""

This was the synopsis of the show

Nd this all happened ik the first 30min



Just expect what would have happened for the rest of 16eps , 1 hr each


Kdramas work on two things

VERY STRONG, INTIMATE, FLESHED OUT, WELL PACED STORY

AND

THE MOST HEARTIEST BUT THOUGHT OUT CHARACTER interaction



The female protag is 21yr old

The male protag is around 44 yr old

That's y the story is called MY MISTER

now lemme quote from a review

"" This is my ultimate, most favourite Kdrama of all time. It might not suit everyone's tastes, but it was the first time I cried because a drama ENDED. Finally a drama that is beautiful and breathtaking from start to end.

I guess if you're the type to prefer fluffy, lovey dovey, Kdrama cliche type of dramas, then this won't be for you. My Mister is completely different in terms of the ""Kdrama formula."" ""


""
(Slightly) EDITED:
“A story about three brothers in their 40s and a girl in her 20s facing the hardships of life and helping each other through the process.” The initial description of “My Ahjussi” was something along these lines, and as far as the storyline goes, that is enough to tell you the essence of it. A look at the daily lives of three middle aged men and a young girl. How interesting could it be? What could possibly be happening in their lives that makes it engaging enough to have a whole show about them? Is it something extraordinary? Definitely not. Is it something you have never seen before? Not really. But, is it worth watching? Oh god yes.
""


The best part is the relationship between the pritags

Is it

LOVE

TWO OUTVASTS LOOKING FOR EACH OTHER

FATHER-DAUGHTER

PITY AND SYMPATHY HELP

SELFISH SHIT



Till the end u wouldn't know


Won't even go to other relationships in the show the trio brothers, the side stories ufff just uffff


TRUE Depression, dementia, Death

In the most realest and grounded of ways was show which is the main point

Hell the show ended with thr main chara finally crying

I forgot to tell u, the main protag, reminded me of u , since the first time I saw u, his and Yours personality matches down to T


The FEMALRE PROTAG ufffff

I originally have a set plot in my. Mind, but kdrama always breaks it and cosntructs a new one

The gal I thought was just going to get help and have a happy end

But the shit which she did , made me fkin love her


Ep1 I was confused


Ep2-7 I realized I loved her,

Ep 8-10, I realized she became what i originally thought she was

By last ep, inhad fallen off




Korean girls, and their ability to look that BEAUTIFUL without makeup, cant compare man

The WIFE'S skin was literally glowij on my screen


Just ufffff(currently the song going on is BAKEMONOGATARI ED)

It's an amazing drama which has quite an interesting story.
I really enjoyed it, but I actually had dropped it for some time since I have a bad habit of stopping a drama when it gets a little bit boring. I don't like skipping a couple of minutes ahead or even episodes (like a lot of people do for some reason) so I got stuck, but I eventually came back to this drama and wasn't disappointed. I even cried which has become pretty rare for me. The show itself is pretty slow paced at moments, but that's what's appealing about it. The atmosphere is pretty dark and the acting of the whole cast was amazing. All the delivered lines at the very end left me in tears.

Love Love Love!!!
I loved this drama. Initially i watched it for IU but as i watched it i began to like every character and the entire plot. The only this that kind of ticked me off was the wife, Yun-Hee, she made so angry. It seemed like she was playing the victim while she was the one that was cheating. I get it, she's guilty. but don't tell him that you're tired of hearing his sorry's when you should be the one saying sorry. She should be the one happy that he is still with her. I rooted so hard for Ji-An and Dong-Hoon when i got found out she was cheating on him. But they didn't end up together sadly.

Words can't do justice to how great this drama is - just watch it!
Quite possibly my favourite drama ever. Not being hyperbolic - it’s seriously excellent - and bring tissues. Make space and time for this drama it isn’t easily binged as it’s a bit heavy for that but it will totally reward you for that time.

Spoiler free summary - my words can’t really do justice to this drama it’s that good. You just need to watch it - persevere through the initial bleakness - and you will be rewarded by wonderful drama on the heart in humanity, what it is to live, the power of making a connection, community and the kindness of strangers.

The cast are amazing, most especially the main leads - I’ve seen and loved both IU (Hotel del Luna) and Lee Sun Gyun (Coffee Prince) but they are both on another level here. The direction is deft and the writing assured and subtly brilliant. The characters are so wonderfully rounded and authentic, it’s practically trope free for a KDrama and the OST is just top notch.

Please just watch this - it’s a total masterpiece.

Longer spoiler filled review.

Things I liked:
IU as Lee Ji An. I loved her layered performance. She managed to be so dead in her eyes when we first meet her and we know she’s telling us the truth when she says she can’t wait to die. But she’s also scrappy and strong and in those moments she gets a real fire. In later episodes when she cries, when she tells the selection board what it’s meant to have been noticed and treated well by Dong Hun, when she says sorry 10 times, when she thinks Park Dong Hun is mad at her for wiretapping, she shows such emotional vulnerability and her journey from making herself invisible to growing to love and care for Dong Hun is beautiful.

Lee Sun Gyun - he is such a fantastic actor - this role gives you the whole gamut of his range. He basically was Dong Hun. He inhabited that man of deep emotions and not very many words. His voice, so deep and sonorous was like another character in this drama. I absolutely loved the last part when she picked it out in a cafe and was drawn to it. But even his breathing and his footsteps were marked in this. I love how Ji An said they moved her when she heard them.

Them together - I loved their undefined relationship. I loved how they conveyed how special they found each other’s company, how they could be authentically themselves with each other but so subtly. We see how he’s only really able to be himself in her company rather than the guy who doesn’t answer questions of his wife, Mum and brothers. They know each other and they recognise they know each other. It’s the kind of relationship that I know exists, but so rarely gets portrayed. As someone who spiritually believes in a reincarnated life I think these two have deep relationships in the past and in this life they were brought together to heal each other. I loved that she was so frank with her emotions but despite it, it didn’t need to then turn into a mawkish unrequited love or romance, as it wouldn’t fit right.

The brothers - I don’t have a lot of experience of brother only relationships but to me this was such an authentic trio. I loved how different they were, how fiercely they loved each other, faults and all - and most of all like their mum said - when a bad thing happened to 1 of them they were all depressed. They bought some much needed levity to the drama and again these actors just inhabited their respective characters.

The villain - firstly I just love Kim Yeong-Min as an actor - and he made this wholly unlovable character so believable. Rat-like and such a jerk, but a bit menacing with it, we know what Yoon-Hee means when she says she is embarrassed she fell for him. I like that we didn’t need flashbacks to see what kind of person he was at college and how he came to be CEO.

Gi Hun & Yu Ra - they really grew on me and in my own continuation of this drama they get back together again (though they will probably split up and get back together..) I love how they made Yu Ra, this seemingly ditsy character have a lot more depth and some of her lines were some of the most profound in the entire drama. I loved the scene where he broke down and explained why he’d been so awful to her in their movie. Amazing. (I didn’t like this actress Kwon Nara in Suspicious Partners so am glad I’ve seen this performance from her)

Special shout outs to Dong Hun’s Mum - the ever brilliant Go Doo Shim - to an evil but vulnerable Jang Ki Young (giving us glimpses of the man he could have been without the abusive dad) and to Ji An’s grandmother, who made me cry so badly in so many scenes.

Things I didn’t like - nothing. Really nothing. Everything was just pitch perfect.

In fact for me, the writers got everything right in this drama including the bittersweet ending. The only thing I was missing was an explainer on Ji An’s relationship to Ki Bum - I assume he was her childhood friend in the one flashback they had with all 3 of them after one of the times she’d been beaten up. But it s a tiny minor quibble.

And the OST. This is amazing. It’s on repeat. Even if it does make me want to curl up in a morbid ball and sob. Thanks Viki translators as ever but especially for the lyrics of the songs which went so well with the drama.

Very Beautiful Drama
I didn't expect this drama to be so good, I don't usually like watching drama reviews because I don't want to know anything about that drama in advance, I want to be surprised by the story, and I was very surprised, luckily it was a very nice surprise.

Plot 10/10
An interesting plot, unusual, full of unexpected events, as in crime stories, and yet somehow oriented to show the lives of ordinary people and their relationships in their wonderful neighborhood.

The main plot is about the lives of two people who are separated by their age, status, family life and yet similar mental characteristics.
They both feel lonely, especially the male lead, although he has a wife, a child, a mother, two brothers, friends, he still feels lonely and misunderstood, while the female lead has only a few people around her, a difficult childhood and even murder on conscience . These two people are fighting inside and outside so that circumstances would lead them to find each other in that fight, but this is not a typical love story in which they end up with each other, the goal here is not to find physical love but the real unconditional love, love within themselves.

If you have problems in life, this story can help you see them from a different angle, to see the light at the end of the tunnel, to keep the love inside you no matter what happens to you from the outside, if the love is in you, the whole world can hates you but that feeling of love will be in you and keep your soul alive forever.

The family and friendship aspect of the story is portrayed exceptionally in this drama, I really enjoyed it.

Due to its slower pace, this drama is experienced more through emotions and less through the mind, and that is what thrilled me the most.

Cast 10/10
Very good acting of all, especially the main roles who did a really good job showing deep emotions of sadness and loneliness which can be very difficult to express

Music 10/10
Music is great and fits into the atmosphere of the story

Re-watch 10/10
I will watch this again for sure

I strongly recommend this drama.

Full immersion required, not for light viewing
I've been holding back from reviewing this show, my ultimate favorite drama. I feel like I'm not eloquent enough to convey the essence of the show as I would like to. But alas, I think it's time to give it a try. This show deserves at least this much love from me.

My Mister takes you on the familiar road of the mundane, daily worklife in the city; of struggling to make ends meet; of under achievement in life as you grow older (at least for me lol). It is a melancholic story of two unlikely friends, finding a kindred soul with each other.

Each episode may feel slow and heavy, so definitely not for a casual following or even binge watching. I had to stop myself everytime after watching 1 or 2 episodes, feeling drained from the emotions the story has stirred in me. If the first episode doesn't at least intrigue you on how the story will unfold, then it's better to find other, lighter or brighter shows. This show needs your full attention, or none at all. If you go in half hearted, you only set yourself up for disappointment.

As the story unfolds and we discover our main leads' motivations, we also become familiar with a wealth of supporting characters that you either love or hate, for what they each represent to the lives of our main leads. Many support cast get a bit of focus too, adding layers to the story as a whole. I could only peel some of these layers upon rewatching, appreciating alot of nuance I've missed the first time around.

One example (minor SPOILER) would be the twisted dynamic between the loanshark son and our female lead. Lee Ji An's friend asked why she let the son beat her like that, when she would normally not let anyone mess with her. The show won't tell you the answer, but it's one you would naturally arrive to after putting all the clues together. You'll have to watch the show to find out the answer lol. I love that the showrunners trust the viewers to get it, even though I missed it the first time because I'm dull.

Besides the wonderful cast and a richly layered story, the OST is on point in capturing the scenes' mood and emotions. This is such a poignant drama for me that I always tear up when I see people talk about it or even just hearing the theme song. I hope I was able to convey my love for this show despite being so vague in what I wrote. I wanted to set the right expectation before you dive in into this immersive but demanding experience. Cheers!

Watch the series, and you'll want to watch it all over again.
While the rich chase the best positions in companies, the downtrodden try to survive. This series focuses on the latter screaming from the depths of humanity.
Screaming and being heard.
JiAn is a young outcast ready to do anything to get out of debts imposed on her by creditors, who conveniently ""forgot"" that she had no duty to accept the debt.
While working in a company she experiences what had eluded her until then: falling for someone.
Towards the end, DongHoon locates JiAn on the run to make sure she won't have to testify and reveal humiliating details in the life of DongHoon and his wife. DH locates her and enters's JiAn's small room. The scene is akin to a human feeling like a worm when Divine Grace presents Itself (I am unworthy, don't come close to me ...). She got saved!
The wasn't the only one, who bettered her life. Her paralytic and mute grandma died in peace, her accomplice GiBom escaped prosecution, her abuser KwangIl redeemed himself, couples were saved, people found jobs, ...
Watch the series, and you'll want to watch it all over again.

""Every relationship is precious""
A story that I could only describe in one word:
""Perfect"" (10/10)
The title itself ""my mister (ajusshi)"" describes the setting of the story where a young girl meets a middle-aged man and throughout the story, formed a relationship that would further shape the world around them.
Each character has depth, each dialogue has weight, each scene has significance to the story. I love how natural things appear as I watched all 16 episodes of this series. It felt as if I was watching a real person, not a Drama Series, but a real life of a real person. Ji Ahn being this precious little girl, Dong Hoon being the kind & ideal adult, and the good friends that surround the two of them, creates this wonderful world found in their small neighborhood. The story and characters are so well written that it can easily be relatable to any demographic.


The Cast made a really amazing job at portraying to us the characters of this story. The acting was superb and was accompanied by the music that could make your heart melt or make you feel good depending on the scene. The lines were delivered with power and emotion that could make you cover your face and try not to cry, and the scenes were played so well that even when they just stood or walk or even breathed had made me feel the EMOTIONS of each character. The cinematography and the direction of each episode is not of the ordinary Dramas out there, this really gets you immersed to the story and attached to the characters.
Acting/Cast (10/10) , Music (10/10)

This is definitely one of the best Drama series out there. And simply one of my most favorite stories. I would definitely revisit each of my favorite scenes in the future. Rewatch Value (10/10)
As a friend of mine convinced me to watch this drama, I would also highly recommend this anyone interested in watching Dramas that are worth your time and has the good story.
Overall (10/10)

FROM NOW ON, LET'S BE HAPPY.
Watching My Mister was the equivalent of waking up early in the morning while it's raining or snowing outside and curling up beneath the warm sheets, knowing you won't have to get out of bed for a little while longer and you can just enjoy this moment of peace. (I'm not joking when I say that this drama is probably best enjoyed during the months of December and January — at the very least I'm glad I was able to watch it during the month of November.)

There is a lot going on in this drama but at the very heart of it, you have a story about humans. Just humans. Humans eating, humans drinking, humans dying, humans hurting, humans loving. Humans going through the cycle of their everyday lives. Old humans, young humans, rich humans, poor humans, successful humans. Pitiful, pitiful, and yet very nice humans. I'm repeating the word human a lot because quite frankly, that is what this show is about (If you're looking for romance, you might be disappointed, but if you're interested in office politics, I would definitely give this drama a try).

Humans are delightfully messy and sometimes we hurt each other and break beautiful things, and My Mister definitely acknowledges & portrays that side of humanity, but there is a kindness here, too. We live in a very interesting age where it's easy to lose sight of what is important because of the difficulties we face, and we also live in a time where human connection is now more important than ever. We all need people like that in our lives, someone who reminds us to eat and asks us if we want anything from the grocery store or someone who will come to your grandmother's funeral and tell you that if you want it to be nothing then it can be nothing. Watching all of these characters, all of these humans connect with each other, crying for each other, fighting for each other, helped to remind me of that, and I just know that I'm going to be thinking all of these characters and their stories for a while.

Also, as someone's who's struggled with depression and anxiety for several years now, I was pretty astounded at the way My Mister represented these struggles with mental health. I've never seen a piece of media before handle this topic in such a gentle way, and yet at the same time, they also didn't hesitate to show all of the less-than-pleasant parts, too. This was a very honest show; no romanticization whatsoever. They didn't hold anything back, and for that, I really appreciate it.

Overall, if you are perhaps looking for a story centered around the aspects of humanity that often get overlooked in other pieces of media, and if you're in the mood for a good cry, I would definitely recommend My Mister. I fact, I would probably just about recommend this show for everyone in need of something healing to watch.

It was a bit complicate in the beginning since I watch sub because no translate. But i did not give up then I started to understand from episode to episode. Started to understand how broken the girl is and how she surviving. Another interesting point was how she hacked his phone so she knows every moves of him. That's so touching my hearts. then she changes from ignorance to love & care for him. The characters are all amazing in role themselves and it made me very heartbreaking in most scenes and it's also encourage at same time. I do love the both main characters, their facial expression are real. I cried so bad in 1 or 2 episodes before the end. The first most emotional drama i ever watch. It is worth to watch.

I don't even know where to start with this drama. My Mister is simply a masterpiece of a show. From the story, the characters to the OSTs, everything was done perfectly.

First off the story is one of a kind, it's an obvious but this drama expresses love in a way i haven't seen before, it isn't the normal love as in a relationship that we normally see in kdramas but it's the kind of love for humans have and the respect that comes with it. I loved the dynamic between Ji An and Dong Hoon becasue they both had pitiful lives but they brought eachother up and essentially saved eachothers lives. If they didn't meet one another, I really think they wouldv'e died an early death and that breaks my heart. I loved the ending to this show as it showed that they are both living thier lives well and also they both said hi to eachother with a smile on thier faces showing they are keeping to thier promise they made to eachother as in when they bump into eachother on the street they will smile and say hi.

Literally all the characters in this show had a distinct purpose to fulfill in the story.

With Lee Ji An, I personnaly think the casting of IU was perfect and she did amazing expressing the character for Ji An. In the first few episodes I cant lie to you I wasn't fond of her character becasuse of the things she did but the more I saw her I could understand her actions and empthasise with her. I even said to myself that the more she listens in to Dong Hoon's life she will feel for him and see that there is another person like him in the small world she was living in. I really loved how she ended up adoring Dong Hoon and just wanted hom to be happy even though her life was far from perfect.

With Dong Hoon, his character was just perfect, it showed us a raw dipitction of man whos had enough of his life and feels worthless. After meeting Ji An he starts to see the good in life after talking to her more and more and helping her with her issues. The scene that impacted me the most with him was when he was talking to Jeong Hui saying that there is someone that gets him and his pain, also the scene where he went to the loan shark and fought with him. These 2 scenes really just shows how much Dong Hoon respects and treasures Ji An as a human being.

Even though this show wasn't a romance, the bond that the two leads shared will probably be the most precious one they share in life even though they will both have different lovers and this shows that every relationship you have in life is precious and you are meant to treasure them no matter the age becasue there was a 20 age gap but they related and conversed even with that gap.

The side characters did thier jobs perfectly as they all had thier own little story to tell in the big picture which only expanded the story. Dong Hoon's 2 brothers are literally amazing, thier relationship shows what a brotherly relationship can be and how precious they are. One thing I dont understand in this story is the Wife that had an affair, she was so addamant on getting Dong Hoon to quit his job and marry the CEO but when everything got found out she began to pity Dong Hoon and helped him in the end in which i'm telling you if I was in Dong Hoons place I wouldv'e got a divorce straight away becasue it went on for a month and if Ji An didn't expose it then they would of gotten a divorce in the end and she wouldv'e betrayed her son and husband.

The OST in this drama was just simply amazing, every song had meaning to the story and just added to the feels and made me enjoy the story that much more.

Before I watched kdramas and when I started watching kdramas I rarely cried at TV shows that I watched becasue I didn't feel a connection with the shows I watched. But in the past half year, I have cried more than I have in my life from my memory, theres something about kdramas that just bring the soft side out of me and teaches me so many life lessons. In My Mister, I learnt that I should treasure all my relationships and be kind to anyone that needs a helping hand.

Overall, If your looking for a romance this is not the show for you. If your looking for a raw dipiction of life and the hardships that life comes with and to see the bond 2 people can share without it being romantic then i reccoment this show to you 1000% because this show will not disspoint.

Lets Live Happy Life!!!
I know small things matter in life but I never knew it can have a huge impact on a person...This drama taught me why small bits of hope can change a person's life...If there is only one person by side you can live and survive…
I want the drama to continue but I don't want it at the same time...The drama is so satisfying till the end and the drama knows how to end an episode…
The journey our characters go on in this drama is so real and believable it feels like seeing real people living their lives...This drama is so mature in how it handles things...Things I can understand but I don't know how it will feel if it happened to me…
Our main lead is not a “K-drama male lead” he is a middle-aged man making millions who want to die but can't because of this family, there is no one who can understand him until one person enters his life...Her name is Ji Ahn played by IU...she is a cold character who does not get along with anyone and can do anything for money...as you watch the drama you will see why she is this way and you will cry for her…
Every character has something in the show that has layers to them...The male lead in this drama is my fav lead in any Kdrama (Park Dong Hoon played by Lee Sun Kyun)...and If I watch his drama when I am in my 40’s...I may cry even more for him
I love this drama...I am writing this after re-watching it...Saying small things like ""Hang in there"", ""You are a good person"". ""Its not a big deal"", ""Want me to get you something"" can really help a person live

Phenomenal Side Character Writing.
NOT A LOVE STORY but kinda is though
GREAT ACTING, dialogues, greatly written, perfectly connected and realistic characters, 2-3 good music pieces
premise:
the most innocent, forgiving and kind guy as MC who lives in a neighbourhood of people who just by being on-screen make you and his day better.
but MC gets cheated on by his wife with his CEO.

The show revolves around how the MC deals with family, love, office problems

the ending was good but could have been more elaborated

the side stories and MCs interacting with them is an example of phenomenal writing
it offers drama, heavy and realistic life situations and problems.
The ending could have been more detailed but other than that the show was 10/10 '
highly recommended by me

I was moved to tears by this movie
It's such a humane story and delves into the thoughts of the normal everyday man trying to make ends meet and the the trials and tribulations they go through. The story was impeccable and showed that even if you fail there is still hope.
It just allows you to see human beings as beings and empathize and even recognize yourself in them.
This is definitely a learning experience and I highly suggest that it's very much worth watching
The actors we very good in their ability to interpret how they were feeling and it showed how people view grief, success,failure and happiness and the emphasis places on trying your best to find comfort in your life no matter what life throws your way.
I was a bit hesitant about the story in the beginning because I thought it would be another cliche of a story but it ended up being so deep and pensive that I found myself weeping alongside these characters. I guess you could say they really do hit the nail on the head with regard to they tell the story of the every day man

Best thing ever to watch
This is a kind of story that at the end you can't find a word or phrase to describe the worth of it.
Truly say this is a worthwhile drama.
I know the actors act amazingly but what made me fascinate were the plot and dialogs.
I got sick of shallow and mundane dramas and movies, I always wanted to watch some real and authentic characters far away from any cliche in such a realistic story. Guess what, My Mister fulfill this wish.
I love it and I'm going to watch it again and again and again...

A Masterpiece!
There is nothing more that can be said about this drama which has not been said already. So i can just start by showing my own dedication for this drama by opening an account just to review it after 2 yrs. You can tell about the quality of a drama if you cant find its replacement even after 2 yrs.
Now to start, The people who should avoid this drama? - Pre- teens / teens , those who still live in fantasy world!
Who should watch it? - Any Adult or mature person with enough life experience will truly appreciate this masterpiece.
What is the specialty of this drama? - Other than the usual like smooth & packed storyline, Great acting , OST etc
the real deal of this drama is how it captures greatness in simplicity. Now dont get me wrong I
appreciate all the supernatural dramas too but this is on another level its like watching Breaking Bad first time and not finding words to describe it. In this show you'll see what walking with a heavy heart feels, what it really means to have a warm heart, what integrity looks like, what being a family really means , what guilt actually feels like, what to Love sby really means!(Not the lead), what renunciation really means, the joy of companionship, and last but not the least how to show immense Love, Respect and admiration without WORDS!

Any special character? - Other than the leads (3 bros and The girl), there are 4 special characters - 1.The lady shop owner, 2. The cleaner , 3. The grandmother, 4. the Monk. You'll know why they are special when you watch the show.

Any drawbacks? - The only drawback I can think of is a character related to the youngest brother that character should not have been given that amount of screen time, and That's why I am not giving it 10\10.

After finishing this drama, I can not pass on the opportunity to write this review.

Do not go into this show expecting either a romance or a comedy. Instead, you will get a heart-warming story expressing themes which will change your perception of grief, life, depression and the good in human beings.

The story of ""My Mister"" is not your average cookie-cutter drama plot. The themes of hardship, happiness, love and redemption are all consistently strengthened and expressed through beautifully written story and character design. It is rare to come across a drama that feels as if each scene holds the writer's thoughts and beliefs, as if they were speaking directly to you.

A struggle a new watcher may find in this show is the pacing of the plot. The story itself is slowly paced, but grows deeper and more intricate as you spend more time with each character. As you begin to learn the truth about Dong Hoon, Lee Ji An and how the two change each other's fate, you will come to understand the significance of this story. If you find the beginning episodes boring, please endure it and see the story through, you will not regret it.

While the show is fantastic, I do not think that a rewatch is necessary and would not enhance the story.

The music in a drama is meant to compliment the scenes and strengthen the emotions. Many people obsess greatly with the music of a drama, but I believe it should only be taken alongside the scene, rather than analyzed seperately. The soundtrack has a handful of songs, all timed well enough that each scene feels complete with it. However, there were some scenes where it felt worse because of the music. Overall, complimentary and works with the emotions.

Please consider watching, this was one of the best experiences I've had in dramas.

This drama is emotionally heavy and every episode is heartbreaking. You will cry a lot, it almost does not feel like a movie or like anyone is acting. You can identify yourself with all characters, which is great as the feelings are more relatable-however it does affect you. I actually waited 4 weeks before I watched the last episode, somehow could not bring myself to do it. However, they have ended the drama in a very positive way, which I am satisfied about. If you have watched Misaeng and if you felt it was difficult to watch because of all the injustice and hardships, then this drama has the same type of feeling. You feel bad and very sad for the main characters.

I don't usually post a review on a series, movie or anime but this series ""My Mister"" hit me hard. This series is unique from what you always watch. It is a must watch series because it will teach us many things that can change perspective in our lives.
Please be ready to scenes that some of them will make you sad or cry. This series would be my memorable and favorite on all I've watched in my entire life. I want to thank and give credits to the director, cast, staffs, etc. for bringing best series that will make you feel the entire scenes and relate to it.

UNPOPULAR OPINION: I did not like it
I started this because I love IU, but I stayed for Park Dong Hoon. I wanted him to get everything that he deserves. The man is gold and full of wisdom.

What I liked:
1. Obviously Park Dong Hoon.
2. The friendship the soccer club has.
3. Ji-an's grandmother and Dong-Hoon's mom.

What I dislike: Everything else. First off, IU's acting was topnotch as always, but I found her character annoying and she seems like deciding unwisely at times, making things worst.

Second, the love affair that they've been trying to portray just did not work for me. I mean, the story would still have been great even if they did not add the romance part between Dong Hoon and Jian. It was far stretched. It was also clear that Dong Hoon was not interested with Jian, he just cared for him. But towards the end, they've been trying to push for the romance part further.

Third, I hated the actress. The romance between the brother and the actress was so unnecessary and annoying. Their dialogues were cringy. Tbh, I fast forwarded their screen times. The character of the actress was, I'm sorry for the word, but it was pathetic and empty.

I wanted to stop halfway because maybe this is just not my cup of tea, but I wanted to see Joon Young and the wife get wrecked.

Maybe I expected too much from this because it has a great rating of 9.1, but overall, I did not like it. But thank God, they promoted Dong Hoon.

To each his own.

An Emotional Masterpiece
It's really hard to explain My Mister to somebody, as I found recently when trying to convince a friend to watch it. But you really, really must. The synopsis isn't exciting - an unhappy man in a good job meets an unhappy girl in a minimum wage job and the two help each other, whilst surrounded by office politics, grim personal lives and the odd comedic moment. Where this drama really comes alive is in the acting, the characterisations and the reality. This drama is so real, gritty and sadly relatable and does a wonderful job of portraying the value of human connection.

The male lead, Park Dong-hoon, expertly portrayed by Lee Sun-kyun (LSK), is the eldest of three brothers, stoic and very much the one in his family who has ""got it all together"". He shows little emotion to his family and co-workers, but very quickly the viewer sees the pain he's suffering in his day to day life. He's also a genuinely good person, full of integrity and compassion, and LSK shows a phenomenal amount of emotion through his acting - largely through his eyes and facial expressions in a notably quiet character. You can't help but want the best for him.

Meanwhile, Lee Ji-an, played by the songstress IU (or Lee Ji-eun), delivers the best performance of her career living the life of a young woman in poverty, whose sole purpose in life seems to be taking care of her disabled & deaf grandma in her dilapidated studio. Barely able to scrounge a meal together for herself, she genuinely looks dead inside, and comes across as cold and guarded. It's a remarkable performance from one of Korea's most effervescent personalities. Even more so than LSK, IU's character has numerous heart-breaking moments throughout the show - they're phenomenally performed and desperately sad.

Overall, the story is incredibly hard-hitting. It really highlights problems of poverty, depression and corporate greed whilst making it clear that people can really make a positive impact on each other's lives. With Breaking Bad levels of characterisation, a wonderful supporting cast that I'll let you experience for yourselves, an amazing OST that will make you tear up months after finishing the show, phenomenal cinematography and direction, My Mister is truly one of a kind. You'll be locked in until the end, rooting for everyone to find happiness, walking away with a knot in your stomach with conflicting pain from what you just witnessed and optimism for what might become.

I had no regrets watching this drama
My Mister is not your typical Korean drama. If I were to describe it, the story is too beautiful and enthralling that you don't want to miss a single episode. But it's also a drama that makes you not watch it with a back-to-back episode. That is because you need a lot of time to absorb and digest every episode of it. The simple, pragmatic story, the dramatic urban location, the tender yet sensible portrayal of characters will immerse you deeply into the drama and makes it hard to recover quickly. To be honest, it took me almost a month to finish all 16 episodes. Even though I have time, I couldn't watch more than one episode. Well, I tried once, but it took me more than a week before I could watch again. This is what makes an outstanding drama.

My Mister is not a typical Korean drama. It will not make you laugh. It won't make you cry either. Every episode leaves viewers a heavy feeling but makes them ponder more life and survival, and in the end, will give you the feeling of realization. One may find it depressing, but it's not. It's a healing drama and a good reminder of how one can still lead a good and happy life despite the hardships he endures.

Just beautiful overall story portrayed by wonderful cast of actors. The various support cast has amazing chemistry with the main leads who also had alot of chemistry. Fully rounded characters except for the maybe the main antagonist but the actor did still did a great job. The young antagonist was excellently written and the actor did a wonderful job with his part of the script.

The original music was beautiful and original and really well edited into the show.

There was no lag in the middle episodes -- each episode was necessary and kept my attention.

While watching this I got carried emotionally by this drama. Pretty dark and sad. It made me really ponder about life which is never easy. Living your life has never been an easy task. IU's acting got delivered well and I could felt the emotions she felt. For the ahjussi whose wife who commited an affair with his friend was also heartbreaking. But the thing that I remembered the most is the monk who left his girlfriend cause he don't wanna continue suffering as Buddhism has a lesson that living is suffering. I'm glad that in the end, both of the leads live a happy life. This drama has left a good impression for me.

I didn't know about this drama until I saw the results of the polls 2018. This was so good. I love IU (actress or singer) and I couldn't imagine anyone who could portray Ji An better than her. Also I really liked Do Joon Young and Kwang Il, the actors portrayed their characters very well. The other characters made the story much better.
The music was gorgeous, even if they're not the type of music I listen. I liked the old songs from this drama, as well.
Now, I want to see more dramas which could give me the vibe this drama gave to me. I will surely rewatch this someday.

Not a typical Korean Drama
This is not a typical k-drama. Story of people who are struggling in their life, irrespective of their financial status. Amazing story line and acting voilà. IU has beautifully played the character of Lee Ji-an. There are only a few Idol who can sing and act good, she is good in singing as good as in acting, and Lee Sun Kyun is an amazing actor. I have watched his work, coffee prince, Parasite and The Advocate: A Missing Body with Kim Go Eun etc. All are drama and movies are must watch for everyone.

Don't miss this gem
I guess at this moment this is one of my most favourite kdramas.
I found it accidentally searching for films in which IU (Lee Ji-eun) had a main role (after watching Hotel del Luna)
What a big surprise
I agree with other reviews, maybe is not for everyone. A big film about human relationships, friendship, family, people like us.
I don't want to reveal anything about the story. Just give it a chance and watch the first episode.
Lovely, caughty and breathtaking from episode 1 to 15.

This is the first ever review I'll share. Which is really a big deal for me. Since I always have this feeling that my reviews,comments,feelings, and feedbacks from every drama I watched are all one-sided, like it's too much of a personal opinion for me so I couldn't care less about sharing it to people. 'nyways, here's the thing, i wasn't at all prepared about what I'll get from this drama. I just thought I'm gonna see a different one, well yes I did but the emotional rollercaster was what really made me have these deep feelings for the drama. All emotions was felt through my heart. Who would've thought that the gloominess and that monotonous ways of the characters would make a huge impact, that's really some bomb acting right. This ain't a romantic drama but deym u gonna feel the love, that love feeling that makes you cry, well it made me cry, a lot, even now while I'm typing while having flashbacks of the scenes. That's how far it got through in me. After finishing every set of episodes every night, the scenes and the feelings would still linger when I close my eyes. I think there's no end to this review about how it made n impact for me so I'm gonna end this by just telling to WATCH THIS RN if you wanna feel that mixed emotions playing in your heart and be captivated by the bb acting of characters.

I had finished watching ""My Mister ""and I had loved it. Iu acting was so fascinating. It's worth watching it.
All the characters was so good they were totally in to it.
The Male lead is also good, the most importantly Iu character is good.
I also liked the music of this drama, Sondia voice was very soothing, all the ost's were also good
U all will probably love watching the drama.
The screenplay is good as also the story Is too good.
I am a fan of Iu and also her acting is good In this story
Her character is different from other stories, in every drama she plays a role as a baby doll and in this drama she was very bold, her character as a child only very sad. She suffers from the childhood and as a result she became bold and continues her life as a bold girl. When she meets the male lead she analyzes his life and his character and finally fell for him.

FOR ANYONE THAT WANTS TO FEEL LOVED, WATCH THIS SHOW
this is something I should've done long time ago, after rewatching it again I got the feeling that I have to share my feelings for this show, I wont say my life was hard, but at the time I watched this show, I was in a situation no one should be in, and could relate to this show a lot, therefore whenever I rewatch it hits hard on how did I manage all what I've been through, back when you first watched this show, it gave me the warmest hug ever, and after all this time when i rewatched it again it still gave me a hug that is not less warm to what I've got on the first time, this show is ""PURE GOLD""

Why you should or shouldn't watch this drama
Before I begin my review I would like to say that all that I write here is my own opinion and what I felt like when I watched this drama. I love watching dramas and especially reviewing them in my own way. Whatever I write is what I may have felt when I watched this drama. Please don't get offended in any way if your views don't match mine.

I have watched a fair share of drama mostly romance and also have explored other genres as it is good to expand your view range. This drama is totally different from any other drama I have watched so far, even though I have watched many. The lead actors Lee Sun Kyun, IU, Park Ho San, Song Sae Byuk and other supporting actors did a very good job at portraying their characters which makes this drama worth watching. You may wonder why I am writing this review after almost 4 years of its release that's actually I have skipped this drama when it was airing in 2018 because of its heavy topic. But oh! boy oh! boy, if you don't watch this drama you really are missing out.

You probably may have seen IU in Hotel Del Luna, Moon Lovers etc. which received a lot of love from her fans and others. In this drama, she has really played a very difficult character that looks easy on the surface but is definitely not. Her character is full of emotions like depression caused due to various reasons, which you will get to know if you watch this drama there are many other emotions and expressions that Lee Ji Ahn (character that IU is playing) portrays throughout this drama. She is selfish and self-centred a type of person usually people hate, but the way she is because of certain factors that the drama covers. Ji Ahn is unpredictable, in one scene you will feel like she is a good person in the very next scene you may hate her. She really showed commendable acting skills in this drama as Lee Ji Ahn.

Like I said in the beginning this drama is nothing like what you may have watched previously, this drama has a lot of heavy topics that it covers, the title doesn't reflect it that well though. though the title is quite three dimensional if you analyse it after you complete watching this drama. I personally am a binge-watcher but when it came to this drama I surely couldn't binge-watch this, I will definitely not recommend anyone to binge-watch this drama as you need time to analyse each and every single episode, there are very minute details that you need to follow to get along with how the plot will unveil itself. WARNING: You may feel depressed after watching this drama though.

The first few episodes are quite slow which can make one feel like giving up, but I can tell you one thing that is please don't give up the drama yet wait and see how beautifully the narrative arc is. You may think it is boring at first but the moment you reach the part of rising action you will not be able to leave it that is my guarantee to you as someone who has watched this drama. You need to carefully and minutely follow the story it is almost like a treasure hunt, this drama is more like a novel than a film I suppose in that case. This is a different yet well-written plot. Park Hae Young, the screenwriter did an amazing job. She was able to somehow thread the loose bits together very well. A quality of a great writer is someone who is not only a good storyteller but a good weaver as well.
(You need to figure out the rest by watching this drama)

Thank you for reading, I hope that you enjoy this drama.

A Slow-Burner... But a Good One At That!
I have heard so much raves about My Mister on social media, with many people hailing it as one of the best K-drama series of all time. Since, it was on Netflix, I had to watch it. I was surprised by the tone and atmosphere of this series, which was unlike any of the K-dramas that I've seen thus far. It's a different kind of Kdrama. One that is more depressing , dark and melancholy. Engaging and touching, this series was very good though it is a slow-burner I must say. It does take patience to watch this series, but you do get rewarded. I love that the story is bout friendship not love. I love that the two leads develop a deep friendship rather than love, which we have seen so many time before. On a side note, this series reminded me of Parasite with the idea of poor but intelligent individuals conning wealthy people for money. Acting, production and story were all quite good though there were a few questionable moments, especially during the first few episodes.

For Episode 1, why didn't Dong Hoon put the money in his bag which was right under his desk. Why would he go through the trouble of getting a folder to cover the package and putting it in the drawer. Even when he believed that there was the possibility that Lee Ji Ahn saw his hide the package, why wouldn't he just put it in his bag right then? Even when Lee Ji Ahn asked him for dinner, he could have still put the package into his bag (even if she was lording over him which I assumed that she was). If she asks what the package is, he could easily lie and say that it's nothing. Even angle-wise, I'm not sure that Lee Ji Ahn would be able to see Dong Hoon open the package since he did have a barrier to his left which could have easily covered this act. And why would the guy in charge of the electricity room help her? And she didn't even give him a cut of the money. Of course, I'm being nit picky.

I felt that there were too many coincidences in the first few episodes. Such as in Episode 3, how did the brother know that the waiters at that club wore that uniform when it seemed like he was there for the first time. And there's no way that Ji Ahn orchestrated that hit-and-run as she would have to time exactly when he was wake up at the hotel, etc. Too many factors to take into account.

All in all though, it was a great K-drama series. Not the best K-drama that I've seen, but definitely one of the best. *Fighting*

Kang Yoon Hee's character
Kang Yoon Hee is a actual bitch & whore. All she knows to how to get fucked up/sex (have an affair) with Do Joon Young. And when Kang Yoon Hee found out that Park Dong Hoon knows about her affair & Do Joon Young will not going to marry her, she acted liked a complete fucked up bitch/whore. She felt guilty that Do Joon Young will not going to marry her. She didn't felt any guilt towards her husband (Park Dong Hoon) and her son. She is a real life slut and a bitch.

Park Dong Hoon seems like a genuine guy who needs lots of love & for him, family comes first. But this bitch went all the way around to get fucked up with his junior. And she also wanted to get Park Dong Hoon fired from that company.

Seriously, she is a actual whore. Fuck her.

A very moving story about two lost souls
I'm so emotional after the last episode 😭😭

What I liked:
- IU's performance. I love love love Ji An's story. It's basically similar to Ash from Banana Fish - someone good growing up in a horrible situation, having to do soul-crushing things to survive, becoming ground down and hardened, but coming to life when someone is kind and warm to them and seeing that life can have good things too and finally learning what it means to be alive and human. What a great analogy for childhood trauma. So many moving and scenes lines from Ji An/IU 😭😭 I really loved her arc
- Male lead, played by Lee Sun Kyun, was great too
- I love the theme of community and family, I loved the music, I loved the directing - very stylish - and I really liked all the side characters
- Lee Ji Ah's character is someone I didn't think I would like but her arc was really 😭
- refreshing that a life drama doesn't have romance as its center point

What I didn't like:
- pace was very slow for someone like me who is easily bored and imaptient. I had to put this show on fast forward and skip scenes sometimes. The last episode had so many emotional punches; I wish the writer had kind of paced them throughout the entire series, coz most of the series is REALLY slow
- some of the sideplots were kind of uninteresting, I didn't really care about them and their inclusion felt abrupt (especially the monk)
- there were some themes that I felt like the drama didn't portray so well, the biggest of which was Lee Ji Ah's character, Kang Yoon Hee. I did not like how marriage was portrayed, I did not like the way they treated her character when it came to the affair

Heartwarming :)
I came to know about this drama after becoming a Uaena. And, I am quite sad that I didn't watch this drama earlier.
This is one of the best dramas which I have watched. A heartwarming, beautiful and soothing story.
Sometimes a show comes along that is so insightful, so unexpectedly profound and so transcendently beautiful that you are left without adequate words to describe it. This is that show.
Thankyou for making me smile and cry at the same time. Each episode left me with watery eyes.
Thankyou so much for creating this master piece.

Hmmm from the beginning I'm not excited about this drama. I want to watch this drama because of IU. I even sleeping cause of the length of the drama so long. But after seeing some reviews I just wonder what makes people fall in love with this drama. after I try to watch it again in the middle of the episode. Finally, I know this drama contains much moral life from a hard life, loyalty, and pure love that means not belong each other but support each other. And every interpersonal relationship has a special way for each other. This drama has many sad scenes about life that maybe happened in our life. I feel so sad, pain, and heartache even when IU cried. She has a magic to make me cry and feel what she feels. IU's acting is great. In here she is really hard work for be Ji An that opposite with her character as IU. Besides that, Ahjussi Himneyo !! Dong-hoon is an introvert so he can't express his feeling well. He buried his feeling inside his heart and make me sad to see him. I love to see three musketeers brothers that support and always be there for each other.

The soundtrack also really supporting the scene and situations. Anw I hate why Jang ki Yong so cruel in here. I just watched ""go back couple"" and fall in love with his character as nam Gil sunbae but now I really angry to see his character in here. I also feel pity for Joon Young. All his plan failed even though I think he's one of the antagonists cast in here. But he loses against Park Dong Hoon. He also already paid Ji An but as a result, she betrayed him, and at the end episode he maybe gets punished or jailed and lost his title as CEO. He also was punched by Dong Hoon but he can't fight. After this drama ends I learn many things in life. Thank you ""My Ahjussi""

Mixed Emotions
I'm conflicted about the ending. Mostly, I enjoyed it because the actors sold the drama, but the writers put too many characters into the storyline, and the ""unequivocal love"" was a waste at the end. **SPOILER** The two main characters have a complicated emotional relationship. After enduring and embracing each other's hardships together, they have a lot in common despite their age difference. In the end, he and his wife are still together: yet, she and their son are living in the US now while he stays in Seoul. He seems to keep his promise and is living a happy life as a CEO, and she has found peace in her new life. Both have grown together and separately with great admiration for one another. It was an okay ending, but they may have well never seen each other again and just kept tabs on each other through mutual friends. Although you see a possible rekindle deep emotions through a small hand gesture and eye contact, it's just left up to your imagination.

A perfect description of a dysfunctional family. It starts off with the lead character Park Dong Hoon having problems at work receiving a bribe. The way the story unfolds after that is one best and on point descriptions of how one mans life can unravel. On the other side it describes one persons misery and how Lee Ji An somehow has come to terms with her pitiful fate and just lives on to live. The leads have their own issues and it's a story about how every issue one person might have a community or family can rise above. From the start there is an immadiate chemistry between the leads and an intrigue about how the connection between the two will unfold. Really impressed about Lee Sun Kyun and IU as leads as well as Park Ho San and Jang Ki Yong as oldest brother and angry antagonist. Overall one of the best I've seen.

I didn't want to write a negative review. For a long time, I was thinking, ""Okay, I didn't like it, I didn't find it interesting. That does not mean that someone else didn't find it interesting either. Why rain on somebody else's parade?"" But then I read other people's reviews on the dramas that I enjoyed and realized: tastes vary, so do opinions. Why can't I share my opinion, however negative it might be?

My apologies to all who loved this drama. Everything I am going to write is MY POINT OF VIEW. If you see it differently - good for you, it's because you are different and no two people are alike in this world. Not even identical twins.

Let me start by telling you that I really, really tried to enjoy this drama. At least two of my friends found it engaging. I have made serious attempts to watch it (seven times, to be exact). However, this drama is just not for me. Which is totally okay. It would be odd if everyone had the same taste, wouldn't it be? So, if I didn't like it, there might be somebody out there who didn't like it either.

Let's start with the PLOT. My main problem with the plot is that it's boring. The main characters are three brothers. Now, I would understand if it was three sisters. Then I would watch it. But three brothers? Plus, let's be completely honest here, those brothers are not exactly eye candy. They are just middle-aged guys, I wouldn't want to watch a shower scene with any of them.

Now, if one of them was Seo Kang Joon and another one Kim Myung Soo (L), I would consider watching. But alas, it wasn't the case. Sigh. The only hot-looking hunk there is Jung Ki-Yong and they made him a villain! How dare they!

If I had to summarize the plot in one sentence, it would be: two wounded souls meet each other and change each other's lives by helping to heal each other's traumas. I will be completely honest: I copied it from somebody. I was just too bored to finish watching the series, so I could not possibly summarize the entire plot.

Am I interested in two people healing each other? Not really. To heal your past trauma, you need to see a therapist, not some equally wounded individual. But that's just my point of view. Of course, in dramas, it might look better, but it's just a drama.

Also, the plot is way too unrealistic for me. Yes, it's not fantasy but it is very close to fantasy, I am sorry - who is going to believe that a girl had to wiretap the guy and listen to everything he says and does 24/7 when they have a much better way of doing it now? Just record everything by using a special app. My lord, she might have missed so much valuable information. What an old-fashion way of doing things. I am not buying it.

Also, the FL's life story is somewhat overstretched. They should have added that she was the first woman astronaut on Mars and that in her spare time she was raising white tiger cubs - and that wouldn't be too much compared to what she had to go through already.

My only question is how gullible do people have to be to believe this stuff? No, really?

Now, let's talk about the main characters. I have nothing against Lee Sun Kyun, he is great. IU. on the other hand, not exactly so. Now, to all of you out there - I am not a hater. I can say the following about IU: she is very pretty and she is a talented person as well. If I were a guy, I would probably keep a picture of IU on my phone and even the computer screen. But I am not a guy. No matter how beautiful and charming IU is, I only view her as an actress. She is stunningly beautiful and she has a nice voice, but acting is not exactly her thing. Yes, I know, she was in many dramas. So were many other kpop singers and their acting skills didn't improve.

I get it why IU participates in so many dramas. She is widely popular and every time her name is added to the series, her ""army of followers"" jack up the ratings. I get it. But one thing is to be pretty and sing well, and another thing is to be a good actress.

The difference between a good actress and a great actress is that a good actress can show different expressions on her face. A great actress is the master of microexpressions. Microexpressions are something that only some people can pick up. An example of microexpression could be ""smiling with your eyes only"" when the corners of your mouth do not move, yet your eyes are smiling.

When IU is ""acting"", she is still IU. The difference is: sometimes it's a happy IU, and sometimes it's a crying IU. I have watched many dramas with her and never ever she has been LIVING through her character. There was only one drama, I forgot the title, that was kind of close. IU was playing a singer and she was walking around with a big guitar. The reason why IU fit there was that she was basically playing herself.

In this particular drama, IU has tried everything: ruffled hair, gloomy look, tomboyish walk. The only thing that she didn't try was to become a different person and living somebody else's life. Not sure why. Either it was too hard for her or she doesn't know how to do the method. On the positive side, she will be popular no matter what she does.

Well, I think I wrote quite enough even though I am not even half done with the reasons why this drama was, in my opinion, not that great. Again, if you loved this drama that much, do not feel upset. We all have our points of view. To each his own.

This was a cute story but bland. IU did very well, I feel she was not the right actress for Lee Sun Kyun. Lee Sun Kyun also did very well in this but I feel he was the wrong actor to play this part for IU. Sorry that I feel like that. The storyline was cute, dramatic at times. It had its ups and downs. At least the character of Park Dong Hoon was faithful to his wife. I have a different view for the ending but I will keep my lips sealed. The music they played was repeated throughout the drama was not good for me. I'm more of a fantasy type of person, wanting more action in a drama. All the actors played their part.

ANOTHER HYPED DRAMA ROMANTICIZING CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS

I’d probably get bashed by fans for this but…

I just cannot absolutely enjoy a drama portraying cheating, stalking and blackmailing that fans keep romanticizing just because the characters have more than one trait that make up their personality. I feel a lot of people are quick to get attached to dramas with seemingly three dimensional characters because that’s something that we don’t see often but being invested to the point of justifying their behaviors that are outright violations is just ridiculous.

People would come at you if you even say that the behaviors are questionable. I don’t get why they keep talking about how the characters are deeply flawed which makes them real but when it comes to judging their behaviors, suddenly it’s all fiction? I swear if Ji an was a guy, they wouldn’t feel the same way.

If you’re looking for a slice of life drama, this is not it. There are other ways to make the characters “human” and the story feel raw without romanticizing their “flaws” that are not actually just unethical behaviors trying to give depth to the characters.

i'm on EP 4 and so far i like this, like the plot and highly recommend it. This is one of those dramas where there is no rich handsome boy and you still enjoy it hahahahha. And OMG IU!!! , her acting standard is so classy and very much hollywood material, she is one of those actress which you can watch where there is no romances, she is so young yet she is like those veteran actresses, kudos to IU!!!
I feel bad for the grandma though, i like how she rolled out of the hospital, that's uncommon scene.

WORST HIGH RATED KD EVER
OMG this was beyond my imagination of how a drama can be this bad

Extremely boring
Too long with no need
Very detailed
Very slow pace
Dark light during directing which made you depressed
And IU made it much worse for me

I could bear only 2 episodes and I was dying
I couldn't bear anymore
It was same as just between lovers

If you didn't like (just between lovers) like me,
so you definitely won't like this one

The catastrophe I jumped to last episode and I get about 70% of what happened during the hole drama
Which means it's really an awful drama

And it stamped with this sad stupid end
Horrible from all aspects ??‍♀️
