This series may go down as one of the most stunning I've seen to date. Everything about it was beautiful and heartbreaking at once. The cinematography and the music are worthy enough, and the costuming is gorgeous as well. I didn't originally even plan to watch this show. I didn't think it would be a subject that would interest me because I don't normally care for historical dramas. I was sucked into the grip of this show immediately and was not let loose until the final credits came. Knowing that this series had its basis in real Korean history was never far from my mind. The writer managed to weave an epic tale of love and sacrifice. I never noticed the slow plot movement in the first part because I was so immersed in the path to get there. Each step is important to the overall storyline. And the culmination of the groundwork that was laid made the slow build up worth the wait.

The only main actor I had watched before was Yoo Yeon Suk, but I had not been a fan. I knew of Lee Byung Hun, but had never watched him in anything. I was blown away by the acting of all 5 main characters. Some may say otherwise, but I thought they were flawless in these roles. Kim Tae Ri was especially captivating. Her beauty and her voice were mesmerizing to me. Some thought LBH was too expressionless, but I found him quite the opposite. And when he unleashed one of his smiles, I was enchanted. For the first half or so, I felt like the chemistry between the Eugene and Ae Shin was very thick. There was a bit of shift afterwards, but nevertheless they had something there. I was very moved by the acting of the other three as well, and they all became very beloved characters that I rooted for. Dong Mae and Hina were the anti-heroes. And Hee Sung was a hero in disguise. They were all complex and compelling and I loved each of them for varying reasons. The extended cast was no less impressive, and no less part of this story - I couldn't even begin to name them all and what they added to the narrative.

The story is not all tears and sadness though. In the beginning, there is definitely some humor in the mix as well to keep it from becoming too solemn. The writer really did a great job carrying us forward with each new step that our characters faced. I loved all the relationships that were formed, and the bravery of the Righteous Army, and the people of Joseon who captured my heart. So when it got to the climax, we were more than ready ---and yet, somehow, not prepared at all.

The music chosen was excellent. Haunting and lovely. Sad March and The Day were the main songs. And a sad, melodious version of Greensleeves to top it off.

I know that I gave it a 10 for re-watch value. I would absolutely watch this again, but I don't think my heart could handle it anytime soon as it's already ripped to shreds right now! Even if you think that historical shows are not for you, I think everyone that loves Korean dramas and culture should not miss this show. I would not recommend this show to anyone that is looking for fast paced or satisfying happy bows. You would be looking at the wrong thing here. But if you want a story that will move you and mesmerize you, this is where it's at.

When I watch Mr. Sunshine, I feel like I am watching an Oscar nominated film.
Mr. Sunshine is comprised of everything you would want in a drama. It has a stunning and talented cast, mesmerizing cinematography, an engaging and compelling plot that keeps you hooked begging for the next episode, complex/dimensional characters, quotable writing, and even comic relief. Don't let the first episode fool you in terms of heaviness as this drama has plenty of laughs to balance the grittiness. I find myself laughing throughout the entire episode, in between my tears. Each episode just gets better, and nothing feels like it's dragged, there's not an overdone use of flashbacks or that thing kdramas do when they the repeat a scene 5 times from different angles so we can see each side of the characters (like, can we just see the scene once from one angle, do we need to see them do the same thing 5 times in 5 different angles?? Thank you, Mr. Sunshine, for not doing this.) Honestly, this show has it all and it is now on my list of my favorite kdramas to date.

What I think I like most about Mr. Sunshine besides it being absolutely beautiful to look at is the characters. The main leads are compelling, as well as the rest of the main cast who have me rooting for them as well as feeling for them. They are layered, their decisions are not hasty, and they are not the types of characters you normally see in dramas. These characters really feel like humans making human decisions; I can see their reasoning, their logic, and empathize with them. Eugene defends his country, while feeling his ties to Korea, while Ae-Shin defends her country, which is Korea, and both of them are committed to their causes whilst figuring out their feelings for each other and how they can balance both. Dong-Mae, who rises from nothing, is someone I empathize with and somehow also root for despite his not so commendable actions, along with Hui-Seong, who turns to vices to fight with his inner demons. I honestly love them all and cannot get enough! Once this drama is finished, I know I will miss them dearly, like old friends.

Something else I must mention is the portrayal of the female characters. BRAVO WRITERS for writing such strong, smart, clever, and independent women who do not need a man to rescue them. Both Ae-Shin and Hina are absolutely AMAZING! Girl power! They are both autonomous, self-reliant women who stand up for their causes and do not run away from danger. They do not sit still, and when they disagree with something, they say it! They are smart and take everything by the reigns, which is something more kdrama female leads should do: they need to rise up and speak for themselves and not wait for romance or a man to save them from their problems. I cannot emphasize how refreshing this is to see in a kdrama, nonetheless a historical kdrama/sageuk! This drama certainly passes the Bechdel Test in terms of the portrayal of women in fiction.

One more thing to mention about Mr. Sunshine which is refreshing is that romance does not overpower the plot. Although this drama does have a heavy love triangle (rather, love pentagon?), it is not the main event. What takes the lead is the story, and the romance may be a big part of it, but the story itself stands alone and keeps me interested.

If I haven't convinced you by now, I do not know what else I can say to urge you to watch. Mr. Sunshine is amazing, trust me on that. (:

[I wrote this review on episode 18, but I still stand by it and think it deserves my initial praise]

I made a video tribute on my YouTube channel if anyone wants to cry again: https://youtu.be/iFNuGJe4YY4

As a filmmaker myself, I am really impressed on how far the film industry of Korea can go. A high budget production for a Korean Drama series. Imagine how much it takes to produce a 2 hour movie... Now make that into a series and multiply that budget per episode. That's Mr. Sunshine. Big respect to the film industry of Korea. They are serious and passionate with the art.

I watched Goblin and I really liked it, it did set my standards for Korean Dramas before... Now, from the same creators comes 'Mr. Sunshine' - they set the bar too high haha.

CJ E&M's TVN has been producing really great movies and series lately and it makes me proud to be a partner of CJ E&M and DIA TV through my YouTube channel.

It was really hard for me to rate this drama and describe my feelings about it because, on the one hand I do recognize it's quality (the story, the directing, the cast, the historical significance) but on the other hand, I felt like it took 20 episodes for it to get really, really good. The last episodes, while tragic given the historical back-drop of this story, had me glued to the screen. They were beautiful and emotional. I definitely cried.

However, the 20 episodes leading up to them were largely very boring. There were great moments of bromance, humor, and even some just all around aesthetically pleasing scenes, but a majority of the screen-time was focused on politics and it was just so boring because I already knew what was coming. I wish we had focused more on the characters earlier on since they are so, so great. Eugene Choi, Goo Dong Mae, and Kim Hee Sung had me rooting for them the entire time...and not just to ""get the girl"" but to be successful in whatever direction their lives were going because they all were so genuine and had such depth.

Go Ae Shin is one of my all time favorite leading ladies. She isn't your typical lead at all and I love how she took her destiny into her own hands. She was strong, funny, and cute all at once so it did not surprise me in the least that all three guys mentioned above were smitten with her (as opposed to many a drama where I can't figure out why guys are falling left and right for the heroin). Kim Tae Ri was fantastic and I give her so many props for standing next to Lee Byung Hun and holding her own, it really shows how talented she is as an actress.

I think when I first started watching Mr. Sunshine I was disappointed because it wasn't really what I expected from writer Kim Eun Sook. Some of her trademark elements were there (especially when it came to the bromance/humor) but overall it just wasn't what I wanted it to be so I was upset. Once I got over that though and was able to watch the drama for what it was instead, I was able to appreciate it much more. This time period is made for epic stories and is so emotional and tragic. Every time I watch a drama or movie that takes place during this era I feel for the Korean people so hard. Having lived in South Korea, I've witnessed first hand the effect the terrible things that happened during the Japanese Occupation has had even today...there is still a huge scar. Mr. Sunshine in particular was an interesting story because it started right before the occupation, instead of in the heat of it as other shows I've seen previously have. That made it even harder to watch because you can see all the pieces falling into place leading up to this horrible time period you know is coming. So while watching, I knew exactly how it would all end. In a way, that made finishing this drama easier. I won't lie and say I still didn't bawl my eyes out...but at least I was expecting it. I still have some issues with the way certain things went down (not *what* happened so much as *how*) for our characters here but overall, I'm satisfied.

Conclusion: watch it for it's historical significance, beautiful cinematography, and lovable characters. Be patient with the story. Bring a box of tissues.

Ps. Was anyone else expecting Gakshital to just show up in the end? How epic would that have been?? (haha).

This is a drama I will watch countless times. Absolutely sure about it.

I'm completely satisfied with the male lead's charming, exquisite performance. If he did not already have an fairly decent ability in English language, then he sure learned it quite perfectly for this drama.
The way Choi Yoo Jin mesmerized me with his manners, his looks, his perfect devotion to the female lead. I think it's one of the best performances from a male actor I've seen in Korean dramas. Any woman would love him, any King would honor him. And surely anyone would want to be defended and protected by him.

I haven't seen Kim Tae Ri play in dramas. It surely is something to regret, I'll fix that mistake quickly.

She plays with this fervent fire and dedication, that you might see in other actors, but at first notice, I can't think, who would fit more perfectly into this role. The gentle yet unbending nature of the role is perfectly acted out by this female lead. When I looked her play Go Ae Sin's role out, it made me want to be her. The courage emerging from fear and doubt, with such victorious indignation. It takes me a step farther, to look at women of that society more closely and to ardently admire of the nature of women in all the times of the world.
Not as a feminist, but just as a fair judge of character, I wonder, how many people with this kind of nature have there ever been in this world and will there ever be...

Also I would like to point out that, when in a hurry to get to the plot's important moments and as usually a person with busy life, there was not a moment in this drama, that I had the heart to skip. Everything fitted so perfectly. There was not a moment that would have left a question mark, as why would they add this or that scene here/there. And this is one of the most important points of any drama. How well does the story flow and how much does it make you want to skip to the important parts. This, for me, had not a second of it.

Also, one extremely important point. The side characters, everyone was important for the story. They added coulor's to the story, that will make it possible to remember them as much as the male/female lead.
Not just the lead actors, but also every other actor was perfect for their position in this drama.

Hope you like the review :) This is just how I feel :)

#BTW! Music is over the top. You can just drown into the emotions and the deep feelings in the drama's OST!

I have many thoughts about this drama. First the good: it is one of the most atmospheric and beautiful ones I've seen in a while, on par with the quality of Sword and Flower in its cinematic-like portrayal. The framework of certain scenes was just breathtaking. (Changing the aspect ratio at the end as well — just… outstanding). Also, it was very good at building up historical events, like the heart-wrenching fight of the Joseon people, the dread of being colonized by Japan, etc. The latter especially, every time a scene was characterizing that, the camera work paired with the ominous music portrayed the doom-and-gloom perfectly, enough to send chills down your spine. Its action scenes were a work of art as well, with the fast-paced sword work and quickness of biting bullets. When the drama focused on action, it was a joy to watch. If this had been the majority of the drama, I would’ve given it a higher score for sure.

Another praise I want to give the drama is its realistic sets and costumes. I loved the mix of traditional and modern clothes, the slow-yet-rapid advancement of technology, etc. It really felt like we were given a glimpse of living in those “turbulent times,” as Ae-shin says at the beginning.

Which leads me to second, the cons. The elements of this drama that made me not rush to watch it, that always had me on the verge of feeling utterly unabsorbed and frustrated at times. The pace is just too slow at times; there are one too many longing looks between the two leads and lingering goodbye scenes. While it could be argued that the pace of the drama matches its tone and atmosphere, that it builds slowly because it’s reflecting how historical events slowly build up with tension until they explode, there’s a balance that unfortunately was mostly not reached. It leaned too heavily into following the slow precession of the hour hand instead of the quick ticking of the second hand on a clock (throwback to Hui-Seong). Those slow scenes lost the tension that is essential for a drama like this. I was reluctantly uninterested in many character-to-character moments when those should’ve been the spine of the plot. Instead, it was the political backdrop and those types of events that held the story together rather than the original story-beats of the drama itself.

Finally, that leads me to the characters. I liked them overall, but I never fell in love with any of them. They had good character arcs (for the most part. Looking at you, Gu Dong-Mae, the man with a million lives) and the actors played them excellently, But there was just something missing, like a disconnect between the characters, their motivations, and the overall story. The characters felt more like an afterthought, a throwaway the director can rely on when they need the story to go forward, but couldn’t use a historical event yet, so they have the characters muse and muddle about in the same problems they’ve had since the beginning. I guess I felt like they weren’t fleshed out enough and didn’t feel like they were an essential enough part of the story, which seems weird because they are the main characters, and they’re /in/ every scene. They just didn’t feel… real enough? I don’t know. My favorites were Hina Kudo, Go Sa-Hong, and Kyle Moore. The other four were lost in their convoluted love-square and unrelenting, stubborn pursuit of a single passion, with the exception of Hui-Seong, who weaved in and out of the story seemingly uselessly until the very end. I liked his final resolution, at least.

I’ll leave it at that. Obviously I had a lot to say, so this drama is memorable in that way. I think it’s overall worth watching, but I would recommend it to people who are most plot-focused than character-driven, and even then to expect some meandering scenes. It was well-acted and brilliantly shot, and it does have many redeeming factors (those last three episodes even got a few tears out of me, which is rare). It’s a decent drama, it just has some outstanding flaws that unfortunately keep it from reaching its best potential.

If you're into cheesy love stories then this isn't the drama for you. If you're into historical dramas, tragic then this is the drama for you! The story can be difficult to understand however if you pay attention you'll be fine or if you read comments LOL. This drama is really beautiful and I hope you give this drama a chance.

This drama isn't too fast paced nor too slow paced. Each episode is important, each scene is important. The cinematography in each episode is breathtaking. The storyline is simple as , set in joseon time.

Story line : I will honestly give the storyline a 10. As I said before the storyline is different, the script the dialogues is well written and each epusode really captivates you. The romance in this drama was done well not too fast nor too slow. Both main leads were pleasant to watch and as their love grows we all really do crave for more. The love story in this drama is very much different than other drama love story I am telling you now. This drama is about the war between Japan-korea and it really does educate us if you're into historical dramas lol.

Acting : EVERYONE DID SUCH AN AMAZING JOBBBBBBB. They really did drop main casts to 2nd main casts to supporting casts to minor casts. I am very well impressed with them. Plus the chemistry between all was really different and intriguing. Lee Byung Hyun honestly never fails to impress me, I'm glad KES picked him for the job. He really done a great job as expected from him. Kim Tae Ri has now gained a fan ! Ha ha. She did wonders with her acting! Her facial expressions were great her dialogues her accent she did it well. Not one once of awkwardness. The chemistry between her character and LBH character was extremely good. You can't feel any awkwardness or any any gap between the two as you're too immense into their love and their adventures together. Kim Min Jung I watched her previous drama didn't like her role much but her acting here was awesome!!! She is one of my favourite characters so fearless. The actress did a amazing job at it and it is really hard to portray the role well but she did it and she also gained a fan! Yoo Yeon Seok is God damn attractive!!! He never fails to impress me and his chemistry with all the casts was pleasing to watch YYS really mastered his role well, he makes you want to hate him and love him at the same time. Last but not least Byun Yo Han - you'll end up just loving him he's really funny. The actor did a good job at it too and I'm glad KES picked him. Nethertheless everyone did great. The supporting cast did to (I would write their names out and talk about them but it would be too long lol!) Thank you KES for choosing them.

I gave music a 10 as well because the music really did go well with the drama overall. It was soft and slow and I do actually listen to the songs in YouTube. Really soothing.

Rewatch I gave it a 10 because I will deffo rewatch this drama later on maybe a year after or so. This drama is worth the rewatch.

This drama will not bore you.

A beautiful story
This story takes a while to get into. The first episode is a bit confusing but after a few episodes I began throughly enjoying the story and the characters.

Best Parts:
The characters are so beautifully written and complex. Many of the characters are neither good or bad but are somewhere in the gray area.

The cinematography is gorgeous. This show looks beautiful and it is obvious that the production team put their best effort to make this show look great.

Weaker Parts:
I would say my only complaint is some of the characters I wish we spent more on screen time with them.

A bit of warning: This show can get a bit violent/ bloody.

Overall: This is become one of my favorite dramas and I think the drama with the best production value I have ever seen. I recommend the watch.

poignant, beautiful, inspiring... a masterpiece
mr. sunshine's power and beauty cannot be expressed in words.
this story was perfect from start to finish. chills, tears, smiles and butterflies are guaranteed.

i'll keep it short, this is the real gem you're looking for in kdramas. a must watch.
the cinematography is impeccable, the music heartbreaking, the acting powerful, the story heart wrenching and riveting. every character was so intriguing and deeply developped, which made you very attached to each and everyone of them. from anti heroes like kudo hina and dong mae, to brave patriots like aeshin, all flaws, strengths and weaknesses of the characters were wonderfully portrayed. the episodes had me glued to the screen, the pace was perfect. i would've even watched a 60 episode long mr. sunshine haha !

but most importantly, this is a heavy but crucial story of the fight for independance, which will make you tear up and squeeze your fists. if you haven't watched it already, please do. i'd love experiencing watching mr. sunshine for the first time again,,, so please enjoy !

This one of the best things I've ever seen. It touched me in ways I didn't expect and I think that it will stay with me for a long time. The story is very strong and the drama is made very well made but that is nothing compared to the cast and the characters they portrayed.

The five main characters are a dream to watch. You feel for them very strongly early on and even if you think that some of them are a bit extra, they get under your skin.

I loved Eugene the most, though. His relationship with Ae-sin was my favourite part of the drama. It reminded me of Jane Austen's Emma - he accepted her, admired her, let her be herself and loved her so very much.

If I loved it less, I might be able to talk about it more.

Tvn keep being strong!
There's no doubt that ""Mr.Sunshine"" is focused on everything visual.
- Beautiful natural landscapes/background and scenery.
- Amazing and epic cinematography.
- Good color work, light and shadow.
- Classic and cultural clothing.
- Great graphics and effects.
- And even a great sound work.
It is beautiful.
The drama is very descriptive, detailed and symbolic.

The drama has a deep love story, which is something I usually don't like, but surprisingly, this drama hits my favourites and was quite funny. The comedy is so subtle and well tailored into the scenes.

Lee Byung-Hun is one of the best korean actors and the most popular internationally and Kim Tae-Ri has so much talent. A she proves that in one of the best movies, ""The Handmaiden"", so these two actors accepted these roles because, they knew this drama would be different and epic.
Amazing support characters.
Even though 3 leads love the same woman, their love is pure and everyone of them is willing to sacrifice. I really like the fact that there is no jealous relationship that turned people into evil beings.
The drama also shows girl power with such badass and awesome female characters, which I completely loved!
You can wait for 10/10 from all actors.. Acting, characters, excellent.

Mr.Sunshine is a truly piece of art.

There are many aspects to this drama but what struck me most are the many faces of love portrayed here. There is the mother who wills her son to run away and live, the mother who chases her son away because she doesn't want hom to suffer a life like hers, an aristocratic grandfather who allows his beloved granddaughter to learn gunnery and attend a western school so that she will be better equipped to face the new world, a slave soldier who loves a noblewoman with a love so warm and protective though he knows he can never have her, a Japanese samurai heading a violent gang, obsessed with a love for her born out of a single act of kindness and an aristocrat, born to wealth, having known no hardship at all, frivolous, lighthearted, till he learns of the terrible things his family did.
Everyone of the five main characters touched my heart in different ways. The acting was on point. The humour was delightful especially as the relationship of the three men moved to a different level of empathy and understanding. The scenes in which Ae Shin learns English and Eugene learns Korean were delicious!
And most beautiful of all was the love story of the American Joseon soldier who didn't belong anywhere and the plucky young Go Ae Shin who fought to protect her motherland. He loved her but he hated Joseon and yet he helped her in every way he could. This is the best love story I have ever watched in a kdrama and I find myself going back to their scenes together again and again.

It's an okay masterpiece
Note: The title needs quotes around the word ""masterpiece"" but the system wouldn't allow me.

Before deciding to watch this drama, I came here to get an initial feeling of what this drama might be like. To my surprise, most reviews here were calling this a masterpiece and a must watch so I immediately went to watch it. I have just finished it and I have no idea if those revieweres were watching the same drama I did -- it's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, in my opinion.

The story is really good. The music is good too, it didn't stand out to me as either great or terrible which is good. The cast is really nice too. The cinematography is really well done! Sadly, that's where the positives end.

The direction of this drama is not great. Too many episodes for what it ended up delivering. The characters are almost 2 dimensional as they make decisions that sometime seem random or make no sense. There's romance but sadly I didn't care for it one bit and I was not convinced of how and why the leads loved each other.

This drama could've been at least 8 episodes shorter! There are plenty of wasted ""prolonged"" scenes of characters just seemingly staring at each other as if the actors were trying to remember the next line. Some scenes were completely useless and added nothing of value; just fodder to pad this show.

The important bits were not given focus -- be it the characters or the political story. I do enjoy a good slow burner, with ""good"" being the operative word here. This drama overstayed its welcome and to be honest, I was bored for 99% (hyperbole) of the time I was watching it. I could not give it attention as I had the urge to fast forward past the useless scenes. My partner kept me from doing that and while she liked it more than I did, she still found it needlessly padded and slow.

I get the reason it's slow is to immerse people into the world and the characters and that the nature of political events unravelling is usually slow but this was needlessly slow. If there was a criteria for direction, I would've given it a 1.

Want a similar story with a far better pace? Watch Bridal Mask.

Mr. Sunshine was a fantastic drama! Just the overall feel of it, the cinematography, the excellent writing, acting and the mesmerizing soundtrack made it look like an out of this world masterpiece. I probably started watching this because of the reviews and because Netflix also streamed it. It's a great series for beginners into the Korean drama world. Plus, it's educational and a must-see for history lovers. First of all, I appreciate all of the effort put into design, costumes and the scenery. It did feel like the viewers were living in Joseon. Second, there were so many various characters of different backgrounds and aims, so many to choose from to be your favorite. Personally, the badass Gu Dong Mae and the fiery Kudo Hina stole my hearts. Not to mention all of the side characters which made the dialog and storyline very enjoyable. The only thing that I disliked was that there were no intimate scenes between the lead couple. Some might argue that it isn't necessary for a drama of this sort, but somehow it made the love story a bit unrealistic at times. Third, I've admired the interchangeable serious and comedic moods throughout the drama. The comedy lifted off the seriousness once in a while and it was refreshing. In addition, the transition between Korean, English, Japanese and sometimes other languages felt super sophisticated and alive. And fourth, I have to admit that the soundtrack was fantastic and now in my daily playlist. So many great artist became a part of the OST and brought in different colors to the series.
Overall, this is definitely a gem and one of the best-produced Korean dramas out there. If you enjoy beautiful shots, historical shows and good quality dramas in general, please pick this one up and watch it. It will forever be remembered and quoted by me anyways!

Always know the translation of word “Love” on other foreign country.

A beautiful romance that always find its way home in tragedy and sadness. Mr. Sunshine shows how far one can go to protect the thing you love, your country, your people, and the one you truly love. It depicts love that forgets its social status, work position and birth right, but every choice they made to pursue such love reminds them of all the things they tried to neglect.

Mr. Sunshine achieved its high caliber quality through its great cinematography, good story and right casting. I can never wished for more to its casting especially the five main leads. All those artist except Yoo Yeon Seok, are not familiar with me. I’ve seen Lee Byung Hun but never got a chance to watch his dramas, but because of Mr. Sunshine I will. I think his comeback on the small screen, really means that he really trusted this project. At first look, I really don’t find any chemistry with the main couple, or to any main leads. But after I watched it, I can never wished for anyone who will act for those main lead characters. The support characters are worth mentioning for they take the whole drama to next level. I really love Gunner Jang.

The drama runs on 24 episodes for 70-80 minutes long. It is longer compares to other drama. I think it can have less scenes to lessen the number of episodes but it will spoil the sincerity of each scenes. The background view, the stare, the silence, the flashbacks and every second of this drama is truly breathtaking.

One of the most tragic ending for all the characters but a happy ending for Joseon. As much as how heartbreaking main leads’ fate have been, it still such a great finale.

P.S. And I of Nuest, one of drama’s OST brought me here.. And I will be forever thankful for that. Every OST in this drama is such a good tracks.

Richly crafted and visually mesmerizing, Mr. Sunshine is a sweeping tale of romance and political intrigue. From the first scene, the most apparent thing about this drama is the beautiful cinematography. I felt like I was looking at pages of a graphic novel - each scene stunning and carefully composed. As the drama progressed, I was thankful that the characters and story are on par with the quality of the visuals. On the surface it is a dramatic love story set during a turbulent time in Korean history. But it's also a stirring story about identity, patriotism and the characters' relationship with their homeland. The great acting, visuals and character development make this drama a notch above the rest for me.

You know how lots of dramas start off strong and peter out? This one starts strong and gets stronger and stronger as it progresses. The story pacing seemed a bit slow to me at first. There may be a few too many dramatic pauses. But it's worth it. As the plot unfolds it really builds to an exciting crescendo that wouldn't have been as powerful or heartbreaking if we hadn't been given the time to really know the characters. The last few episodes are so powerful I can't get some of the images out of my head. It finishes strong.

The story centers around 5 main characters - each intriguing and well portrayed - each with a particular viewpoint and relationship with the country of Joseon. There is Eugene, the slave who escapes to America as a young boy and returns for revenge, Ae Shin, the badass noble woman who leads a double life as a rebel and Dong Mae, the fearsome swordsman with a fatal weakness. Hina is the tough, enigmatic hotel proprieter and Hui Seung is Ae Shin's affable fiance. These characters play off each other marvelously. I love the unspoken and begrudging admiration that develops between them - even when their motives are sometimes at odds. I fell in love with them and I cried for them all.

There are so many pieces to the story and its put together perfectly - a great balance between the history, love story and thrilling action scenes. There's even a little humor and cuteness. Mr. Sunshine is a beautiful historical drama - well written, exciting, emotionally stirring and heartbreaking. Don't miss it!

Hands down, the best kdrama I've ever seen.

I would honestly say that I really have high expectations for this drama. It was created by DOTS and Goblin creators so what should we expect right? It was so good that it exceeded my expectation. The storyline was old and based in the past but it was fresh; very new. The twists and rollercoaster ride they added to history made everything perfect.

There were so many things I want to say about it while watching but now that I finished it, I was speechless. I was so attached to the drama that a part of me felt left. It was a lovestory, but it wasn't just about romance. It's about love for family, love for friends, love for strangers who turned to family, love for comrades, love for the people and most especially love for the country. Just when I think I know the word 'love', I was just as clueless as Go Ae Shin, and no language can explain it.

The five actors really gave justice to their characters. I love how 5 different people from different countries with different plans ended up with the same goals. There were bad blood at first, but suddenly turned to fondness, and all became allies. The characters were all so unique and well written. Kim Hui Seong may be narcissist but he was never arrogant. He was so loving, selfless and precious. Go Dong Mae is evil, and he really is. But when it comes to the people he values, he is willing to risk everything. Who wouldn't love Kudo Hina? She's a strong woman who doesn't need any man in her life to back her up. As for Eugene Choi, oh my god, I love him so much. And Go Ae Shin? She's the best! Despite being noble and being untouchable she still stood tall and fought for the people who are powerless.

I was first skeptical to start because I've seen the age gap but it never bothered me. Thank God I really gave it a try.

""Guns, glory, sad endings""

I was wondering why those words were kept being mentioned in the first episodes and realized that the whole story revolved around those three words. The guns, where it all started. The glory, as every characters strove for their beliefs. And sad endings, because endings means good byes.

P.S. If you're planning on watching it get your tissues ready. It will be a fun but painful ride.

Name a more Oscar-worthy drama… I’ll wait
Upon a quick glance at the title and the promotional poster, you’re probably already thinking wow, this sure looks underwhelming! Well, dare I say that those were precisely my first thoughts – but now, I don’t even hesitate for one second when someone asks me whether this drama is any good, because my answer will always be the same, and that is: ‘exceptional’ doesn’t even begin to cut it.

Initially, I thought the premise was very lacklustre – set in the early 1900s, this mini-series focuses on Righteous Army activists fighting for Korea’s independence against foreign forces, but the more I watched, the more I began to realise how fascinating this was. Not only did it act as a device to help viewers establish the rationale behind each of the character’s motives, but it also contributed to the story’s development in more ways than I could have imagined. The idea of a premise is that it lays down the most basic foundation of a writer’s work, and just like a movie post or an illustrated cover of a book, it paints a simple image of what’s inside, but not much more. And here’s the thing, it’s incredibly unfortunate to still see so many K-drama writers (whether old or new to screenwriting) fall into this rut when it comes to bringing an idea to life. However, for Mr. Sunshine screenwriter Kim Eun-sook, this doesn’t ever appear to be a problem she faces.

Kim is one of the most accomplished and sought after screenwriters in the industry, and it’s a no-brainer as to why this is the case. In the last 10 years, she has written the script for some of the most commercially successful dramas: Secret Garden (2010), A Gentleman’s Dignity (2012), The Heirs (2013), Descendants of the Sun (2016), Goblin (2016), The King (2020), and this drama included. Yes, she may have incorporated overused clichés in a few of her written work (e.g. rich guy-poor girl, evil mother-in-law, etc), but at the same time, it’s evident she continues to develop narratives which are so unique and enthralling; a talent which is unsurpassed in the industry. Unlike many writers whose dramas flopped, each one of her projects has stood the test of time, and this drama is no exception.

But the success of Mr. Sunshine ought to be shared equally with director Lee Eung-bok, whose creative direction and vast use of cinematic techniques in this drama was just out of this world. Together, they raised viewers’ awareness of Korea’s history, and shed light on those deemed peripheral in society. Many with very little understanding or are quick to judge will say that everything portrayed is historically inaccurate or rubbish, but what these people fail to acknowledge is that these very cruel and tragic events did happen, and whether or not this drama perfectly encapsulated that 101% accuracy is irrelevant. Mr. Sunshine was a cleverly crafted masterpiece to simply put, and I have no doubt the producer called in a historian to ensure the historical and factual basis of the premise was presented in such a way that had more to do with the storyline and character development, rather than the accuracy value it would have added to the plot.

The storyline was wonderfully perplexing, with each dramatic turn adding all these unexpected twists. It was fuelled with long-awaited revenges, political debacles, and palace shambles, all atop a crumbling social class system and a country’s disastrous attempt at stopping the Japanese from invading. Unlikely friendships formed, loyalties tested, identities challenged, and moral compasses questioned, but till the very end, not one person flinched, nor did they flee their allegiance to join another simply for the sake of love or friendship. But what I really appreciated about Mr. Sunshine would be this: the delivery of a poignant love story without the need for any kissing scenes.

I’m not going to lie when I say that there’s got to be smooching involved to make the chemistry somewhat convincing, but even when there was none of that here, I wasn’t the slightest bit concerned or disappointed. Because when there was grief, I ugly cried; when there was suspense, I went numb; when characters embraced, my heart melted; when a character experienced pain, I too felt my heart being ripped out of my chest; whenever a villain or antagonist appeared, my insides burned with rage; when a character showed their quirks, I chuckled with amusement; and last but not least, when a scene was so profoundly sad, it did more than just move me beyond tears.

I also admired Kim’s screenwriting, because instead of cheapening the plot with unnecessary exchanges, I found myself immersed in eloquent poetry and an engaging dialogue that actually built towards something, whether it was revealing important information about a course of action or disclosing a certain character’s disposition. And every time a flashback or sentimental object re-appeared, I knew what purpose it served because the story behind it was so powerful that it became an etched memory (e.g. Lady Yun’s norigae (ornament), ragged shoe floating in the well, wooden music box, red paper windmill, etc). The stunning cinematography was also something to marvel at; not just acting as a visual aid, but in creating this immersive historical experience. With a beautifully composed soundtrack to match, I was well and truly enchanted. (Two songs in particular which struck a chord was Park Hyo-shin’s “The Day”, and Baek Ji-young’s “See You Again”; both of which evoked so much soul, emotion, and lyrical meaning).

But what this drama could really not have done without was the outstanding performance of its talented cast (whether lead or supporting). The main cast comprising of Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-ri, Yoo Yeon-seok, Kim Min-jung and Byung Yo-han all had a unique charisma and stage presence about them, and I’m so thankful that their talents did not go to waste when they auditioned for their respective roles as Eugene Choi, Go Ae-shin, Gu Dong-mae, Kudo Hina and Kim Hui-seong. To be able to see each individual connect with their characters by immersing themselves in the script was one thing, but then the ability to translate and deliver the right amount of expressive energy and a certain personality on-screen was another. Thus, it was really pleasing to see that actor was emotionally, mentally, and physically invested in whatever challenges their character faced.

To start off, Lee Byung-hun did a marvellous job acting as Eugene Choi. His natural charm and ability to bring so much depth and emotion to the screen was very enthralling, and I couldn’t help but be captivated every time his character spoke, laughed, or smiled. Eugene was a man of chivalry and didn’t hesitate to rise and display authority whenever he was placed in a position of conflict. He was clever, ballsy, and uncompromising, but at the same time, considerate, sincere, and likeable because he always spoke his mind. Lee’s action scenes in particular just exuded this wow factor you’ll rarely see from other male leads; attributed to all the stunt, weapons, and martial arts training he had done in the past to be better prepared for his Hollywood action roles. Combined with his knack for being able to also speak English and Japanese fluently in the drama – you couldn’t help but think, what can’t this man do?! If anything, Lee is a true embodiment of fine wine that gets better with age.

Likewise, Kim Tae-ri absolutely killed it as Go Ae-shin, and who would have thought Mr. Sunshine would be her first breakout role on the small screen! What really stood out to me about Kim’s character was that she was such a badass, fierce, smart, and tenacious noblewoman who wasn’t unlike every other female lead, and it was only through her ability as an actress that she was able to deliver a strong and empowering female protagonist that was more than just a pretty face. Ae-shin was quite literally living proof of Mulan under disguise in a black suit, and the fact that she risked her life, nobility and feminity by switching out of a traditional hanbok and into clothing that placed her in a man's world to protect her country, and her country’s people was worthy of admiration. Simultaneously, Kim did a stunning job at portraying Ae-shin as this graceful aristocratic lady whose posture, speech, and movements were refined, articulate and well-paced.

But if there’s one person who I really want to commend for his acting, it would be Yoo Yeon-seok. This man’s performance was just incredible, and even if his character were barbaric and callous, you have to really give him credit for emulating someone like Gu Dong-mae. Dong-mae was the kind of character that gave you chills just by the way he smirked, tinkered with his samurai swords, or held a gaze, and that’s the sort of talent you want to invest your time in watching. That said, his character wasn’t all that coldblooded and indifferent. Eventually, we see that he wants to be a part of a society where people don’t fear him, and whenever we caught a glimpse of his softer side, it was often met with sorrow and sympathy. Yoo genuinely did an excellent job at his portrayal of Dong-mae not only as the loyal and merciless leader of Musin Society, but also as someone who was authentic and selfishly selfless.

It is also worth noting that Mr. Sunshine upped the ante to showcase the strength and power of women in characters like Kudo Hina/Lee Yang-hwa (Kim Min-jung). Although her role was secondary to that of Go Ae-shin, I really admired how Kim’s character was this affluent, elegant, cultured, and classy modern-day lady who was very ruthless at times. Her role as an accomplished owner of Glory Hotel not only allowed her to indulge in elaborate kimonos, Edwardian fashionwear, and an array of Victorian-era hairstyles, but it also gave her the opportunity to shine through as a skilled linguist, fencer, trendsetter, and businesswoman. It’s quite rare to come across a second female lead this alluring, and a multifaceted character at that, so needless to say that I was impressed by how Kim always exuded the right amount of charisma with the perfect expressions to match in her portrayal of Kudo Hina.

And then there's Kim Hui-seong (Byun Yo-han), the charming third male lead who plays the second wealthiest man after the King of Joseon. From his use of self-deprecating humour to enliven sticky situations, playful teases, and softly-spoken lines, to the way he showed true, genuine concern for those around him, Hui-seong was nothing quite like the condescending and smooth-talking Casanova aristocrat I thought he’d be. Byun showed the audience that his character was more than just a womaniser; he was a gentle soul, risk-taker and a free-spirit who really wanted to contribute to society. It also goes without saying that he is a natural when it comes to conveying the expressions of someone who is genuinely in love. Hui-seong’s gaze always dazzled with adoration for his fiancée, and he never hesitated to wear a tender smile which carried with it this sweet sadness.

Final comments
I have never been more impressed by an AMAZING supporting cast, and although I may not know everyone’s names, it is without a doubt that their acting has left a lasting impression on all viewers such as myself. Kim Eui-sung especially, did an incredible job acting as Lee Wan-ik (the drama’s primary villain) and it only just occurred to me that he played the evil businessman in ‘Train to Busan’. Honestly, this guy’s expertise must be in villainous roles because his character in Mr. Sunshine was hardcore wicked with no redeeming qualities, and the fact that he could make you hate his character’s guts on a level you’ve never felt before is a true testament to one’s acting capabilities.

Not only did Mr. Sunshine record the 6th highest rating for any given episode in cable television (previously coming in 3rd place before the release of Hotel del Luna [2019], Crash Landing on You [2019-20] and the World of the Married [2020]), but it also netted an overall average rating of 12.955%, making it the second highest-rated K-drama of all times in cable television. What makes this latter figure far more significant than the first is because not only does it reflect the popularity of the series during its broadcast, but it also evidences strong audience engagement.

There is no doubt that Mr. Sunshine is probably my most favourite drama to date (along with Crash Landing on You and Signal), but if you ever just need to know why again, please don't hesitate to re-read this review.

Favourite quotes
Kudo Hina: “Three men who are worse than strangers are gathered in one room.”
Ae-shin: “Not goodbye but see you again.”
Lee Wan-ik: “I may be a mutt or a hound, but I’m the boss of all other dogs.”
Ae-shin: “You only have one bullet”, Eugene: As always, I just need to use it wisely.”
Kudo Hina: “Before you leave, act like a decent father for once in your life.”
Dong-mae: “We, unlike our parents, can shoot a gun or drive a sword through anyone.” Eugene: “I made a choice. We, unlike our parents, have the luxury of making choices.”
Ae-shin: “Gun. Glory. Sad Ending.”

Character summaries
Eugene Choi/Choi Yu-Jin (Lee Byung-hun) is the son of slave parents who flees Joseon at a young age and becomes a naturalised American citizen. Growing up, Eugene knew he was different from all the other kids – from his skin colour, long hair to his poor English speaking abilities – getting heavily bullied as a result. From the point he realises that he can no longer live as a Joseon man in a western world, his growth is exponential, and Eugene defies all odds to end up becoming a very admirable U.S. Marine Corps officer. Despite his accomplishments, he continues to be tormented by his past memories of being hunted down by slave hunters and keeps hold of Lady Yun’s norigae (a traditional Korean accessory that is hung from a woman’s hanbok skirt) as a reminder of his mother’s sacrifices. But make no mistake when I say each flashback of Eugene being thrown that norigae by his mother came with profound sadness; a true testament to the saying that “a mother's love for her child is like nothing else in the world. It knows no law, no pity. It dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path."" But that is not the only object which served a purpose in the story – Eugene also kept with him a very peculiar wooden music box, which played a hauntingly enchanting yet sorrowful melody. What made this music box so special was its significance to Eugene; the melody evoked happiness, hope, and life in spite of the tragedy and grief he suffered fleeing Joseon as a very young child.

Upon his return to Joseon, we see that Eugene’s unwavering loyalty to America remains unchanged when he is sent to the American Legation in Joseon to uphold peace and friendly relations between the two countries. Although he is often dragged into Joseon’s political debacles by Emperor Gwangmu (Lee Seung-joon) and anti-Japanese minister, Lee Jeong-moon (Kang Shin-il), Eugene explains that he has no intention to be swayed by their desperation to protect Joseon from Japan and all for a very good reason. At the same time, we learn that every action he makes is somehow unintentionally politically motivated – both a win for himself, and for the Emperor and his underlings; demonstrated by what he ends up doing with the ‘Certificate of Deposit’ (i.e. the King’s bank certificate), Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lee Se-hun, and his position at the Royal Military Academy where he shares with his trainees a very powerful Arabic proverb: “An army of sheep led by a lion would defeat an army of lion led by a sheep.” Although Eugene is seen to be this serious, calculating, and audacious character, I loved that he also had this warmer side to him which he shared with Go Ae-shin (Kim Tae-ri) – the Joseon woman he fell in love with and cherished more than his own life.

Unlike Eugene, Ae-shin was more reserved and careful with how she carried herself, and their love story was met with a lot of difficulties and uncertainties whenever a mission arose, or their situations changed, and neither of them would know the outcome of one another – symbolised by the placing of a red paper windmill at each other’s place of residence, or at the Apothecary (where they would often meet in secret). Although the portrayal of their relationship was far from the lovey-dovey type that you would otherwise normally expect to see in K-dramas, you could tell that their love for each other was nonetheless so pure, and every misty-eyed gaze and embrace became more heart-wrenching than the last.

The daughter of an aristocrat, Ae-shin was well-known for her kind heart; never faltering to help those she saw in need. As if brains and beauty was not enough, Ae-shin ended up following in her parents’ footsteps to become a part of the Righteous army, a movement led by her grandfather to protect Joseon people from threats instigated by Japan and foreign forces. Although she was refused involvement on many occasions by Lord Go, I loved that her persistence, grit, determination, and fearlessness to provide for Joseon and more trumped feminity and nobility, thereafter, becoming the army’s most-skilled sniper after her master, gunman Jang Seung-goo (Choi Moo-sung). If there was anything to admire about her character, it would be that she was a reticent catalyst for Joseon people’s freedoms and women's liberation – and who doesn’t love a strong, empowering female lead?

a slow-paced but an okay one
as someone who doesn’t really enjoy slow-paced dramas, this one was a bit hard for me to finish everything. but mostly at first, i kept on going because of lady hina and go dong mae. the storyline is of course, a slow-paced one which i’m kinda find with it but i got sooo so so tired. its only after the 16th episode i think, that i got hooked to the story, like i wanna know more. i really like the storyline actually despite it being very slow, the characters, the cinematography and the music, their acting. its just that i don’t really enjoy their romance story here hahah idk i just don’t like them together. i think the reason why my ratings are low is bcus of this hahah. but i appreciate all the hard work they put in this one, like everything they did for this drama and for 24 episodes? wow. and love the ending too hihi i cried at times too. overall, i’d recommend this for anyone who’s not looking for fast-paced kdramas and just want to enjoy its stories and outstanding cinematography.

Cinematographically perfect but story...
I have serious disappointments with this drama. Cinematographically perfect. The soundtrack is wonderful. The acting is so awesome. The outfits are great. But i think there is a problem with the progression and finale of the story. The script could have been written better.

First it was extremely stagnant until almost episode 15. So I think it should have been at most 16 episodes. Also, it was unnecessary for all men to fall in love with just one woman. Hina was a lonely and powerful character who deserved to be loved. She was more patriotic and brave than Ae-shin. There was incredible chemistry between him and Dong-mae. You can feel that sexual attraction even when they're just side by side. What a pity! I am most sorry that such fates were written on them. Moreover, this screenwriter wrote the second couples very well in his other dramas. E.g. descendants of the sun, goblin, hwi-seong was my favorite character in the drama. cute but lonely character who is happy with simple things. his way of death was ridiculous. He had to survive and support the struggle with his writings. What a pity! There was no chemistry between the main couple. I couldn't feel this throughout the drama. all I saw was the extreme age difference between them. moreover, the way the man died was very dramatized. it didn't affect me at all. Also Ae-shin's character was contradictory. For her, love was more important. It went beyond the patriotic woman image that was featured in the first episodes. I could not understand what she wanted to do. She couldn't make me feel her patriotism.

For the first 10 episodes or so, I was a little lukewarm toward the series, mainly because I found the pacing to be a bit slow, and I wasn't on board with the main ship yet. However, my decision to persist was the best decision yet. I grew to love not only Gu Dong Mae (I'm obsessed!), but also Kim Hui-Seong, Eugene Choi, Lady Ae-Sin, Kudo Hina, and all those side characters as well. This drama is so heavy, and at times so light and uplifting. It has left me with so many feelings with my heart. I'm overwhelmed and utterly impressed by this experience.
Others have said so much about this drama, but I just have to say this:

Humor is 10/10, and this is coming from a person who is very skeptical of humor in k-dramas. But this was so well-done, everything from Interpreter Im and Do-Mi, to the bromance between Eugene, Dong Mae and Hui Seong, to Ae-Sin's struggle to learn English. I'm left wanting a special episode for each of the main characters that I wanted to learn more about; namely Gu Dong Mae and Kudo Hina. I really, really wanted to learn how Kudo Hina came to be who she is when the drama begins. If you're looking for complex characters, this is the series to watch.

Acting 10/10: All characters, main or secondary, completely owned their roles and became them.
Cinematography 10/10 ... need I say more? Every shot was breathtaking.
Plot 10/10 I freaking love historical narratives.
Romance 9/10 I didn't buy Hui Seong's love for Ae Sin (that was too abrupt and I don't believe in love at first sight), but the Ae Sin - Dong Mae interactions were full of tension, and the Ae Sin Eugene interactions always made me smile. It was adorable and heartbreaking.
Pacing 8/10 If you're like me, you'll get impatient with the drawn out scenes where a character just stares into the distant with a pretty background and a melodic OST blaring in all its glory. I just zoomed past those, but there were too many of such scenes and I hungered for more action ... which I got after episode 12 (so hang on!).

I really liked how the drama portrays class conflict between characters entangled with political/military conflict and nationality. Eugene Choi is a Korean-born American captain who seems to struggle with how he should approach his feelings toward Joseon, a country that failed to protect him and his family. Ae-Sin is a noblewoman who is deeply loyal to her country, but is stuck between the patriarchal restraints on women, the need to pick up a weapon and fight, and a complex relationship with lower class like Gu Dong Mae. ""The hierarchical system is destroyed, but we can't change our roots. Once a slave, always a slave."" The series doesn't merely portray the unfailing courage of Joseon in the face of Japanese imperialism, it also highlights some key problems of the Joseon society. In Joseon there are the lower class butchers and slaves who are so oppressed they can't even protect their own children, there are traitors who are keen to sell Joseon to Japan, there are those who turn against their own parents and choose to be loyal to their country, and there are those who leave their country to survive, only to come back and take revenge against those who oppressed them.

This drama truly deserves the high ratings and accolades it's gotten.

First of all, I would like to say, ""BRAVOOOO!!!!"" I just completed watching this drama and had been re-watched twice. There's is no such words that can describe my feelings right now. This drama is so much awesome!

Secondly, I would like to thank the writer and director for being so damn good in casting these characters. I could not imagine if any other celebrities to act well as these casting did! I fall in love with all these main roles. Kim Tae Ri did so much super damn good in portraying her character. Fall in love with her the moment saw her on the roof with the black spy attire. I love Eugene Choi! He is such a manly character, matured and his voice is so much cool. Lee Byung Hun and Kim Tae Ri succeed in portraying their chemistry as the main lead characters. Dong Mae, Kudo Hina and Hui Seong did such an awesome art work... They really did best in this drama. This drama won't be this damn good without them.

Heartbreaking love story, but I do really fond this drama. After watching this drama for thrice, I still could not move on to the other drama yet. This drama successfully attached me and somehow I did saw them in my dream. Hahahahaha... Being so much dramatic now, but I do recommend you guys to watch this drama sooner.

I can't put in words how much I loved this drama. From the very first minute I knew I would be doomed and this didn't change throughout the whole 24 episodes. It took me on a captivating journey and let me dive into another world every day.

I knew that this drama would come with lots of heart wrecking moments. Moments that moved me so often because the story did an excellent groundwork of its characters. There were so many facettes of each of them, you unknowingly start to root for everyone, even though some of them might have started out with your disliking. Although... No, actually not. I never really disliked anyone who didn't deserve it. It's exciting to see everyone's story develop, to see where their decisions lead them. They are like branches, pointed towards different paths, and yet grew from the same tree. And in the end the wind blows them in the same direction.

I never felt that the story would move forward too slow because each scene was important to me. Like enjoying a good wine. Every tiny moment sucks you in and doesn't let go. And with all the historical background it was exciting and refreshing to hear at least 3 (sometimes even 4) different languages throughout the whole drama. Though I can't judge the Japanese parts, the English ones sounded pretty good to me.

This is not a drama that blends you with a stunning cinematography, pretty costumes and a nice setting, just to cover up a lacking story. This drama does have all these things AND a convincing and fullfilling plot which makes it a gem in this massive pool of dramas.

It's a story about friendship, loyalty, bravery, love and sacrifice. And it would be a shame to miss out on it.

Gun. Glory. Sad Ending.
""My romance lies in the muzzle of a German rifle. Who knows? How you saw me that night could have been romance in and of itself.""

I watched this drama without any knowledge of Korean history which is why I was a bit confused in the first two episodes. I almost dropped it, but I'm glad that I didn't (because I'll surely regret it in the future) and decided to continue watching it. And after the third episode, I realized that this is the best kdrama that I've ever watched.

Everything about this drama is almost perfect, if not perfect. The storyline, character development, cinematography (which is top-notch), OSTs (whose lyrics were all beautifully written) and most importantly, the emotions that it evoked from the viewers. All the characters are memorable: from the main characters, to the minor ones, and even the cameos. The actors portrayed their roles flawlessly but the writer should also be commended with the way she wrote each of the characters who are perfectly imperfect in their own ways.

What I love the most in this drama are the dialogues of the characters which are so impactful and meaningful. I feel like I'm watching a movie and reading a book at the same time. It's amazing how ""Protecting you"", ""Maybe it's the end of jealousy"", and ""I don't even know my way around Joseon, and yet I'm walking toward somewhere far away"" can be a love confession, and how ""I will pray for you and console you"" and ""You should keep moving forward, I am taking a step back"" can show how much you care for someone.

When I finished watching this for the first time, what remained in my mind are the emotions that I felt throughout the story. But when I rewatched it, I appreciated the story even more and I find it more exquisite than the first time I watched it. I came to notice the little details and the symbolisms used which I didn't notice before. It may be hard to rewatch this because of the number of episodes and the pain that it'll bring, but I do think that it is worthwhile.

I don't know if I'll ever come across another drama as great as Mr. Sunshine, but even so, this drama will surely have a special place in my heart.

Not for folks who prefer the typical fast-paced super obvious romance. This drama will make you pay attention to the little details, you have to be able to read in between the lines and catch the metaphors being used to describe ""love"", the little smiles and gestures ...words not spoken. Everything about the drama screams subtlety, from the lead actor's awkwardly cute stiff strong personality to the actress' subtle steps to self realization and of course falling in love.

Others might feel it's too slow but for me, I appreciate the build up, episode by episode, I get to pay more attention to the character's circumstances and what makes them who they are as opposed to the typical in your face descriptions. Cinematography definitely is key in this build up, it extremely inviting and captivating, I couldn't take my eyes off my screen in fear that I might miss something.

If you're looking for a historically accurate account, this isnt for you.

Mr Sunshine is a long ride. 24 episodes long, with a massive plot, great performances and a tragic ending, this one is not one of the usual fluff k dramas. Now, I'm only a bit familiar with Korean history, so I'm not sure if this drama was historically accurate. But if you don't mind your dramas to be kind of fictional and you like to focus on the current story that you are watching, then you won't be disappointed with this drama.
However, even though the story was good and very impressive, the drama had a slow start. It felt like it was dragging on for the first half. In the second half, fortunately, it picked up. The action scenes were more plenty and the plot thickened. Kudos for the ending as well, as it was bold to conclude things like this.
Moreover, the performances were excellent from all the actors and they were many many characters in this drama, so it was harder to pull off concistant performances from all of them. One thing that bothered me though, was the constant changing of the language of the dialogues throughout the drama. But that might not bother everyone.
Finally, the costumes and settings were really good and felt original and well made. Though the soundtrack wasn't that impressive, it suited the drama's mood well enough.
So, overall, 7 out of 10.

I’m laaate. I know. I regret that I didn’t know this drama until now. I was bored when i saw this on netflix, clicking this drama without any expectations at all because i didn’t even know it. Now after watching all of it, this is my first time writing a review because it’s THAT GOOD. Every episode is precious and timeless. It teaches and inspire you about so many things. Love, friendship, patrionism, loyalty, etc... Be prepared though. It’ll be a one hella rollercoaster ride of emotions. I would say that this is now my all time best drama FOREVER. No regrets at all.

WOW!!
APPLAUSE!!!
I started watching this drama without knowing what to expect. I've never watched anything for Lee Byung Hun before so I was a bit discouraged.
BUT MY GOSH!!
I absolutely loved this!! The cast, the acting, the music, the directing, the outfits, the dialogue, not a single plot hole!
Every single actor played their character effortlessly and perfectly conveying the emotions beautifully! I was so immersed in the drama for 2 whole months.
The plot of the drama is not what I expected at all. I expected mainly a war/revenge focused plot, but it wasn't like that at all. It had friendship, romance, revenge, bromance, and war all executed perfectly.
I haven't enjoyed watching a drama this much in so long bravo!!

P.S. I watched the drama while it was airing two episodes every week on netflix and in my opinion that's one of the reasons I was able to enjoy it so much. It's a long drama with long episodes and so many things going on each episode. So for some people, it might be boring or too much.

there are few dramas I rewatch, and even fewer dramas, but this is a beautiful story that gets better with every rewatch. I could watch 1 ep per day, 1 ep a week, or just watch this drama all day long, it's just so beautiful..

if I had to choose 3 dramas that can kinda reflect on my drama preferences, then this drama would be num1. it has everything I look enjoy in any type of show;
1- strong independent smart yet soft and awkward female lead
2- clean cut cold dark traumatized male lead that is naive and clueless
3- a beautiful elegant smart fashionable business woman
4- a brutal messy killer with a sad life/story
5- a ragged disheveled playboy that loves ""beauty"" and hates hard work
and many many more layered and interesting side characters all intertwined in a beautiful story about protecting a country.
if I were to describe the guys' reaction to Ae Sin's life choices I'd say;
Hui Seong wanted to be a shadow Ae Sin could hide in
Dong Mae wanted to tie her down/stop her from doing anything that put her in harms way
and Eugene wanted to walk by her side.


I'm currently rewatching it so I'll fix this review later ;p

What the heck just happened
Let me start off this review by saying that Mr. Sunshine is so far from the type of drama I ever expected to watch, let alone completely fall in love with. I had always considered myself a rom com type of person, and I wanted to say that I absolutely hated anything angsty, overly complicated or political, and most importantly, having a tragic ending. Mr. Sunshine is the epitome of all those things, and if I, a religious rom com watcher, can see just how much of a gem this drama is, then almost anyone can.
Story: Mr. Sunshine is an incredibly long drama (24 episodes!) which tells the tragic tale of 5 people during the japanese colonization of Joseon in the early 20th century. While I have to be completely transparent and say that this drama was definitely on the slow end (sometimes a little too slow :/), it was ultimately worth every single second. The pace of the story is perfectly mellow, and, despite being slow, I would never say it was dragged out at all. The pace perfectly fits the mood of the drama, and not a single one of the 24 episodes could be considered filler or irrelevant to the plot. The plot’s complexity completely baffles me, and I honestly believe that I will need to rewatch this at least twice more to fully appreciate the storyline. The tragic ending was perfectly executed, and, frankly, it is what made the drama so beautiful. Had the ending been anything different, I don’t imagine that the ratings would be the same, nor would the drama be nearly as impactful as it was. I am not ashamed to admit that I was bawling my eyes out like a baby the last two episodes, and that just goes to show how brilliant the drama is.
Acting/Cast: In this, I will also discuss the characters themselves, as well as the cast that played them. I absolutely adored every single actor, and I felt like they perfectly suited the role that they played. Despite some overacting by English speaking actors (*cough* ALLEN *cough*), the cast, especially the main characters, were wonderful actors and portrayed their characters perfectly. While I heard of some complaints of Lee Byung Hun’s stiff acting, I have to disagree and say that he wonderfully played the character Eugene Choi. I felt no stiffness in his acting, only the reserved and disciplined portrayal of a seasoned US Marine Captain. I have to give special recognition to Gu Dong Mae, for whom I probably cried the most in this drama. He was a beautifully tragic character who deserved so much better. I loved the bromance and the humor in the drama, and the tragic romance, despite a lack of kiss scenes, completely enchanted me and convinced me of Eugene and Ae Sin’s love.
Music: Ah, here we go… what can I say except that I have been playing the same one track from Mr Sunshine (Sad Waltz AKA Dong Mae’s theme) on repeat for the past several days and crying uncontrollably. Every single track in this drama was beautiful, and I will say that this is my all time favorite soundtrack from any drama with complete confidence.
Rewatch value: Like I stated earlier, this drama gets a 10/10 in this category because I already feel the urge to rewatch this drama besides just finishing it. I will definitely revisit it once my broken heart can stitch itself up at least a little bit, so see you in a few!

Excellent series
This series is amazing. All of the actors/actresses give outstanding performances. The editing, casting, set, camerawork, and clothing are all very high television quality. If it was not high budget it seemed to be.

The story for the most part is excellent. It is based on real historical events but has fictional aspects which has brought some criticism in korea. I think this issue is the only real flaw worth mentioning among most viewers. There are a few things i would have preferred to see within this story. This is mostly personal preferance on a few of the character's choices and the ending. That doesn't change the fact i binged this whole series and really enjoyed it. Honestly, i wish it had taken many more episodes to get to the ending :)

I highly recommend this series to anyone that likes period pieces. It is easily among the best of them.

Amazing lead characters
One of the good series in Korean. Starting I felt a bit slow and seriously it was very slow but the 3 lead actors who made me to love this drama are Yoo Yeon Seok, Lee Byung Hun And Byun yo Han and I loved every scene where this 3 are involved. They made really amazing combo. Kim min Jung was Also amazing and her style in this drama I think no one can replace it. Kim tae ri looks like a baby face girl but her voice will be like a well grown women. I liked her acting in this drama specially in last 4 episodes but when she is with male role Lee Byung Hun, I couldn’t like it much because of age gap which is shown in they face. In drama they age is not much different though.

I loved every scene of Yoo yeon seok, and he is an amazing actor, his Japan style and style of talking in Japan and Korean are truly amazing. I loved his character so much in the drama. And the reason I tagged this review spoiler because I wanna share this part. So don’t mind reading it. If you like suspense then it’s better you stop reading this right here. Yoo yeon seok character is one the best character in Mr. Sunshine, the flow of his character and the vibe I loved it. The minute when I felt his character is gonna end I couldn’t watch this drama till end but I was hoping him to be alive somehow and till end he was taken really good. The end of his character in the last episode is so touching . And the last scene of his in the last episode I will say amazing editing and cinematography and view. The way he linked candy and him, I felt it is really amazing, sweet with danger - I felt it that way.

An other best character which byun yo Han did was really cool. I loved the emotions and smile he carries in this drama and his ending was so touching. and he is one of the amazing actor in the drama. The love and words his character has are beautiful.

Lee Byung Hun character which he played was good. His emotions and love are next level.

And you can’t say one character is good in the drama. All the characters in this drama are truly amazing from 1st episode till the last one. Mostly everyone will make you smile and cry too.
You may feel slow starting or normal but it depends on your taste of drama but the ending is very sad. But keeping sad ending and slow pace aside in this drama. I can suggest you can watch this drama for few reasons
you will like male and female leads in the drama, even supporting roles.
Love, friendship, hate, jealous, and special 3 male leads combo. And emotions.
Cinematography, editing and sound track, background music, songs, dialogues, expressions and scenes are truly amazing.
Very clear characters ( no confusion- mostly in drama with many characters - linking from character to character disturbs the flow of the drama. You won’t feel like that)
Even though it’s Fictional and real events story, the story of Joseon was touching and Righteous army.

Rewatch value maybe low but few scenes even though you watch 10times you won’t feel bored.

I BINGED THIS IN 3 DAYS, IT'S THAT GOOD.
As the headline suggests, I finished this so fast because it's all I could think about day and night when I started it. IT IS SO GOOD. PERIOD. I actually put this off ever since it aired because I am your typical romance watcher. I don't usually watch that many historic/war-related dramas. Also, I tend to watch things by the younger actors. But this was exceptional. I hope anyone reading this understands that they should give it a chance. you'll regret it. I was shocked as to how much I enjoyed it. Yes, it wasn't as romance or lovey dovey as you'd hope, but it was like a different kind of love portrayed in this drama. I think everyone should give it a chance, no second thoughts, just try it. The actors were exceptional, the emotions the made me feel are not easy to do. I like studied each actor, and truly there was no flaw, their expressions and character were portrayed so well. Please please watch it. I really loved this.

Gun, glory and sad endings
I have a lot to say about this show so bear with me...
First of all, this is not a love story, it's a story about the sacrifices one must make in order to protect what they love, whether that’s a person or a country, as happens with the two main leads.
This is an incredible show and I really don’t understand why it doesn’t get more recognition. Even if you forget the real inspiration behind the show and the fact that it’s based on a historical period, the cinematography, the acting and the ost, all together will make you travel back in time and be a part of this epic story. You’ll totally forget that you’re watching a drama, because everything will seem so real. You will connect to every single character and wish you were a part of this rebellion. Just like Eugene, by the end you’ll feel un urge to fight along side with them. Not because it’s your country that’s on the line but because you love the characters so much that you want to stay by their side and protect them at all costs.
I think I’ve never seen a show with so many outstanding characters. One of the aspects that makes this show shine so much (pun intended) is for sure the relationships and dynamics between all the characters. And I’m not just talking about romantic ones, but comradeship, devotion, mentoring and friendship. This show has more bromances than I can count and all the characters are so beautifully written that you can't help but root for every single one of them. I must refer to one of, if not the best triangle I’ve seen portrayed on a drama: the sword, the gun and the flower. Dong-mae, Eugene and Kim Hee-sung had such a great chemistry and I can’t even put into words how exciting and pleasing their scenes together were. These drinking buddies made me shed a lot of tears but also won over my heart and made smile the brightest.
Although I love the main couple and fall for Kim Tae-ri in every single role she plays (Ae-shin was no exception, she did a brilliant job), I must admit the 3 second leads stole my heart. I think they gave the show so much depth by portraying these complex and conflicting characters in an outstanding way, making the show far more interesting.
I wish Hee-sung had someone with him on his final moments, someone to cherish him and cry for him. For someone who always seemed to smile and bring a lightness to the scenes, I always found him a bit lonely. I wish I could say goodbye to him in a prettier place, somewhere where he could look up at the world with his hopeful, charming and secretive eyes that hid so much pain, but always seemed to look for the beautiful things in sight. He had a wonderful soul and I think the writers did a wonderful job with him giving him one of the best character developments of the show.
Hina Kudo and Dong-mae… I was mesmerized by these two. Their beauty and strength in a world that never treated them well, the fact that they overcame it and did what they had to do to survive. I think they saw and understood each other on a deeper level and there was true love between them but sadly like much on this show, love isn’t always enough and life gets in the way, specially in times of war. The scenes in the beach really broke me but they were one of my favourites of the whole show. They will stay with me for a really long time and I will miss them a lot.
I must say that I had some problems adjusting with the change of pace in the final episodes of the show. I think they spend a lot of time setting the mood and the context of a very fragile state of peace until BANG the plot explodes and hell breaks loose. However, I think maybe that was necessary for showing how wars begin in the first place and countries lose their independence.
This is not the kind of show you binge watch, mostly because sometimes it's just too painful. You have to stop, recharge and keep going. Emotionally it's very challenging but it's completely worth it.
Unlike Ae-Shin, we always knew what “sad ending” meant, we knew where we were going but still a part of us always hoped for a better outcome. But as they often reminded us along the season, a sad ending was always in the horizon. That said maybe it wasn't such a good idea to watch this right after I finished Scarlet Heart (yeah I did that). I’ve seen a lot of people comparing both dramas, and I can see why. However, I think there’s a big difference between the two: Sad endings vs. tragic endings.
In Mr.Sunshine, I feel like the deaths always had a higher purpose, they’re not just used to make us suffer. They represent the character’s choices and are always aligned with their personalities and with what we know matters the most to them. I feel like every person here died for a cause, they died fighting for what they believed in, to protect who they loved and that makes it easier to cope with I think, making it more sad and less tragic. It brings the bittersweet meaning to a whole new level though.
I saw in a comment somewhere that Ae-shin represented Korea. She was the precious thing everyone protected at all costs, the thing that a lot of people risked their lives for. As heartbreaking as it is, I think the fact they all loved her and sacrificed their lives for her, it’s because she was the future. This show really does an incredible job with symbolisms and this is the major one. You can see it clearly in the final scene, where she’s holding the flag: she outlived them all because she’s the future, and she carries with her every single person who died for her, they’re all a part of her, she has in her all their spirits representing the Korean people at its finest hour and carrying them to a brighter day. This a true love letter to the Korean people, a tribute to their spirit, strength and courage.
This show made me learn a lot about korean history and I came to admire the korean people even more. I think the strength they all had to have to not give up their nation and fight for it until their very last breath was really touching and to me moved me more than any romance plot.
That said, I think this is a remarkable story, told in the most breathtaking and meaningful way, a real masterpiece. I'm very thankful for all the work they put on this show and to all the actors who brought this complex and mesmerizing characters to life that I will keep in my heart for a really long time.
It was a long journey that made me cry my eyes out, but also made me laugh, hate, hope, fear and love along with them! <3
Goodbye and see you again…

I don't speak Korean so I had to watch this series with subtitles. I watched the entire series twice! This is the best drama that I have watch in all of 2018. The cinematography, sound, special effects, costumes, just about everything is absolutely stunning and left us mesmerized for the entire series. But most of all the acting by all the characters in the series are all top notch. The music also needs special mention. The pieces were perfectly matched to almost every scene. Sori by Lee Suhyun of AKMU was especially haunting and beautiful. There wasn't a dry eye in the room.

I started the series sort of half interested. I found the first episode to be somewhat disjointed and confusing. It turns out it was a necessary step to understanding the rest of the series. By the third episode we were all hooked not just by the superb acting of Kim Tae-ri and Lee Byung-hun but also Kim Kang-hoon who played Eugene as a child. And it only got better from there! This is definitely binge worthy.

Kudos to the director, cinematographer, sound editor, for a truly epic experience.

While I've watched countless Chinese drama, I'm rather new to Korean ones because I'm less familiar with the language and the culture. This drama was suggested to me by Netflix and after seeing that the lead actress was Kim Tae Ri, whom I loved in the Handmaiden, I immediately decided to watch it.

24 over-one-hour-long episodes flew by. This I the first drama I've watched where I never skipped a scene once. I admit I was more interested in the romantic subplot(s) than in the general historical plot – also because I already knew what sad and terrible history Korea was about to go into so I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat – but the political scheming was never boring, and the villains and the antagonists were never flat or too stereotyped.

Also, this drama had zero drama clichés, or at least they were very sparse. No stupid misunderstandings or jealous rivals; no clueless female protagonists or jerk male heroes; no situations that make you cringe or roll your eyes. It had more of a movie feeling than a TV drama's.
Every character, especially the main 5 (Eugene, Ae-sin, Hina, Dong-mae and Hui-Seong) was interesting and well-rounded and I really empathised with them all.
The funny bits were actually very funny, and the product placement was sparse.
The music and the cinematography were outstanding – though regarding the latter I think they put all their effort in the first half and the second half doesn't have as many gorgeous or iconic shots. If I have to think of the shots of this drama that are iconic for me, they're all in the first 15 episodes.

The acting was really good, with Kim Tae Ri and Byun Yo Han shining the most in my opinion.

I only gave 8.5 to the story because, just like with the cinematography, I had the impression it wasn't as strong in the second half. It got slower around episodes 15-20, then it got a bit more predictable and sometimes it felt like they didn't have a clear idea where they were going with some storylines. I also wish the ending was different in a couple of aspects. But overall it was a very solid story and they managed to juggle well the personal stories with the political/historical background.

I'm keeping this review spoiler free but in the next paragraph I will go into more detail about things I didn't like so if you want to stay 100% spoiler-free please stop reading.

I've already said that Mr. Sunshine is amazing and listed the good things, but I have a few small complaints I'd like to mention as well.
First of all, I'm a little disappointed that the romance subplot became less and less relevant as the episodes progressed, especially towards the end. While this won't matter to those who watch this drama mainly for the overall story, I'm a sucker for the romance and I wish the relationships had progressed a bit more. I think there were things that could have been done but sadly were never explored.
Second, towards the end they introduced interesting new characters and situations that were left as loose threads and never brought to a closure. That was also a bit disappointing.
I'm also a bit bitter about how a particular character's arc (my favorite character, actually) ended, and I think that, again, there was still a lot of unexplored potential there.

In the end, I'd give 10/10 to the first half of Mr. Sunshine and 8/10 to the second half, so my overall vote is 9. If I'm ever gonna rewatch this drama, I'll probably only rewatch the first half.

A veritable masterpiece
What an epic, sweeping masterpiece. This story is full of heart, han, and jeong. It is deeply patriotic to Korea. I am almost envious of that level of national pride. Where I'm from, we are all hyphenated identities; an amalgamation of immigrants living our lives in the same physical location. I don't know all my East-Asian history, but it's almost overwhelming to think about how a tiny nation could be so powerful (or so vulnerable) and how quick we are to forgive and/or forget things in the not-so-distant past.

I appreciate the moments of levity, love, and friendship too. This show depicts ALL the emotions and facets of life. Kim Eun-sook is known as the master of quippy one-liners — and for good reason! Somehow, all the characters endear themselves to us. My heart is full and aches at the same time.

Guns, glory, and sad endings indeed.

This would have a 10 star rating, or even a 20 star rating, but a few episodes used some goofball humor totally incongruous with the personality of a (few) character(s). I really didn't like that, even though it happened maybe, two or three times? It detracted some integrity from the show. But, look--it detracted only 0.5 a star! So, do watch the show!

It was something that stayed on my watchlist because I wasn't sure if I wanted to potentially waste my time on a too-serious historical drama, but... it took my by surprise.

It was like a gift had fallen into my hands. :)

Overall, the whole Mr. Sunshine series ride is a worth binge watch. You’ll see the best quality of friendship or as a comrade; a family who aren’t connected by blood; a love that’s unrequited; a bunch of strong people who want their freedom even if their lives are at stake and many more. There are many lessons you could get from here and I think you’ll never hate this much because of the strong plot and the ending isn’t that typical (IMO )

CANNOT begin to describe how beautiful this show was. Extraordinary is an ordinary word for this show. A masterpiece, so unique and so so beautiful in each and every aspect of the willingness of this show to be beyond its imaginary reach.
This drama has so much potential and great cast. I watched the lead's movie sometime back, ""I saw the Devil"" and instantly liked him. In this show, he looks much more mature and is paired up with a fairly young actress, but they make a striking pair. I was rooting for them all along.
The story is a massive hit. Other characters play their parts almost brilliantly, there is nothing I dislike about this show.
Must watch, it is beautiful!

Too many stunning and lingering visuals...
Mr Sunshine is one of the most visually stunning drama series on TV. The colours, sweeping landscapes and battle scenes in the early episodes are Oscar worthy and viewers continue to be mesmerised by beautiful images throughout the series. I think the writer and director wanted to contrast the tragedy as it unfolds with the beauty of the country caught in a political storm. However, towards the end of the series as the story moved towards its climax, the lovely scenes often got in the way of the story-telling as the action and drama slowed to linger on one beautiful shot after another, or scenes were reprised in slow-motion from different camera angles. Without the lingering shots, the makers could have kept the story tight at 70-minute/episode (28-hours in total) instead of the over-indulgent and ever-lengthening episodes as the series progressed (totalling 30-plus hours).

(Spoiler alert!) Since the drama was set in a particularly turbulent time in Korea’s history, the story was never going to have a happy ending. The cast was excellent. The huge cast, main and support, each played a part in moving the story forward and their characters evolved and grew as they were affected by events. Of the three male leads, Captain Eugene Choi’s (Lee Byung Hun) character changed the least, maybe because Eugene was already nearly forty years-old when the story began. I liked how Kim Hui Sung’s (Byun Yo Han) character evolved from that of a rich playboy and cad to the quiet observer and then to a man who learnt, in his own way, to do the right thing. I also liked how viewers were gradually drawn into the inner turmoil of King Go Jong (Lee Seung Jun) as the political situation in his beloved country escalated. But I felt sorry for Kim Min Jun’s character, Hina Kudo/Lee Yang Hwa who did as much for the Korea as Lady Go Ae Shin (Kim Tae Ri) but was overlooked and overshadowed by Lady Go.

I didn’t mind the music initially but there was too much of it and the use was too heavy-handed. I felt my emotional reaction was being coached and manipulated as each scene was audibly cued before the story unfolded on-screen. While this might be okay for a 2-hour film, it is very exhausting for the viewer in a 30-plus hour drama.

I won’t be re-watching it or looking to recommend it to friends unless they’re fans of historical dramas and melodramas.

I started watching this drama with a heavy heart and holding my breath. It's a great piece of work that needs more and more recognition. I feel sorry for those who doesn't know about the Korean drama. I'm not Korean but i just relate to every single incident in it. First of all, i like how the characters are portrayed. Every character has its role and target,has its impact and values. You can't just watch this drama focusing on one or two characters. And i like how we could see the story, incidents through different and many eyes, nationality, class, and gender.

I've heard a lot about this drama and that's one of the main reason why I watched it and wow oh wow! It took me by surprise!

I knew this drama is good based from what I've heard but I never really thought it would be THIS good. It exceeded my expections by 1000%. I'm really not the biggest fan of dramas about war or was set during that period but somehow I just found myself wanting to watch the episodes consecutively. I just can't seem to stop. And I really don't know what is the reason for this. I thought to myself, I wasn't a huge fan of anyone here, not really a huge fan of the main couple BUT something about this drama just makes me keep wanting to watch more.

would 100% recommend this drama to every one. The sexual tension between the FL and the three MLs are no joke, really did not know whom to ship her with since all the three guys are amazing in their own ways. During the initial episodes you can already tell that the three MLs are genuine. Really love their brotherhood. But what kept me from enjoying their mischievous acts in the beginning might be because I already foresaw that their ending won't be a happy one.

The last episode made me cry a lot. This drama might be a fiction but watching these types of films makes you realize what type of life our ancestors had. What sacrifices were made for us to live a life that we are living now. It gives you a deeper appreciation on the things that we have now. The last episode also made me realize that choices we make now, big or small, will somehow have an effect on us which is why always choose to be kind no matter what. This was shown in the beginning of the last episode. I literally had goosebumps when the people tried to protect Ae Shin. It was such a touching moment.

I really felt sad for the three male leads but I feel more for Kim Hui Seong and Go Dong Mae because I think they weren't given the recognition that they deserved.

This is me just rambling on because it has just been 10 minutes since I finished this drama and my thoughts are all over but bottomline is THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. IF YOU HAVEN't WATCHED IT YET PLEASE DO.

Not your average drama
Mr.Sunshine is not your average drama in many aspects. The cinematography and photography were out of this world, maybe the best I’ve seen in a drama.

In terms of story again this is so much more than your usual romance heavy or oriented drama. The drama explores the road toward the Korean independence and the struggle of the people around that time. Although according to some articles I have read not very accurate, it gives you an idea of how Korea was at that time.

Before starting the show, I’ve read in another review that this is not a bingeable drama and I thought to my self “Challenge accepted” but I soon realized that they were right. Mr. Sunshine has many characters and many plots going on that each episode is very information heavy. If you try to watch more that two episodes in a row you start to drift apart and you are unable to follow the characters and their story. And trust me their stories are worth following.
All the characters, main and supporting, have a purpose and a role to play, none of them feels out of place or as a filler. The two Female leads were strong, independent, smart, brave and everything you would like every female character in a drama to be. The actresses were great and did an amazing job.

The 3 main male leads are amazing and their chemistry and interactions incredible. Three characters that love the same woman but can’t seem to hate each other and understand that there is a purpose bigger than them and the girl! Although I really hate this trope to the bone, like there are no other women in that place!!

I have to admit that, when it comes to the Male leads, I have a soft spot for my future husband and love of my life, Dong-Mae. The actor did a great job taking such a complex character and bring him to life and portray every emotion incredibly.

Having said all that ,there were two things that prevented me from giving this show a perfect score. One was that although the story was amazing, 24 episodes were a bit much since I felt that at some point in the middle the story got a bit druggy.

Now to the second part that might be a little controversial, but my main issue to this drama was the 2 main leads. As I said above both are BRILLIANT in their roles and their chemistry was good. My problem with the Male Lead was that out of the 3 males leads to me he was the most indifferent, I just didn’t feel for him the same way as the others. Kim Hui Sung brought a much-needed levity, cuteness and fun to the drama that you couldn’t help but fall in love with him. As for Dong-Mae, I think I made my feelings clear! He was such a complex character and far from the good guy/hero, but the actor did an incredible job. He portrayed all the emotions of the character perfectly with every inch of his face and he could really make you feel everything he was feeling, while being incredibly hot. So, the Male Lead really failed in comparison to me.

As for the Female Lead my main issue with her is really subjective and not really her fault, but she looks too young, especially next to the Male Lead. I know she was a 30-year-old actress playing a 30-year-old woman, but she looked 16 and it got even worse when she was in the suit, because she looked like a 12-year-old boy! So, every time she was in a scene with the ML all I could she was a 16 year old girl next to a 40 year old man and it made it icky for me taking me out of the drama!

All in all, for me Mr. Sunshine is a must watch drama that will bring all kind of emotions out of you!

Phenomenal
Mr Sunshine has gone well beyond a drama to a masterpiece in its own right. I just finished watching it and I have to say it is easily one of the most stunning dramas that I have ever seen. The performances of every actor involved were so evolved that every character came to life in a gripping and heart wrenching manner and yet there were so many times when I found myself smiling and falling in love with even the secondary characters at the way they could still manage to find humour in such difficult times.

All in all this was a story of epic proportions and a true epitaph to all those who fought so hard to keep their own national identity and independence. Thank you to all those involved in the making of this wonderful piece and to the fallen and those who continued the fight I salute you. You brought a story that needed to be told not just to the generations of those who followed but to the entire world. Well done.

The Best Korean Drama. PERIOD.
It's my favorite korean drama EVER. Nothing can beat this one ever. It's perfect in many ways. It's a crime not to watch and even greater crime to not like it. It's SO PERFECT! It was so captivating that after 2 years I still haven't rewatched it yet. I dwelled so many emotions and energy while watching it. Just thinking about it makes me happy and bitter at the same time. I made it my routine to listen its AMAZING soundtracks. THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT! I still listen to them every other day. Which is also the reason why the drama still feels so fresh to me. It's a top tier korean drama in every way possible. Watch it and love it. It will leave a big impact on your life and mind.

YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!
i cant exaggerate any more how amazing this drama is. from the story, to cast, to production, this drama is impeccably good. as a film student this is the kind of drama that sets standards for the rest. the filmography is beautiful and awards it indeed deserves.
there was never a moment that i was bored or un-interested. the strong build of character makes the smallest of scenes so much more interesting without adding too much to them.
the choice of actors couldn't have been any better, i fell in love with all of them. you do not understand how much i cried at the end of this series (no-spoilers tho), i was left heartbroken as well as heart warmed.
the filmography man... for a film student its like a dream come true.
i dont want to give too much away because its best to jump right into it and find out for yourself.
just please watch this show! i promise you wont regret it!

So, how do I begin this? It hasn't been five minutes since I finished this drama and I'm here writing a review about it just because I feel like exploding, and I cried like a baby. This drama was too much!

I've waited long enough for this drama to air last year. The moment they released its trailer, I knew that I should definitely watch it. So there came the month of July. I initially planned on watching this while it was on-going but the pacing from episodes one to nine was too slow for me. But good thing I picked it up again.

The element of getting yourselves on the edges of your seats was there, the element of anger, grievance, love, friendship, just... everything. I loved how well-rounded the characters were especially the five leads; they never tilted, they went forward to the paths where they knew they belonged.

Go Ae Sin had only one goal in her life and that was to save her motherland. Eugene Choi, a foreigner on the land of his roots, ended up saving the country who abandoned him. Gu Dong Mae loved only one woman and went on taking the road that would lead to her safety. Kina Hudo, a Japanese woman by name, yet a patriotic Joseon by soul. And lastly, Kim Hui Seong, the man who just wanted to know what his heart really desired.

This drama was like a movie extended to twenty-four episodes. The cinematograhy, the music, the costumes, the production design... everything was perfect. It was perfectly executed. The story-telling made you feel the feels, so is the topnotch acting of everyone--the support roles were really something, too. This drama was really deserving to bag the ""Drama of the Year"" award.

Thank you for lighting up the flaming desire in our hearts. Let us not say goodbye, rather, see you again.

The most stunning piece of art and cinematography I've ever seen...
I cannot express enough my applause and love for this drama. It is just so full and so profound in many ways that captivated my heart and soul. The story was so well written that bound every single character in the drama, no matter how small their role was. The scriptwriter really succeeded in retelling a wartime story in such a new and passionate way. Usually, when I watch historical or wartime dramas and movies, I just consider myself as an audience and watch them because they are entertaining, informative, or dramatic. But with Mr. Sunshine, I really felt that the drama touched my heart and soul, leaving me feeling the same way with every character in the drama, and made me feel like I was just right there in the drama, standing beside these characters. The love lines between the characters are well developed, too, with portrayals of different ways of loving and caring for others. There's one thing that's interesting about the chemistry between the two main characters: even though there were almost no intimate acts (kiss or something more than that, the best they did was hugging, and I wish there was even one kiss scene), the love that both characters have for each other is very existent, it's like their affections for each other were oozing out of their eyes and body movements, it's just something that you can feel it even without having to look at it with your eyes. Really great acting and chemistry!
Everything else than that, the cinematography, the OST, the scene set-up, the acting, were all top-notch. The drama gives the audience all kinds of emotions: heartbroken, happy, comical, angry, frustrated, disappointed, excited, and so on. As I said, this is a profound and fulfilling piece of artwork that deserves applause and appreciation.

Fancy watching this during a pandemic. It's so beautiful; it took me by surprise.
Mr. Sunshine.  This awe-inspiring one-season series and its many moments shined in every possible way.  From its deep storytelling to its intricate cinematography.  I loved it.  I have watched several Korean dramas before, but this one was unlike any I had ever seen in every aspect.  It was my first time to even cry while watching a K-Drama. Speaking volumes and truly setting the bar high.

Story:  The show takes place in late 19th/early 20th-century Korea, a time period not often depicted in Korean dramas.  Yet, Mr. Sunshine fluidly combines history, action, drama, melodrama, romance, and even occasional humor.  Never overbearing or overshadowing one genre over the other.  Though the historical fiction aspect of Mr. Sunshine is based loosely on historical events and figures, they are well covered and bring more cohesiveness in the story.  After having watched the first episode, I was hesitant to continue; it really dragged out the plot and I wondered if rest of the show would continue similarly.  One episode later...I was so glad I stuck with it.  There continued to be a multitude of slow-paced scenes and flashbacks in the following episodes, but they helped fill in the gaps or emphasize a foreshadowing. While mostly maintaining accuracy in the language used for the time period, the script was meaningful and witty and contained an abundance of memorable quotes. The overall story was a passionate and meticulous masterpiece writhed with metaphors and life lessons.   

Acting / Cast:  BRAVO!  My hat's off to the main cast.  Each main cast member exhibits great dedication to his or her roles, enveloping the character's personality and characteristics in each emotion.  The characters are written to be three-dimensional and evolving, and the main actors follow through beautifully with that.  The script includes several lines in English and Japanese (even some French). Even with these linguistic barriers, the main actors and actresses pull it off amazingly.  I was especially impressed with Lee Byung-hun (Eugene Choi). It is one thing to speak English and another to act in English. Lee did both so well that I occasionally thought he was a native English speaker, as his diction and accompanying acting were clear and fluid. In terms of the Japanese spoken, I thought several of the actors were fluent in Japanese. I learned later on from a talk show, featuring Yoo Yeon-seok (Goo Dong-mae), that he and many of the actors didn't know Japanese.  Instead, they had someone who was fluent in Japanese on set to critique their accents.  The Korean supporting cast professionally starred in their own right.  Some being familiar faces on other popular K-dramas.  Continuing on with the supporting Western cast...well, they were written to be one-dimensional for the most part, more on the sidelines, more just to be there and speak English. I didn't have many expectations for them in acting and it could've been worse.
 
Production / Visual FX:  The high quality production matches with the expensive budget.  It goes all out to ensure each scene looks realistic, yet artistic. A multitude of visual effects are used, but they don't detract from the story. Several scenes are also shot in slow motion. With this in mind, the choice camera angles really contribute to the cinematography masterpiece that is Mr. Sunshine.  Each shot had a meaning and if I didn't know the meaning while watching the particular episode, it would become much clearer in a future one.

Music:  The soundtrack and score are top notch!  The soundtrack evokes the melancholy, passion, and determination of the characters, befitting the scenes they are placed with.  Not only with their tone and rhythm but their lyrics too. Another plus: the music never emanates the tackiness I occasionally hear from other romance OSTs. The majority of the OST is in Korean and, interestingly enough, some in straight English.  I assume the English songs are meant to follow the current K-drama trend of including a handful of English-only songs, to allude to the ""amicable"" relationship that Korea had with the United States then and now, or to symbolize Eugene Choi and his existence as a forever foreigner in the show.  Maybe even all. The score is very fitting to the time period and aligns well with each of the scenes' moods.  I loved it all and still listen to the OST and score weeks after having finished the series.

Rewatch Value:  I have rewatched the majority of Mr. Sunshine and was never disappointed.  Each time I rewatched a whole episode or a few scenes from a prior one, I noticed new nuances, whether it was in character development or a metaphor relating to the culture, time period, and juxtaposition of characters.  It felt like strolling through an art museum that I could never get tired of.  Art that could never grow out of taste and style.

Overall:  STANDING OVATION *slow clapping with tears. That was my reaction after having finished Mr. Sunshine. I would recommend this drama even to those who dislike K-dramas or who have never considered trying it out.  It was that amazing.

Story & Acting- This drama had you hooked in with both the story & acting. Yes, it had slow developments in the start but it was bearable and each moment was worth it and there were funny moments as well. Like someone mentioned, the romance between Aesin and Eugene is not the same as you see in typical dramas with a lot of skin-ship/kissing/bed scenes,etc. The chemistry between LBH and KTR was wonderful and they were able to show how deeply they love each other in the drama and you were very convinced with their acting. Some of their scenes may be cheesy but I also found it very cute. The way they performed together was amazing and way better than any typical romance drama. I guess they were trying to show modesty in that time period and at the same time, the historical events was what the drama was mainly focusing on, just added a romance on top to tie it in. As for the other actors, they did a wonderful job as well. I like how this drama made them matter.

Music- There were so many sad OST’s and I loved them all. There were especially two that would catch my attention and I'm not sure of the names, I would have to check it later.

Rewatch Value- It's definitely going to be lower for me. It was an emotional drama, I rarely cry when watching any dramas labeled as tragedy or sad, but this drama hit you in the feels in the very end. I can't bear to re-watch those scenes that made me cry again, but at the same time I would still want to rewatch most of it since I enjoyed it just as much as it made me cry.

A truly Breathtaking drama.
If you are still wondering whether or not you should spend 24 hours or so of your life watching this drama, wonder no more. Those hours you spend will give you an amazing experience. If my heart had the strength I would rewatch it again already, I would rewatch all the scenes that had taken my breath away. But it seems I have to let my heart rest a bit or I might just have a breakdown haha :D


They had their moments.
And In those moments they loved
harder each and every time
So that when he’s gone
the love will last for a lifetime
As he took a step back
she took a step forward
and She did so with as much passion as his life meant to her
so she went further than he could ever imagine.
Now, she looks back and reminisces
To when they used to walk side by side
And she smiles,
Goodbye...
Surely they will reunite In better times.
Because that is love.
and see you again.

I suppose that was how I interpreted the beautiful love story between the AeSin and Eugene :) With the bittersweet love, it's a definite given that this drama is mesmerizing. For me, I have to say it's the most beautiful drama I've seen. This is something I would watch every year and still cry the same way I did the first time I watched it. The cinematography was worthy of an Oscar-nominated movie, the soundtrack was incredibly befitting, the course of the show was paced nicely, not too slow and not too fast. It was at a pace where you could soak in the warmth and meaning of the show.

All of that combined makes for a stunning drama. Every episode pulls you deeper and deeper into their world. Although many would first see it as a solemn drama, the humor is definitely alive. I often find myself laughing from all the silly shenanigans between the characters which made me quite sad later on as it makes me smile or laugh in the midst of tears.

I found myself falling in love with all the characters, especially the two leads. The characters were truly portrayed as human beings. They were layered and complex, just like us. With that and the amazing acting done by all the cast, it definitely compels you to dive deeper into their characters. The actors brought their characters into life beautifully, they all fit the role so well I can't quite see any other actors or actresses playing these characters.

This drama makes you understand and bond to the characters so much so that At the end you would feel empty without them. You'll find yourself occasionally missing the humor, the bromance between the three male leads, the badassery between the two female leads, and of course the sweet smiles shared between AeSin and Eugene.

The couple was really the sweetest. I don't really know how to describe it with justice but the romance was beautiful. It was enchanting how pure the love was, it's a different kind of love that we see in today's dramas. It was slow and warm, It was a kind of love that didn't demand, it was just giving. but it was also the kind of love that struggled between ideals, nevertheless, It was the kind of love that took pride in the little things. It was the kind of love that would stay for a lifetime. I didn't know love could be filled with so much longing and beauty. It wasn't a love story...it was more like a story of love.?

The show was also quite meaningful, portraying the pains and struggles of the past for a better and freer future in such a raw and true form. I come from a country whose past is filled with stories of struggling like this, I never really cared because you know the past is in the past but because of this drama, I learned to show a little more respect, because of their efforts and their sacrifice I can live a life with privileges.

""Thank you and Goodbye Mr. sunshine, in our independent country, see you again.""
This really hit me man, it's like the team was thanking all the characters and the people those characters represented that had gone through so much pain and struggle in the past.


Thank you, director, writers, actors and actresses, the production team and everybody involved in making such a stunning drama, all of you really made me experience a roller coaster of emotions. Thank you.

AMAZING DRAMA
At first, I hesitate to watch this drama because of the era. But when my korean friend recommend me this drama & i watch the first episode,it hooked me right away that i dont want to stop watching. As i get deeper into the story i was fascinated of what the lead are portraying. Im really not into cheesy drama so this is probably for me. It leave me sleepless night coz i can't stop myself. Im so impressed that there are not much hidden secrets from the past. I probably hate throwback on dramas, it only consume time.LOL
Im definitely amazed how the lead carry on their role despite of huge age gap. Great work guys!!!
I always thank you for bringing such a wonderful drama to us audience.

First of all, I usually shy away from political drama's as I tend to find them way to frustrating but my oh my...I'm glad I didn't let that idea get in the way of this magnificent piece of work. This is one of those drama's that will really make you grateful for the seemingly normal life you now lead, regardless of your origin. Be prepared to not only cry but sob wholeheartedly with the leads.

I love that one of the messages in this drama was that the next generation should not have to bear the sins of their ancestors. I have read so many cruel comments that states we should not visit Japan but please remember the message this drama was trying to convey.

I also really enjoyed the underlying tones of Karmic debt. It showed how every action taken by the leads had a sort of rebound effect that needed to be paid off in one way or another. It reminded us that every word and act of violence only added weight to your Karmic debt regardless of the reason. And that Karma would come for you...sooner or later.

Romance was one of those ""blink and you'll miss it"" type but it was vastly deep and heartbreaking. I think there was actually more Bromance than Romance in this drama and it added the humor that was needed to make this a well rounded piece of work. Physical intimacy was very limited but so well executed that I didn't feel ripped off. Acting was...sooo beautiful to the point it was agonizing. Every single cast member was mesmerizing.

The two female leads stole the show and it was spectacular. My all time favorite character will always be Hina Kudo/Lee Yang-Hwa. She was intelligent, loyal, fierce, brave and beautifully righteous. She is literally the epitome of what a feminist is. I could honestly go on for hours about how well written this character was as she out shined the main female lead in soo many aspects. I would love to see a spin off of her earlier life and how her and Gu Dong Mae met in Japan #praying.

As for re-watch value...I would definitely re-watch it but it is quite heavy and emotionally draining so maybe not in the near future. I'm usually into fantasy romances like TMOPB (Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms) but this drama really did leave me speechless. Highly, highly recommend.

Magnificent!
I'd like my heart back please!

What an incredible drama - let alone a kdrama! Each episode is shot like a blockbuster movie, the cast are superb and the story captivates you from start to finish. That it's based on historical events, makes it all the more painful sometimes.

The the five main characters are superb and you love them throughout and become so invested in their stories. Each of them go on a journey and you fall in love with all of them. The supporting cast are equally great. One of the villains does his job so well that I wanted to smack him in his face - great actor!

At 24 episodes this is a lot longer than the usual kdrama and sometimes the pace may seem a little slower than what we're used to in the West - however, the investment of your time pays off in spades.

I'm not going to mention anything about the plot as I strongly urge you to watch this. This is an utterly beautiful love story - love for each other and love for country - whatever the cost!

One of the Best Shows I Have Ever Seen!
I have been watching movies and shows for over forty years. And, yes, this show is THAT good! After watching ""Descendants of the Sun"" only a couple of years ago, I was wondering how long it would be before another grand series came about; a series that resonates with the heart and soul; a series with a crisp story and fantastic performances by the actors. And along came ""Mr. Sunshine.""

I can only think of a couple of series that are on par with ""Mr. Sunshine."" ""Band of Brothers"" is one and ""Descendants of the Sun"" is another.

What is truly sad is that much of the world is quite ignorant when it comes to Korean history, I'm sure. It's a country that always seems to be at odds with Japan, and sometimes China and Russia as well. Its turbulent history has too often been plagued by invasions or other countries attempting to gain control of the small peninsula.

""Mr. Sunshine"" tells of the time when Korea was, once again, fighting against Japanese occupation in the beginning of the 20th century. With virtually no real army to speak of and a king with little power on the throne, Korea or ""Joseon"" found itself relying on rebel guerilla tactics to try and prevent the Japanese from a complete takeover.

Several characters find themselves unknowingly intertwined with each other at the outset of the series. One boy finds himself quickly orphaned and making his way to America to begin a new life. He returns to Joseon years later as a U.S. Marine Captain. Little does he know how the turn of events would pull him into the conflict between his previous homeland and Japan.

The story's focal point is on three men who all happen to have feelings for the same woman, Go Ae-shin; a woman with a background as terrible and wrought with horror as the marine captain's. And yet, she is the heart and soul of the rebel forces. It is admirable and captivating to see this woman spearhead the rebellion, as well as her willingness to do whatever it takes to help her country. Tae-Ri Kim is perfectly cast, giving Ae-shin tremendous depth and complexity to her character.

The cast is simply magnificent from top to bottom. Every role, no matter how large or small, is handled with immaculate precision and depth. However, there is, to my mind, one who stands out just a hair above the rest. And that is Byung-Hun Lee as Eugene Choi, the marine captain. The man has a regal distinction that very few actors in history have been able to pull off with such ease. He may appear to be emotionless in many of his scenes, but to make such an assumption would be wholly inaccurate. I've said many times: an actor/actress who can say more with their eyes than with words, is a true master at their craft. Byung-Hun Lee is such a performer. I cannot imagine anyone else playing this part with the integrity and depth that he brings to Eugene Choi.

This is quite literally a ""Do not miss!"" series. With 24 episodes, each at about 75 minutes each, you are in for a wonderful treat. This is a show to savor. One might be wishing to quickly move on to the next episode, but I found myself stepping back and letting each episode soak within me instead. Like a perfect French dessert, you relish taking your time and savoring each bite. This is such a series.

I have been hesitant to watch this show for a while and keep pushing them on the back of my list, but then i ran off things to watch and decided to give this a try.
Amazing.
Great cinematography, extraordinary acting, everything is perfect.
I'm quite stingy with scores but then i give this one a perfect score.
Everything is perfect.
This one keeps me glued to the screen, preventing me from skipping parts which i used to do with other shows, makes me scream like a high school girl, bawl my eyes out, laugh like a maniac, also tears my head off of frustration.
Give this shows a try for those who haven't seen this.

This Review is full with SPOILERS so please be aware.
Well, i've been thinking the whole day in this drama, i didn't understand my feelings.
1. Acting/cast: The casting was so on point and all the characters are so well constructed (even the bad ones), the only bad thing that i got to say is that you can tell that the scenes with David McInnis weren't filmmed at the same time, because you can see that in reality he was never in the scenes where there were other characters different than the translator, the child or Eugene, probably he was never with Ae Shin (ypu can see him in a take but that's probably fixed), sometimes it happens in the dramas but this time it was very noticeable. However 10/10
2. Story: Really a beautiful story with a sad ending. I loved how they tried to represent a very difficult time. In the middle of the drama it was a bit boring, but in general the first 8 episodes and the last 6 were excellent. 9/10
3. Music: I wasn't a big fan of this OST, some songs were really great, and some others were ok. 8/10
4. Rewatch value: Not for me, because it mistreats my emotions, i'm sorry but i won't rewatch it, my heart can't handle this. 8/10
5. Others:
The cinematography and photography was so beautiful, 10/10
The bromance between the male leads and female leads 10/10
The ending, well yes i got a problem with this ending, i didn't like the way Goo Dong Mae was killed i though that he was going to die for sure but i didn't like the way he did it. Also the way Eugene dies it reminds me a little to Titanic, couldn't he jump back? 8/10
Also loved the large number of scenes between the two leads, I loved how they focused on romanticism rather than romance. I would have loved a kiss, but that does not take away the beauty of its story. 10/10
Anyway i totally recommend you to watch this drama if you love Politic and Drama and Tragedy, it is very well written and well developed. Overall 9/10

One of the most beautiful stories ever told... truly Mr.Sunshine was breathtakingly beautiful.

One word to describe how this drama plays out would be bittersweet. And given the context of the story, it would be almost impossible to have it otherwise.

Essentially the story dates back to the Japanese imperialism period. It strives to portray the life of the Joeson's protestors against the Japanese colonization. The historical/political aspects of this drama are in play throughout the entire drama but are mostly emphasized in the second half. There are a lot of ups and downs, a touch of humor which really kept things lively (s/o to the drinking buddies squad).

The five main characters and their dynamics were really amusing to watch. Some of the relationship developments got me by surprise. I think anyone who decides to watch this drama will connect with at least one of them. Personally, Hina Kudo's character really resonated with me.

The OSTs are beyond what words can describe, got me emotional at all the right moments. My personal favorites are:
OST Part 7: Becoming the Wind - Hyunsang Ha
OST Part 6: My Home - Savina & Drones
OST Part 4: Sori - Lee Suhyun

I think it is a personal preference, but I would suggest if you decide to watch this drama forget what you've seen of the main cast and let them paint a new canvas for you. What I mean to say, is that each cast member really makes the character their own, and I don't think I've ever seen a more suitable cast. Not only the main actors/actresses but also all the supporting cast were just.... daebak!

Mr.sunshine, it was an unforgettable 24 episode ride, you will forever leave a lasting impression. <3 <3 <3 <3

The drama hits you hard in every pay possible..
This is hands down the best k-drama I have seen till date.
Everything from storyline, acting and OSTs are splendid. Although it has a sad ending but the actions of each character seems justified & leaves an impact in the final outcome.

Cast:
Every character has aced their role to near perfection. Conversation between all the main characters, their respective actions and following repurcussions pace the show in a very balanced way.
Eugene Choi and Go ae shin's relationship and the way of embracing each other is represented in a very beautiful manner.

OSTs:
Each of the songs hits very deep. All the songs are so beautifully composed.

Glad that I watched this masterpiece and it will have a lasting presence in my memory.
Hope to watch it again sometime...

It wouldv'e been a diservice if I didn't write a review for this amazing Drama. 'Mr Sunshine' is a literal one of a kind drama in which I dont think we will see a drama like this one for a long time. I'm from england so I couldn't fully sympathize with hoe bad Koreans were treated because the drama shines light on historical events, but even I got annoyed at the Japanese soldiers for the tyranny they spread throughout Joseon.

This show did something ambitious and it was to make it multi-lingual to where they have multiple languages present in the show, they were; Korean, Japanese, English and French. I can only imagine how hard it was to get a cast for this show because they needed to be multilingual. Eugene's role especially because he spoke Korean, Japanese and English fluently in this show. Also, even though I disliked the Japanese characters I have to admit their acting was very good and just made the show better.

Within this show there was a clear 5 main characters and I loved each and every one of them. I loved the dynamics between Eugene, Dong Mae and Hui Sung. They all had the same women in thier heart but they just couldn't hate eachother in which Is why I loves the relationship they had. Normally in dramas thier are obnoxious characters who fight for love but neither Dong Mae and Hui Sung were bad, Dong Mae especially.

Eugene is a very complex character because he fled to America from Joseon and then comes back with America. It's quite sad for him because Koreans call him American while Americans call him Joseon so he got forced into a middle ground. Throughout the show he insisted that his motherland was America and acted on that belief throughout the whole show saying that. He even wouldn't ditch America for his love Ae Sin which shows how loyal he is to America. His relationship with Ae Sin was complicated in the fact that she was from an Aristrocrat family which means she's high up in terms of status so just the emotion of loving her was dangerous for him. You could say he got swayed by her but not fully. Even though Joseon ditched him, he still helped Joseon in some ways and I think purely that some of his actions were done for Ae Sin so she could survive. I knew that he wasn't going to live to the end of the show, it was foreshadowed alot to us with the whole 'Sad Ending' saying. So when he finally used his last bullet to save Ae Sin I coulnd't help but support his actions as it was for her safety.

Ae Sin is a very interesting character because since birth she was very interested in foreign affairs to the point she became a gunner to fight for Joseon to get thier independence back. She was also in a sticky position loving Eugene because she was engaged and also her family didn't think nicely of her having an American lover. It was my first drama that I watched from Kim Tae Ri and I was positevly suprised and I will watch out for more of her works. Her relationship with Eugene was so fun to watch because she was able to cool down and be happy when she was with him and one thing I loved was her smile and her laugh, they were just so adorable. When she said 'Mister Sunshine' that was also a powerful scene because she's basically saying that Eugene was her light and someone that lit her up. I loved how she wasn't just some weak character but she was strong and relied on herself to the point where it made Eugene look smaller than her but when Eugene stood up to the plate and sacrificed his life for her, that was the biggest act of love anyone can give to someone.

With both Eugene and Ae Sin, their relationship was amazing to watch as they had great chemisry, they wasn't the kind of couple in which kissed and showed their affection that way, all they wanted was to be with eachother and the way their relationship grew into something big was very fun to watch.

Now in my opinion, the dark horse character in this was Gu Dong Mae, I loved everysing part of his character. He portrayed a samurai amazinly and everytime he was on the screen it wasn't boring to watch. The way he was ruthless to everyone and didn't hesitate was a personality trait which defies him because of his harsh past. His relationship with Eugene was a wierd one because they both loved Ae Sin but they couldn't hate eachother as they grew fond of eachother. With Ae Sin, he was just fine seeing her and that was all it took to satify his love for her, with the whole debt thing in which Ae Sin met him every month on the 15th, that was just to see her. Personally he was my favourite character in the show and it was painful to see how pitiful he was as he faced death doors multiple times and couldn't get his love recipricated.

With Hui Sung, he was an MVP in this show as he was the one in which recorded all the events in history for people in the future to recognise the efforts and pain that Joseon went through. The sacrifices he made for Ae Sin and Eugene were very thoughtful and I truly believe that he is sincerly sorry to Eugene about what happened to his parents.

Hina was also a very good character due to how she did things and also her indescreet love for Dong Mae in which she probably realised too late before she died. I liked how independent she was and she could fend her own.

The relationship of Eugen, Dong Mae and Hui Song was very sad because Hina kept saying which out of the three would face sorrow but in the end they all died but in my opinion they did not feel sorrow because they all died for the cause of Ae Sin being alive and well and thats just what they wanted.

Even though the show does not have a 'Happy' ending per say, since the events on this drama are portraying what happened in the 1900s between Japan and Korea we know that eventually Joseon get thier indepence and become the Republic of Korea so Ae Sin acheived her goal of protecting Joseon even though we didn't see it we know it happens and we saw the hope at the very end of the show with her standing tall next to a Korean flag.

The OST in this show was very good as it created the mood and atmosphere for the show. Noticeable OST were from Sejeong, Ben and Kim Yuna which were all honestly amazing now that I'm listening to an OST right now and it makes me quite sad that I can't watch this anymore.

Overally if your looking for a very different kind of drama in which shows politics and love at the forefront then watch this show. This show also opes your eyes to some of the things that Korea had to endure against Japan.

I am not a big fan of historical dramas but this one was a beauty. Anyone who watches this drama and doesn't love this needs to rewatch the drama.
Eugene Choi's character is so dreamy. I love men like him. He is decisive, knows what's wrong and right and looks so good!
And Kim Tae Ri is so amazing. I love her rebellious character.
I love how the drama is not overly tragic despite the ending where I bawled my eyes out. It has it's cute moments where you yourself can sense the romance brewing between Eugene Choi and Go Ae Shin. There are also funny bromance moments all of which balance the drama so well, it's amazing. The cinematography is so beautiful too.
The love story, I would say is hauntingly beautiful. You know the futility of their situation and can understand that a future where both of them are together is next to impossible. But even then you can't help but cheer and root for them.
I even loved the characters of Kudo Hina, Go Dong Mae and basically everyone else that there was in the drama.
This drama is just all kinds of amazing

Working together for the third time, Writer Kim Eun-sook and Director Lee Eung-bok forged yet again another drama into a landmark. Masterfully melded with realism and romanticism, Mr. Sunshine offers an indelible image of the waning age of the Korean Empire. By far the most ambitious K-drama ever mounted, it's a legendary saga of romance and war told in an unforgettably cinematic style.

Every episode is like a mini-movie offering hardened yet vibrant characters, panoramic views, and emotionally-gripping action, climaxes, and plot twists. Further enhanced by heart-rousing OSTs, it's one of those black pearl-rare dramas that keep the viewer entranced right from the episode's very beginning and wired up to its last scene only to re-watch the whole episode again to fully savour and comprehend its magnificent scale and dramatic mystique.

Aforesaid praises aside, this drama is worth watching for the intelligent and memorable characterisations by a constellation of the brightest acting talents ever assembled. Protagonist or foe, adult or child, in main, supporting, or cameo roles - we've grown to either hate them or adore. It stars Lee Byung-hun as the righteous, enigmatic, and romantic USMC Capt. Eugene Choi; Kim Tae-ri as the sharp-shootin' spunky noblelady Go Ae-sin; Yoo Yeon-seok as the hapless romantic gang boss Gu Dong-mae; Kim Min-jung as the enchanting hotelier/fencing femme fatale Kudo Hina; Byun Yo-han as the noble-hearted dashing nobleman Kim Hui-seong; Choi Moo-sung as the hardy yet hearty gunner Jang Seung-gu; Kim Kap-soo as the famed potter/RA's revered leader Hwang Eung-san; Kim Eui-sung as the uber-wicked Lee Wan-ik; Lee Ho-jae as the venerable Lord Go; and many more.

In watching Mr. Sunshine, we've witnessed how noble, self-abnegating love works; how character is built; how unlikely friendships are formed; how loyalty is won; how cultural stereotypy of femininity is 'lunged' at and/or 'sniped'; how grace and equanimity can be maintained under surmounting pressure; and above all, how to make a difference esp. in a period of constant change and great tumult.

Two and a half hand-spans and back, we circumspectly yet excitedly nagivated the intricate terrains of Eugene's and Ae-sin's hearts as we concurrently entered into a world of history. At the end of our long journey, some of us have been left intrigued and wondering thus warranting a peer-back with critical eyes through the fog of time to re-examine important world events at the dawn of the 20th century. It is without a doubt that Mr. Sunshine not only left us overwhelmingly entertained but also edified.

Kudos to Kim Eun-sook for her astute and dynamic story-telling; to Lee Eung-bok for his meticulous and gorgeous camera work; to all the actors for their topnotch performances; to the crew for their diligent and painstaking efforts; and last but certainly not least, to fellow fans of Mr. Sunshine for helping make the drama an immensely enjoyable watch down to the last minute through your percipient comments, clever reviews, and delightful artworks.

Until next time.

Maybe not your typical kdrama
To quote a line I heard somewhere before: This is not a love story, this is a story about love. There are no kissing scenes, there is no PDA, very little flirting. But there is more meaning in the way the characters talk to each other, look at each other, act for each other.

One of the reasons I really like this show is the character interactions. You don't just care for the 5 main characters, you learn to love everyone around them as well. The first few episodes are focused mainly on the development of the character backgrounds and understanding the role of each character (because there are SO MANY). Many people got bored around the middle part which I agree I felt too. But stick to the story and it won't disappoint. Or maybe it will? Hehehe. Starting episode 14, the story really kicks off and the plot moves a lot quicker.

Maybe not everyone will like how it ends but I think it's what makes it so meaningful for me. (I still don't think I'm over this story)

If you're looking for a story with a good plot, loveable characters and great cinematography, I suggest you give this a try. You will both love and hate this drama.

guns, glory, sand ending.
At first I thought this drama would end happily in a fairy tale, ending with ""living happily forever.""
but unfortunately not.
the story is quite complicated for me to explain,
Sweet love from Yoo Jin and Ae Shin that made me laugh.
Hui Seong's unrequited love.
hidden love from Dong mae.
story ""betrayal, and death.
everything ends sadly.
and of course it really drained my tears.
especially in the last few episodes. You need a lot of tissue to remove your tears.

Indeed a Masterpiece.
This was a complex and sophisticated story but it was not hard to understand, I really enjoyed watching this and I'm glad it was not a waste of time. Every episode felt like a movie thus this is not a bingeable show. Mr Sunshine is not for everyone, it's really mature, detailed, slow paced and long. To my surprise I never got bored watching this I was so invested in it. The best thing I like about this drama is the character development as well as the characters. Every character was unique and developed in some way and it was interesting watching their relationships blossom. As for the two leads considering their age gap, they had amazing chemistry. You would feel every emotion while watching this. I cannot necessarily rewatch the whole thing, this is one of those dramas that I love but I can't bear to rewatch. Do I think it needed 24 episodes? no but each episode led up to something thus it was worth the watch.

Very good k-drama
I loved it although the ending was sad, I rarely cry and this k-drama almost made me cry so gonna clap to that. I would not recommend to watch this as your first k-drama because it will set your standards too high. I don't understand why this kdrama has 8.9/10 Because personally for me as a fan of romantic war I loved this. Although some scenes (usually the crying ones) looked a bit unnatural but other than that, the plot was amazing. I really loved the characters except the age gap kind of bothered me.. I honestly can't look at other k-dramas the same way because this one was just amazing and I didn't not know a k-drama could be this dramatic. I would most definitely rewatch this because after i finished watching the k-drama i just felt so empty. This k-drama really got me waiting for new episodes.

I think Mr. Sunshine will forever be the best drama to ever exist, at least in my opinion. I've watched this drama for the second time now; despite me knowing what happens in the drama, I still get surprised by how amazing everything is.

If you ask me what I consider amazing in this drama for you to watch it, I'd say everything is amazing. Have you ever wondered what a drama would look like without flaws? Mr. Sunshine is a flawless drama; from its cast, its storyline, how everything was directed, and everything in between.

I know that a lot of people tend to avoid historical genre dramas, but hear me out. While I believe that a lot of other historical dramas are good and have their own charm, Mr. Sunshine is in another class of its own. It wouldn't be boring as you might expect it to be, because this drama was set during the time Japan was conquering Korea and right before World War 1 (1914), so industrialization was already taking place; guns, trains, electricity, and whatnot were already being used. While certain elements of the story were fictitious, a lot of the story was still based on the true history of Korea; so you could learn a lot about their history and culture. Dramas like this tend to be slow, while Mr. Sunshine isn't necessarily a fast-paced drama, it isn't really a slow one either despite having 24 episodes. When you're watching, you won't feel the drama being draggy, and after watching all episodes you'll realize that not one episode passed by without having something meaningful happen.

Now let's talk about some of the notable things that made this drama so perfect:
1) The cast: The cast was perfectly handpicked. Every single one of them played their role perfectly. You could actually feel their emotions being displayed in full throttle as if they were actually living in this drama itself. I believe that all the cast in Mr. Sunshine deserves an award for their acting, and some of them did. Lee Byung Hun won the best actor award, and Yoo Yeon Seok won the best supporting actor award respectively, beating out other amazing actors from other amazing dramas that also have one of the highest ratings in My Mister, Mother, and Prison Playbook. Unfortunately, Kim Tae Ri didn't win the best new actress award, but she still deserves the praise and nomination nonetheless.

2) The plot: The story was so rich! The writers did an amazing job crafting such an amazing story, and I can't stress this enough. What's more amazing is how they managed to direct such an amazing story to make it even better. The whole drama was so smooth and I didn't feel like there was part of the drama that should've been removed. The cinematography was great and the production of the film itself deserves an Oscar. You don't really have to worry about non-essential episodes wasting your time because Mr. Sunshine did not have any filler episodes; every single episode was meaningful and contributed to the build-up of the whole storyline.

3) The music: Well, not much can be said about this but I just wanted to put it out there. The OSTs of Mr. Sunshine perfectly fit the theme, and highlights/magnifies the emotion felt of every scene perfectly.

Overall, as I said, Mr. Sunshine is the best. I've never been this attached to a drama ever, and I think I'll be forever scarred by it as well. Prepare yourself fully before watching this, as you'll have your emotional sensitivity automatically set-up on high during most of the drama. In certain scenes, I was trying to hold my heart in my chest as it literally felt like my heart would explode from all the crying. I kid you not, prepare yourself for one emotionally unstable roller coaster. Please do consider watching this masterpiece of a drama, I'm sure you won't regret it.

One of the most hectic & hard dramas to make are the historical ones due to the setting & environment they have to make & did marvelous job with this one.. it reminded me a lot with bridal mask as both have the same setting.. but I don’t know why I had the feeling from the beginning what ending would be like & I was right with hunch.. for me.. I actually didn’t like the romance between the two leads as much as I loved the relation between the three men.. their enemy / friendship feelings between them were amazing whichever actually drove me to watch until the ending..

The characters & acting were marvelous, Lee Byung Hun is great in any role he does & he did his role perfectly & it’s suited him perfectly.. but Gu Dong Mae won my heart fair & square.. his acting, his role & his background story were all great that touched my heart.. it’s my first time seeing Yoo Yeon Seok & he actually win a spot in me with his great acting.

My only problem were Go Ae Sin character.. I don’t know exactly what it was but I found her character the least interesting in all.. Kim Tae Ri is a great actress & she did her best in this role but I feel that her age wasn’t suitable for this role especially with her baby face which made her look more younger.. I believe that Ha Ji Won would suit this role more action wise & age wise.. she is one of the top actresses who aces action roles most.

I believe that this drama can go shorter as I skipped many scenes which didn’t affect the story.. also I found the middle part were lengthy & a bit boring because of the fillings.

In the end I didn’t regret watching it.. the ending was full of tears with me but I knew it would end like this.. a memorable show indeed..

...along with the rest of the characters (R.I.P).

I came for nuest's ""and I"", stayed for the show.

The actors were amazing and went above and beyond expectations. Later on I found out the main actors are pretty good well known actors (western action film star and the handmaiden cough cough) also the supporting actors are amazing as well. I didn't know that about them but luckily kpop exists and it's what brought me to check this show out in the first place.
So the music was a A+ for me. There's definitely a few that make me want to cry along with the scenes.

At first I really loved AeShin and Eugenes romance, but Dong Mae was such a good runner up (lol). It kind of breaks your heart that he lived the way he did. I also fell in love with Hina! Kim Min Jung needs more roles like these.
I read about how the accuracy of the history might be off, but who cares? It's a good fiction story anyways, even if they got a few details wrong lol.

I didn't give it a perfect 10 because a few things made me go, ""but wait, couldn't they have just done this?"" or ""that doesn't make sense!"" etc. For example, the train... also, dong mae- why u HAVE to fight the musin society? and the hotel- couldn't they have just- anyways. You get what i mean.

Looking at all the reviews for this drama, all that I've wanted to say has been covered by you geniuses. So, I'll just keep this short.

This drama destroyed me.

Why was it so perfectly made? The cinematic shots left me in awe. Who can fault the actors in here? No one. Don't even get me started on the OST... gosh I'm still listening to it.

The storyline and the dialogues were incredibly clever.

Yoo Yeon Seok as Gu Dong Mae, life ruiner. Oh how I love him sooooo much!

This series cinematography and visuals was what got me hooked. It felt like I was watching a high budget Hollywood production, each episode felt like a movie in itself. Casting was on-point maybe except for Ae-sin who I think have very soft features to be a gun slinging sniper. At times she looks like a teenager who seems out of place in that chaotic Joseon era. The main characters deep and tragic history and development was superb. However, the main fault for me was that having the 3 male leads with such powerful characters go after Ae-sin.
I mean, I get their deep history with her but I feel like a more interesting storylines could have been explored if the plot did not stick to this ""love quadrangle"" until the very end.
Ae-sin's passiveness and poker face acting just didnt do it for me. There was Hina who was a unique lovable character but Dong-Mae failed to even realize her love for him because he just had to get Ae-sin. I cried so hard when Hina died in Dong-Mae's back while confessing her feelings to him. They were not even given a single day to spend together after she waited for him for 3 years ?.
The finale made up of the last 2 episodes were just dang good! I mean I have never been satisfied with a kdrama ending like this for a loonggg time. As expected in a war death came and a piece of my heart died with each characters passing. Each death may seem rushed at the end but it was artistic and meaningful and heart wrenching to the core. Ae-sin as the last man standing was as it should be. All in all this is a series definitely worth watching! ❤

This drama was heartbreaking. I've been crying for the last couple of episodes because of it. This drama started of really good and really caught my attention. However, episodes 9-18 were not the best. Those episodes had interesting scenes, but it got boring. I'm really giving this show a 9/10 because this isn't some simple drama. It definitely is not for everyone. Episode 20 onwards were magnificent. I fell in love with all the characters; Eugene, Ae shin, Hina, Hui sung, Dong hae and more. I don't see myself watching this series again, because I don't think I can put myself through that sadness again. All actors and actresses were absolutely amazing and I'm really happy to have watched such an amazing show.

A Slow but absolutely worth all the time put into it (May need to fast forward at times)
*Some mild spoilers*
Mr. Sunshine is seriously one of my favorite kdramas of all time. Honestly it's astounding that the scriptwriter for this kdrama is the same as the one from Heirs. This is undoubtedly her best work and it will be difficult to top this. It's bizarre that not that many international fans talked about this drama compared to the Heirs etc.

The story and the characters was absolutely beautiful. I think all the main characters were nuanced and tragic in the same way.

The con of the story is honestly how slow it could be. There were times I would simply fast forward through Lee Byung Hyun and Kim Tae Ri's scenes, simply because they would be staring at one another for so damn long. Additionally, their age difference was so unnerving to me, especially because Kim Tae Ri looks much younger than her age and Lee Byung Hyun looks obviously 40.

But I understand why they casted him. His character was difficult to portray and to some I would understand why they would call him boring, but to be able to make me actually like and understand this kind of stoic character (not really he also has a lot of comedic moments without Ae Shin).

The side characters Gu Dong Mae and Lee Yang Hwa (Kudo Hina) CARRY THE HELL OUT OF THIS DRAMA. Because the main characters are the respectable and noble heros, these two are the anti-heros and much more grey but oh my god their acting and their story DESTROYED ME.

Mr. Sunshine is an experience and I'm so glad I watched it. Truly beautiful and the metaphors behind the characters elevate it way past a simple historical romance kdrama.

The OST is great. I finished the drama months ago, but I still listen to the ballads to this day and I hate ballads normally.

The Best KDrama to Date!!!
I’m in absolute awe and in love with this drama. For those who are hesitant of watching this drama, don’t be because this drama is a masterpiece! There are no words to describe how amazing this drama is. It’s just that good! For someone like me who doesn’t watch/like historical dramas, I was very impressed by the quality and I don’t think any drama can top this one (well at least to date). The cinematography, production, costumes and OST were perfectly executed and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Pacing
It does start off a bit slow at the beginning but it does pick up the pace at episode 3 or 4. I’d also like to point out that episodes 15-17 were also kinda slow but other than that, the overall flow of the story is good and doesn’t really have any pacing issues.

Characters
- I love the female characters so much. Both very strong characters and don’t rely on anyone. We’ve got one that’s a sniper and the other who does fencing. I also just like to mention the fight scene between the two as it really showed some women empowerment. A power duo indeed!
- There’s a little bit of bromance between the 3 male characters, which I absolutely loved as well. I wish we got to see more of that.
- Ae-sin is my favourite character hands down!
- I live for Eugene, Ae-sin and Dong-mae supremacy.

OST
Every track perfectly matches the scenes and is top tier.

Cinematography
You can tell that they really thought about what shots, colour grading and angles they wanted. It was like watching an Oscar-worthy film. No doubt that this drama has the best cinematography to date.

Overall, this drama is one of the best ever made and for someone that doesn’t even like historical dramas as much, that kinda speaks for itself. This drama will always have a special place in my heart that’s for sure! I do suggest for you to really know the history before diving into this drama just so you can fully understand what is going on. I personally did a bit of research before watching. GO WATCH IT! IT’S WORTH IT. TRUST ME.

This is one of the most unique shows when it comes to cinematography. I think Kdramas overall has its own style of camera work and mood setting. However, Mr. Sunshine really made me feel as if I was watching a movie. When I think of it in my mind, it felt like one continuous 24-hour long movie. In other dramas, there are cuts in each scene and conflict whereas here, every transition either from scene to scene or the changing of conflict is smooth. I really comment both the director and also the story for this.

Speaking of the story, I really love the concept. Anything that has to do with a revolution or an overthrow of an oppressive system excites me. I do think it is very well done. There is a build-up to every significant event and each character's motivations and choices are deliberate and truthful. I loved that every character stayed in character or when there was development, the writer took the time to flesh out for the most part. In my opinion, the most lackluster part of the entire drama is the romance between the main leads. Maybe it was because I didn't love Eugene's character or maybe I didn't like the actor, but it just didn't click or made me feel for them.

Aside from Eugene, I truly believe that the characters make this show. Because the writer does such an amazing job at character development, I fell in love with every character despite the flaws that they have. The characters were so complex, especially Kudo Hina and Gu Dongmae. However, my favorite character is perhaps the simplest of them all, Kim Huiseong. His character started off as the arrogant, cowardly rich boy hiding behind his family, but as the show progresses, you see him grow to have such a kind and pure heart. He went from hiding behind his family to baring the sins his ancestry committed and taking the blame as well as atoning for both his and his relative's mistakes. There's also so much more to his character. I feel like that shows how much the writer does with everyone. None of the characters that matter are ignored.

The things I don't like about this show and why I didn't rate it higher are pretty small, but to me, they really make or break a drama. For example, the music they used at certain scenes felt off. I feel like since this was on Netflix, the soundtrack had more English lyrics that just felt off in moments where there was so much Korean pride in the drama. Even in the Korean tracks, none of the songs stood out to me except for maybe the Suhyun song. They were nowhere near as memorable as Goblin or Descendants of the Sun. I also felt that the acting by the Americans and specifically Minister Hiyashi were stiff majority of the time. There were a lot of crucial moments that were suppose to make the audience feel something and in my opinion, it fell short because of the over the top line delivery. The actor who played Kyle Moore was the best actor out of all the Koreans but even his line delivery felt forced. Minister Hiyashi and other Japanese actors such as the bald soldier felt less like a person and more like a cartoon. The Japanese were treated like 2D character but those two were the worst.

Mr. Sunshine could have been a near-perfect drama but the very things that make a Kdrama memorable weren't executed as well.

I don’t even know where to start. There’s just too many layers to this masterpiece.

The story and writing were beautiful. It made me google about Korean History a few times just to check fiction from fact, and to know some parts were inspired by real history just made it even more engaging. The fact that this made me curious about another country’s history... that’s a win for me.

The cinematography, oh my gosh. Your eyes will surely be in for a feast, and you’ll leave fully satisfied and in awe from almost every episode. The music also heightened the emotions.

The characters. Most dramas usually reveal their backstories mid way or towards the end as a plot twist, but the writer in this drama chose the opposite. You’d appreciate every character from the very beginning since their history is revealed as early as the first episodes. Though it got confusing for awhile, be patient and wait for all of these beautiful characters with beautiful histories meet and create an even more beautiful story for us.

Can I specially mention the bromance? They added humor in this very “heavy” drama. This is probably one of the few dramas that really had me literally laughing out loud, all thanks to the peculiar friendship of the three.

And sorry, special mention for Yoo Yeon Seok. His acting was totally out of his usual character, and damn sir, you really pulled it off. I rarely fall in love with characters, this is one of the few moments.

The heart ache. You felt for the characters, their desperation, anger and frustration for a country that was falling, and their eagerness to stand up and fight for a cause... damn, this makes you realize how lucky we are in the times we live in.

Spoiler: this one particular scene in the end made my heart ache in particular... this was when the shop that buys stuff and does favors opened again, and they started having a collection of the many things that hold too mny good memories. It gave me a familiar feeling I have about growing old- the feeling of sadness when you’re reminded of the good moments and how you’ve lost the people you’ve spent them with. This is the pain of passage of time.

Thank you, Mr. Sunshine. This was truly a treat and I’ll surely be reading articles about you for days.

An epic saga in turbulent Joseon
Set in the troubled times of early 1900s, Joseon empire (Korea) is in decline with a number of foreign powers trying to gain control. It's a lesson in history. And if you know the history, you know how it ends. All five protagonists have their own reasons but they all are originally from Joseon and share a love-hate relationship with their motherland. All of them also carry the burden of their parents: either trying to live up to them, or living beyond their sacrifice or trying to get to terms with their cruelty.

From the writer-director pairing of the Guardian and DOTS (star writer, Kim Eun-sook and Lee Eung-bok), the brilliance of the show is in its poetic writing. The first English words Go Ae-shin learns are 'gun, glory and sad endings' which defines her as well as Joseon; her character is possibly a metaphor for Joseon. The cinematography turns each scene into a painting, supported by beautiful sets and soulful music.

Acting is of course, wonderful, although, the brilliant Lee Byung-hun looks a tad too old for his role. He looks solemn in the serious scenes but a bit out of place when he acts silly. Kim Tae-ri is absolutely fantastic, drawing romance into her expression with barely a breathe.

It is hard for me to pinpoint how I feel about this drama. It had a lot going on for it but also had a lot of flaws. It had some of the most beautifully shot and memorable scenes, yet so much of the drama was filled with skippable fluff.

The setting of the drama is what initially attracted me. At the turn of the century, it is an important time for Joseon, where their fate for the next few decades, even up to our day and age, would be determined during that time. One of the themes that were emphasized in this drama is the injustices some Koreans went through at the hands of their people, especially due to hierarchy. This resulted in many people with a grudge against their own country, especially against the nobles.

Another very strong point about this drama is the character development. Other than the Japanese antagonistic, and the depiction of some traitors, many of the characters were given layers and layers, that you can't help but feel for. Of course, it all bloomed thanks to the talented actors behind it. Starting with Kim Tae Ri playing the character with a mission Go Ae Shin. This character could've easily become overbearing (think Gaksital FL), yet here she remains constant. As the story goes on, you can't help but be driven by her plight. And that is what happened with all 4 other leads. Eugene Choi on the other hand is the character I connected with the most. The feeling of not belonging to neither country can be lonely. You see him struggle daily trying to understand where he stands. I admired how he never felt ashamed of his origin and felt for his pain and grudge against those who caused it. Then you see his grudge falter as he is met with people that kept challenging the preconceived notion of his birthplace. Lee Byung Hun really gave his all for this character, especially towards the end.

Watching Yoo Yeon Seok after seeing him in ""Hospital playlist"" it is difficult to accept that is the same person. Looks aside, his character is the most pitiful and toxic. He has no problem slicing anyone in half if they got on his wrong side, yet he won't hesitate to protect them if he sees anyone being unfairly treated. The most tragic character is Kudo Hina / Lee Yang Hwa played by Kim Min Jung. Having been sold off previously like some commodity really shaped her personality. She is all about being in control, however, the one thing she could never control is the action of her parents. This breaks her time and again throughout the drama. You can also sense the sadness in her eyes. Finally, Kim Hui Sung played by Byun Yo Han was the main reason for me for starting this drama. He was the actual sunshine here. His smile lightened my day, even when you could feel the heavy burden behind it.

Of course, what made this drama memorable is a large number of supporting characters. Gunner Jang was a character I followed and rooted throughout. This story was as much his story, as it was Go Ae Sin's story of a man who rejected the leaders of his country but chose its people. He was the forever rebellious Jang. Another character that stood out is the king. He was frustrating for most of the drama, but as the story went on, you realize how helpless he felt, and how carefully he chose his actions to protect his people. Being in his place is the most crumbling experience. There were many more, too many interesting characters.

The horror of colonialism is really well exposed here. The actions the Japanese did makes you wonder if it was possible to lose one's humanity to this point. Now, I do not know if what was portrayed was exaggerated. Some instances couldn've been, while others not. However, I do know the dangers of collective brainwash. When being constantly fed on how those ""other"" people are less than you, your brain accepts it and you become desensitized. Seeing what my beloved Japanese people did was really conflicting. But that is the truth of becoming a colonizer. Though they suffer a lot later due to losing the war, I think that was a blessing in disguise. It helped them reflect on what they have become and change. That opportunity was never offered to those that never lost a war.

Action scenes were great overall, but especially the sword fights with Gu Dong Mae. The scenery was beautiful, and some scenes were haunting. The train scene will probably go down as one of the most beautiful scenes in my memory.

While the drama had all those great things going for it, it still took me so long to finish. I lost my motivation to watch due to the lack of direction for the story to take. Each episode was between 75 - 80 minutes, with much of it had the characters walking around and eating dessert. The actual story starts at around episodes 19-20. Yes, it took THAT long for the story to take off. That is too much fat needed to shed. There is also the mix of history and myths that bothered me, and no reasoning given for actions that took so long to be taken. For example, the Mori character made no sense. They used it to turn the Japanese colonization of Korea to be some family centuries-old conspiracy when this had nothing to do with the truth, nor the overall story. Just added drama that didn't amount to anything. The portrayal of America is also in the same vein. On one hand, it's treated like this paradise, only to be brought down to reality by our Korea-American hero. One line said really stood out:

""America & Britain lent Japan a total of $410 million dollars, and 40% of it is being spent on the war. The two countries basically forced Japan into the war. Hence, America will never help Joseon. The Russo-Japanese war will result in a great deal of profit for America”

The music was overall negligible, but there was some sweet background that brought peace to the scenes.

It was overall a good drama to watch if it wasn't for the dragginess. I do recommend it to all.

I've always love Revolutionary War drama/movies , no matter where you are or what you've become or what you do , never forget where we've come from, in the end our country needs us :)

I cried so much that i had to paused for a while and catch my breathe, I feel like i am watching an Oscar winning serial.

Writing for a TV is a skill, and not one that many have. Having to maintain pace, coherence and continuity within sharply limited six or seven-minute segments is a remarkably hard thing to do. That the writers of Mr Sunshine succeed

The show has action, creative dialogue, and maybe the most badass TV character ever in , a good political intrigue. Excellent villains. I enjoyed the strength and conviction of Lady Ae Sin's performance, the absurdity of the Japanese caricatures. A drama of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial sets.

I imagine myself in the Joseon period how frightening it would be :)) Having fought the Japs.
The rough-and-tumble of Joseon life during the Revolution and brave men struggle against his own violence.
Long live Joseon, Long live South Korea!

You will not regret
Not many people have seen this drama, I still don't understand why.
But if you are hesitating watch it now or leave it unwatched. I can tell you that you are missing a story that will hook you from the beginning to the end.

Do you like Japan? Do you like korea? Do you like United States?
Well, this is your drama, a drama in which three different cultures mix, where you feel every moment, you laugh, you cry, you worry, you can't stop watching it.

And most importantly, it is not a simple story about duty or love, it is more than that.
It is how each of your actions leads you to the right place, to a fight in which you should not be part of but you are in the middle.

What would you do?
Sit back or join the fight?

Tragic and impactful, MUST WATCH
Let's start with my favourite quote from the show:
""Noble woman always resorted to living vibrant, like a flower""
""I'm no different, I also live vibrant.
The only difference is that I want to be like a flame""
Breathtaking, heartbreaking and unpredictable are three adjectives I'd used to describe this drama.
Every scene, every dialogue and every glance makes you feel all types of emotions. This show is filled with such beautiful written characters who all have thier own stories. All the characters are shown as extremely capable and passionate individuals who are ready to fight for thier rights and protect thier loved ones, come what may. Especially the women really stand out,none of them are weak and clueless, be it swords,words or guns they're always ready for anything. This aspect really sets it apart compared to every other drama,the depth of the character and thier development just makes you fall for every character by the end of the show.
This show is tragic, in every way possible and that makes it beautiful. A failing country, a love that will obviously have a sad ending and unrequited love that has gone on for decades. Sacrifices one makes for its country and loved ones,Patriotism, fighting for equality in the unfair world and how powerful a country can be when they all come together, is so beautiful displayed.
The symbolic meaning of every scene gives you goosebumps. Its incredible the impact this show has on its viewers,especially knowing that this is based on historic events.
The writer has mixed up 3 languages Korean, Japanese and English without making it seem funny or awkward,which is extremely hard.

What made me a little dissapointed is that they took this unrequited love aspect to another level. It was extremely unrealistic how a man's heart never changes, especially if the other person isnt interested in him. I felt like some of the love aspects could have been tuned down a little. But I do understand that love played a very important role in the story and was essential. I must say the mid portion of the show was a little slow and frustrating, nothing much happened. They really put in alot in the last 3 episodes though,maybe could have extended and slowed down the the story from 20th episode as alot was happening.
But nevertheless, this show really leaves you broken and then healed, extremely amazing. I cried so hard that tears stopped coming.

Superb! Superb! Superb!

This drama left me in shambles by the end of it with its stunning but heartbreaking ending. Nevertheless, I have been deeply touched by this drama's depiction of Korean independence fighters of the early 20th century and of the unspeakable violence committed by the Japanese army and government in Joseon during that time.

Moreover, the beautiful, healing romance between Go Ae-shin and Eugene Choi was like a rose through its painful beauty.

I was also heartbroken by the death of Gu Dong-mae, as he had quickly become one of my favourite characters through his complexity and good soul.

It is also worth mentioning the stunning soundtrack of this drama, which will keep being played in my house! Astonishingly beautiful!

I will certainly keep thinking about this drama for a long time and will re-watch it for sure.

mr. sunshine sets the bar way too high for me to fall in love with any other drama with similar genre. perhaps, my all time favourite. they did convey the most sorrowful pain, the most painful smile, and the most gut-wrenching tragical story that i personally don't want to recall, but, every time i rewatch it, i feel the strange feeling of not wanting to let go comes back to me all over again. a timeless masterpiece i might say. gun, glory, and? well, you name it. (also, hell, the OSTs are MARVELOUS).

Watch Mr. Sunshine you won’t regret it!
This is the most beautiful Kdrama I’ve ever watched. I just finished it and I’m crying like an idiot. I’ve never been more invested in a historical drama. It is a cinematic experience that may bring on the waterworks. It gets an audience to truly think of that precious history that brought us to where we are today. All the sacrifices that gave us the world we live in. I loved it and hopefully y’all will too.

What drew me in to this drama was the fact that I had heard the love story was beautiful, and it was. However, I didn’t expect to fall so deeply in love with all the characters. From the comedic relief characters to Eugene himself (I just shed a tear typing his name so you know his death hit me hard), all of the characters made me root for them, made me want them to succeed.

i cried
This kdrama is hands down one of the best ones i have seen so far. I typically dont watch historical dramas, but this one omg. The story was so good! it got kind of slow at times, but it was still ineteresting and everything was relevant to the story. The actor were also sooo amazing! i typically hate when there are random white people in kdramas, because their acting is always trash, but not in this one! every single actor was amazing. The only thing i hate is goo Dong-mae and Kudo Hina's ending. I shipped them more than the main couple and i am so upset over their ending. Im gonna watch youtube videoes of them for days.

Overall i highly recommend this drama.

Finally watched it
I knew it was going to be good but having watched a lot of Joseon set dramas, I was a bit reluctant to watch yet one more. But Mr. Sunshine is one of a kind and that's what makes it powerful. We usually see period dramas with the same setting. The palace, the king, the court etc... we know the setting we know the costumes.
But this drama is set in at the end of the XIXth century beginning of the XXth and the mix of costumes, cultures and languages is a feast for the eye. The actors are mixing English, Korean and Japanese (and a bit of French too!) and I loved it. Seeing this page of Korean history was really interesting.
The actors are sensational. I discovered (finally) Kim Tae Ri when watching her new drama 25/21. I tend to like feisty actresses and she's one of them. She has soul, determination and is perfect in the role of this noblewoman who will do anything for Love and Country.
Lee Byung Hun is also a discovery (late as well) and I loved his way of playing this man in quest of his identity, vengeance and ultimately, love.
The impressive supportive cast was also a fantastic addition on this period piece about love, pride, loyalty and survival.
No wonder it was one of Netflix's top series before Squid Game arrived.

I am starting the review with this because some of the cinematography just took my breath away. Playing with the lights, slight hints about what is to come that you may not even catch... The fact that this was filmed in such beautiful places and all of the mountain views by themselves sometimes made my eyes tear up and wish I was there. Thankfully the angles that make it look like you are also a person living in the early 1900s Joseon and are secretly spying on the characters help to stop oneself from buying a plane ticket to see the views in person.

The story was beautiful. I might be a little biased since my country also has a history of independence fighters and a lot of losses against oppressors and so I buy this kind of stories very quickly. Nevertheless it was well-told and I am happy with it.
I loved the cute little friendship between the three main male leads. Even if they stayed in denial about it.

The acting was great. I remember the first time I saw AeShin cry I was really surprised because usually during dramas when people cry you can see that they are sad and you can see the tears coming out of their eyes. But with her there was sadness, self control, helplessness... You could actually see from the way that she cried that she was a noble girl who grew up with everything but wants to be more than just a pretty decoration for her husband, so she becomes strong. And thus when something bad happens she tries to keep her composure and yet that darn lower lip just keeps twitching and doesn't listen to her!
All of the other actors did a great job as well. I think the acting was superb for the most part(except for maybe a couple of scenes where dead people's eyes were moving a little but I guess it's really hard to stop them so I'll let it slide). You could see each characters whole life story written on their faces.
I loved it that the characters changed a little throughout the drama but they didn't change their key character details, it was very well done.
Also I just want to mention the casting. The characters really looked A LOT like their parents and the younger versions looked like the older ones. I don't see it done that often and I was really happy to see it. Even the adult gunner Jang looked so much like his father, even though as a kid he didn't look that much like him. That's what happens in the real world as well.

The music was really good but maybe because I recently watched a drama with soundtrack that is still echoing in my heart I can't bring myself to give this one a ten.

I would gladly rewatch it sometime because I fell in love with a lot of characters as well as the wonderful directing.

Overall a great drama. A must watch.

the story was rather slow paced for me hence why i had to skip from ep12 towards the last ep. didn't regret doing that but what I DO regret was to even start watching this show GOD THE PAAAIN.

eventhough i missed out a good half of the show the pain towards the end was still there.. It was there.. Still there.. Somehow the words I want to say isn't forming but what i can say is it is one of the most beautifully captured show there is. Everyone who was a part of this drama did a REALLY GREAT JOB . I had a few attachments with the characters and it was god damn painful to see them go. Especially Yu Jin, Hui Seong & Dong Mae . They were just starting to grow fond of each other and- It was good to know that they had each other's back eventho they hate e/o Lol. The end of this drama gave us the closure we expected and wanted which was good BUT STILL PAINFUL. YuJin & Lady AeSin cause of my pain and suffering god damn why cant they just be happy ?!

was it worth a watch ? YES definitely but if you have awful attention span like me it'd be fine to skip a couple scenes and episodes.

Left my heart torn apart
Super high stakes, unpredictable, outstanding cinematography, beautiful OST, amazing directing and screenplay, incredible acting performances - a masterpiece!

I was hesitant to watch this since I’m usually not a fan of historical dramas but I was blown away.
I just finished the show and after bawling my eyes out for hours, this has left a permanent void in my heart that I’ll never forget.
The beginning and first half was sometimes a little slow paced for me to be honest but it builds up for the later half so that at that point you’re so attached to the characters it’ll crush you.
There’s a lot of like political stuff you might not understand unless you really pay attention to what’s going on all the time and every little scene is important. Even when it was slower it still had me glued to the screen and kept me interested which really surprised me.
And the second half I literally couldn’t take my eyes off.
(Not that I could see a lot through my waterfall of tears lmao)
The only thing that bothered me a little sometimes was the acting skills of the foreign actors on the show. As an actor myself I just wish they could find some foreigners that are actually actors. The Korean actors though just WOW! Incredible. Especially the 3 second leads too I am in love with their characters.
Also it got me really interested into researching more about the actual history of that era.

Heart Stirring Journey
I never thought I would write a drama review but Mr Sunshine changed all that.

If you are the type who can easily figure out the punchline to a story based on a few words, please only read this after you have finished this drama. Assuming of course, you prefer to get immersed in the story without knowing where the story will lead.

“This is my history” “This is my love story” launched me into more tears the second time I re-watched this scene the day after I finished the whole drama. Although the drama ended with hope, I was unable to shake my feelings of sorrow for the tragic end for so many of the characters.

Lee Byung-hun was phenomenal as Eugene Choi, displaying a range of emotions from commanding to charming to endearing where he said, “... the beginning of revenge or the end of jealousy”. Certain scenes where the lighting showed his age made me appreciate him as an actor even more after finding out he was older than me and that he had also starred in Squid Game.

I loved how the relationship between Eugene Choi, Gu Dong Mae and Kim Hui Song developed into one of trust and brotherly love. I found Kim Hui Song annoying at first but was moved to tears when he burned the marriage letter. Gu Dong Mae was the cool bad guy which had some of the wittiest remarks when the 3 of them had drinks together.

Kuno Hida was the alluring hotel owner that was cool, calm and collected with a fabulous wardrobe of western dresses. She was a multi-faceted character that was a Japanese widow-hotel owner to most, a Korean daughter of a villain to few and an undercover supporter to the King that no one knew about. I particularly liked her role in getting Lady Ae Shin back to Joseon from Japan and her letter to the King after blowing up her hotel.

The attention to detail for the costumes and settings were on point. The wars and fighting sequences were very graphic and realistic. The scenes with the battleships were so real that I found myself wondering how much cgi was used. So it was a surprise to be able to spot 2 scenes which looked like it used blue screen.

This story was one of the best I’ve seen. But above all, the story telling was very real, without the usual unrealistic back stabbing and plotting that most historical dramas portray. Brilliant!!

História emocionante. Fotografia linda. Músicas que te prendem. Emoção em todo lugar.
Entrou para a minha lista de favoritos com toda a certeza! Comecei a assistir com nenhuma pretensão, mas logo fui captada pelo o enredo, história e personagens. Amei o fato de eles darem forma não somente aos personagens principais, mas também aos secundários que roubavam a cena em qualquer momento que apareciam!

Cada cena e simbolismo foram trabalhados tão excepcionalmente no decorrer da história, que mesmo os telespectadores que não são coreanos (como eu), podem identificar e sentir o sentimento de revolução. Admito que chorei de soluçar no último episódio, mas o meu coração tem a vontade de assistir de novo e de novo. Eu gostaria de esquecer todas as cenas para poder revê-las e poder sentir todas as emoções como se fossem novas novamente.

I’m finally done with this amazing drama. Hell, the cast was gold, the setting was unique, and the plot was simple but then they made it more than just that.

The drama has no KISSING scenes but oh my gosh they got to pull off the chemistry of the leads and the side couples so good. Loudly crying face I heard that Kim Eun Sook had help in writing this drama and I truly applaud for the Mr. Sunshine crew and cast.

The OST was also amazing and it was so unique. I also liked how the drama didn’t just revolve around a love story but it also incorporated patriotism and nationalism. So many characters were beautifully flawed that’ll make you love them even more.

I’m so glad that they made this drama somehow empowering for women. I felt like any time, I could practice fencing or even holding a gun. They gave off such strong female characters that you’ll love and admire so much.

LET ME ALSO INCLUDE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY. Yes, it’s so beautiful. It’s like an overlapping scenery between the modern and the old age of Korea and it’s just so unique to my eyes.

The drama had flaws (since I don’t believe there’s a what you call a PERFECT drama since there’s always room for improvement) like it’s a slow pace, but I’m glad it improved as through the episodes.

This drama was so beautiful, once again. The ratings are well deserved. Watch this drama my dear moots, it’s beautifully painful but worth it.

One of the best kdramas out there
This is my first review here and I just gotta say, this drama is amazing. I know that not everyone will enjoy this but I can assure that it's worth watching for many people. It's also a very sad drama so if you hate that then this probably isn't for you. In the first episode I actually dropped it cause it was very boring but after giving it another chance, it ended up becoming my top fav kdramas. There's not much to say about this drama except that it's great and I suggest you shouldn't have too much expectations to it. You also have to be very patient because this drama is slow at first, but it gets better and better each episode. Overall, I love this drama and I can pretty much recommend it to anyone!!

dont judge a drama by its actors
Okay, first of all I’m like “omg the male lead is like way older than the female lead”

BUT I suddenly decided to watch this drama after reading the reviews here. Ngl, everyone like this drama so much. (now i know why huhuhu)

The first episode kinda slow but then things got more and more interesting with every episodes. Istg, I cried thru out watching this whole drama.

AND I LOVEEEEE THE WAY THE LEADS ARE POTRAYING THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER ><

THE SCRIPT WAS AMAZINGGG AND THE CINEMATOGRAPHY GOT ME HOOKED SERIOUSLY. Every scene was shot at a very nice angle was
B E A U T I F U L

I also like how every characters have a detailed story of their own like this drama shows every character’s struggles T_T

Disappointing. It’s visually stunning, music is great, but that’s it.
I’m disappointed. The story is not good. Or maybe I just expected so much from the glimpse I had from the music video and reviews here.

The music video of Park hyo shin’s ost is a way better story than the entire series. It’s unnecessarily long just to keep dragging the episodes to showcase the beautiful cinematography.

Story: Why so long? Is it to cater for the countless slow motions and CGI? Or is it to make it seem like a big shot kdrama? Most of the scenes are empty, the order of the series is a mess, maybe they were just trying to be more historically accurate but if then they couldve just made a movie. The war that I was expecting for the last episode actually happened in the first episode, and it was just a glimpse. The feeling of patriotism that I’ve been waiting for was concealed in a very short scenes, then the lovestory-filled ending came up, then the end.

Cast/Acting: I don’t buy the main leads. Why does it have to be Lee byung hun? He might as well became the father figure for the main female lead. I could see hyun bin as a more fitting cast for the character. Kim tae ri, okay so many better actress to portray this role, but I can forgive this. The rest of the main leads, perfect.

Music: One of the best soundtracks in kdramaworld. Thank you Park hyo shin and Baek ji young.

Rewatch: No, because it’s so long and empty, I might actually fall asleep. Actually I did fell asleep so many times while watching this, I just woke up one morning and the entire series has been streamed out. Lol!

Overall: Very disappointed. Unlike the claims of other fans about this drama as patriotic, historical etc. it actually focused on the lovestory of the main leads, the main leads as in the five main leads.
There are only three good things about this drama.
1. The cinematography
2. The music
3. The mourning scenes in ep 20.

one of the ultimate kdrama's
going into this drama I did not know what to expect, but the moment I started i could not stop myself. this drama is so so so so so so so good. every element was beautifully thought off and executed, each character was amazingly casted and 'acted as well. i'm not a fan of historical dramas but this drama holds a special place in my heart. the romance in this drama is not one that you would expect, the chemistry is amazing, very explosive. cinematography was another huge part which made this drama all the more better. it is a MUCH WATCH. there was not a second that was boring. you will express all sorts of emotions watching this drama but that's the best part, you will feel for certain characters and i just found myself being completely immersed in this drama. you will not regret watching this!

It's Jane Austen meets K-Drama meets any moving story about rebels!

I'm going to admit that it took me a while to really get into it. The beginning moves like a slow history romance with no real direction. This is why it received a 9 from me. Those first twelve episodes while intriguing were nothing groundbreaking. But, If you're looking for a sappy history romance where the king falls in love with a commoner, then I suggest you move on. This drama is for strong willed rebels who are willing to be inspired to action!
The last twelve episodes however were the most gripping, tragic, moving and impactful i've ever seen a K-Drama.
The acting was also note worthy, when they cried, I cried. During the good times, I laughed. They drew me into their story and made me root for a country i've never even set foot in. Yes, the real main character of this was Joseon and really made me think about the history of current day South-Korea.

The story, acting, music, cinematography, editing, bromance, sis-mance? Are all top notch in my opinion. This story ramps up pretty quickly without leaving you bored at any step of the way. The villains didn't quite get the torture I thought they deserved but also, sometimes, the bad guys win in the end.

Despite it's flaws this is hands down the best K-drama I've watched in recent times. Only watch if you've got the heart to steel back tears, Impressive control for your anger and the open-mind to feel compassion for what others have gone through.

Mesmerizing
This is my second time watching it. I think its better this time because all the anxiousness is gone (I know who lives and dies) and now I can just relax and enjoy it as it unfolds.

Lee Byung Hun is one of my favorite ML’s and he doesn’t fail to highly succeed in mesmerizing us this series. I had not seen Kim Tae Ri (FL) before and I thought she was just great. Actually, everyone of the actors and actresses are just fabulous in their roles and one is able to connect to each one emotionally and feel what they are feeling at that moment.

I would like to add my two cents worth about the controversy over the ML being so much older than the FL. I think maybe younger viewers might not readily figure out the dynamics of why it was cast this way so I thought I’d explain. The FL is very mature. She is not only well educated, especially for that time when women were not permitted access to education and the outer world, but she is also a Freedom Fighter. She is intelligent and she simply isn’t going to be attracted to someone her age. We can see that in her disdain for the SML. But the ML is extremely accomplished in all facets of life…his demeanor is one of tremendous self confidence and she is drawn to that more than just him being physically attractive. A notable quote by the FL…If a man cannot keep a promise to a woman….what can he keep? This shows how important Honor and Loyalty is to the FL.

I can highly relate to this situation as this has been my life story. I have lived in the wilderness a lot of my life. I was accomplished at many things when younger, including martial arts. I simply could not relate to someone my own age. I ended up marrying two times, both men were much older than me…..one 26 years older, the other 20. For me a relationship is not so much about love, although that is important, but more about respecting my partner for his own accomplishments which I require to be many. The FL proves this is also how she views a potential partner. She isn’t interested in daily Korean life, she wants to be a mover and shaker and is likewise drawn to someone else who is also that way.

So I give Kudos to casting for including this wonderful dynamic - rarely seen in KDramas. The story moves along swiftly and I thoroughly enjoyed the time that was shown where she was training to be a Freedom Fighter. She is that perfect combination of being tough as nails, but not emotionally stunted…..she lets her guard down when she knows she can trust someone.

Honorable mention certainly goes to Choi Moo Sung (her mentor) - he always nails a character. Of course we must mention Yoo Yeon Seok (Dong Mae the Samurai). He is just breathtaking in this role - certainly one of his finest roles. You just breathe in his pain, his confusion and despair and embrace the choices he makes as he emotionally matures through the series.

Surprisingly there are a lot of very funny moments in this tragedy series. Often provided by Il-Sik, the trader. For instance he is asked what his name means. His friend says Hope. Il Sik shakes his head and says no, it means never skip a meal. Later on he is trying to explain to a lady gambler why she isn’t having any luck as a gambler. He says to her “In a game, if you can’t figure out who is being hustled, its probably you”. Between his witty sayings and his funny facial expressions, he brings a light heart to a heavy drama.

Lastly Byun Yo Han (SML) does a really wonderful job. You can’t stand him in the beginning and cry for him in the ending. I don’t really consider this a spoiler statement…..most of us who are long time watchers of Sageuk know the SML never has a happy ending.

First Kdrama I watched and just one of the best shows I've seen period.
Goddamn this show is fantastic. The characters, story, acting, action everything is just so well done. Such great production values and cinematography. I can't speak too specifically on the show since it's been a while since I've seen it but it has still strongly stuck with me. I absolutely loved how Eugene's and Koe Ae - shin's relationship developed, their romance was beautiful. All the supporting characters are strong. Eugene's confrontation of the people who wronged him as a child was great and what a great performance by Lee Byung-hun, the boy who plays him as a kid also does a wonderful job. I do remember finding the Samurai guy to be a little too edgy sometimes but he has a great story nonetheless.

As far as re watch value goes, I would watch it again but some of it is pretty sad so maybe one day.

It Is My New Favorite Kdrama
I am not going to lie, I probably will NOT watch it again EVEN THOUGH it's my favorite. If you have been a long time kdrama fan, you know how TVN is. Not only is this a TVN show but also a historical drama so you know they are not afraid to kill some characters. It is a heartbreaking story but more than that, it is just so beautiful to watch. It is a real masterpiece. The visuals are appealing and the storyline is interesting. I love how well written the characters are and their relationship with each other. I can say this is one of the best kdrama I have ever watched. You are going to be deeply attached to all the characters and that is the reason why you might cry the most. Everything is great but I still think it will hurt me if I rewatch it.

An Epic Story of Love and Sacrifice
This drama affected me more than any I have ever seen. The acting and story fit together perfectly.

I was brought to tears multiple times; tears of joy, rage, and love. All of the actors and actresses moved me with their performances. The story illustrates the tragic history of Japan and Korea. This is must see drama in my humble opinion.

I wish this series could be successfully adapted to a full length movie with international distribution.

Kudos to the wonderful actors and producers of this magnificent story.

I just finished watching this drama today and i am still in shocked. My mind is blank right now and I don’t know what to say. I always like historical drama especially when it involves humanity and wars. I like how the writer slowly builds the storyline and the relationship between characters here. I think this is the first time i like most of the characters in the kdrama show despite of their flaws but they totally bring up the dynamic in their interactions with each other. I like how far that they grow on you in each episode and they totally steal your heart.

The focus of this drama is about relationship between the king, the righteous group, friends, and most of it is about patriotism and justice for sure. It’s not so much about romantic relationship though the drive between 3 male characters’ action is towards the main female protagonist which i can totally understand, who wouldn’t fall in love with a gorgeous, brave and smart lady like aeshin? Ohhh, i like her a lot, i think aeshin is my most favorite female lead in kdrama right now.

I think they have the most profound love that stands through hardship, i really like how they respect and help each other, oh it’s too perfect and beautiful. It’s rare to get this kind of respect in your relationship nowadays. I admire their characters a lot. Huhuhu.

The cinematography is excellent, acting is also excellent, music is awesome. The journey watching this show is really enjoyable. I like a cold hard truth show like this one, i can finally say that i like your drama, kim eun sok. I don’t know how to explain this drama, you should watch it yourself coz it’s hard to explain without spoiling the story hahaha. Ok.

This deserves a 10/10 rating!!!!!
Instantly became the #1 best drama for me knocking down Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (I love u so much but I'm sorry TT^TT)
General: When you see a drama review where they say, ""it's not your typical kdrama"", well that line does not give justice to how every aspect of this drama is so unique and so well-thought of. It's a historical drama where there's actual history. 2 award-winning actors as leads, as well as award-winning actors as supporting characters! Even the villain is a veteran actor!!! Lee Byung Hun and Kim Tae Ri once again made me laugh, cry, fall in love, and feel warm.

Personal: As a person living in a country that was colonized by the same colonizing countries in the drama, I felt so connected with what the characters were feeling. It's a whole historical experience for me.

Love story: The leads' love story was so intimate in a very subtle way. I love how it was written and executed. It's a relationship/love that was not rushed, full of good qualities, they communicated despite conflicts, they understand each other's situations instead of having a fight. Basically, the whole journey of the love story in this drama is like a warm hug.

Antagonists: THEY. ARE. SO .GOOD. They'll make you hate them so much but in the end, you'll also praise them for their great acting. These characters along with the supporting characters actually made the drama even better. They're not one of those dumb and weird antagonists. Yes, they're annoying as hell but them and the leads and supporting characters were all so in par when it comes to acting and portraying their characters and executing certain scenes that will leave you wanting for moooore.

Supporting roles: I had to make a separate paragraph for them because they earned. They're all so freaking well-written I hate myself for not watching this drama sooner!!! They're not like other supporting characters where it's like the have their own separate world or own separate story/drama inside the drama itself. Not one of them became irrelevant throughout the series. Each one has something to do with the whole damn plot of the series. They're almost like lead characters. And since they're relevant to the whole story, you won't be distracted by a separate story. You'd want to know them more and I applaud the writers for that.

I honestly just started this because of one of the OSTs where Park Hyo Shin is the singer, and he's my favorite solo artist in the industry. But when I watched it, I was so surprised.

Lastly, the ending: I don't want to give spoilers you have to watch it I promise you everything will be worth it.

This drama is just breathtakingly beautiful. Those snowy scenes in ancient times with ancient clothes... just so beautiful.

I love that some parts of this drama were done in English, helps to relate. It's incredible what diversity does to a drama. By just adding an additional language in this drama, the feel completely change. The story line is good. I wouldn't bear to rewatch the last few episodes. It's just too heartbreaking.

I love how this story portrays women. Many girls would be inspired after watching. It's unfortunate that I feel Kim Tae-ri (as Go Ae-shin) didn't really shine in this drama, she didn't own the character , meaning if she were to be replaced, I don't think many wld noticed. The OST is so so only. I can't recall much since it has been over a year since I watched this.

a must watch if you like ancient times winter Korea.

WOW
Of the 70+ dramas I have watched, ""Mr. Sunshine"" was one of the BEST!! The story, acting, cinematography, EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect!
I did hear some complaints on how the history was showcased throughout the drama. Some also stated that the drama, Mr. Sunshine, showed a lot of bias. In other words, I guess the storyline showed Korea as the ""very good guy"" and Japan as the ""very bad guy"". But, I never really liked learning about history, so I thought that the story was amazing and beautiful!!
In regards to romance, there's no steamy romance with a lot of physical contact, I guess one can say. The hugs, eye contact, smiles, between the Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-ri were so sweet and anyone could tell that their characters loved each other. Other than the romance between the mains, the bromance was reallyyyy funny! Yoo Yeon-seok, Lee Byung-hun, and Byun Yo-han showed a lot of comical scenes together that always lightened up the mood. To this day, I still search up these three characters on YouTube just to see the scenes they acted out together ^^
Lastly, the cinematography!! The scenes were ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I would like you to go on Safari, YouTube, or Google and search up ""Mr. Sunshine Scenes"" and click on images. They are very beautiful~~
I guess one small complaint I have is the cast... and I know that multiple people do agree with me and others don't.
------------ Lee Byung-hun was just... too old, I honestly believe that someone younger should've been casted-------------
I too know that other people do not think the same as me and believe that ""age doesn't matter"". I respect that opinion, but... I'm just sorry, the chemistry between the mains kind of got ruined (just a lil) because of the HUGE age gap (20-years people). But I didn't hate it. The acting from both characters were AWESOMEEEEEE still. I heard that if there really were kiss scenes between Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-ri, people would've had an uproar about it ^^
OVERALL, the story PERFECT, the acting AMAZING, the cast ALMOST COMPLETE (I just still wish there was someone at least a lilll younger - Hyun Bin - would've been fine tho) that's why I couldn't give a FULL 10/10, but still... WATCH IT
I ABSOLUTELY recommend to watch this drama! You will NEVER regret it~~

Mr. Sunshine is a powerful historical drama featuring a story of romance, politics, and rebellion. Many pieces make up Mr. Sunshine which both widens its appeal but also runs the risk of being too ambitious. I chose Mr. Sunshine to be my first K-Drama precisely because I have a soft spot for all of these genres. Mr. Sunshine did not fail to impress and it ended up exceeded my expectations.

I will immediately note that this drama was perfectly cast. Every actor is a natural fit for their role and each character is very memorable. Among the main characters, Lee Byung-hun as Eugene Choi and Byun Yo-han as Kim Hee-sung stand out in my mind. Even the side characters feature great acting with Choi Moo-sung as Jang Seung-goo and Lee Seung-joon as Emporer Gojong.

The characters of Mr. Sunshine are intriguing enough to pull the show through its slowest parts. The mains come from a wide variety of backgrounds offering unique perspectives on the rapidly changing society of the setting. It is particularly interesting in that the show offers the perspectives of those born in the lower classes of Joseon society with Eugene Choi, who was born a slave, and Goo Dong-mae, who was born into a butcher family, considered to be the lowest tier in Joseon's caste system. The show also gives a voice to women of the late Joseon era. Protagonist Go Ae-shin is a noblewoman longing to gain more education and get involved in the politics of her nation against the wishes of her tradition-minded father. Kudo Hina is a successful businesswoman, a rarity in Joseon at the time of this setting, who operates a hotel hosting primarily foreigners. Unlike other characters, her loyalties are not immediately apparent and she acts as an interesting bridge between the other main characters. Lastly, Kim Hee-sung is the second-richest nobleman in Joseon but lacks ambition and purpose, causing him to waste his time with womanizing and drinking. Surprisingly, it was Kim Hee-sung who ended up being my favorite due to his fantastic development.

Great attention is paid to the details of Mr. Sunshine's story. For example, the first episode is essentially a long prologue but the viewer does not realize that literally every line uttered in the first episode is built upon throughout the story and nearly every character with a speaking role becomes an important character later in the story. The show is not afraid to demonstrate this with plethora of flashbacks, which admittedly can be excessive at times.

Romance is a main feature of the story. There are even two love triangles involving to some extent all of the five main characters. Fortunately, the drama never becomes ""guess who this character will chose!"" It is evident from the beginning who each character loves and also that their feelings will not be fickle.. The drama from these love triangles come from unrequited love and love that breaks Joseon societal norms. I was skeptical of the romantic element for the first half of the story but all doubts were put to the rest when I saw how the romance builds on itself in the second half.

Emotions are powerful in this show. The emotions in scenes are amplified by a striking soundtrack that never seems to run out of heart-wrenching melancholic songs. Viewers should certainly be aware that they are not in for a picnic of a drama. However, the drama is not always go cruel and dark, especially in the beginning. For every scene showcasing Japanese cruelty to Koreans there is a romantic scene or comic relief. The writers are smart enough to pace these scenes of wildly different emotions from each other. Viewers won't go from viewing two servants cracking jokes immediately to an execution.

Perhaps the greatest point to make about Mr. Sunshine is that it is an evocative show. At times it can feel like propaganda with its uncompromisingly negative portrayal of the Japanese yet slightly positive portrayal of the United States. However, the show is not afraid to be critical of Joseon society. Three of the main characters have tragic backstories literally caused or exacerbated by the backwardness of the ultra conservative culture. The other two characters rebel against their society's culture and norms, albeit in very different ways.

Aside from the show's politics, I have a desire to write about this drama's character development, romance, the emotionally powerful soundtrack, the impressive cinematography, the metaphors and symbolism. I may write a analysis of these topics in another spoiler-heavy review.

Do not expect to get the best war story ever told or the best romance ever written with Mr. Sunshine. Mr. Sunshine is a jack of many genres, but a master of none. This will be absolutely fine if you enjoy historical romantic dramas with a story about war and rebellion. Like me, you will be easily able to get through the slow pacing approximately episodes 3-13. If you are not a fan of these genres it will be more difficult, but I still recommend to give Mr. Sunshine a shot.

So many sad moments, but 100% worth the tears
I love the cast's diverse linguistic skills - makes it feel very authentic because the time frame the series is depicted in. Lee Byung Hun is a marvelous actor and really expresses Choi Yoo Jin(Yu-Jin)/Eugene's emotional conflict, sadness of loss and the slow increase in his subtle, but growing smiles... are indeed like sunshine, they're so beautiful to see. Kim Tae Ri does a beautiful job & I can appreciate the dynamic of her being a strong woman working toward bettering herself to achieve her goals but still hold a playful, musing air when (as Go Ae Shin/Ae-Sin) she interacts with Choi Yu-Jin. At times there were a few places where she seemed a little stiff.

The 2nd leads, Yoo Yeon Seok (Gu Dong Mae / Ishida Sho), Byun Yo Han (Kim Hui Sung), and Kim Min Jung (Kudo Hina / Le) are amazing in their own right. The chemistry, conflict, emotion of their characters were conveyed well. Each contributed something memorable for their characters, even as I type I remember each of them; that's how great a ""felt"" impression they left for me. The dynamic of the relationships between all the characters in this story flows nicely and is masterful as the the threaded connections slowly shorten bringing all of them together for better or for worst.

In some episodes, there were cuts in a particular scene that weren't cleanly edited so the transition & time flow were smooth, but it added to the effect/benefit of another character in the following scene. It also made it feel like the progression of time was longer than what it was.

So many sad moments, but 100% worth the tears

I am at loss of words
Mr. Sunshine has redefined perfection. From cinematography to dialogues to story, acting. This show is perfect on every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling. This show is brutal, it is beautiful, it is honest. This show will rip your heart into pieces an you will still keep watching because it is that beautiful.

I have been watching Korean shows since last 10 years and i have not seen a show as great as this.
I was completely ignorant about such a painful history of the Korea. I don't know how many shows or movies South Korea has made on Japanese colonization, but I must say this has got to be their best work.
I have never cried as hard as i did while watching Mr. Sunshine. It felt like they were my own countrymen. Being from India, a country that had been enslaved by The British for 200 years, I could relate so much of their pain and sacrifice. I have heard stories all my life about the martyrs and the freedom fighters of my own country. Never did I think i will see the same stories of another country.
May be all countries who fell victim of Imperialism still bears the scar of our ancestors.
I wish this show had a happy ending, but real life did not have happy ending. So this story has what real life had. At the end they had gun and glory. Happy Ending followed decades later.
I can go on and on about this show so may be this is enough. Please watch this show, no matter what.

Lastly, I must say each and every frame of this show is so picturesque that often i found myself pausing the show and staring at my computer screen just to grasp the beauty of the show.

""split personality"" review
in reality, i hate to rain on somebody's parade, and since a lot of people truly love this drama, i apologize, but what must be said must be said.
i can not relate to this drama but from a truly split personality perspective, since it has the ""good, the bad, the ugly"" and more. all that the other viewers write about it is mostly true - mind-bogglingly beautiful scenery (the scene where ae-shin is walking with eugine on the icy lake takes your breath away and will stay with you forever etched in your visual and emotional library, whether it's in your brain or in your heart, and the entire story is kind of symbolic of walking on thin ice at all times), in general the choice of sites in the drama can be used for tourism in korea - guaranteed to work even today, the cinematography is up there with the most outstanding dramas and/or movies from all times, the characters especially the main 3 males and the female hotel owner hina are extremely multidimensional, like it is in real life and their continuous development is very satisfying, the acting of all actors is as good as it gets, especially lee byung-hun as eugene choi (i first saw this actor in ""all in"" while i was chasing after ji sung, and discovered lee byung-hun, and the rest was history... his charisma, his manly charm, his superb acting, his ability to go from extreme toughness to extreme softness - he was raised to my top best korean actors from that moment on) and he does not disappoint in ""mr. sunshine"", he stays true to himself as an artist, as always gives it his all, and shines with unmistakable inner beauty. one more thing that i noticed, when he gazes at ae-shin or even other people, he slowly blinks just one time, and the blink is like a cat that blinks to his/hers owner expressing love, it's really special, if you know cats. the other actress that i enjoyed very much is of course the adorable, mysterious, badass kim min-jung as kudo hina, she truly kept me on my toes, with her non-ending french designers dresses, hats, jewelry, her quirky intelligence and female intuition, her courage, her undeniable charm. these two characters or i should say actors kept me wanting to see more and more of them, even when i wanted to just leave this show many times throughout, the slow paste of it drove me crazy, the lengthy looking in each others eyes for minutes at a time without any movement or action - i wanted to scream enough already, we get the idea, we are not dumb... the heart breaking good byes between ae-shin and eugen, too many, not justified and always coming back together just to say good bye again - really? some other things that annoyed me to no end i will mention later here... the other two characters that is worth mentioning is yoo yeon-seok as goo dong-mae, perfectly cast in this role, so strong, gorgeous looking, evil, always with endless pain bubbling to the surface, always staying a step ahead of death, and byun yo-han as kim hee- sung, the typical spoiled rich brat, always gambling, loosing and drinking on the account of others. both of these characters, one was born in the lowest class of that society, the other was a son of the richest aristocrats in this area. dong-mae like a ticking bomb on the verge of exploding and taking down all around him no matter how, who or what. kim hee-sung, the aristocrat, who loves all things beautiful, easy going, trying to charm everybody no matter who, making a joke out of any situation. frankly, i did not like these two all the way till the last third of the drama, and then they kind of woke up, tapped into their own morals, grew on me and developed into characters that slowly charmed my heart and i got deeply invested in them all, only to be devastated at the brutal end. the question for me, was it worth spending so many annoying hours of this drama, to finally get to the last third part and especially the last 5 episodes, to finally get so emotionally attached to this characters only to be completely heart broken at the end? i truly did not answer that question yet. and now the most baffling part of this drama - the main female character, ae-shin. i think her character was completely screwed up by the writers, she was the only one one- dimensional as it can be. yes, they wanted to show her burning patriotism for her country and cause, but they deprived her of humanity. wasn't she a physical body like all of us? didn't she have emotions that a woman would express through some kind of affection to the love or her life? the one who gave up ALL that he had in this world for her, his adopted country that he was so proud of, his military career that he loved, his best friend, and finally his own life in exchange of hers. (by the way, eugene choi succeeded somehow to express his love without touching her ever, but it felt like he was stopped by her inner desire to avoid any physicalness) and at all times, there was not a single hug, kiss or any other form of expressing love. how on earth can that be? even when they got married, no hug, no kiss - nothing. and i understand the writers or directors idea of showing extreme patriotism above all, but show at least something... something that would move us and make us believe that she really loves. that was my greatest disappointment and the biggest flaw of this drama. and last but not least i wanted to mention the politics in this drama, that was supposed to be kind of the background to anything else, but took over and became the major part of it. although interesting in terms of korean history (and made me truly hate the japanese cruelty), it was too much of it and became simply boring many times. now that you know ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" you decide if this drama is for you, if you can tough out to the third part of the drama.

Despite the title, Mr. Sunshine is no romantic fairy tale. Handsome Captain Eugene Choi returns to the land of his birth after 30 years in the USA where he carved a brilliant career in the military, only to find that nothing has changed for the better and the kingdom is now threatened by the increasing presence of the Japanese army.
Joseon's King/Emperor, lacking the support of his ministers and betrayed by many, does not want to create a confrontation with a superior military force fearing it would plunge the country into a bloodbath, so he gives in too often and finally loses the throne. Joseon-Korea ended up under Japanese occupation for 36 years until the end of WW2.
Eugene falls in love with Ae-Shin, a noblewoman fighting for her country, and protects her at the risk of his life and career. Lee Byung-hun makes an excellent captain, his calm demeanor and composure thinly veiling the anguish of his childhood and his now all consuming love for Ae-shin.

A SAD PATRIOTIC DRAMA
Where is Mr. Sunshine? Because we don't see him in the drama, all men were serious deep sober men, but I love this drama so much. Background story was about invasion of Americans and Japanese into Jeseon Empire and how this Eugene Choi who born into slavery, run away to America and graduated as US Marine Corps officer, he returned to Korea as Consulate officer and investigate the murders and missing rifles. This drama has the elements of dramatic suspense, a noble lady who's expert with guns and amazing sniper without anyone knew about it, she met Eugene Choi while they're both on the mission. If you're talking about man with uniform, Eugene Choi (Lee Byung-hun) is the man, with calm steady confident demeanor he's the type of person that you won't mess around while an aristocrat's grand-daughter, Go Ae-shin (Kim Tae-ri), who is part of the Righteous Army, kept herself dignify by defending her beloved country. They both fallen in love but they both born from different class not to mention Ae-Shin has Kim Hee-sung (Byun Yo-han), a nobleman who has been Ae-shin's betrothed since childhood. 3 men loved her deeply; Eugene Choi, Kim Hee-Sung, Goo Dong-Mae and none of these guys stay alive at the end.

I love the character of Kudo Hina, she's an amazing woman - Glory Hotel owner who's using her beauty and charms to move around the elites and helping the cause, with her smile and soft spoken she killed people with her gun and sword. She's braver and more dangerous than any men because she's doing it without a flinch of eye and strong determination. Blow up her own hotel to kill Japanese that resulting her own demise, the ending was so sad, everyone died and unhappy ending. The best thing about this drama is the production did not fake of anything, the actors spoke English, France, Japanese as good as their Korean without sound like gringos. This is a great drama with beautiful background setting, top notch acting and casts, beautiful flowing story line, it's simply the best serious Korean drama so far.

From this drama, I learn something about the history of Americans in Korea and in what involvements, or whether there's truth in this story line. Become a family discussion to compare notes...meticulously Americans been in Korea way before Korean War like what's in the history book told us at school. Very interesting indeed..looking inside of Korean history as well as American history in Korea.

I hesitated watching this drama because the time period seemed boring and I don't like watching anything about war, etc. I'm glad I decided to watch it as its a really nice one. I've loved LBH since watching All In and I just swoon over him more since watching this drama. The role was made for him. He speaks English so well and acts better than that all the other people who speak English in this drama. I loved the comraderie between the guys and the love story was really well written. I wish all dramas can be this good!

It feels like a movie. There's too much to take, given that it is only a drama series. I cried for the least expected scene I could think of, I cried for the last scenes when the patriotism of the characters was shown, it really striked my heart, and I was just surprised when I felt the tears in my face. I never thought I'll have that strong feeling for something that's way past behind my generation, especially not even in my own country, I never thought that flashbacks from my learnings about our own country's history would appear and I would reflect again that much. And with that I really want to thank the producers, directors, the whole team of this drama for showing it to the world, inferior countries like us( I'm from the Philippines which was conquered by Americans that time ) do have this kind of story that must be told again and again for generations to see. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 10 is because I longed for the romantic scenes for the main characters and was disappointed until the end, I felt the love, yes, but not having even a single kiss scene, even in the cheeks makes me really sad.

I just watched a masterpiece . The drama excels in every aspect from OSTs to Cinematography , this is one of the best, Definitely in my top 10. This is when we realise that responsible creators are most important in the industry. They didn't try to make a fool out of the viewers like most of the others do. They valued our time and work hard to bring the best out. It's all evident in this drama from start to end. The casts were amazing. I was amazed by the FL from Little forest and Handmaiden. She is subtle yet strong in the way of representing the character. LBH as always was superb and mostly, cool and stylish . Yoon Seok was admirable as well playing a bit of both good and bad shade. The actors done the role brilliantly and maturely without the regular dose of cliches that K-actors produce. Must watch!!!!!

Deserving of its praise.
Mr Sunshine Review:
This review is from my perspective as an international viewer.

=== Production Value: ===
The production value is SUPERB. The Joseon set designs were really good that I was able to immerse myself in their period. The set looks new for something in their time.

Though, I have some criticisms for the New York scenes. Especially those on the bridge. While I understand that they did not put extras for the sake of dramatic effects, it took me out of the drama since it feels like New York is a desolate city.

=== Plot: ===
The plot was really slow at first (This is a personal problem and preference because I really have a short attention span) though, as I though over it a few times that I kinda prefer it for the characters, especially with the looming war in the horizon. How I wish for them that time could just pass by slowly so that we don’t have to see them suffer.

There were some elements of visual storytelling that I saw and seeing those small tidbits being set up before the war part coming together in the final act. Especially the EMOTIONAL SCENES. *Chef’s kiss*

I liked the creative liberties that they took in putting some internal conflict in the form of political intrigue in the drama.

== Characters: ===
I can see that diluting Ae-sin’s character to highlight others characters in the story was done deliberately. She’s not entirely a flatly written as her headstrong personality and a sense of duty of her country was what drew these three men to her and made them care for a country that abandoned them. (I’m not so sure for Dong Mae’s motivations but I am sure with Eugene’s and Huiseong’s though).

Eugene is a character who was already stable when the story started. He has a past then, he returned to Joseon after he became a soldier. He just goes with what America dictates to him before Ae-sin came into his life. After he met Ae-sin, his character was given depth as he was torn between his identity as a Joseon man serving as an American soldier. Even if the conclusion to his character arc was a sad one but it was satisfying. The dam of emotions I felt for this drama finally broke when his Lieutenant friend was reading what happened to him.

Dong Mae belongs to the character tropes that I really hate the most. He’s your average bad boy type who has a past and decided to join the Japanese gang, Black Dragon Society. He became a mercenary. He began to soften when he and Ae-sin interacted more. His interactions with Hina Kudo were also memorable to watch because their relationship seemed more of genuine and platonic friendship rather than lovers. (Heck, this was one of those platonic friendships done really well that I’ve seen in a drama.)

Huiseong also belongs to the type of men that I hate the most, PLAYBOYS. He’s one of those characters who bears the guilt of the sins of his clan and seems aimless with no motivations until he met Ae-sin and the other two men. With his character development, HE BECAME ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS. While the other characters preferred to fight using bloodshed (guns and swords), he prefers to fight using intellect, his camera and pen. I also like that when he was taking photos of the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan, they used gunshots as if the camera shots dealt some kind of impact. The sad part of his character arc was despite him finding a purpose, no one would remember his name as he fought for Joseon. He died in prison alone with no one to mourn for him. Despite being tortured, the smiling mask that he wears never seems to come off of him.

Kudo Hina/ Lee Yang Hwa is my favorite characters in this drama as someone who exemplifies true feminism. I admire how strong her character is. Her father just sees her as a pawn to expand his influence but still, she managed to make herself independent. With her cunning wit and charisma, she’s able to use her position as someone who allows different forms of life to enter her hotel to help Joseon. She also knows when to be feminine while being a badass who holds the sword elegantly at the same time.

This was also one of the few dramas where the side characters had more impact to the stakes of the situation they were in. They do not feel like props but as characters who also had to struggle during that time. There are too many to mention so rather not.

=== Dialogue ===
The dialogue had more purpose aside from serving as padding for this very long drama. They serve as extra setups for the grand event that was going to come and the callbacks to those little scenes and dialogues made me cry a lot.

=== More than just romance ===
I went into this drama expecting a romance. Though, I wasn’t disappointed that it was purely romance since I like the other elements in this story.

=== OST/Music ===
As for the instrumentals in the background, they didn’t bother me that much but for once, I am glad that they used classical pieces in the Glory Hotel scenes to accentuate the time period it was in.
The OSTs in this drama is not so overpowering compared to other dramas. When they’re played in the credits, I don’t feel tired hearing them again and again and had some impact on how I perceive the events that transpired in each episode.
One of those OSTs that I kept replaying is The Day by Park Hyo Shin.

Extra thoughts:

Playing The Day at the end of the drama with the flag of Joseon waving made me more emotional and a bit patriotic (not for Korea but for my country whose citizens seems to idolize politicians more to the point of them not being able to take criticisms directed towards them).

The deaths really shocked me and I finally cried upon seeing the objects that represents the characters being sold in the pawnshop.

If I have the time, I am surely going to re-watch this drama 100% despite it being tragic.

Just watched the last episode, and, goodness!!...I feel as if I have been put through the wringer! This gorgeous 24 episode series is full of wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography and heartfelt music. It is a historical fiction of a young man who is forced to flee Korea because his life is in danger. He comes back years later as an American soldier and ready to take revenge on those who hurt his family. The drama that surrounds him sets the course in the path he takes, whether it ends in happiness or tragedy.

I love films that make me care for the characters, even the not-so-good ones because the writers have taken the time to flesh them out and not make them one dimensional villains. The female characters are very strong. No Mary Janes here. The acting is out of this world, pleased that they were able to cast a very talented ensemble. This is a show that doesn't not leave you. The historical situations were fascinating. It has been a real pleasure waiting for new episodes to come out weekly. Watch this. You will not be disappointed

Wow, after watching 24 episodes of Mr sunshine, I do not know how to feel exactly. At first, I found the show to be extremely slow-paced and boring but something about it kept me going. I felt it was too slow-paced especially with respect to the relationship between the two main leads, I would have thought that the lure in the forbidden affair between the yu jin the slave and Aeshin the noble would be capitalized but all we got were long stares and heartfelt goodbyes. I actually felt more chemistry between dong mae and aeshin even though it was a bit on the obsessive side on his part. However, the historical part of the drama held it together as it gave its audience a glimpse of what Joseon went through at that time. I loved the acting, I felt the cast really got into their roles and delivered their best, I loved that it did not end up with the typical revenge troupe, I thought the story would just be about Yujin coming back for revenge, but I liked how the drama pointed out that at the end of the day, there is a choice not to go down that path. I also loved how in the end there were no fixed heroes or villains, this can be illustrated by Hina and Hui seng who refused to follow their father's footsteps and chose to fight for their country.
The tragic, yet hopeful feel the drama gave off at the end was beautiful but I would have loved it if they did not kill off the whole cast leaving just Aeshin

I NEVER watched any HISTORICAL drama but this one made me binge-watch it on NETFLIX!!
This series isn't even finish yet but I am currently rewatching it again for the 3rd time!
I love the cinematography in this TV Series. The staff/crew of the show really made an effort in making this historical drama.
It's amazing how the writer created this epic and unpredictable drama.
The love story is incredibly cute and makes me think of Eugene Choi and Ae-sin once in awhile(because it's that good!).
The actors are all superb; they all did a spectacular performance and delivered the lines pretty well.

Truly beautifully written masterpiece
Let me start off by saying I do not watch historical dramas. This is a rare occurrence but I became curious due to the ratings and reviews. I am currently on episode 20 and can confirm this is worth every waking moment. This is a beautifully written story with several twists and turns that cover everything from romance, unrequited love, the struggle between the rich and the poor, the righteous vs the corrupt, power and war. The drama intensely takes you through the impact that war, betrayal, social status, love and corruption had on the lives of all the main characters. There is an excruciating amount of pain throughout each episode; at times overwhelming and heartbreaking.  Yet, there are also those perfect moments in the plot that are just breathtakingly beautiful, humorous and heartwarming.

The acting and character development is phenomenal. From the two main female leads, though beautiful and poised also mysterious in their own way. Their strength is not just in their beauty. They have learned to survive in a world where their freedom is dictated by men and/or their country. The fearless yet hopeless romantics that play the male leads, Dong Mae, Hui Sung and Eugene Choi and even those within the Righteous Army each have a story that plays out. Right off episode one you dive into bits and pieces of everyone's lives. Discovering the closer you get to the end that they are all interconnected in one way or another.

What is there not to love about the three male leads? Aside from the fact you could slice the tension between them with a knife. One scene I can still recall is when Eugene addressed Hui Sung , who was still unaware of the impact his family had in Eugene's life. ""When there is a man in front of you whose heart has been torn out. You shouldn't say you're hurt.....That would be shameful."" While I watched this, though a minor part. I felt the pain piercing through Eugene's stare as he addressed the son of the family that killed his parents. Also, the chemistry between Eugene and Lady Ae-Sin is spot on. One of my favorite scenes is when she drops out of nowhere and directs him to a meeting spot after she waited days for him to reply to her letter. In that space, she ends up getting the upper hand by grabbing his gun and while pointing it directly at his face proceeds to question him. Romantic huh? But, regardless of what they were doing their romance is captivating even without having to exchange words.

Everything so far has come together seamlessly. Yet, as beautiful as this drama truly is there is also a significant amount of loss. But, I do hope the writer pulls through towards the end and that they can save us (the viewers) from a sad ending.

I love it.
Everything about this show!
The actors are very good. Gorgeous too.
Lady Ae Shin will become one of the most famous heroines of all time.
The three gallant males too.
Just perfect!
Hina the other female. The fatal one is great too. I love shows where the women are strong but feminine.
It is pure luxury .... The camera is one of the best ... It reminds me how cinema used to be.
Korean history is full of great characters and rich moments in history.... It is very sad too

Mr. Sunshine was the first kdrama that I ever watched and oh boy, did it set a high bar. From the costumes to the music, the production quality is really high. The story is compelling and while the romance(s) are very central to the show, there's enough going on outside of them that you never feel that things are being neglected in favour of romance.

I've watched it through all of the way twice and loved it just as much the second time.

Spoilers beyond this point!
I am not, and will never be, over the ending. I just cried through the last few episodes. Full sobs as pretty much everyone died.

It`s been a while since I`ve watch something like this, seriously. I didn`t think Korea could put anything better tan Warrior Baek Dong Soo but this definitely goes hand to hand, Korean Historical dramas have some magic to it that you don`t really get from other series and this is no exception.

Writting: I`m on episode 8 and I`m truly amazed with the writting and the plod, there seems to be no word in the dialog that is unnecessary or misplaced, they all fall in place beautifully, the romantic lines melt your hard, the dramatic parts really move you and all the tension between the characters you can really feel, i think this is where this series truly excels

Acting: acting is superb, specially since I'm not korean so I don't know if its a natura representation of how they are, but they can definitely transfer your emotions. I can relate to the characters and my favorite so far is the yakuza, something tells me he will end up sacrificing himself at the end, well executed.

Plod and storyline: I`ve seen a lot of people say is its slow and that first chapter is confusing, and well i agree that it can be, but not in a bad way as everything reveals its self as you are watching and in that sence i love it, as you are always looking for answers and thinking and then you get supprised as the story seems cleaver. I also like the character development although at episode 8 there still a lot i want to know about the main characters, but i think it contributes to the mystery.

Music and visual: stunning, its like you are watching a realistic paint from Miguel angelo, and Korea (if everthing was filmed there) its beautifully it really make you go there in this part i think is superior to Baek Dong Soo. and music is spot on, it complements the beautiful scenery without been overwhelming

overall I'll give a 9.5 up to episode 8. fully recommended if you are looking to see thru cinematography which require you to do some thinking and be patient as things start to unravel, not your american show where they pack a livetime in 40 minutes, Koreans seem to like to take their time to explain things and to create an ambient, that why they are so worth watching

If you like visual then its a five star but everything else is too slow.The main lead looks like father and daughter. Story is boring after watching maid,six flying dragon and roots ,this looks like kindergarten stories.Only good reasons to watch until episode 8 was Netflix hi definition.I dropped now and rewatched six dragon just to take away my boredom.There is a scene where you can see flies interacting which is more interesting than characters acting.It looks like all the budget is gone on making pretty.

MUST WATCH or You Will Regret Not Watching This.
The title and plot may seem misleading at first like some random cheesy fantasy story. But it is none of that. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE DRAMAS EVER, PERIOD. I literally finished a box of tissues watching this because I kept getting so emotional watching this. This is something anyone can and should watch no matter what genre they prefer I feel. This is a warm heart touching family drama. And let me just say the actors are phenomenal, to make me cry this much takes skill. I loved the acting of each character because they portrayed everything so well, I don't think anyone could've done better. Also, every OST is really good too so another plus. I HIGHLY recommend people to give this a chance. It will touch on the hardships and sacrifices of family and the warmth this show has really hit me. It deals with many psychological things as well and it's just so sweet to watch all the relationships and the love family have for each other. Please watch this, you won't regret it. Also, when I watch dramas usually I am tapping the 10-second skip button a lot for the boring parts, but for 18 again I watched every second.

MUST WATCH
The best drama during October that I watched.
The storyline keeps the audience from getting bored, and makes them curious to watch the next episode. Emotions that fluctuate, do not make this drama seem excessive, instead it makes the story more interesting. The actors are very good at playing the characters in this drama. Makes us feel the emotions of each character as if we really are in their position as characters in this drama. Even the music supports all the scenes at every moment in this drama.

Beautiful, heartwarming story about life choices and regret
This is a must-watch if you're in for a heartwarming love/family story without the stupid draggy drama tropes.
Bound to give you some inspiration in life and some words of encouragement.

The premise is very simple: like the original US film 17 Again,
18 Again is about the male lead being unhappy with his life and his body suddenly goes back to when he was 18
So you have two actors (one ""old"" and one ""young"") playing the same character
and learning about what it means to appreciate the mundane daily life
and what it means to love someone even when real life gets hard
(but like, realistic ""trying to make enough money to live"" ""trying to chase after your career dream"" hard, not ""chaebol mother kimchi slaps"" or ""ultimate bad guy is here to kill us all"" hard)

10/10 to the acting because Lee Do-hyun absolutely slayed!
Playing a 40+-year-old soul in a 18-year-old body, he really did have that chemistry with his costar Kim Ha-neul
The way he looks at her with so many mixed emotions and the way the characters interact really makes me forget that Lee Do-hyun is a young new rising star.
Of course the other actors also added a lot to the story telling. I don't think there's a bad apple in the cast at all.

18 Again , A Surprisingly Heartwarming Drama...

For those who don’t know, “18 Again” regurgitates the same fundamental premise of the American movie“ 17 again” (2009’). Yet rather than having Matthew Perry in a rugged business suit moping around for most of the opening of the movie, we are instead introduced to Yoon Sang Hyun ( Secret Garden, I Can Hear Your Voice) playing our very different protagonist, Hong Dae- Young.

In a slightly similar manner to his American character counterpart, Dae- Young isn’t living a happy life- his job as a practical handyman brings in only enough for him to survive, he is in the process of a divorce with his former teen sweetheart, Jung Da-jung ( Kim Ha Neul) and to make matters worse, he has totally lost touch with trying to connect with his two children Hong Shi-ah ( Roh Jeong Eui) and Hong Shi-woo( Ryeoun) since they have entered their teen years . A surprising miracle , however, allows Dae- Young to return back to his 18 year-old self ( Lee Do Hyun) as he attempts to relive his glory days back at high-school.

On the other hand, whilst comical misunderstandings from generation gaps to Dae Young’s best friend, Go Deok-jin ( Kim Kang Hyun) having to pose as his father are undeniably taken from the movie for comical effect ,
where the drama divulges in plot from the original movie is by adding a more bittersweet and crisp level of characterisation and backstory to our characters for viewers .

Whilst Sang- Hyun felt a strange and respectfully mismatched choice as the older counterpart of Lee Do Hyun, it soon became apparent how both actors were able to perfectly mimic the other in a fairly complicated manner. Do Hyun had to juggle between portraying his version of Dae-Young and Dae-Young’s new alias, Go Woo- Young in a mature lighting , whereas evidently Sang-Hyun had to channel the elements of being a high schooler again when the camera reverts Do Hyun back to his “ true-self”.

Respectfully this is also thanks to fairly good characterisation as well- rather than merely writing off Do Hyun as a love struck clown like in the movie ready to win back his wife . The reasons behind Do Hyun’s estranged relationship with Da- Jung and his children are far more complicated as a consequence of his biggest challenge in the drama , being to overcome his personal struggle by attaining an altruistic perspective for others, rather than allowing his past problems to consume his sense of identity .

In addition to this one of the most surprising examples of characterisation in the show had to be with Shi-ah ( Roh Jeong Eui), the teenage daughter of Do Hyun. Although Shi- ah appears in the first few episodes of the drama as a stereotypical teen through milking her father for cash , obsessed with her looks and a rebel at school , Shi-ah’s reasons for doing so are actually a lot more complicated than they first appear. Perhaps my only slightly annoyance with Shi-ah’s character portrayal was the desire to pair her off with the cliche of the dreaded stereotype of the “ goody two shoes” childhood friend ( Choi Bo Min) as well as disturbingly the bully of her brother ( Hwang In Yeop). It wasn’t that Shi- ah shouldn’t have had a romantic pairing in the show, however, it took away a lot of focus away from Shi-ah’s own story and familial relationships as an individual more than anything else.

On one note of appraisal, however, In Yeop’s character, Goo Ja- sung wasn’t written off like his American counterpart as merely just the “ superficial bully” of the story. Similar to a lot of real-life scenarios, Ja- Sung is a product of his own unhappy environment and thus only begins to learn from his mistakes as a consequence of others like Shi- ah and Dae- Young showing empathy towards him. This is perfectly shown is a tragicomic scene in one later episode of the series where after a certain incident, Dae- Young is able to bond with Ja-Sung (despite his initial anger over bullying his son ) over a similar incident also happening to him . Whilst a fairly sad and heartwarming scene, a great misunderstanding by Ja- Sung over Deok-Jin ( pretending to be Dae-Young’s father) leads him to comically claiming that Deok- Jin doesn’t “ seem the type” to do so.


This naturally moves us onto Ha- Neul as Da- Jung. Initially Ha- Neul’s portrayal as Da- Jung came off a bit too headstrong in the first several scenes of her character introduction, however, as the drama progresses Ha- neul peels back another layer to her character as rather than just a comical plot device through her portrayal of Da- Jung as an individual. Da- Jung’s past with Do Hyun from teen lovers to on the brink of a divorce offers Da- Jung new opportunities as a working news reporter and rekindled connections with her children, yet it also faces her with conflicting over rekindling the past by holding onto memories of Do Hyun as well as her friendship with Choo Ae- Rin ( Lee Mi do) or a new interest in baseball player Ye Ji- hoon ( Wi Ha Joon). Initially whilst Da-Jung’s character was fairly strong, a problem which clearly manifests near the ending of the show is the anticlimactic finale- it isn’t necessarily that the actual ending itself needed to be changed, however, the quality of logic by the end of the show or climaxes seemed to fizzle into nothingness at the end of episode 16.

Obviously not entirely touching new ground with the concept, 18 Again was rough around the edges in parts due to anticlimactic storylines, cliches and again an indulgence of product placement later on in the show ( without rhyme or reason in some cases). On the other hand, there’s no denying that overall 18 Again was one of the few decent dramas overall of 2020 with good acting , casting as well as fairly good characterisation amongst a bittersweet storyline . Although not flawless, 18 Again is a perfect drama to watch if you want something which will touch your heart.

"" Hello, hello... hellooo""
Story- The story came from a western movie, 17 Again starring Zach Efron. Although it's not original, you can tell that this has more depth and focuses on family matters/issues. Just a reminder tho that you need a box of kleenex. lol. The flashbacks will make you bawl, it's heart wrenching but beautiful at the same time. I don't want to get into details 'coz I want the viewers to feels first hand all the emotions while watching.

Acting- Mad RESPECT for LDH's acting it's SIMPLY FLAWLESS!!!I love him in HDL,he was able to capture the heart of many eventhough he was just given a little screentime, but here, he's on a different level. YSH is a veteran actor but he gave LDH the spotlight. All the side characters/actors did an excellent job, it's not only the main leads that makes this drama exceptional but every single one of them. The roles fit them perfectly, so kuddos also to casting director.

Music- Don't get me started with the OST's. Whenever I hear the "" Hello, hello... hellooo"" bgm coming, I would grab my box of kleenex, believe me you need one.lol

Rewatch- If only I don't have tons of cdramas/kdramas lined up I would definitely rewatch this gain and again (like torturing myself)! lol.

Overall- This drama is a must watch! Give it a try and you'll never regret!!! Hands down!

A sea of subplots
If this drama is a plate of food, it had the best ingredients and beef but the chef is panicking so he added all the spices available in the kitchen, then overcooked it because he's afraid the meat will be rare. Because they have to make a 16 episode drama, they give you a lot of side stories forcefully crammed in the storyline. To be fair, sometimes I complained because the supporting characters are not given enough story depth, but 18 Again was too much in doing that. Most of the latter half of the drama is filled with all these stories and they successfully reduced my interest. I also admit that I loved the comedic parts of these stories but no, we don't need the stalker, we don't need Ye Ji Hoon's brother and his story, probably Choi Il-gwon is not necessary too. There are already enough flashbacks and more important side stories to focus on.

The casts are doing good job in their roles, especially Lee Do Hyun who successfully portrayed the 18-year old and 37-year old parts. There is no awkwardness when he is in romantic scenes with Kim Ha Neul. Yoon Sang Hyun on the other hand also managed to express frustrations and regrets to the viewers very well.

Music is generally nice, but not that super memorable. Why? Blame ""Hello"" for that. The song is a bit overused and in the end your mind just randomly playing ""hello... hello..."". So yes it managed to stick on me, but as a nuisance.

Overall this drama is quite enjoyable because the story is actually nice and full of life lessons, just skip the unfunny side stories.

Heartwarming but empty
18 Again is a beautiful story that doesn't really go anywhere. While I enjoyed the journey, in the end I'm left wondering what all of it was for. To explain what I mean, 18 Again is the retelling of the movie 17 Again, and that's the first problem. It's a retelling of a movie, and it's a 16 episode drama. To make up for that extra time, a lot of conflict and story and character development needs to be added if it wants to keep the attention of its audience and still deliver the impact of the story. And honestly, at first it didn't really feel like it was falling short of that. The family of Hong Dae Young and Jung Da Jung is broken and believable. Each member of the family has their own life to live and worries, and problems that need to be addressed before it reaches its finale. There's definitely a lot more character in this drama than there was in that movie, because there needed to be. But maybe not enough.

HDY's marriage is falling apart, and he doesn't really know why. He and his wife argue a lot and he's frustrated by the situation he's found himself in after giving up on his dreams of being a basketball player to support his high school sweetheart and their twins. He lost his chance at glory and years down the road, with their marriage crumbling, he's starting to feel regret. Through some magical, not really explained means, HDY becomes young again. He has a second chance to live the life he could have had before. Honestly, it's not a bad premise. It's fun and heartwarming to watch him befriend his children and get to know his family all over again as a classmate and not a father/husband, but that's about all the show does. He gets to know his children, stalks his wife, and misses them until he inevitably gets them back. There are minor conflicts sprinkled throughout to keep you interested, and about a million fake-outs of his wife or someone else finding out who he is, but the stakes are low and there's never anything to worry about - the worst that could happen, which obviously was not going to happen, was that the wife was going to end up with the second lead.

Shows like this rely on interpersonal relationships to really make you feel things, and there doesn't need to be an element of danger for a drama to be interesting. But conflict can take many forms, and without it, a story is made up of fluff. I cared about the characters but they weren't doing much of anything.

I have to say though, the moments that matter were done well. I wanted to see the couple back together, I wanted the children to succeed, and I did have fun along the way. The relationship with HDY and his kids was sweet and wholesome, and I did look forward to more episodes week to week. It was only after finishing it that I was able to take a step back and really assess the time I'd spent with these characters and what it all meant. I realized that the hype and emotions I felt at the start never went anywhere, and while the ending left me satisfied on one front, it left me realizing just how little story there was.

I could sit here and nitpick all of the details of this drama that left me unsatisfied. But at the end of the day, I enjoyed it. And, if you're looking for a story that does a good job portraying the average couple, that doesn't romanticize marriage like so many romances do and that makes you feel like the relationship they have is real, this is right up your alley. It's fun, it's cute, and parts of it will melt your heart. Just remember going into it that what you see is what you get, and it may fall short on substance after you meet that halfway mark.

Beautiful moments surrounded by nothing.
Here’s the thing - I liked the show when it started airing. I knew few people thought this type of plot might not work out with a drama format, but I was still full of hope. At some point, though, I had to admit they were right and I was wrong.

This show should be 12 episodes long at best. Preferable 6 to 10. It should focus on exactly 3 plotlines: Da Jung and Dae Young, Dae Young and his kids, and Da Jung’s job/dream. They should fill the episodes with school drama, as a lot of interactions were happening there. You can even keep the bullying and teen romance. But why, oh why do we need a love triangle? Why do we need a 2nd couple/romance? Why do we need all the scenes and interactions between Deok Jin and Ae Rin? Why do we need that Il Kwon mess? Or what was the point of this mystery photographer guy? There is so much going on in this show, and yet it feels like nothing is happening. All the most memorable moments that were truly meaningful were the family interactions. We do not need that many filler plots.

The last two episodes were some whole new level of cliche and stereotypes. When you have 2 cars of doom for the price of one, you know you've hit the jackpot. The back story about Ji Hoon's brother being connected to Dae Young was unnecessary and presented in the worst possible way. Such an emotional scene and yet, I could not stop laughing when the 2nd car came out of nowhere.

I don't even want to talk about the last minute ""I'm breaking up with you for your own good"" plot, because that trope just needs to die, or at least take a few years break from appearing on screen.

The highlights? All the scenes between Dae Young and his kids, both in the past and present. The slow realization he had about mistakes he made, the gradual learning that Dae Young actually cared a lot for Shi Ah and Shi Woo. These are the scenes I will remember after the show ends, and these are the ones that moved my heart the most. These were the gems that made me cry so many times, and if the show focused more on the actually important parts (relationships between main characters), chances are it might have gotten a 10 out of me.

For the acting, Lee Do Hyun aced the role. There are quite a few shows with the “younger actor playing an older character after body switch”, but none of the actors were as believable as Do Hyun. I trust this guy with my life. What do I see? Bright future ahead of him. His talent will lead him to some great roles and amazing projects.

Overall, the acting was on point. The emotional scenes were emotional, happy and funny scenes were just that: happy and funny. No areas of complaint here. Some people might dislike a few overacting moments from Lee Mi Do, Kim Kang Hyun and Kim Yoo Ri, but it was clearly a stylistic choice that has nothing to do with the acting skills of the actors themselves.

Usually I don’t pay that much attention to the soundtrack, unless it’s truly outstanding. Here, I liked quite a few songs, especially Sohyang’s Hello, which truly elevated the emotional scenes to a new level. Not to mention Sondia, who became one of my favorite ost singers, with an amazingly sweet and warm voice.

Overall, nice show, but skippable. I stayed for the parents and kids relationship and Lee Do Hyun’s acting. Even though I am massively disappointed by the obvious ending and last two episodes, the scenes between the family still made me tear up a bit and it shows how amazing this drama could have been if it was not for the unnecessary sub-plots.

1 plot, 100 subplots
the keyword here was 18 ""again"", they just kept repeating things and branching out their subplots more and more. I don't blame them becasue they had to make a 2 hour movie into a 16 hour drama but they should've atleast only did 8eps. or at some point they should've made the ml forget his family and try to live his dream as it was intended, but after his wish suddenly he was chasing his kids and hanging out around his wife/getting jealous every two seconds.

the good;
the family bonds
the friendships
the friendships in the family
the acting was nice
the directing was beautiful (ie the cinematography)
the comedy was sometimes good


the bad;
the existence of the 2nd lead
the 2nd leads backstory and his over confident and selfish personality (his flirting got on my nerve)
Deok Jin and Hae In's over complicated dragged out romance (we can't be together for blah blah reason)
and basically every plot unrelated to the fact that the ml was young again
the 1st ten or twenty mins and the last 5mins were the only thing plot related, suddenly they'd go out to eat
ep14-16 and the endless breakup was just horrible that made me reduce my ratings from 8.5 to 7
the ost was nice but that Hello Hello song was overused that it got on my nerve
there's a saying, ""if you don't have a plot add a stalker"" and guess what, they did
the work drama around the mom was ""realistic"" but they even got to ruin that, for 1- everyone randomly hated her, and 2- suddenly everyone forgot (I'm mostly talking about the boss)


and I never rewatch stuff

Not a typical or cliché', shattered all my expectations
Cheerful with a happy ending, but to deliver that ending It went through a whole punch of social problems such as, bullying, divorce, starting late, sexual harassment , discrimination and early marriage.
A couple is getting divorced after a long love marriage, and we have no idea why. All we can see is how they are doing in their late thirties, comparing them to the dreamy image they had as teens when she was a pretty girl, and he was the tall dark and handsome athlete. As we watch, we can notice that their relationship was hit by silence as time passed. Each one of them has become an introvert, and the lack of money added more fuel to their problems. Even the support one offered to the other wasn't understood or made any echo in this silence between them. One of them sacrificed the life dreams to support the other, and one who couldn't see anything but the laziness and the anger of the other one didn't know it's just a hidden bitterness.
Somehow the husband became 18 again, and a chain of comic situations start to happen between him and the member of his family. He became a friend who is active in their lives, not a distant father.
Acting is so good especially from Lee Do Hyun. Other actors are also good, yet they really look much older than the age of 37.
Soundtrack is amazing, and the message and the ending are so perfect with a great perspective of the concepts of marriage, life, regret, dreams, and work. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

A MUST WATCH FAMILY MOVIE!!!
I didn't expect this drama to be so moving I mean knowing that I watch the English version movie with my fave actor Zach Efron!! 17 again movie which i loved to much and rewatching it again...This Korean version is what can i say!! They spiced it up!!! Adding more emotions and romance! Emotions was spot on!! Parent and children relationship is being a focus here and of course since theres a huge age gap, the cast was really amazing in their roles that it makes it so exciting to watch!!!A MUST WATCH!!!

Heartwarming, relaxing and overall a great drama.
I started watching 18 Again because I was out of dramas to watch, but it actually got me hooked and waiting for the next episodes.


The plot is good, I haven't watched a drama with a similar story before- so for me this is new and fresh. I love how they show love from a different angle- from a husband to your child's friend.
The acting is good, Lee Do Hyun's chemistry with Kim Ha Nuel is superb ~
I love the OST too, Hello sounds familiar though- like I heard it from another drama before (?).
But I'd say there's not much to rewatch in the drama, since it's not really a thriller or something.

Drama is heartwarming and teaches us great lessons about love, family and sacrifices. Certainly worth watching.

Perfect Feel Good RomCom
Story
This series was simply perfect. If you've seen the American version, then you'll pretty much get a gist of what it's about, but it has that k-drama heart and familial love that the American one lacked. You go from laughing to ugly crying in seconds with all the feel good moments this series has. They delve more into the characters and you get to understand the different perspectives of each of them. The cinematography was great also and the story gave us closure of all the characters in the end. It was practically gift wrapped. (brace yourself for the final moments in the final episode)

Acting/Cast
OMG...LEE..DO...HYUN. That man acted his ass off. He played a guy, who was actually an adult, trapped in a young body. (LOL) It wasn't cringy or awkward and his scenes just...….flowed. His voice is so soothing. My gosh. This man deserves all the awards for this show. The casting was great. All the actors played their roles well, even the ones you hated.

Music
Soundtrack was the bomb. I still can't get ""Hello"" out of my head and you can't help but tear up, when you remember the scenes.

Rewatch Value
Most definitely 100%

Overall
This show is a must see. JUST WATCH IT. Gather around the TV/computer with your family. Hug your Dad. Tell him you love him because this show really makes you appreciate the family that you have. A beautiful life lesson this show has about family and marriage. It was funny, heartwarming, sad, lovely....I'm running out of cute adjectives. Just watch it!!!!

Not upto my expectations
I had high Hopes for this drama due to the amount of hype and the high ratings I had seen on the internet. But I'm sorry to say, this drama was dissapointing in many ways.
I didn't particularly enjoy the drama or feel much with the characters. I was preparing myself with tissues because all family dramas are usually hard hitting, but this I couldn't connect with the characters at all.
First of all this drama is a remake of a movie which lasts not even 3 hours, the writer really had to drag the show into 16 episodes which is almost impossible to do and the writer really tried to include stories of so many people and so many sub plots that weren't necessary and made the show boring ultimately.
Right from episode 1, nothing captured me and made me addicted to the show. I was bored and always waited for something to happen, but nothing happened. I used to find excuses to not watch the show and had to fast forward the last few episodes so I could finally finish it.
The second leads role was such a waste honestly. I hated every scene the second lead came in just to make the male lead jealous. The storyline was suffocating honestly. I couldn't take his scenes though the character itself was a sweetheart. Every time I saw the repetitive jealousy scenes my frustration really went up. It was hard to watch.
*spoiler *
I couldn't fathom the fact that a high schooler was actually hugging and kissing a 37 year old lady, though he is still her husband. I found it so hard to watch.
I have to say that I really loved the Bonding between the family members especially the dad and the kids, was very warm to watch.
The osts are very beautiful though. Very unique voices and meaningful lyrics. Loved that.
I wouldn't really recommend and would probably not rewatch.

Meaningful, Organised, Entertaining.
Absolutely loved Lee Do Hyun's acting. The young cast is so good-looking and fun to watch. Great, consistent delivery of message - being grateful for decisions/people, the importance of relationships, finding happiness, regret... Although each episode ending doesn't have such a big cliffhanger (compared to other dramas), every episode was really important for the storyline so it was really painful waiting a week for every 2 episodes. I'd reckon it'd be a great drama to binge-watch. I honestly didn't expect every episode to be so good since it was just a remake of an hour-long Western movie. The staff team elaborated on the main couple's story more (and other characters) which made the story more meaningful and structured - not rushed nor draggy. Also, beautiful OSTs and cinematography (loved the little details at the back!)

P.S Had a strong second lead syndrome with Hwang In Yeob. He is so attractive, I would definitely want to see more roles from him! Also the weeb/s AHAH. Deok Jin is such a humorous character. Some of his scenes are super dramatic and unrealistic (same as turning 18 again). I honestly did consider whether they were necessary but then again, they were definitely really entertaining to watch! The same goes for his love story!!

“If you think of it as a regret, that’s the end of it. But when you think of it as a lesson learned, it brings a new beginning”

Method actor in action
Surprisingly, this drama delivers great depth in the character interactions. I mean, from the title and knowing it's based on the Hollywood movie, we already know the entire story. And despite the premise, this show doesn't overdo the silly circumstantial humor, which is something I'm not fond of. Instead, it portrays deep character interactions to make the story come to life.

Many have written about the outstanding acting of Lee Do Hyun playing a man in a teenager's body. I've read interviews that mention he is a method actor. This seems spot on considering his overwhelming intensity and charisma. He fills the screen with energy and truly becomes the father's character. He steals every scene he's in, and he makes this show what it is. He is one of the most talented actors I've seen and considering how young and new he is on the k-drama scene (he is only 25 yo in this role), it is impressive!

Some reviewers have complained about the way Dae Young is treated in the story. He shoulders pretty much all the blamed for the failure of his marriage and everything that has gone wrong with his family. I agree that the writing is lacking in this area. Dae Young and Da Jung never have the chance to deeply discuss the elements of their marriage. They also don't get a chance to heal Dae Young's feelings about giving up his dreams for his family. Where the beautiful depth of interaction lies is between Dae Young and his children. They are given many opportunities to interact with each other when Dae Young becomes their teenage friend. These moments are so lovely and well done that you almost wish they could stay friends this way forever. Roh Jeong Eui and Ryeoun play Dae Young's children so well. They are a joy to watch.

There are a few other flaws as well. The biggest are the distracting sub-plots that go nowhere: the stalker, the internet troll, the car crash, and the corrupt coach. These events are silly, brief, and pointless. I believe it's mostly a writing issue, but Kim Ha Neul as Da Jung comes off as too pouty. She isn't given much to do, other than switching back and forth between strong reporter/mother to pouty woman. And disappointingly, there is a scene where a character is at a cosplay event dressed as Aladdin with slightly darker face make-up. It's racist even if the intent wasn't there.

Despite the silly sub-plots, I was OK with the tiny love triangle where Da Jung is wooed by the baseball player Ji Hoon, and supports him as he navigates issues of raising a kid on his own. However, this could have been done with more meaning and deeper conversations between the two of them. And speaking of lacking meaning, I also thought that the treatment of Da Jung as a divorcee who was a teen mom was heavy handed. It's a big missed opportunity to truly deal with the issue beyond simply going with what public opinion of her was from day to day.

I must end by mentioning Lee Mi Do who plays Da Jung's lawyer friend, and Kim Kang Hyun who plays Dae Young's friend who pretends to be his father. Both have amazing comedic talents and despite the over-the-top situations they find themselves in, they never lose empathy for their characters or go overboard with the hysterics. Instead, they balance their characters out really well. And finally, if you've seen the show, you will have noticed the set and costume designers' love of pastel colors. It was fun to see them throughout the show in the school, the office elevator, and in Da Jung's wardrobe. I'm not sure what it was meant to symbolize, but it was a fun addition.

All in all, this was a treat to watch because of Lee Do Hyun's complete transformation. Even though we know how it ends, it was a fun ride getting there.

Solid heartwarming family drama
What would you do if you can be young again and have a chance to re-do things you regretted in your youth? These are the life questions tackled in this show, and highlights that despite the hardships, fights, and imperfections, usually we don't realize what's the most important are those just beside us all along.

Lee Do Hyun was a charming standout, though a bit green in Hotel Del Luna. But here he totally impressed playing a 30 something father in a high schooler's body. Good all around cast, from the main cast to the comedic actors, and some newbie actors that look all promising (second lead syndrome is strong in this one).

I'll have to commend the PD, writer, and staff, how they depicted the transitions from past to present and vice versa, or even when Lee Do Hyun is onscreen to when he transitions visually to Yoon Sang Hyun is amazing and seamless. Umbrellas are already done to death in kdramas, but 18 Again's umbrella episode is one of the best kdrama episodes I've seen in awhile. It might not have done anything new, but 18 Again took the classic flavors we love about kdramas and executed it very well, and made me appreciate my family and what I have right now.

Funny and a tad corny. Based on the American movie 17 again
For me, there are only 2 reasons to watch this drama: Lee Do Hyun and Lee Mi Do.

Lee Do Hyun for his really good performance as a 37 year old miserable father trapped inside his handsome 18yr old self. I totally believed he was this ajusshi which is why the age gap with Kim Ha Neul didn't bother me one bit. I thought they had great chemistry and he nailed the yearning which made me want them to get back together so bad. I also thought Do Hyun's interactions with his daughter were so funny as I totally could see Yoon Sang Hyun in Do hyun's acting which is why I think he did such a good job.

As for Lee Mi Do, she was just the side BFF, but she just stole every scene that she was in. She was so funny and I love her confidence. The elevator scene where she can't give CPR to Kim Gang Hyun because he grosses her out cracked me up! Or the bar scene where she tried to seduce him was even funnier. Her looks of disgust make me laugh out loud and just speaks to my sense of humor.

The script has a lot of problems though especially making most of the characters change their dispositions suddenly so that they are redeemed. It's really predictable too and tends to cross the line into sappy and corny at times, but it had just enough comedy and romance that made this more enjoyable than not, especially when these two actors were on.

This drama was inspired by the 2009 movie ""17 Again"" and even though there are many similarities between the movie and this drama in the main plot points this drama is DEFINITELY better. I had watched the movie prior to this drama and had found the story to be interesting but I wasn't pleased by the execution. This drama is definitely one of my favorites now! The story manages to be fun and light-hearted but also appeals to some deeper, more mature topics.

I have watched many dramas but I have never loved a cast so much! If you're into handsome guys and beautiful girls, this drama is meant for you. The actors all managed to portray their characters incredibly well, I was especially amazed at Lee Do-Hyun's acting. His portrayal of Hong Dae Young was great, both when he was a teenager, and when he was an adult trapped in a teen's body. I also LOVED Kim Ha Neul as Jung Da Jung. She managed to make her character incredibly kind and optimistic without seeming like a naive fool, on the contrary, she was incredibly wise, mature, and quick-witted. I just mention them specifically because I was extremely pleased with their performance, but ALL the other actors were incredible in their roles. I truly can't stress how this cast has become my favorite in terms of acting and fitting their characters.

I also really LOVED the plot. It was not rushed, it was funny yet serious (but really funny) and exciting. It makes you want to root for the happiness and success of all the characters. Furthermore, the growth of the characters is evident but gradual and natural, none of them are stupidly naive causing the viewer to be constantly frustrated with their dumb and irrational decisions. Another aspect that captivated me was that there weren't one or two specific villains, whose every actions have the intention of making the leads miserable. The issues they faced were REAL, normal people problems, not the cliche money throwing scenes or the constant (failed) attempts at public humiliation by the repetitive jealous villain.

If I were to point out any negatives I think I would have liked the romance to be a little more present and intense, because (SPOILERS) most of the couples getting together and/or reconciling occurred in the last two episodes or so. It would have felt maybe more realistic if the romances were clearer from earlier on in the story. Also, I would have liked to see the children's story a little bit more, especially the son's. In the epilogue, we find he has a little romance situation that stemmed in high school and I wished we could see that as well (to better understand his growth from what we saw in the drama to what appeared in the epilogue style scenes in the last episode).

It has been a very long time since I have watched a drama I liked so much. I didn't give it a perfect score only because I feel like there might have been one way or another in which the drama could have been improved. You know there's a lot more I would like to write in this review but I don't want to spoil toooo much. So enjoy y'al!

Watch it. Who wouldn't want a chance to ""do-over"" their life?
18 Again is based on the Zac Efron movie 17 again where a man gives up his dreams of becoming a basketball star when his high school girlfriend tells him she is pregnant with his twins. Like in the Western Movie, Hong Dae Young the main character gets a chance to become young again, (using a different plot device of some magic tea) and enrolls in his old school where his kids are studying. Unlike in the Western movie, this is a series so we get a LOT more backstory of how the parents met and what their relationship was like, also the emotional stakes are higher as revenge is less of a factor. Story wise, and acting wise, in all respects this series is way better than the movie which is its inspiration.

Hong Dae Young, the main character, does not seem like a bad man. In fact, how his customers treat him, a ""mere"" man who fixes their washing machines, is was downright depressing. Nobody offered him ""water"" except for one ""special"" old man who after berating him to fix a radio (which is not his job) offers to ""fix"" his life for him, leading to the body change. His kids lie to him all the time, he spends more time drinking than talking to his wife and that's why she wants a divorce. In the meantime his career is going nowhere since his company promotes based on nepotism, not performance. You could say when he is given the chance for a do-over, he decides to live the life he COULD have had if he had not gotten married young. Who can blame him for making that decision?

Jung Da Jung, the wife, wants to divorce him because there is no more love in their marriage. It seems time does that to people. Also she was depressed in her career as there is a lot of ageism, sexism and even discrimination against working mothers and divorced people especially in broadcast TV. Clearly she is the most skilled but it's still an issue, even in 2020. The kids also have their issues bullying, ambitions not in line with parental expectations or unstated goals. The best friend Go Deok Jin is HILARIOUS, and this series is worth it alone for the big, epic, hilarious fight scene in episode 1 featuring Mjolnir and Captain America's shield.

This is a brave series that deals with a lot of modern issues. It has its sweet moments, balanced with comedy, mega dramatic scenes and wistful profound realizations. This series is one of the best when it comes to using flashbacks as a story telling device, I've rarely seen any series employ them as beautifully. The soundtrack is wonderful and overall I enjoyed this series very much and you will too.

heartwarming drama
this drama was on my watch list since i came to know this was based on the movie 17 again and is from the makers of go back couple... this drama gave me the exact same feeling i got when i watched go back couple... the comic scenes were hilarious and the emotional scenes make me cry hard...

i guess without a doubt that the star of the entire drama was lee do hyun.. his chemistry with the rest of the cast was also on point... he played the high school dae young in the past and woo young (older DY in younger body) really well... the difference is quite evident...
i like how the makers give the point of view of each character which helps in understanding them deeper... this made me like hong family and the rest of the characters with all their flaws...

i wish the drama gave more screentime to some characters but i dont feel it had any unwanted storyline either... i guess the writers were so good that even if this was a 20 episode drama it wouldn't drag.. the writers and director managed to make 16 episodes out of a 2-hour movie excellently...

the drama successfully made me laugh and cry equally... dramas like this have high rewatch value and maybe i will rewatch this one again sometimes in the future...

Unrealistic but with tearjerking moments....
So, while waiting for the next episodes of Mr. Queen, I found myself watching this on Netflix.

First off, while the story is obviously unrealistic (the being young again part), I loved the family drama angle of the story.
I honestly skipped through the stories of the other characters and just focused on Dae Jeong and Dae Yeong.

Wasn't a fan of Lee Do Hyun in Hotel del Luna but I adored him in 18 again; specially the parts where he still acted on his fatherly instinct while being a classmate of his daughter.

For me, the drama showed the struggles of teenage marriages. And while theirs ended happily, in real life, more often than not, the couple ends up separating.

Not being a Korean, I also wonder if the workplace in Korea is as discriminating as depicted in the series. From my impression of Korea, the country is undoubtedly of an upper class status, but in Kdramas, I find their society conservative in some aspects of life.

Anyway, this drama is not without it's flaws. Like when Dae Yeong's dad recognized him, but did not question as to how he came to be young again. It also did not show nor explain how he got back his old appearance. There was also the matter of his voice. It was obviously different but over the phone, no one even commented on it.

If you are looking for something to fill up the time, this would be a so-so drama to watch for me.

Relearning things you already know
While watching this drama, I realized a lot of things that I already know. Sometimes you don't need to learn something new, you just need to be reminded of the lessons you have already learned. There are precious things in life. We can't deny that time is one of the best treasures we have yet the most taken for granted. We always think that there are next time or there are still time but truth to be told, we have to enjoy it while it lasted.

Here, you will be reminded of the things you did in the past or the memories you never have. Above all, too late is just fine. As long as you take action right after your realizations, you're good.

I am so happy that I watched Sweet Home first before 18 Again. Lee Do Hyun's performance in both series is phenomenal.

You'll horribly be missing out on the emotions
I'm not sure where to start because I love this drama so frickin' much. You'll be badly missing out on a gem if you won't watch it so please give it a try.

Overall:

I've seen the original movie ""17 again"" years ago and it left me curious as to how they would spread out a movie into 16 episodes of a drama. I knew the general story but went in expecting the expected, with no surprises. BUT NOPE it was completely unexpected as this drama encases intense emotions with right amounts of humor and suspense elements along the way. This story is more than just a story. Everything but the transformation is so real whether it be the family, friends, dreams/aspirations and love of all kinds. There's so much to learn about ourselves and surroundings through what they show us on screen. It shows is how to be grateful for the good and the bad in our lives because it makes us who we are. It shows us that we can't waste our life looking what we don't have have but see what we do have.

Main Ideas in my opinion:

We often assume the reasons behind someone's actions and this is the biggest idea the show focuses on. We need to try to understand the other person's perspective and problems will arise when things go unsaid and caring actions go unseen. Sometimes we might not know the whole story of someone. The drama shows that misunderstandings serve as clouded judgement, leading us to easily make decisions we regret later. The intertwined journey of the leads allows them to learn and see their partner in a different light and the sacrifices they've made.

""18 Again is a heavy family-oriented drama as it displays the dynamics not just between two leads and their kids but the leads and their parents as well. It shows the parent's perspective of being strict with their child simply because they don't wish for their kids to face any struggles. But this only bridges the gap between the kids and the lead characters. The drama shows us kids can express this frustration by being quiet or rebellious while encountering problems of their own in school. They show us the importance of approaching your child primarily as a friend and then secondly as a parent because it makes it easier for them to speak out.

The main character Jung Da Jung was a strong person who never gave up on her dreams. Her perseverance is greatly demonstrated throughout the show. She didn't let comments on her age or being a mom get in the way of continuous effort. With her genuine personality she breaks past all the barriers, earns her place in her dream job while winning the hearts of the people who once stood against her.

Acting/OST :

The main character of Hong Dae Young played by Yoon Sang Hyun and Lee Do Hyun have blended in seamlessly. Lee Do Hyun never lets us forget he's the older version of himself on the inside(Yoon Sang Hyun), a father with protective instincts, a caring husband who's still loves his wife dearly, a best friend and someone who came to see his mistakes and never stopped being their for his family. That was a mouthful but seriously he did an outstanding job even though this is his first drama as a main role ( go watch him in Hotel del Luna!). I personally thought Lee Do Hyun was the main character most of time but when emotional moments came, Yoon Sang Hyun would return to the screen to portray the true character on the inside. Apart from the incredible acting delivered by the two main male actors, I think this drama did a great job of visually showing the transformations to highlight that aspect. AND there was no supporting character who wasn't necessary to move the plot forward. There was a right balance between the past and the present scenes so you won't get confused.

The OST complements the scenes so well and it really brings out additional emotions (I was ballin' most of the show and I don't cry that easily). I think ""Hello"" sung by SoHyang was the most played OST and TRUST ME it's such as amazing song. I'm still learning the language but despite not understanding 80% of the song, I could feel the sorrow and the love (this goes for the whole OST). The power of music extends past the language and that's true fascinating.

Many people find the ending of most dramas to be incomplete but the ending in ""18 again"" leaves us feeling complete and healed. I was crying while watching show at night and in broad daylight ( at 11 in the morning LMAO). So that speaks for itself. No matter how much I write it's not enough to describe this piece of work. I liked ""17 again"" but I like ""18 again"" a lot more. It's made me delusional enough to write a message to Lee Do Hyun on Instagram about how much I loved the show as if he'll see it LOL

A must watch!
Story:
The writing is consistently good from beginning to end. There were no plot holes or overused tropes in this drama. The story flows naturally and it will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. It is a family drama. It depicts the reality of life; the struggles of marriage out of high school due to teenage pregnancy, the breakdown of a marriage, the distant relationship between parent and kid, and so on. It even has some funny aspects that will surely make you laugh. It is perfect all around.

Cast and Characters:
I'm not familiar with any of the actors in this drama except for Kim Ha-neul. One of the strengths of this drama is how good the acting is. The lead actors, and even the supporting cast, were all fantastic.

Music:
I loved all of the OSTs. It all fits perfectly based on the theme of this drama.

Overall:
This one is an exceptional drama. It is a must-watch.

A gem with ""maturity"" written all over it
I found a gem. I didn't think I would cry so much! It had exceptional writing, perfect representation of MATURE and immature youth, it pulled off not one but 2 damn amazingly done love triangles, it made you relate to ALL characters, it showed growth and development no matter the age, the value of family and friendship and POWERFUL WOMEN who did not always need a man to succeed or make right life decisions, the struggles of life and workplace for more than one character.
But it was also really funny!
And warm!
And the cast! THE CAST was amazing ! The acting! Oh God ? this better get all the awards this year !

Super fun, emotional and thrilling
They made it! They brake some molds and we can expect some different stuffs here! You know, not the typical conservative boring romantic familiar korean drama. The script was perfectly developed, and I must say, the male lead (young version) really WORKED HARD and you can tell: his job is amazing. My respects to all the crew!
You will be touched as well as laugh out laud. Totally recommend it.

Heartwarming and beautiful drama for this complicated time nowadays..
Love the drama. It has simple messages such as be good to family, there is room for one's improvement etc..The acting is so great matched with the understandable storyline made it easier to digest. Although second lead syndrome plays a big role in this drama pace, the main lead actor and actress really made journey through their character resulting in good character development. The OST? Simply menacing and good placement of SFX and music in the drama. This drama have a lot in common with 17 again movie from USA since it based on that movie. Love both those movie and drama ❤❤❤❤❤..

I have not enjoyed a Korean family drama this much since ages.
I was hesitant to start this drama because the idea of a guy who jumps back from 37 to 18 years old after making a wish looked too much of a childish concept for me. But I decided to against that and I am happy I did.

STORY:
It tells the story of a couple which is in crisis after slipping in a routine or misunderstandings and absence of communication.

The husband gets the chance to go back in his 18 years old body thanks to a magical trick. From this point, he will be placed in a new context and gain a new perspective of the events past and present. This will open his eyes about the people around him, their past with him and what he can do to make things better for them. His ex wife is unaware of this but the unexpected and impossible situation will also lead her in the same process of rediscovering.

The drama does not have a complicated message. Just that despite all our dreams and our best efforts, the difficulties of life can make us loose sight of what we wanted to realize for us and for our loved ones. Then we forget the good moments we had and we close ourselves to them and the lack of communication will pile misunderstandings and anger. In the end, what matters is the Love we gave and received and this is what really creates success in our life.

The drama also tackles with different issues of the modern society: women at work, discrimination and sexism at work, intergenerational conflicts, bullying at school, adoption, being abnormal in a normed society... not in a complex and boring way by little touch just to emphasize the human side of it.

CHARACTER / CAST:
- Hong Day Young / Yoon Sang Hyun - Lee Do Hyun: YSH is not the top model actor but he is a reliable actor with strong acting skills and he portrayed a very human HDY very frustrating, lazy and annoying but in reality very hardworking and dedicated who lost track of what really counts in his life. LDH was convincing as young HDY, a reliable friend and helping hand for his children and the way HDY rediscovered his feelings for his ex wife was cute and funny.

- Jung Da Jung / Kim Ha Neul: I love this actress and her voice. She is great in this drama as a woman who still loves her husband but can't do with his temper and attitude anymore. After divorcing, she gets the job of her dreams, she is courted by a handsome man and she meets a 18yo double of her ex husband. A serie of changes which will help her put her life back on the right track.

The other supporting characters and cast were all great, interesting characters with depth and complexity and their own story full of emotions.

- Shi Ah: Lovely girl and daughter with great defensive martial skills and a dream for herself. She built a wrong opinion of herself and of her parents but she works hard for her dream.
- Shi Woo: a good son abandonned to himself and to his issues until he meets a friend who will help him rediscover his dream and confidence.
- Ye Ji Hoon: Confident baseball star who wants to woo Da Jung. I have to say I never really liked him as I found him kind of creepy and sneaky in his ways to catch her from behind by surprise or lure her in encountering him. He has his good sides though. I enjoyed the real connexion he has with the leads.
- Ok Hae In : the weak part of the drama as her story is more to give depth to another character.
- Go Deok Jin and Choo Ae Rin : Super funny besties of our main couple
- Good Ja Sung : a journey from bullying to protecting
- Seo Ji Ho : Shia's best friend. A nice and good boy who wants to upgrade his status.

MUSIC :
Nothing special for me but nothing terrible either. Just appropriate for the tone of the drama.

REWATCH:
Yes for it has good messages, simple lessons about life and it is filled with good and emotional moments. Also, 16 eps but the pace is good. Not time to be bored.

OVERALL:
A great family drama well writen with every episode filled with a high dose of emotions which leaves us smiling, laughing or crying. I have almost no critic to make against it and I enjoyed it from start to finish. This family drama is a gem of its kind with a very satisfactory ending which gives a nice closure to everyone. A deserved 10/10.

It's really fulfilling watching this drama.
It was not just an ordinary love story plot. It shows what will happen after the ""happy ending"" mark of fairy tales. The reality of what life might have and the struggle becoming to become unprepared parents. This series gives me different perspective and viewsof how we should live our life without regrets. I'm proud to write a review about this because it is all worth it! Actually the theme song of this series keeps ringing in my head until now. When you watch this, you will understand a parents' worries and regrets that's why they keep their children to listen to them so that it will not happen to them.

PERFECTION
This drama was so PERFECT! I have never watched a better drama before! So adorable, heartwarming and so real! It was really worth watching ♡
The movie was good but this remake was so much better! I never though they could make 16 episodes from such a story but they made it. The new characters, the flashbacks were amazing and an absolutely wonderful addition that made me move, laugh and warm my heart.
I'm gonna miss everything ㅠ-ㅠ
I'm so sorry jtbc didn't distribute it with netflix because they chose to distribute globally other dramas not as good as this one. It deserves to be known by the world! And Dohyun must win thousands of awards! Everyone has to win awards! A masterpiece ♡

I started watching this drama on a whim; without any expectations at all, besides 'Lee Do Hyun'. After binge-watching the first 10 episodes, I was pleasantly surprised. Think of the American movie '17 Again' but so much better. Unlike the original American counterpart, 18 Again didn't feel too forced when the story progressed.

This drama is the type that will really stir-up your emotions without the need for extreme situations and thrilling suspense. This may sound silly, but if you made the fantasy portion of this drama a normal occurrence, this drama could definitely be one of the most realistic dramas out there. And the realisticness of this drama is definitely its charm; everything is relatable and you can totally feel the emotions and warmth the script and dialogue are trying to portray.

Well, there are some things I didn't particularly like, but these things are purely subjective. First things first, I don't really react well with really cringy and awkward scenes, and 18 Again at the start was not short of them. And probably the only other thing I can pick on, the drama lacked depth. I know that it's like I'm contradicting what I've been saying in this review, but it just feels like something is missing despite the praise I've given this drama; it's just hard to explain. I personally think it could've been better if they added more of a melodrama vibe in order to make the drama a bit heavier.

OST- this deserves its own short paragraph. No kidding, the songs in this drama are bombs!

Overall, this drama is pretty good. Definitely a drama you could watch when you've run out of highly publicized-mainstream dramas.

""We got to love our decisions, and never regret on things that made us happy. "" -Dae-Young
Eighteen Again, is a tearjerker, I came to say this upfront of a lengthier review down below! As long as you don't hate getting wet eyes, you will enjoy this drama a lot, feel sad and sad, and sad again, and cry like a baby, within every episode, every time the lead interacts with his kids, comforts his sweetheart and is reminded of his past, the flashbacks, the epilogues!

STORY:

THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY DRAMA! It's deep, relatable and heart wrenching!

From the lead's relationship with his Father, with his wife's Mother. to his friendship/ father-kids relationships, to the heart-breaking relationship of him as a high school minor who is always there to comfort the mom of his two kids.
Each and every bond is carefully written and the result is something very precious. full of life lessons.

Characters/CAST: Great job done! Kudos to LEE DO HYUN, I couldn't hold my emotions in check whenever I looked into her eyes, which were frequently red and in tears, yet sparkling as bright as a star other times!

Kim Ha Neul was simply gorgeous, Yoon Sang Hyun very charming, Roh Jeong Eui cute and sweet, Ryeoun, calm and a bright star.

I also want to praise the young actress portraying teenager Jung Da Jung. Her expressions were so sincere and genuine. Every time she was on screen, my heart felt her pains, and ached for her. She did a stunning performance! She deserves lots of support and love!

Soundtrack/Music:

Hello, I’m telling you
With a trembling smile, that I love you
Hello, that in these dazzling and beautiful times
It’s you I will remember forever""

I would rate the music 10/10 even if ""Hello"" by Sohyang, was the only song/instrumental piece used in the whole drama. It was such a heavenly beautiful and perfectly emotional piece. It's a legendary soundtrack.

RE-WATCH: Surely, if I get times, I'll re-watch this, probably with my cousin who recently got into KDRAMA, and already have great taste.

OVERALL: Surely there might be some unnecessary plot devices, cliche and even extended 2nd lead screen times, but it's just I don't care at all, I was so invested in these characters, and loved them sincerely and was rooting for them all along, I couldn't bring myself to rate it below a perfect 10! It's highly recommended, EVERYONE and ANYONE can get hooked as they're done with the first episode, and fall in love with it as soon as watching 3rd episode's epilogue.

I can guarantee that. 99.0000000000000000%

A must-see for Lee Do Hyun
So... I started watching this drama because I was curious about this Korean remake of the movie 17 Again. I remember liking the film (I even have it on DVD) so I really wanted to see the Korean version. And... I have mixed feelings about it.

First of all, the story. Well, it's basically the same from the movie (at least, for the main plot). Because, of course, you can't make a remake of a 1h45 film into a 16h drama without developing the initial story. But, if the story was pretty good at the beginning, it became more and more filled with drama... Too much drama... I ended up really annoyed by all the useless drama that they have created. Moreover, there are too much clichés!!! They have used all the typical romantic clichés that we usually see in K-drama and that became more annoyingly funny than romantic at the end... They could've been more creative about that. Also, I think they made some really bad decisions with the main plot (but that's just my opinion). For example, the scene where he goes back to his old self was more impactful in the film than in the drama.

The casting was the only thing that was perfect in this drama. I mean, Lee Do Hyun killed it in the role of a young dad. He made me laugh, he made me cry. I really fell in love with him in this drama. I'll always remember the scene where he was holding the umbrella for his two children, that was so cute. Or the scene where he signs to his dad after the basketball match. The rest of the cast was also good, of course, but Lee Do Hyun stole the show for me.

The music is really good, although overused.

As a whole, I would say it is a good show to watch once. Prefer rewatching the film instead, it will take less of your time.

Noticed issues further I watched
First incling there was something wrong was when I started looking at recaps to see what would heppen. Thats when I knew it has lost my interest.
As others have mentioned, this drama goes on for too long. There are too many side plots happening when the concentration should be on Dae-young and Da-jungs relationship and their relationship with their children.
As for my main issues, reason for marking so low, has to do with Dae-young and all the trials the writers put him through. I have a feeling because the show kept going, they had to keep including stuff. All this built up to a very damaged person that is not really investigated in the show. Also, the circumstances he is put in, there was an opportunity to investigate/critque the society he is in. I think this was unintentional, I'll try to explain myself better.
There will be heavy spoilers.
Lets start chronologically, with the first big even being the death of his mother. He is unaware she is sick/going in for surgery and dies while he is away, playing basketball. I'm sure there is a big heaping of guilt here and obvious anger towards his father for not saying anything. Also, he appeared to have a healthy relationship with here, he has learned sign language as well. In one moment, she is gone, with no opportunity to say goodbye. This effectively orphans him as his father becomes distant/abusive. An important support structure in his life, his parents, is gone.
Then there is what precipitates this, his girlfriend becoming pregnant and him having to give up basketball.
Basketball was the one thing he was good at and was his escape for him from his life and one fell swoop, it is gone and he now has heaped on responsibilities, being a father and a husband and only just finishing high school. There was the scene where he meets his father again with his son, where his father mentions basketball is all he was good at, otherwise he was a failure. Sure it's not the first time he hears that. And from what people said, he was pretty much guaranteed to make it the big leagues. He had no other plans.
The big themes of this show seem to be go for your dreams at all cost, regret/guilt and communication. All of these are allowed for everyone else, except for Dae-Young.
His dream is shattered, his father has disowned him so he can't ask for help. I know his father helps on the sly but thats not the same as being there for him.
Lets contrast Dae-Young with Ye Ji Hoon and his brothers. Again, I don't know if this is deliberate by the writers but they are pretty much the mirror of Dae-Young. His brother is able to attend college and look after his sibling. And then when he dies, Ye Ji Hoon is able to have both his sporting career and raised his niece. All the while being told by Da-jung not to give up his dream, he can be both a parent and a successful athlete. Opportunities Dae-Young was denied.
Da-jung was able to become a successful reporter, supported by Dae-Young. He had the chance to restart his career but his childs illness stopped that. He had to sacrifice everything for his child, which as a parent is to be applauded but all he gets from people around him is didain/ridicule for where he ended up.
He is supporting his children with their dreams, helping his son get confidence to play basketball and accepting his daughters decision to go to beauty school.
This marriage appeared doomed from the start. If after 10 years, the husband can't confide in his wife that he has to again give up his dreams, there are bigger troubles. Also, Da-jung sensed there was something wrong, when he started drinking but either dissmissed it or forgot abount, understandably because of their sick child but something that isn't explored.
No one seems to acknowledge the sacrifices he has made/makes for his family. There are some scenes where Da-jung becomes awares of them but seems to be too late, and she comes to regret her divorce but also, she misses all the ridicule/scorn heaped upon him. The reunions in paricular are eye opening. When you have the opportunity/time as his class mates were able, you can make something of yourself but both these seem missing from his life.
This may be due to English translation, but there were two contrasting/interesting scenes. As he is leaving, his father calls him pathetic. Da-jung then also calls him pathetic, presumably just before the divorce. I wonder how hurtful that would have felt.
As mentioned above, a big support for Dae-young would have been his parents but they are gone. Da-jung appears to have a good relationship with her mother and has a friend to confide in. Aside from his immature friend who is an issue in himself, with not taking no for an answer from the teacher, Dae-young appears to have no one. He can't confide in his wife, appears to have a pretty hostile work environment and self-medicates by becoming an alcoholic. Would not be surprised if he was suffering depression by the end
After all that, I can understand how he ended up the way he did. However, I can not condone it. He is still responsible for his own actions but sometimes when your travelling a dark road, can't see where to stop.
But, this goes into some wider issues the writers touch upon. While a Korean show, it's issues that affect a lot of the world.
Does he not reach out because he is the head of the household, a man? Are there no places he can turn to for help? Looking back, I was not surprised at his outburst at the reunion. It was a deep pain that had been festering. As before, this does not make it right but can understand it.
The amount of work he had to put in on his job. It looked to be very manual labour intensive, leaving him exhausted at the end of the day. It may have long hours, meaning he can't see his children. They all agree he is not there for them but was it by choice? That does not excuse him not helping around when he can but can understand it. This is contrasted when he is young again. He now has time to listen, to be available because he has none of the above responsibilities. Perhaps if he had some more support, an opportunity to continue playing, he would not have ended up where did.
So, to summarise all this, this drama had it's funny moments. But, I think the writers unintentionally wrote Dae-young into a corner, making him the sole reason for the divorce. They touch upon Da-jung not communicating well but that seems to be her only flaw. Divorce/realtionships are tricky and there is never one reason why but they tried to make him the villain. If the writers had have just concentrated on the family and their circumstances, I think there was a good opportunity to explore their marriage breakdown further, see what they both did/didn't do and explore more of the issues that led to where Dae-young ended up.

A very romantic love story
Just finished watching the last episode and the last episode make me so sad that I’m single now... how happy it is to have someone that you love.
Actually I started watching this drama beacuse my recommended it, I know this drama and I thought that it is a drama version of 17 again I don’t wanna watch it cause I know how it goes, but it’s different, it has more Asian type of drama and I love it cause I’m asian, for me it’s more realistic.
For me there’s a lot to learn from this drama as a child or maybe later when I’m a parent 😍😍

MUST WATCH!!!
'18 Again' is one of the best drama released in year 2020 and I think no one can denied it. The first two episode seem a bit slow but it grow well on me. The storyline might be simple and light but it's full of beautiful message that can reflect in our reality life. Not to mention every episode can make my cry like baby. I don't have any problems with the plot actually.. Everything was perfect and beautiful except for the ending.It's a happy and beautiful ending but still I find like something is missing in the last episode Yeah what ever. What I'm amazed about this drama is the transition between Hong Daeyong and Go Woo Young. It's really smooth

about the cast, it's superb especially Kim Dohyun. I love how he can acting like father and school student at the same time. the chemistry between Kim Dohyun and Kim Ha Neul are insane even their age gap is actually 17 years I think. The support cast is doing well too.

As the conclusion, I like this drama 😊

It's definitely a 3-pointer shot from the half court.
** Finally reaching completion and I can confirm that many of the things my review was written has largely been true. Way back when I started writing this review at the start of the series airing, my expectation for it was relatively regarding me feeling enjoyment from the family aspect of the drama but quickly it turned into something more emotional and deep. I self-reflected and find that I am emotionally invested in the drama. My point about how if they explained the age-reversal part well, it could be a selling point for the drama and yet I now don't exactly agree with this sentiment because 18 again is more than that. It was able to live up to this trope of going back in time as a young fella whilst transcending above with the concept that family is central and key to our daily lifestyle. By being young, we lose the times we spent with our family because they are all so much more older than you and you become a ""different individual"". Yet, you also resembled greatly like the older version of you and you can't help but wish you can can become older again for your family. Overall, I highly recommend anyone to give this a watch expecting to learn about having a family, the morality behind it and the relationship which doesn't always seem ideal. The ending didn't disappoint me so the quality for the whole drama is maintained solidly. I give this a drama a 8.5 star which is a super high rating that I only gives to some particular drama. There is only 2 other drama higher than this in my list so you can expect good stuff from watching this. Enjoy and stay true to your family!


With the limited episodes out there as of this review, I find myself interested to await for more of the episodes to air as the story progress into a variety of genre I didn't expect from it. I have never watched the actual movie it was based on so I am totally brand new in not knowing the plot beforehand. Although, I am familiar with the concept of ""going back into the past"" whether it be through time travelling, reincarnation or age-reversal. It's a nice concept that can add unique flairs to a drama IF EXPLAINED WELL. I am not certain yet as to why it happened like that for this drama but they did gives us some clue so I am expecting more of that later on.

This drama is presenting numerous option it could take including the usual family drama. I smell hint of a mystery brewing, supernatural/fantasy element and sprinkled heavily on those are comedy/parody which would entertain you into laughter albeit it can be over exaggerated until you feel embarrassed. With a hotpot of genre, it can potentially be hard to digest the content provided by the drama which was why I am surprised for wanting more of the drama instead.

And the answer to that surprised was.... the raw emotions presented from a parent for their child and love. That to me regardless of the genre is a relatable topic and to see a parent interact with their children as a friend is something I wish more families would have. It gives me satisfaction when the parent could realized the thing s they missed out, whether it be through the neglect of their kids or that they were having miscommunication with their significant other when both want the best in the relationship. To also observe the witty words of a 30+ year old man among kids with a face as handsome as Do Hyun, that's the best combination to have and we all dream of that in our fantasy drama. What better way than to have the same 30+ year old man (ugly) turned '18' (handsome) met up with his ""wife"" who looks so pretty both young and old. Now that can turn spicy XD. Anyway, acting has been great for the cast and to have a side character that serves as a comedy relief is not bad either. It gives me that Backstreet rookie vibe for that person's role in the drama and we all know how crazy he gets.

For now, I believe the drama will turn out enjoyable at the very least so I recommend you give it a watch for anyone that liked a hidden gem which may not have a star-studded cast, but it compensates by including more funnest without degrading the emotional quality of a scene.

Post episode 4: I enjoy the epilogue and the comedy relief in between the drama. Especially at how inspirational a statement during the epilogue scenes. The characters so far have been well-designed with their own personality and the other ""male competitors"" have very good reasons as to why they should exist.

Update to Episode 8: I am definitely reviewing as I have watched more episodes since. This has clearly been an emotional ride so far with those epilogues and the cast serves a very distinct role. I come to find myself relating with the backstory of each characters and have upped the score from 8.5 to 9 star with how the drama is produced.

p.s: I have confirmed that one of the OST (Hello) was sung by SoHyang, the queen and one of the best female vocalist. A good OST can bring a drama scene a long way so to have an impressive singer which is known for being expressive in their voices, it just help me immersed myself deeper. The currently released OST is by Soyou and that is already quite soothing for me, building an atmosphere that create longing for the happier times but due to circumstances, you feel sad.

A better version than the 18 Again film
I started watching this drama after seeing few scenes from instagram. The main thing that I loved about this show is that it shows how messy a divorce can be and the trouble it causes for the people that are left behind.

This drama is a whole package. Every episode has a lot of funny scenes, emotional and times where you want to appereciate the whole team for making this drama. The biggest strength in this drama is the cast. Every character went beyond their scope to prove it.

I hate love triangles, there are two of these in this drama but both ended on a good note which made me happy.

If you are looking for a drama filled with humor and heartbreak, this one is for you.

If you've read the synopsis of this drama, it will be pretty evident what it's about. Yes it's based on the film 17 Again where a middle-aged man goes back to his younger teen self.

STORY:
As mentioned, the story line is based off of the film 17 Again starring Zac Efron. If you've watched the original film, you might like this. It does follow the main storyline as the film with the dad (Hong Dae-Young) being an aspiring talented basketball that ends up giving up on his dream as his high school girlfriend gets pregnant. They have kids, he ends up living a mediocre life with his girlfriends, now wife, then ends up getting divorced. He later on ends up going back to his teen self by some sort of magic. This basic plot of the drama stays true to the film plot as well. The only thing is they of course had to make an almost 2 hour film into a 16x1 hour long episode. So of course, they had to add A LOT to make up those hours. And how they filled those hours were both good and bad.

THE GOOD: I like the little snippets of Dae-Young and Da Jung's past that gives the viewers a little bit more of an insight as to why they're divorcing. It helped show the viewers why some marriages fail and of course also showed the good bits towards the end. And all the silent acts of Dae-Young that his wife didn't know about.

The build up of the love story of the daughter Shi Ah was also added which was decent compared to the film. How she changed from how she felt towards her dad at the beginning towards the end was also very moving since it was like Da Jung's where she didn't know that her dad did stuff for her without her knowledge. This helped build up her character as well as their relationship to a happy ending.

Dae-Young's relationship with his father was also expanded and seriously this part of the drama touched me the most. From how they had a broken relationship to the hidden acts that Da Jung did for her father-in-law, to finding out about Dae Young's mum and his close similarity to his father as he grew up. And eventually to how their relationship gets rekindled in the end.

THE BAD: They added a love triangle with Ji Hoon as the 2nd male character and honestly I didn't enjoy or care for it much. It was added to build some tension but I skipped most scenes of him and Da Jung as we know he was never gonna get picked anyway. The story of him, his brother and his niece was a nice added storyline though and that I enjoyed as it did add to his character and changed him from being a playboy to actually being a fairly decent guy. Deok Jin's love story with Ms. Ok had to be dragged until the very end of course so it just seemed unnecessarily long. For some reason they also added a stalker which was literally just for unnecessary tension for nothing, It didn't really add or takeaway anything to the drama. It was literally a filler.

CHARACTERS & ACTING:
Lee Do Hyun did an incredible job playing someone with a middle aged man's brain. Both his funny scenes and emotional scenes were great. And since I've only seen him in Hotel de Luna, seeing his funny side in this drama was refreshing. On the same level, prepare the tissues for when he brings his A game to an emotional scene.

Yong Sang Hyun was also great. Since he sort of became a 2nd act and only appeared in the important scenes, he really had to bring it and that he did. He definitely added emotional weight to those scenes where he was lingering around Da Jung and in the flashbacks.

Kim Ha Neul was fab too. She didn't have a lot of mum scenes but when she did, she did them brilliantly. Her chemistry with Do Hyun was great as well and not weird at all. Of course, the viewers know that it's Dae-Young in Do Hyun's body but even then it could feel weird if the chemistry wasn't right. But it worked with them since the two worked well alongside each other.

The supporting cast were also great especially Shi-Ah and Shi-Woo as the kids. I appreciated Deok Jin's geeky side too since I'm a Marvel fan :D Special shoutout to Han So Eun (young Da Jung) as she really did great to add emotional weight to Da Jung's character and her young romance with Dae-Young. The chemistry between her and Do Hyun has really made me want a drama with them two as the main leads :D

OST:
The OST for this drama was amazing, although Hello got a bit overplayed. Still I saved it on my playlist cause it's one of those as soon as you hear it, you know straight away which drama it's from and the scenes even play out in your head. There are a couple others such as The Only One and One Person that also stood out to me. Overall great originals that definitely made certain scenes even more emotional.

WOULD I RECOMMEND:
Yes. It's a light, heart-warming drama that will touch you. It's not just about a love story of a wife and husband but also a lot about family and the relationships between father & son, mom & daughter and father & daughter. This drama will teach you a lot about the importance of communicating with your loved ones. And the importance of cherishing the moment before it's too late.

Cute and better developed than the original story
Came here expecting it to be like the movie (which I didn't like that much since the characters were way unmatured and had several plot holes), glad to say that this one is so much better.

I enjoyed every part of the story, even the side ones are enjoyable and a good addition to the main plot. Can't say I found myself bored at any point while watching this, from beginning to end I was invested to know the characters and how their lives developed chapter by chapter.

Story: Well presented, main and side stories are tied together so smoothly to the point you don't know which one it's the core. The characters have an amazing story and growth while the narrative continues around them.
Acting: Phenomenal, although the age difference between ML and FL can become weird at some point in the story, it's understandable and well presented.
Music: Goes hand in hand with the story, amazing choice.
Rewatch Value: It's worth watching it a few more times.
Overall: A perfectly balanced drama with a fair amount of fantasy, romance, life, and friendship. Recommended for those who liked the movie, and for those who did not.

JUST GO FOR IT! MUST WATCH. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
The storyline the characters everything was awesome. And obviously Lee do hyun's acting skills are on another level. I am In love with this drama. Trust me you are gonna love the characters especially the main lead! If I would have to say about this drama in one line it would be ""The best of the best""
18 again deserves more hype. Its really a great refreshing drama. Must must must watch. I am a type of person who is very particular about dramas but this drama has my heart. If LEE DO HYUN gets more dramas with a great storyline then trust he is going to be the next LEE MIN HO! Overall, 18 Again is a nice ride of emotions with great acting, decent storyline, not-for-everyone jokes, and valuable life lessons. However, as just how life goes, those valuable life lessons might not come in the best form.

Such a good drama.
This drama is not something I would rave about, but it was really good. Please check out my bio for how I rate dramas (yes, you will meet a very detailed bio). My friend recommended it to me, and I do not doubt their taste at all now.

Firstly, the story was unique. I don't think it's been done before and even if it has, the quality would not have matched this one. Although the introduction of the characters was a bit faster than I would like, they definitely made up for it as it went on. It's not as heavy and sad of a drama compared to the ones I usually watch. Even though the storyline is completely different from Weightlifting Fair Kim Bok Joo, I would say it radiates the same chaotic but fluffy energy. P.S. I did cry for some reason though. This drama is really hard to review without spoiling anything so after you read this, go watch it immediately if you haven't already so you can understand what I am getting at.

Moving on to the characters and cast~ I don't even think I have to dissect the acting because there was no hole. What I mean is that the level of acting was all the same level--there was not one actor or actress significantly weaker or stronger than the others; I think this cast complements each other well. This drama introduced Lee Dohyun to me even if I've heard of him before. Right away, he sprung up my actor list, if you see my bio. The only problem I have with the characters is that I got some second lead syndrome regarding Jihoon, the baseball player, and Jasung, the bully. Eventually, I saw that the writer did a good job with Sia's pairing because there was little to no character development with Jasung; it was more of a character switch and that's why I was very satisfied with Jiho. Regarding Jihoon though, I just think he matches the female lead more in terms of personality, success, etc. Also I find myself cringing whenever the young male lead has intimate scenes with the female lead.

Overall, I would RECCOMEND.

A weepy with some great characters, but also a few flaws
I enjoyed this drama very much. For me it was flawed but heartwarming ... up to a point.
This is obviously based o a 2 hour American film, and they make it cover 16 episodes - not always successfully.
The premis is OK. our jaded middle aged dad has a chance to re-evaluate his life, and learns he has been doing nearly everything wrong, but learns this without bitterness, and in fact with gratitude.
Most of the plot and sub-plots are engaging and heart-warming, with problems being resolved and wrings righted, sometimes in unexpected ways. Very engaging.
Characters grow and develop sometimes quite subtly, and this is usually handled extremely well. The acting is nearly always outstanding.
I loved many of the characters, often abrasive at the start, but latterly more confident in themselves and their position and aims. The interactions between the generations were a delight, the exposition of friendships were beautiful and full of laughter as well as many very moving moments. Moments when the real nature of a character's care was revealed were deeply emotional and pretty overpowering.
There were two main weaknesses for me.
The role of Jung Da Jung began very strongly: here was an incredibly strong woman who has come through fierce difficulties, and is now brave enough to shoot for her dream career, and can take all the blows offered her and turn them into success. She knows she is facing ridiculous prejudice, but she sweeps all of it away. But somehow part way through the drama she becomes wishy washy, and, just as she is supposedly blossoming as a woman in the gaze of a new man, she becomes the c;iched Korean ""mum"" who is sexless and strangely clueless. Kim Ha Neul is a beautiful woman, but she fades and fades exponentially, for some reason. Perhaps the complete lack of chemistry between her and Lee Do Hyun in the role of the teenage boy was the source of this - maybe a conservative public was thought unable to accept a middle-aged woman really being turned on by a teenager, so it may have been played down until it was completely absent. It ruined the relationship for me, and made her (and the relationship) quite unbelievable.
And perhaps partly as a result of that, the later episodes were undeniably tedious - with too much dithering and soupy plot-filling with ""thoughtful"" gazes and repeated flashbacks to the same events, and the two final episodes were really an exercise in extended I-dotting and T-crossing. Sadly the conventional message of ""stay together through everything, no matter what"" is ladled on heavily, without any real reflection on why the couple are able to come together again ... namely, they have both changed, re-evaluated themselves and their family, and reset their priorities, and they are no longer the same tired and jaded people they were. The end of the marriage was necessary to allow them to grow and come together again

Tearjerker
I've watched so many kdramas already but this is the first time I want to write a review because I really want to express my admiration to this. I haven't watch 17again (the american film) and I was lucky because the plot is really new to me and totally relatable. The whole drama talks about life.. it tells one how to live and the true path to happiness in life. . Which many fails to know how. With the hundreds of drama I've watched only a few brings me to tears. . and this drama is one of the best I've finished. Not so many visuals but purely lessons in life...

It will make you cry a lake of tears.
Despite the fact that it isn't original, you can see that this has greater depth and focuses on family difficulties. You'll need loads of tissues since this series will make you shed a lake of tears. The flashbacks will make you cry; it's heartbreaking but yet lovely. I'm not going to go into too much detail since I want the viewers to experience all of the feelings firsthand while watching.

Lee Do Hyun, in particular in this series, shows remarkable acting abilities. He was able to grab the hearts of many in Hotel Del Luna even though he was only given a limited amount of screen time, but now he's on a whole new level. All of the supporting characters/actors performed an outstanding job; this drama is amazing not only because of the main characters but because of each and every one of them. Congratulations to the casting director for casting them in parts that were ideally suited to them.

This Korean drama is suitable for the entire family. This Kdrama will teach you a lot of valuable lessons. Even this generation's kids will benefit greatly from this, particularly in terms of how to open up to their parents and why it is so vital. Parents will also learn a lot about this, such as how to communicate with their adolescent children.

Absolute must watch
I watched this because when I first read the synopsis, it reminded me of ReLife which a webtoon about a guy going back in time to fix his life starting from his days as a high school student. But this k-drama has a small twist. The guy becomes 18 again in the present time giving birth to myriad of problems and scenarios yet a second chance to redeem himself.

If you a love a feel-good, heartwarming and a wholesome story with an amazing and funny ensemble cast, then you shouldn't think of anything and start binging this.

18 again review
I honestly didn't expect to be hooked by this kdrama. I kinda felt bored in the first episode BUT.
The more I watch the more I want to know what will happen next. Tbh, I love this a lot. The acting is on point and it has a really nice story. It also shows kind of a real life stories about broken families and maybe some of you can relate to it. It shows a really nice plot and you will really enjoy it. It will make you cry somehow. This kdrama just shows the character's different POVs and opinions and how they resolve their problem. You will also get a very good lesson from this. I recommend you to watch it . ..

if it changes you in a positive way, no regrets
Loosely adapted from the movie '17 again', the drama has turned the trope into an amazing life-lesson without necessarily guilt-tripping and dictating. Some acts seem candid to the nature of the story. However, it still upsets me that the main character seems to act so recklessly during the transformation. I realized at the end that it is a part of the main character's character development. I am not comfortable either about the fact that an '18-year-old' body still chases and act like 'thirty-seven' so much, especially around the wife, Da-Jeong. This drama fills the void of regrets I have in life, comforting too.

Never Gets Old
I'm currently rewatching this show so that I can go through the journey again. This show is amazing I love seeing scenes from the show and it's not one of those situation where you get board of it or feel lik it's one of those show where if you were given the chance to watch for the first time you would because each time gets better. Also, the jokes aren't annoying and this is one of those shows that have an honest summary (basically I meant the show summary is what your getting there's no hidden stuff and the genre category is correct).

I'm happy that this was being advertised by iqiyi. This show is pure gold.

Cried in each episode bc so touching. I don't like bad guy and love triangles
I'm on the fence about this show. It has heartwarming moments that I LOOOVVEE and can watch again and again but at the same time, the moments in between those amazing moments are meh. Like Il kwon(the bad guy), love triangles, high school fair and parties.

I have to say the first half was better than the last half.

I cried in every episode because of the heartwarming family moments. He is an amazing dad and husband and a guy with good morals. He risks anything and everything for his children and wife.

She's a 10/10!!!
I’ve had my eye on 18 Again for a while now ever since I was looking for kdramas to watch on reddit, and I only began watching it on a whim as I was going through my MyDramaList “Plan to Watch” list and picking titles at random. Needless to say, watching this drama was perhaps one of the best decisions of my life. I absolutely loved all the characters and felt like every single one of them went through a massive change throughout the story. I loved seeing my favorite actors like Lee Do Hyun and Yoon Sang Hyun on screen again, and I also found some new favorite actors to fangirl over. This type of genre is a complete guilty pleasure for me, and I’m glad that it lived up to my expectations all the way to the end. I didn’t feel like any scenes were filler, contrary to some opinions, and I really enjoyed the slice of life type of storytelling. I cried quite a bit watching this drama and was very invested in the storyline. It’s very hard for me to put into words how much I like this drama, because I’m mostly used to complaining about a drama’s low points in my reviews, and there really aren’t any in this one that I can think of off the top of my head. Rest assured, this will be one of the best things you have ever watched.

Tear-Jerking Drama!! Tissue's a MUST. ~ Warm and Inspiring Fatherly Love. <3
I started this drama without any expectation in mind. It was listed as a recommendation from a friend who loves watching K-dramas but little did I know that I'll love it's entirety.

Story: Story wise I gave it a perfect 10 as the story never felt lacking and has kept with the hype till the end. The message of the drama itself made it extra special to me does convincing me to create this account and write a review so that it can be a reference to other avid-drama watchers to decide whether to watch it or watch it. Lol~

Acting/Cast: 10/10 even beyond that — I was never familiar with anyone (Well aside from the Father adult version since I have watched his other works countless of times) so i started this drama just to ""Kill-Time"" but the actors and actresses were all impressive and has exceeded my expectation. I'm even a big fan of Lee Dohyun now. ?

Music: Simply 10/10. I got all the soundtrack on loop for weeks and is downloaded on my Spotify even for Offline listening. That should convince everyone. IF not you all should.

Rewatch Value: Definitely 10/10, IF not for the fact that I have tons on my pending watch list I would've watch it again after another drama or so.

Overall: 100/100 HAHAHAHA! I just love everything about this drama. ?

This is a must watch
Actually, I have no big paras and stanzas to tell but the thing I can say is that there is no reason to watch this drama
I feel it's a drama from where we all can learn something and relate to something.
It'll make you cry and emotional but the ending will make you fall in love.

And while watching it there may be moments where you may want to hug your parents or call them, do it then:-)
This drama really gave me some light to things we don't take seriously, like our parents working hard for us sacrificing so much for us just so that we can be happy

I really really suggest this to all of you
It's funny, it's cute, it's not cliché, you'll fall in love
There may be things you may not be satisfied with but you'll know only after watching it, trust me don't regret not watching it.
Just do it.

Hwaiting!!

Dont put it in plan to watch just watch it....
●This drama was so hyped that my twitter and IG feeds were full of it. So I just gave up on this drama and watched old drama. And also I don’t like to watch ongoing drama and it was a perfect decision, 18Again is so good that I wont have been able to wait for next episode. Its full of emotions, comedy and life values.

●Plot View- you have read the synopsis or might have watched the movie seventeen again on which this drama is based upon. I too had watched it but I don’t remember it anyway, as we all know movies are short we enjoy them but cant really connect to them. Drama gives you time to get immersed in the story of Hong dae young and Jung da jung. The story is amazingly good dealing with parenthood at young age, divorce side effects to a woman, discrimination at work due to education and age, dreams at any age, friendship, sacrifices and forgiveness.

●Acting- amazing bunch of actors made this awesome story more awesome
•Kim Ha Neul as Jungdajung was a perfect choice. She is an amazing actress and she portrayed the divorced mother of teenage kids amazingly well. Her work environment and enthusiasm was great story.
•Yoon Sang Hoon as 37 yr old Hongdaeyoung was hard working father and husband but he was also an imperfect person. He gives up his dreams and admits he has done lots of mistakes.

•Lee Do Hyun as Hongdaeyoung/Gowooyoung was excellent. He just made the characters more standout, no wonder he won two new actors award for 18again. Giving out his wisdom to the kids in school, apparently shows how hongdaeyoung grew up as a kind person and helping out his family in small things which sometimes clicks the heart.

•Wi ha joon as yejihoon, portraying a young handsome baseball player easily could have given a second lead syndrome. But the writers didn’t put this awkwardness in the drama which is why I liked it more. Instead they focused on his relationship with niece which was very beautiful.

•Kim Kang-hyun as Go Deok-jin and Lee Mi-do as Choo Ae-rin, were great friends and good support to the leads. They had their own world yet they showed what true friends are.

•Hong si ah, hong si woo, ye ji ho, Goo ja sung, showed great potential not just with their visuals but also with stupendous acting in this drama. The entangled story of these kids was very nicely done. How they grew up with the burden of the society, bad family relations and their budding dreams. It was really heartwarming. These new age actors will surely make it big. No wonder hwang in yeop skyrocketed with his new drama true beauty. And yes am next watching True beauty for more Hwang In yeop .

●Music - BGM and Ost was so mesmerising. HELLO, ONE PERSON were my favourite ost. The other soundtracks are also worth listening and they make the drama more special.

●Rewatch - its worthy of getting rewatch not just for story or acting but for everything.

●Appreciation -
◇the amazing scenery in the background, the sunset when hongdaeyoung confesses, the umbrella walk on the rainy day,the anime interior and superhero parties of go deok jin, sakura flowers in the school, just set the mood right.
◇Raising kids never come with the handbook. When they were 18 they had kids and did silly mistakes while raising them that brought tears and smiles simultaneously.
◇Marriage is happiness and divorce is a shame, which only goes for woman is dealt amzingly well via workplace discrimination story.
◇The transitions were smoothly done for 18year old hongdaeyoung to 18 year old hong dae young
I felt empty during the last episode I started missing goowooyoung.

●Criticism- the transformation from 37yrar old to 18 year old was done but how, magic,lightening,basketball HOW??? The only thing i didn't like.
●Fav quotes-
◇No matter how hard life gets, never regret anything in life that made you smile -Jung da jung
◇Its sad that people think that my kids are my mistakes. I think they are my blessings - Jung da jung
◇Seeing our kids take the first step made me happier than when i won a basketball game - hong dae young

Parents and children relationship
I really enjoy to watch this drama. It's story was so touching for me.

It's about parents who sacrifice their lives to rise their children. the mother who postponed her dream to be an anchor because she wants to rise her children until they're big enough. the father who gave up his dream and suddenly has to work hard to get the money for their family in such a young age.

the story taught us to value the time we have, and to think wisely before we act to save our own bright future.
the main couple did a mistake, having twin babies when they were in high school, so they have to struggle with that condition. they crashed their dream, and have difficult adult time because of the problem that they did in their young age. But still, they were responsible couple, although they know the consequences were hard, they chose to raise their twins.

some of the scene are entertaining, it can make me lol.
even the story is so light, it has a lot of moral value.

I like all the cast here. especially Lee Do Hyun, his acting is stunning, he really looks like an adult who's trapped in a young body.

Mostly Boring
Not a lot of comedy in this series. Show tries to run propaganda of ""strong divorced woman"". Husband is the only one who has to repair all his ""mistakes""(read sacrifices) to become an even greater domestic scapegoat for an ungrateful family, in particular a really undeserving wife. The wife is divorcing over non-issue instead of repairing her attitude. That is the narcissistic modern Korean woman for you. Unbearable, ugly and fake.

Wife is flirting at office as divorce is going on. Hard to sympathize with such a character. She does nothing to support her husband's career but this show forces you to believe that supporting wife's dreams is husband's role(hint: it's not). Children are not likeable either. Probably a metaphor for modern Korea, and pathetic situation men find themselves in. Time to get a North Korean waifu.

Honestly, North Korean women are much prettier, look natural and have far less attitude.

How’s the Ending?
For all of you who are like me and would rather not sit through 16 episodes and then have a bad ending, this review is for you. This is a cute show with a great ending. The show has a beautiful message about appreciating those we love. It is all tied together beautifully with a very happy ending.
PROS:
*The acting and OST were very good.
*The drama in this show doesn’t come from a main, irritating villain, instead it is more from the situation that the ML is in.
*There are a lot of positive messages in this show about friendship, parenting, marriage and life.
CONS:
* FL can be a little ditzy. I mean how can you not realize that he looks exactly like your husband did at that age.
* Kissing scene between older FL and younger ML is a little cringy. I just kept thinking that FL actress is around twenty years older than the male actor. Maybe it would have been better if they put the older actor in those scenes instead.
Overall, this is a great show and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic comedy with not too much drama.

a must watch!!!
whew where do i even begin? i will start by saying that this is by far the most beautiful kdrama i've ever seen.
it was both heart wrenching and heart warming at the same time.
the actors portrayed the emotions so well.
i got so attached to the story and characters, i think i cried in every single episode lol
this drama also teaches us a really important lesson and i'm sure that a lot of people can relate to it.
i think that if a couple that was going to divorce watched this drama they would rethink their decision in all honesty.
in conclusion this drama is a masterpiece without a doubt and i definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a drama that will make you feel so many emotions all at once and that will tell an important message.
this is one of the best if not the best kdramas of 2020.

adorable, fun, & heartwarming - aka: a MUST WATCH
This drama was really really good! When I first heard that there would be a kdrama remake of Zac Efron's 17 Again, I was skeptical. There was a lot about the original movie that felt weird to me, and I wasn't sure how this story would translate to 16 hours of screentime.

However, this adaption came out almost PERFECT. It had everything I loved; adorable and fun characters, an over-the-top but engaging plot, hilarious moments, an all-around loveable cast of characters, and just enough angsty, teary moments to round everything out. Very few dramas actually bring me through the whole range of emotions, but this one did and it did it well. While it is definitely overall a sappy romance, there's just as much heartwarming family love, friendships, and coworkers relationships to go around.

The switches between the adult and high school worlds were always fun and gave the drama so much more material to work with! Though I sometimes wanted more time with certain characters, I feel that the drama did a good job balancing all their story-lines. It flowed together nicely, and the ML (both the young and old versions) did a great job of bringing the two characters and worlds together!

After finishing and reflecting on this drama for a bit, it's only gotten better! Though I watched it as it aired, I can only image it would be just as good to binge. I highly recommend watching!!

one Drama that will stay with you for ever! Seriously!!
Who's the Director that directing this?
who's the genius writer that write the script?
Who's the cinematographic that captures all those beautiful moment?
who's the Leading actor? all is good, but Lee do Hyun is REMARKABLY AWESOME!!
(ji chang wok is my first love, than replaced by Lee Min Ho, then Jun hae in, then Hyun Bin,
but than Lee Do Hyun acting comes first before his look.. )
who's all those supporting actors and actress?
what's the title of the OST? all OST?

right after finishing Eps 1 of 18 again, I was stunned , with how the show keep me on my chair
and not want to miss a second of it!
I started googling all above.

right after watching several eps, I forced my husband to watch with me:))

Its our me-time, right after kids sleeping (or force them to sleep upstair so we can watch in peace)

we savour every scene, laugh with it, in love with it, cry with it,..
its the moment that we have been looking for right after we finish all our activities..

my husband said the drama teach him a lot of thing, specially about husband- wife relation,
about the imperfect, the sweetness, the true love, the struggle
and the daddy-son relation..
(cant really relate to daddy - daughter since we dont have daughter)

I love all of the characters here!
all the secondary stories are very interesting and funny if not super cuteee...

in the end of 2020, where it has been such a challenging year, with no travel can be done
(Singapore,,, when will you open to us Indonesian?? I miss Tiong Bahru Brioche sooo much!)
this is like the sweet perfect gift that will stay with you for a looongg time..
you will savour the drama like a very good tiramisu with high quality liquor that you want to enjoy
little by little, while sitting at outdoor chair in a cafe at st mark Venezia.

Lee Do Hyun, im shouted: OFFICIALLY A FAN OF YOUR WORK!!!

MY FAVORITE DRAMA
I honestly love this drama so much and never thought I could have another favourite drama EVER. I enjoyed the storyline so much and would definitely watch again. The acting was superb, the OSTs are amazing, the actors were chosen well and on a whole, I loved everything about this drama. This drama is mainly focused on family and I could never relate any better to the story. I honestly cried so much and would totally recommend it to anyone who is looking for a drama to watch. It is my ultimate favourite drama [;

A masterpiece
It's not what you would expect, it's tons better. I think it got even better than the American movie, the ml really felt like an old soul and made me belive that he is the husband. There is romance in this but I think the highlight is the family bond, after finishing this you get a warm and cozy feeling. Can I say thing the FL is a timeless beauty seriously I am in love with her! She was just the right amount of charisma and perseverance, I really loved her attitude toward life.. She never gave up no matter the difficulties.
The daughter and son also were really good this the son was a little bit pushy and was a forgettable character sometimes. Anyway if you are hesitating go and watch it!!! Super recommend

I'm at a loss for words. Started watching this because of the fun premise, stayed because of the way they shifted the movie route to something way more entertaining and mostly because of the great acting.

Yeah, you can't talk about this drama without mentioning the acting, specially Lee Dohyun. That boy makes wonder with his role, making an already good story become so much more because of how incredible his performance as the main role was. And the rest of the cast is not that far from him in terms of competence, Kim Haneul shines through her captivating and charismatic female lead; it's probably impossible not to root for her at every chance possible. Yoon Sang Hyun gets fewer parts than LDH (which may seem a bit weird since he is listed as main role but very understandable considering how the story needs to be developed) and he's for sure a veteran, a very skilled actor who deliver some great acting whenever he can.

Now, the story itself. It's basically the 17 Again movie for the first two episodes, which may lead you to think this is going to be just a shy remake of another story. But oh boy, by episode 3 they just leave everything behind and the drama really begins. And it's a journey, a very weird and spectatular one. It's almost impossible to get bored or frustrated because the problems are solved in a quick, effective way and it doesn't affect at all the overall flow. And it's very refreshing too, without being too preachy about it. They touch on some delicated matters; like divorce, sexual harassment, bullying and never in a ""in-your-face"" type of approach. It's all very subtle, very light-hearted and the most emotional scenes are usually connected to the main leads itself, and the struggles they need to face.

Still wondering about it? Just try the three first episodes. If by the end of episode three you're still not immersed, it may not be for you. But if you're into heart-warming and funny stories, please give this one a go.

So much more than just a version of ""17 again""
""17 again"" is one of my favorite romantic comedies. So, at first, I admit that I watched this drama just for the opportunity to experience something minimally similar to the film. And this was the best thing I could've done in the last few weeks!!!

""18 again"" is a work completely different from the american movie. It talks deeply about what is to be married. Even though a lot dramas tend to romanticize, here they approach it realistically. Also, it's worth saying the relationship between the main couple is not the only one well-developed during the drama: it's very emotional to watch Dae Young getting closer to his father, children, and mother-in-law. It's satisfactory to see his growth as a character. In general, the other characters were also well built. Secondary stories of the plot don't bore you at any time. Furthermore, I like the criticism about the difficulty a mother has to enter the labor market and about the treatment divorced woman receives in korean society.

The cast is talented and super beautiful! There are some kissing scenes between the adult Da Jung actress and the young Dae Young actor. I read that some people were feeling uncomfortable, but the narrative makes it clear: Da Jung was kissing her husband, Hong Dae Young, not Go Woo Young. The actors were only doing their job. If you focus on that, you will hardly be bothered by the situation (you will celebrate instead).

Lastly, the soundtrack is perfect. I don't usually rewatch anything, but I'll probably rewatch this drama when I miss it or have forgotten several things ~bad memory, not forgettable story~

I had interest in watching 18 Again because of my entertaining experience with the movie 17 Again with Zac Efron. The ratings were so high that I figured I just NEEDED to watch this, but unfortunately, I am dropping this.

My biggest gripe with this plot is how unrealistically marriage (or simply being dedicated to a significant other) is being portrayed here. A marriage does not simply crumble due to 1 nasty thing said, especially not when OBVIOUSLY inebriated and upset. Especially not a couple who have been together for nearly 20 years. At this point in your relationship, you know each other. Situationally, you would know that your spouse is upset AND drunk and therefore, while they might be embarrassing the crap out of you both and saying something hurtful, after things settle down, you would be able to process and address the root of the cause.
18 Again uses the reasoning that the main couple don't *communicate* and that's why their marriage fell apart, but let's be honest - if you didn't communicate as a couple, you would have broken up many many MANY years ago, with or without kids, so making it seem like they broke up over the 1 situation is just ridiculous (and while the writers allude that there were other things that contributed to their break up, it's weak and lacks substantial elaboration). *SIGH*

Further, I have real issue with everything being Hong Dae Young's fault. What about the fact that he gave up his dreams to make his wife and twins his new future? Yes, he made that choice, but it doesn't seem to matter to anyone that he lost his dream career and source of income as a professional athlete and just had to figure out how he would support his family (which would obviously leave him feeling unfulfilled, bitter, and depressed, which is ALSO ignored *huff*). So what, Jung Da Jung is allowed to keep her dreams, but Dae Young has to suck it up because...?

Additionally, to solely blame one individual in the relationship is to neglect the fact that there are indeed two factors the relationship depends on. I see this flawed perspective over and over again in entertainment and I find it infuriating. We all play a part in our relationships and dynamics. We are not perfect. Painting Da Jung as flawless and the *perfect* wife is so unrealistic and frustrating. It implies that only one partner needs to take responsibility for the outcomes of a relationship.

Also, what was with the creepy side-character plots? (The sinister teacher and the stalker) Bleh.

What made this drama worth watching was seeing Dae Young's beautiful memories with his children. I think the drama should have spent less time on Da Jung's career and Dae Young's flaws and more time on the dynamics between this family. What could have Da Jung done to support Dae Young's dreams and/or career? How could Dae Young be more involved with his high school children and be a better support at home? And the root issues of the arguments between Da Jung and Dae Young really needed to be addressed, not just the 1 moment Da Jung was embarrassed and hurt. *sigh*

I would also like to note that the OST for 18 Again is really beautiful. Very pretty, melodic music.

18 Again - A casual watch to make you feel 18 Again
18 Again is an adaptation of the American movie 18 Again. The only difference is that this is not rushed and there is a purpose for each character. The story has a few twists and turns - enough to keep you hooked - and in the end you definitely wish that you had a father like Hong Dae-young (Yoon Sang-hyun) [at least I did].
This is yet another series that will pull you into the vortex of 'The Second Lead Syndrome' even though here I personally did not see Goo Ja-sung (Hwang In Yeop) a good fit for Shi-ah (Roh Jeong-eui) due to their personalities. but definitely hoped that Ye Ji Hoon (Wi Ha Joon) will have a good romantic ending even if it is not with Jung Da-jung (Kim Ha-neul).
To me the best part of the series was Ye Ji-hoon's smile. The man really lifted me up on some of my shitty days. He played a big part [in my opinion] in making Dad Young a good husband and his back-story too is heartwarming.
All in all the series is good if you are interested in a casual watch. It does get dragged a little bit here and there but I am satisfied with how the story rolled out overall. Every element in the series was there for a reason and it showed. To me the message resonated the best - for any relationship to work you need to communicate to understand the other person's perspective.
I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as I did!

Watch it or you'll regret
I love how heartwarming this story is and you can watch it with your family. It speaks of so many lessons and personally, I learned to live my life without regrets because sometimes we tend to look back on the past and regret our decisions. But we also forget that those decisions led us to who we are today. Technically, we cannot go to the past just like the character did in the story. So instead of pondering on what ifs, let's accept the present and be better versions of ourselves so that later on we won't regret anything and we can say that this is the life we've chosen to live. I love how the story revolved on the casts and their lives and not just reliant on the main characters. Each actor performed well and they really contributed on the success of 18 Again. Despite this, what I don't like is how impossible the plot is because technically you can't get younger just because you wished it. Overall, I'd say this is a nice drama to watch with family.

~Massive tearjerker drama about what it means to be a family and what truly defines love
~Lee Do Hyun is an acting force in this drama and perfectly portrays the mannerisms of both his younger and older self so well. His chemistry with the FL is also really good and has no awkwardness
~Major themes revolves around family sacrifices, hardships of high school pregnancy, appreciating small everyday things in life, parent-child relationship, & broken family
~The drama also tackles sensitive topics about being a divorced women in a conservative society, workplace discrimination for females and cyberbullying
~Comic reliefs in between a few intense scenes will have you LOL

I guess I've seen it somewhere before...
There’s not really much to say about this drama. And at this point you probably wondering why then I’m writing this review? Well, the reason is simple. The fact that there’s not much to tell, is a review of its own. 18 again is just a concept that was seen before and there’s not much more to add.

We’ve seen this before. Zac Efron is a basketball star at his high school but for some reason his life does not go according to plan and he wakes up one day as a bitter 30 something year old and want some change. The chance appears when in by magic he get’s a second chance in life, he wakes up as a teenager. Simple? So now, let’s translate this idea to Korean and add another 15 hours of content to this idea that was born as a single movie.

I don’t really remember original movie that well, but I could’ve swear that I’ve seen some scenes from first episode so I guess it was pretty close to the movie.

But let’s just leave this issue. This drama is not original, we’ve seen it before, but does it defend itself on its own? Can we just watch it without thought of Zac Efron in shorts in our heads? Pretty much yes, and then what is left, it pretty good. You know, mostly because somebody tested this idea before.

Overall I like the idea of the fresh perspective, when we progressively see the same topic from various points of view just to know that our main character might not be entirely right in showing the reality of situation. We had similar idea in Familiar Wife, where we also progressively unveiled how things looked according to other character versus the main one. And obviously it changed how we seen the relationship between main characters. In 18 Again we have Hong Dae Young perspective, where he thinks that he’s done everything he could for his family, but when we hear what his wife thinks about it, the situation looks pretty different.

Honestly, I wasn’t too invested in main characters relationship. Hong Dae Young for me was moderately interesting, especially in his teenage version. By the way, when did we cross the thin line between Yoon Sang Hyun playing sexy rock start in Secret Garden and father figurer that got old pretty badly? Because that’s like eight years between those two dramas but I barely recognised him!

Anyway, back to the point. I like how this drama slowly changes from the story about guy who suddenly goes back to being teenager to a story of how other characters cope. Hong Dae Young is a centre of the plot, but not necessary its main focus point. And that’s good, because sometimes the background characters are much more interesting than what happens to the main ones. Secondary characters are truly building atmosphere here. Especially that romantic motive between Jung Da Jung and young Hong Dae Young is at some point pretty weird. I mean I know that in this body there’s almost 40 year old man, but Da Jung casually dating teenager just looks weird. This whole situation seems wrong. And if we’re already here, there’s around zero chemistry between those two.

To add to all of this, we have a bunch of unnecessary cliches. We have a white truck of death, we have people who know each other but don’t know it till the end. And then suddenly it’s a big of a deal.

On a plus side, we have good comedic relief motives. I have to admit, scenes where Hong Dae Young and Go Deok Jin argue as a son and father and are constantly overheard by the office staff is a comedy gold here. Especially with half of those dialogues being beeped out because of swear words.

Overall I kinda enjoyed this series, but more like a guilty pleasure. It’s not bad remake after all, so if you don’t mind watching very predictable series, then I guess go on.

Valuable life lessons might not come in the best form
'Regretful youth' seems to be the strong premise behind ""18 Again"". The drama, which is adapted from the infamous American Movie ""17 Again"", is a lightly-plotted one filled with struggles, family warmth, worthwhile life lessons, and a bunch of jokes (that came off as either purely funny or, most of the time, being more cringe-worthy). Starting off, it must have been a brain-digging ideas to adapt a 2-hour movie into 16 one hour-long episodes. That's almost tenfold of its length. As a consequence, while giving direct moral lessons, a big chunk of the middle part came off as being filler stories, specifically subplots.

A bit of the plot: The journey follows a regretful 37 year-old Hong Daeyoung (who was about to divorce his wife Jung Dajeong) instantly turning into his 18 year-old self out of the blue. While he's at it, he attended his twin children's school. Other than the school's dynamics, the series also follows Dajeong's journey on becoming an aspiring announcer, a dream she put off while being pregnant with the twins at 18.

First of all, I didn't watch the original movie prior to watching 18 Again as I wanted to learn things thoroughly and not comparing to 17 again. However, things took a whole detour after the first few early episodes and only get back up after the two-thirds of the drama. Yes, it has too many subplots. I claim that the main plots are: Daeyoung as Uyeong, Dajeong's work life, and the twins school life. They were pretty much well-written and relatable although most of the times one of them outshines the others in an unbalance way. Things like Sia and Siu lying to their parents about school life could not be more realistic. The story telling is thorough but they might bring the viewers to gain some subjectivity other than making the viewers having more objective view. However, the gap between those subjectivity might help viewers realize on valuable things that humans have ever regretted before. Some simple things they wished they had done, even as simple as being a good son to their parents.

For the subplots, I found Ye Jihun's family plot to be heartwarming while being too coincidental had it happened in a more realistic approach. Seo Jiho's is an interesting character but it felt like he's gone in the middle for some reason. The geeky-adventure of Deokjin and Ms. Ok is lightly funny but adds nothing to the drama's whole weight. The elevator scandal is good. For the others, I found a lot of them to be unnecessary: Choi Ilgwon's whole story of admission scam and problems, the two random employees in Deokjin's company, Aerin's hateful friend, Si-u's barely-appearing girlfriend, and for the worst: the random stalker. I found the stalker plot to be underwhelmingly executed as they had been teasing it since the very early stages of the drama. The reveal was misleading too plus it adds nothing to the drama. Another thing about the story/writing, I found the tear-jerker scenes to be beautiful (although I'm a hard person to cry), especially Sia's bank scene, 2002 World Cup, and Siu meeting dad. In contrast for the lighter comedic scenes, I found most of the jokes to brings me second-hand embarrassments especially when it comes to Ko Uyeong acting as a dad/wife/friend in an 18 year old form. Some people might find the jokes funny, but those are not for me.

For the characters, they seem to be as what they are designated to be except the ones I have mentioned above. The main characters are amazing and their acting are top notch, especially Lee Dohyun for embodying a middle-aged man. At times, Dajeong might seem too angelic but (i'm not sure why) her character just seem so humane. Also love the twins. I found Jiho's character to be interesting and easy to relate to but most times he isn't present in the drama. Jaseong's character development came off as too instant at times that I was shocked one or two times of him showing a more friendly side. Dajeong's seniors and colleague Yumi's character development also seem a bit too delayed at the end. For the others, I might just say they are what they are shown, with the complaints from the plot still stands.

Other additional elements to the drama actually added some value to the drama. The music might be too repetitive with that one soundtrack but it served its purpose. There's not many special effects but they are necessary and didn't devalue the drama. The settings of places and timing are greatly consistent.

Overall, 18 Again is a nice ride of emotions with great acting, decent storyline, not-for-everyone jokes, and valuable life lessons. However, as just how life goes, those valuable life lessons might not come in the best form.

Well worth a watch
This series is a cracker. Far better than the American film. The cast are fantastic and the humour is on point. It's rare that a 16 episode series holds my attention the whole way though but this series delivered. The side plots are also interesting and do not distract from the main romance. The series succeeds in exploring adult themes in a youth drama. Lee Do Hyun who is excellent as the ML. He is totally convincing as an older man in a young man's body. All in all, is just good fun and will have you laughing and occasionally tearing up along the way.

Rewatched it and I still like it a lot apparently
I rewatched this to see Wi Hajoon and Lee Dohyun, and they did so well, along with all the other actors. I remembered little bits of moments, but I couldn't remember the right sequence of it. So when I watched it, I was surprised when I expected something and it still hasn't happened, or something I expected to come out later is actually in the earlier part of the story. Well, at least that gave it kind of like a shock factor so I wasn't bored. And back then I probably missed some things, or some details I couldn't remember well. And it's nice to see those little details, along with some moments that I thought were really good.

Wi Hajoon did such an amazing job portraying Ye Jihoon. When he's in the field, he looks very cool and charismatic focusing on baseball, the thing that he loves and does best in. When he's with Dajeong and Seoyeon, his sweeter and more emotional side comes out. He's everyone's dream boy and everyone thought he's perfect, but as everyone else does, he does too. I love the way they wrote his story, and tying the story with Hong Daeyoung was a pretty obvious, but nice touch. The man he was looking for all these years to thank is the ex husband of the woman he likes? It was nice. Especially because though he wasn't able to date the person he likes, she's with someone who saved his niece. And that they end up just being friends, it was really nice to see, rather than cutting each other off completely so they wouldn't be awkward.

And Lee Dohyun is also really amazing. I mean, His role is a 37 years old dad that just happened to go back to his 18 years old self, pretending to be a student, a friend to his children and their friends, he's acting as a (pretty bad at hiding his real identity) actor. The only other character that was closest to this I could think of is Jinyoung in The Dude In Me, a student whose soul got swapped with a gangster (who turned out to be a dad, and end up meeting his daughter and his first love) ((and it's really a good movie but these two ""teen dads"" vibes are VERY different)) Sometimes when he did the things he does as a dad, it can either go the comedic route or touching route, there's no inbetween. One of his best moments is the one where he did sign language to his dad after a competition. If I remember correctly, I probably cried about this on my first watch. I probably cried a lot more on my first watch in like, any moment.

The cinematography in this is really amazing. All of the shots are very beautiful. I loved the moments where it transitioned from young Hong Daeyoung/Ko Wooyoung to present time Hong Daeyoung. It's just a small little thing as a reminder that Ko Wooyoung is Hong Daeyoung and it's pretty cool. The sets are also really nice, but I especially loved Ko Deokjin's geeky themed house. I'm not a big avengers or game fan, but still, seeing props and outfits like the iron man outfit, thor's hammer, captain america's shield was really cool. To have a house decorated with all of your interests in every part of the house seems really cool and it's like a dream house.

Thoroughly enjoyable and absolutely heartwarming. A definite feel good!
I have had such mixed feelings about this show, that even as I write this, I'm not entirely sure where this will lead. When I completed the show, I was left feeling happy, warm, hopeful, optimistic and absolutely soaked with the sappiness of the romance. But I was also left with this indescribable feeling of.. Something not being.. Quite right somehow. If the way that I just explained it is any good hint, I hope you understand when I say that I cannot exactly pinpoint what didn't click with me. Let's get into the details!

It's no secret what this was a remake of, and I had watched 17 Again and liked it, as a young adult who was hopelessly crushing on Zac Efron (nothing you ever say will ever top the shade I throw at my younger self). I knew when this was picked up that the korean remake will add in a lot of feelings for sure. And it did. Not for the first few episodes though. I was finding it hard to stick around at least till the 4th episode I think. But the way that bonds between family and friends were created and unfolded was beautiful. I smiled through tears and sobbed so many times along the course of 16 episodes. But. But. There were also quite a few side plots that I did not really feel the connect with. Several incidents were dramatized to be lengthier and bigger than they should have been, it got to the point where it felt strained and obvious that something was just being said and done to be a filler. There were many, MANY, strong points in the show but along with them came this draggy, drudgy, aimless parts as well.

When I say that it was hard for me to stick around during the earlier few episodes, the reason I got through was entirely because of the actors. Lee Do Hyun - this man, carried this on his young able shoulders and everyone in the cast helped him in their own ways. This is probably the first time I've seen Kim Haneul in a drama, and it was pleasant watching her, I could see the veteren charm there. And I really think Yoon Sang Hyun shines in such roles (I need to watch more of his works). I also loved, loved Wi Ha Joon's role! He's got such an appealing vibe, suited the role too. But my oh my, Do Hyun! The spectrum of emotions this man showed were so brilliant and memorable. Every emotion, every expression, every dialogue was delivered and FELT. Be it an 18-year old father, or a 37 year old father transformed into an 18-year old kid - I could feel everything that the character was trying to convey. And all that is thanks to Do Hyun. There are great levels of details and nuances in the way he acts out Hong Dae Yeong. The supporting cast is one of the absolute best too!

I adored the OSTs so much! I've got a couple on my playlists now. Only One, Hello and If You have become favorites! The whole album in fact, is a very easy listen, and after having watched the show, each song now has a feeling attached to it because of the show. It's a beautiful OST album.

When it comes to the matter of rewatching it, the chances are quite low. But I definitely would not mind watching this for Do Hyun and to relive some of the interactions between the characters. Have I mentioned how beautifully they've shown the bonds? People travelled full circles to be where they were. Also, this is was such a mix between realistic problems people face in life and love, and a fluffy mushy romantic's dream come true. There were portions that felt real, relatable, and others that felt entirely in-your-face drama like (=never happening in real life, stop waiting for it). What I mean to say is that there was push and pull happening for me when it came to making a stable connection with the drama as a whole.

In conclusion, even though this didn't bowl me over, this in no way, is a drama that should be passed by, please watch it. The actors deserve it, the production team deserves it. It's a beautifully made drama that showcases familial love and bonds in a very heartwarming way. Not to mention, it's got some wonderful background tracks that will be a blessing to your ears.

It was a pretty good show
I have only one complaint. They should have let the kids find out that Woo Young was their father. They should know that he was there for them in their hardest moments. That alone would have made it 9.0 star drama instead of the 8.0 star that I gave it. That's why I didn't like the last episode. Compared to the rest of the drama it was so mediocre and cliche.

I really liked the Younger Couple. They looked so good together and I wanted to see more of their romance. We only got two or three happy romance scenes from them. I really hated the adult Dae Young and I think that was the intention.

I liked everything eelse. It wasn't a groundbreaking show but it was pretty good.

They could have gone for marriage counselling, beautiful drama nonetheless
Story: Pretty simple and beautiful, minus few minor subplots that goes nowhere/pointless (*docks points*). I really enjoyed the themes of parent/children relationships and marriages in this drama. Especially on re-evaluating in retrospect how the son (ML) became like his father (which was not what he wanted) and not regretting over the past decisions (of becoming young parents). Both ML and FL have good character development, realising what went wrong in their relationships and the process of reconciling. I also liked the second ML's story and kinda wished he got hitched with somebody (well, at least he has his 'daughter' :)). I think this drama was relatable in the sense that I am grateful, in retrospect, of my parents' relationships as a couple, which I thought was not perfect and not very romantic (*tmi tbh*), but in hindsight they were open and honest with each other (which what the main couple lacked). As mentioned, the themes of parent-child relationships kinda hit close to my heart, as such experience happens to me. (*very typical: my dad being nagging and both my parents and I not willing to be open with each other*)
Acting: Lee Do Hyun really carried this drama on his back, although some credits should go to Yoon Sang Hyun, for some of the more emotional scenes. He really sold the ahjussi trapped in a young person and the romance between his character and Kang Ha Neul's character (*SHE'S SO PRETTY*). (*imo their kissing scenes did feel a little uncomfortable to watch, as the main male character is a minor, although LDH himself is not*) I really think the LDH's casting was perfect, as they needed somebody old/mature enough who can pull off as a mentor-like figure to the students (e.g: his children) and of course young enough to make it believable that he is a high schooler.
Music: hello hello hello hello~... lol ok its pretty good for a romance drama and not that annoying despite that repeated 'hello'. It created melodramatic moments and raised the swooning romances.
Rewatch value: Honestly, my interest in this drama was piqued through a compilation of funny moments in the drama. I would probably rewatch those funny moments very soon. (*especially LDH being ahjussi and such a dad, IT IS ICONIC*)
Conclusion: *TLDR* 18 Again tells a story of a couple re-evaluating their relationship, the misunderstandings and miscommunications, such that this drama would not have started if the couple went for marriage counselling. It also *kinda* tells the story of how children and parents can misunderstand each other and the importance of parents being supportive of their children.

Emotional, fun, sweet, bitter love... and deffenetly easy to watch
Interesting take on regret, marrage and life...

When I started watching this drama I posted this on my feeds:

I am watching 18 again, and have now seen several dramas with the theme married couples have crisis, go back in time or age or something find out they actually love each other... I just want to tell you that there are couples who have been together for a long time thru hardships that actually communicate and keep on loving each other, and that there also are allot of couples out there who should get divorced. Some couples are good for each-other while others are not. I´m not saying couples should break up after every argument, just that divorce is actually a life savoir for many and really not a bad option. Divorce is one of the most important options we should have and is nothing to be ashamed of, it is the first step towards another chance at happiness. So here is to loving relationships! with whom ever they may be.

And don't forget it's better to be happy alone than unhappy together!

And after watching this I still agree with what I wrote, maybe not for the couple in the drama but overall that I wish to see that type of drama where they acnawladge devorce as a good option,

Anyway the young actors here where all brilliant, they where sweet, made lovely side storys and side love triangels. Every singel character in this drama experinaced allot of growth and it was deffenetly fun to watch. The most annoying and only annoying character in the whole drama was the ML as a grown upp, sorry even thogh this is a very well known and experinced actor his acting stood out as between bad to mehh at most. Specially compared to all the other cast and characters.

The story it self has good pacing, some good massages , some cringe and some humor too, I like the motehrs character beeing a teen mom to begin with I wish I would have seen this before writing my artecle about mothers, she would deffenetly have made the cut as a really good mom, chossing her children, caring yet still able to focus on herself too.

I like the way this drama tackels the issue of absent fathers as well as agisem, cyber bulling and hierarcis.

As mentioned earlier I have seen atleast three dramas with this theme, and I loved Familjar wife alittle bit more (Could be becouse of Han Ji Min) but not much more and loved this one more than Go back couple. The Male lead is deffenetlly the best in this one out of all three thogh.

All in all a fun drama to watch, It has all the makes to make you laugh, moist your ayes and feel familjer it even has a range of umbrellas and trucky of doom! Not bad huh! It also has cuite a few takes on the regular cliches and was both predictable and managed to suprize me once or twice.

Nostalgic
The plot and message of the drama is very touching. Really encourages me to enjoy my youth more instead of worrying so much about the future. Most importantly, seeing the family slowly come together again is so heartwarming. Also the concept is funny and interesting, which is what got me into the drama in the first place. I mean the father becoming young again, experiencing school life. The entire cast did an amazing job portraying each of their character,and I love the comedy, it is not cringy or over the top. This is good if you don't want too much drama and messy plot and just want to relax a little after work

AMAZING
I decided to watch '18 Again' because I'm a huge fan of '17 Again'. Needless to say, this is more enjoyable than 17 Again. I loved everything about this. I love how they incorporated different things to make it even more enjoyable but not once allowing the viewers to get sidetracked. The acting was amazing (probably a few cringy moments here and there but every movie has that so I can forgive those). The OST was great.. i found myself getting emotional every time I heard it. i found it to be very beautiful and very fitting.
If you haven't decided whether or not to give this a try this is your sign. DO IT.

sad, heartwarming, and relatable drama! MUST WATCH!
This kdrama is basically about a man turning back to 18 years old to get a second chance to be with his wife again (since they both got divorced).

I recommend this kdrama to any divorced couples out there because this kdrama has a lot of relable things that real life couples struggle on or need help on getting back together EVEN if you have little kids/teens. Who knows? you might regret getting divorced.

The cast are pretty attractive, their actings are top NOTCH, the music in this kdrama warms your heart like the morning sun. This Kdrama is one of the best of the year no CAP!

What i like about this drama is the PURE Romance, the plot twists at the end of every episode, the regrets, the flashbacks, literally Everything!

The endings were good, all the people in this kdrama has their unique endings towards the end of the kdrama.
The Scenery was also beautiful, and very heartwarming, and touching!!

The only question is...
How did Hong Dae-Young turn back to his regular self?

I don't think there's one single thing i dislike about this apart from this question above me.

Anyways this is my first review so please respect my opinions, thanks.

I didn't expect it that I am going to love it.
I had in the slum for Kdrama recently, and pick this one by chance looking for cheese school romance, but found gold, if not diamond instead.
And this drama made me obsessed with Lee Do Hyun. I have never put any thought about this guy before, damn don't even realize he was Mr. Butterfly in Hotel de Luna up until I search him up.

The soul of the drama is Ko Woo Young played beautifully by Lee Do Hyun. I sometimes forget that he is THAT young and yet he can materialize the character of a 36-year-old protective father who loves his children more than everything in his life. By the way, he is 25 yo but he played both roles perfectly (an 18 yo student outside and 36 yo father inside).

The best parts of the drama are the flashbacks of how the struggles of these young parents and how Woo Young tried his best to be close to his children. All these heartwarming scenes made me grabbed more tissue than I should. And the scenes with their respective parent in-law broke me into storm of cries.
I was a little thrown out by the 'love story' tho. How ironic, I came to watch romantic drama and yet find the romance in this drama has less value than the main idea of ""love your family"".

And the OST, gosh... This drama is about finding yourself back. More than often things in life don't go as we planned them to be and the hardship that we went through made us forget. We often forget the person that we are used to be, forget the reasons why we love our loved ones. AND everytime the song HELLO came out in the background, I felt the pang of pain. As if the song tries to say ""hello again"" to the old us that we have often forgotten. The old us who love everyone and was loved by everyone.

Would I re-watch it? Maybe not. I will remember (and probably go to Youtube to watch) those scenes that Lee Do Hyun brought to screen on what truly a father love is.

Heartwarming
A really nice show that melts your heart away.

The story flows really well and the casting is really great.

Got to give props to Kim Ha Neul, her acting was amazing and she was the MVP for me.

I wouldn't go and say that the show was amazing, it had some issues, for example:

* 2-5 minute repeat of the previous episode that included one or two new lines to make it feel new was kind-a of useless, I always skipped the start of each episode
* some scenes that didn't add to the story or plot but were added for some reason
* the daughter love triangle or in this case the love arrow... which didn't make a lot of sense
* the basketball cringe when they were purposely missing the basket by a huge margin

Nonetheless each episode felt fresh and I couldn't wait to watch the next one.

So I can definitely recommend it to anyone who looks for comfy show that you can snuggle and watch comfortably until the end.

Magnificent
This drama is one of the best that I have watched in 2020 and is definitely a hidden gem. The story, the acting, the OST and the characters developments are phenomenal. Each character is well written, relatable and the acting of the cast is excellent. I absolutely loved each episode and there was not an episode that I did not like at all or felt like it was too draggy. If I should describe this drama with one word, than this would be: Magnificent.

Overall the rewatch value of this drama is 10/10.

Heartwarming and Fun Story
Actually i'm planning to skip this drama because reading from synopsis, I thought it's gonna be simple predictable story. But after watch a clip spoiler from instagram, when Lee Do Hyun scold the girls taking taxy to school, it so funny and I start watching it..

The first half of story actually really good and heartwarming, but the later half they kinda run out ideas, so many filler story and unnecessary scene..
But it's still fun drama to watch, superb acting from lee do hyun, funny friend go deok jin and chu ae rin, love triangle jiho-shi a-ja sung, and i like deok jin love line with the teacher@..

I recommend it if you are looking for light and fun drama.

great potential
I'm a fan of Kim Ha Neul and Yoon Sang Hyun so that is why I started watching. Most of the dramas I watch are before 2018 because I'm not into the zoomer ones like the ones on netflix. Getting straight to the point, the first 4 episodes were S tier. The next 12 episodes were snoozers for me because I have a short attention span so I need every second to matter in a drama. The main problem in this drama is that there are too many scenes that are replays and too many sleeper flashbacks.
The acting in this drama was really good because Lee Do Hyun did an outstanding job in the first couple of episodes and the other two main are veteran actors. But there were still scenes where you would cringe because how cheesy the acting is.
The story in this drama had good potential but after the 4th episode, the plot watered down really hard. But I was never bored when watching the drama. I usually don't finish dramas if they get too sleeper but I finished this one.
Overall a decent drama that I wouldn't watch again. Although the quality of the drama is good, I just cannot rate it higher than a 7.8 because too many replays and slow motions that make me angry. And the underwhelming 12 episodes.

EDIT: I'm currently watching this again with my mom and I realized that I haven't really appreciated the acting, small details, and the music very much. Story is still quite underwhelming but the acting and comedy makes up for it. The fact that I am also re watching this is also proof that this drama is a fun experience overall. I can proudly say that this is an 8.5 worthy drama and is a good watch for anyone especially if you are a father.

TRY 18 AGAIN!
Okay, let me tell you one thing : like a lot of viewers, I began this show with no expectations. At the beginning I even wanted to avoid 18 Again, I though it would be impossible to do a good 16 hours drama based on the American movie 17 Again. BUT I WAS WRONG aha. I just loved this show so much, even if it's not perfect. Yes it can be a bit slow, yes there is a love triangle, yes I didn't like the secondary couple (their story wasn't enough credible, it was a love at first sight pretty creepy but whatever). But overall, 18 Again is such an heartwarming and emotional k-drama fill of love (family love, romance, friendship) and comedy. I you like rom-com, If you like family drama, this one is for you. There are a lot of beautiful life lessons in this show.
PLUS: There is Lee Do Hyun in it. God, I didn't know this actor but he manages to be one of my favourite since the first episode. I'm impressed by his acting, he has a bright future ahead if he chose the good projects :) The others actors are great too, the music is very beautiful (Hello hello will make you cry for sure).

I mean, there's nothing I will say that hasn't already been said by the millions of reviews that came before me. It was a solid romance with just the right balance of fluff, angst and heart. Its my first time watching Lee Do Hyun and I absolutely ADORED him and his character- you bet I'll be checking out everything else he acts in! I see a very promising future for him. The cast is nothing to laugh at, yet he absolutely stole the show- if this character wasn't written exclusively for him, I'd be damned to find anyone else who would have been able to do as well or as much justice to the character as him.

Why regret when we can get a second chance:)
Parent's sacrifice, their screts and them helping you without your knowledge. This is all about the drama is.

Parents love their children undoubtedly,but not all can express their love. There are times when years after we regret some of our choices, but don't realise that the moment we made those decisions we were happy about them.

The story about the will surely make you tear up just like me. It seemed like comedy drama until it wasn't one.

The actors did really great job portraying their characters.

I also enjoyed the OST of this, it was damn amazing HAHA.

I won't re-watch it coz it's a really sad drama, which I totally didn't expect, and I don't wanna cry twice haha.

I don't think the problem with this series was that there was a big age difference. Because we've watched couples with an age difference before(I Hear Your Voice, Secret Love Affair, Romance is the Bonus Book. Light in Your Eyes, One Spring Night...). I think there was no chemistry between the main couple. Even though I enjoyed watching their old times, Da Jung's old version bothered me. It was like she couldn't get into the acting role. Especially 13-14. What was the acting of the woman in the episodes, for God's sake? She acted like she was 15 years old and in addition the scenes were irritating. For example, there is a kissing scene at the end of episode 14. Pay attention to the acting of the female character in that scene. She is crying but her face looks like she is disgusted. I think I should point out that the script is also weak at many points. Especially in the episodes in 2020. I felt the emotion more intensely in the parts describing the old times. I wish old Dae Young would act in romantic scenes. There were times when I questioned the meaning of Yoon Sang Hyun's presence in the drama. I think it was a pity for him. In order to express the emotion more in very unnecessary scenes, those scenes were played by the old Dae Young. But there was always LDH in the romantic scenes. LDH acted great, but we can't deny that the script is weak.

This drama is packed with emotions , comedy , romance and even an action scene between THOR and CAPTAIN (XOXO). If I compare the drama with the parent movie ""17 again"" then I would personally favor the drama though it is not right to compare them as a whole. The acting and inner thoughts of the characters is at times tear-jerking .
Cinematography is brilliants , the change and transition of scenes is done in a smart way.
The only minus point is the slow pace of the drama.
I would definitely recommend this drama . Give it a try ,I guess you won't regret .

An All Rounder
I genuinely haven’t watched something so warm and uplifting in a while. This drama is a remake of the American movie but it’s so much more. The main characters are so enjoyable. Drama touches upon core issues such as importance of family, difficulties of early parenthood, rocky school life and finding yourself even in the midst of a chaotic, degrading life cycle. The father/children relationship is heartwarming and makes you bawl. It makes you realize the hardships your parents might’ve went through to give you a good life. It also digs deep into how children give back without expressing through words. Main lead, Lee Do Hyun, is so charming and believable as a father of two teenagers; I was stunned with his amazing acting abilities. This drama is truly a gem.

The Value of Family
I did not expect this KDRAMA is this good. I was just expecting that the main leads are good in their craft and acting skills. But I was really amazed by the story. You will definitely laugh and cry at the same time. The values taught in this story is really the reality happening in each family or household. It was executed well by each character. Expectedly each character has a good background but I'm still in awe seeing them all together on one screen and was really glad that I was able to see this drama immediately. This is a MUST watch kdrama. Main male leads are both soooo good in their roles. They are matched in heaven. Overall this is a really feel good and warm drama.

WHY YOU MUST WATCH IT
Our first obvious reason on why you should watch this show is very simple. It tells the parent's experience and shows the life of two highschool kids who had a child at a young age.

The second reason on why you should watch this show is, it makes you so involved in the plot that it could make you cry and laugh at any moment.

Our third reason is how our ML are both handsome guys. Two guys with one mind! How amazing! They both are good-looking and have very good acting which almost brought me to tears.

The rewatch value is so high because there are so many memorable clips and episodes that just makes you want to rewatch. Especially episode 16 ending, the ending is what we are all expecting!!! Lets cheer for our HONG fammmmmm!!!!!!

A DEFINITE MUST WATCH!!!
such a great dramaaaa, perfect blend of friendship, family and romance. I love how the stories depict the culture and hardship of being young parents, how public view them and kinda look down on them. Despite the story having hundreds of subplots and not fully developed to its potential, I enjoyed every bits of it. I almost cried in every episodes and lee do hyun did a great jobbb in potraying the character. despite being the cute lee do hyun I could see the ahjusshi in him, like a real father. There were funny scenes too and so it was fun to watch. An emotional roller coaster indeed. love love loveeee the drama!!

Beautiful story of Second chances
Likes
1. Everything about the drama was beautiful!! The three leads were so terrific and their chemistry worked so well. There was a seamless transition between Woo Young and Dae Young, it really felt like they were the same people. Kim Haneul is gorgeous as always.
2. The visuals!! 🥰 all the guys were handsome and the girls were pretty! Except for the bad coach, i loved all the friendships and how supportive they are of each other. I absolutely loved Aerin!
3. Perfect balance of laughter and tears. My favorite storyline was of Dae Young and his dad and the sign language scene 😭. And when Sia finally called up Dae Young to tell him she misses her dad.
4. The cinematography was so pretty too. And the OST. Im sad they didnt release the OST album coz i really wanted to get my copy.
5. So many life lessons about dreams, family, marriage and relationships.

""There are days when we hated each other. But thanks to that, we understand each other better. We learn to appreciate each other more. And we love more. There were more days when we were happier. For that happiness, we decided to love our decisions . We chose people based on love. And we are grateful for our decisions.""

""In life, even if you miss out on happiness, as long as you have that one person who will look for happiness with you, your life will be worth living. Dont forget that you love each other. Be disappointed that you cannot cherish each other better. And promise for a better tomorrow. Just like that, our lives will continue.""

Dislikes
1. Wished for more scenes between the twins. They dont seem to be close.
2. Deokjin-Ms Ok romance dragged on for too long. It was hard to see Deokjin get rejected so many times when he's such a nice guy. I thought he would go well with Aerin coz they're both sweet and hilarious but at least Aerin got a potential boyfriend in the end.

Rating: 9.5/10

MUST WATCH
It was very refreshing and heartwarming drama. Despite the plot of an almost 40 year old family man turn back as 18 again, it was not cliche and the family conflicts and personal dilemma are very realistic. There is a lot of life lessons, reflection and realizations you can get.

The casting was also well pick. The cast portray well the characters magnificently. Especially Lee Do Hyun, he greatly portray his part, very realistic without exaggerations or overly portrayal. He has a great potential in acting. You will surely love this especially his proficient acting.

On other part, the storyline was too stretch and a lot of filler scenes and sub plots that are not really necessary and skipable scenes. The drama should have been atleast 8 - 14 episodes and should have a more great plot twist. Because the story line was so narrow and can predict already what will be the end of the series. But despite that, it was very interesting due to the good portrayal of the cast and team of the given plot. The development of the characters was well place too. Everyone grow and does not left any characters behind.
Above all, this drama is a must watch and Lee Do Hyun is highly commendable. This drama is highly recommended. Sit back, relax and watch this.

A Heartwarming, Touching & Cute Story
I was not planning on trying this drama when I first heard about it and saw that it started airing, but gave it a chance after seeing the high ratings. AND it sure did not disappoint! I was in love with the drama after two episodes and slowly watched every episode in order to save them and enjoy every minute of it. There is just so many things to love about this drama. It covers various genres and topics which are delivered by talented actors (Lee Do Hyun especially!). I am so glad I decided to try this drama when I did because it would have been a shame if I missed out on this gem of a drama! Would totally recommend if you enjoy the warm family type of dramas. I think that if you enjoyed Go Back Couple, you would love this one too! It has all the same family vibes and deep tearjerking moments that hit you all of a sudden.
..
..
..
..
..
..
Now, things I liked:
1. ABSOLUTELY LOVE LEE DO HYUN'S ACTING!- I loved him in Hotel del Luna and he definitely did not disappoint me in this drama but rather made me more amazed at how well he acts. He did better than I expected and really brought the Wooyoung/Daeyoung to life. He is also such eye candy with his cute and handsome/charismatic charm in certain scenes.
2. The plot- I enjoyed Go Back Couple so this aspect of the plot played a role in convincing me to give it a try. It never got explained how Daeyoung changed to his younger appearance but I think that was not a big problem for the story development or the ending. I also loved how there are some parts set up to make you assume something will happen but it isn't what you expect (or maybe just for me).
3. OST- Absolutely love love love love the ost!! Sohyang's voice absolutely breaks my heart every time I hear it play in the drama. She does an amazing job singing that song and helping the scene with emotional factors. All the other OSTs were also so great though! I keep playing them on repeat.
4. Romance- I love how this drama does not overdo it with the romance aspect but puts a decent amount. I do not like super cringy and cheesy romance dramas so this was super great for me. I love the side character's romance stories, particularly Jiho and Shi Ah! They are too adorable together!
5. Great Genres/Topics Covered- I love how the drama discusses various topics about marriage and life in general from the very start. The first episode narrated that it would have been a happy ending if the story stopped here, which is true since many dramas end with a happy ending as such. But this drama discusses those problems that happen after marriage and the happy ending. I really loved how the last episode touched on this topic again by showing that Daeyoung and Dajung still get into arguments and hate each other at moments as real couples do in life. I liked that it didn't just end with their wedding but touched that part again. Other topics were Dajung's older married women getting a career and people not trusting/looking down on people without college degrees.
6. Superb Acting Overall- There is a great cast for this drama. It was the first time for me watching the actor playing Ye Jihoon act but he was amazing! His smile is a killer. As for the other roles, though I thought some of the supporting roles were not perfect at acting and seemed a bit stiff delivering their lines, it didn't distract me too much while watching. But it was overall great acting done by everyone.

Things I didn't like:
1. The kiss- the only thing that bothered me somewhat was the three kisses that Dajung and Wooyoung had in the drama. It felt kinda weird even though it shouldn't be since Wooyoung is Daeyoung and her husband.

Nothing else to mention besides that. I JUST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO CHECK THIS DRAMA OUT!

A great drama!
At first when I watched this, it was back in September where I procrastinated and didn't pay attention in school. This was a great drama. I feel like the adaptation was better than the original and it always found a way to keep you hooked onto the plot. When I watched, I instantly fell in love with all the male cast. At first I watched this for Lee Do-hyun because of his role in Hotel Del Luna but I started to fall for Hwang In Yeop. His character really stood out and can really show how it relates to the real world and Im so happy I got to see his character grow and adapt. Sadly he doesn't get the girl :(

AMAZING SOUNDTRACK! ,, complete touching story
touching and amazing soundtrack!

a very light and touching family,comedy ,little fantasy story,,

Acting fron each actor is very deep and gets feelings, especially the young cast Hong Daeyoung ,, LEE DO HYUN, when he as a young father his feeling toward his childs touching me

role selection ,, although I didn't like the roles as their adult, but it cannot be denied that they chose roles with similar faces
-young hongdaeyoung, old hong daeyoung and his son
-young choi il woo and old choi il woo
-young go deokjin -old godeokjin


Very complete story structures!
at first there were a lot of flashbacks, but what was amazing was the way they edited them, it's been a long time since I appreciated the way the drama edits ,,,, quite complicated because many little scene flashbacks , they show them half and half, but reappear in other episodes, and until the end of all episodes full flashback is displayed again,, I found not many mistakes, from the beginning of the story there were not many oddities


BUT,, actually I also hope that their children know that Go Wooyoung is their father,,, and hope when younghongdaeyoung together with dajung can remember the young dajung, not just showing the old hongdaeyoung ,,,, and I was also curious about what WOOYOUNG write as his future goals but there was no such scene



although sometimes there is 1 story in 1 episode that keeps on repeating and sometimes make me dizzy and confused,, like
ep5 when divorced trial

And ep 8, some scene just being telling not showing, like dajung said she call basketball tim's father before

Ep10 flashback about hong daeyoung accident and Go Woo Young too, wear the same clothes too make me confuse, but telling at the next next episode what happen



and there are some stories like nothing,,

about Chu ae rin who blurted out to Choi Il Woo about Hongdaeyoung,,,but not discussed again, instead discussed about ownership

And the last eps when hongdaeyoung SUDDENLY changed back to the normal face,, too pushy

Beautiful Family Drama
I knew it was a remake of 17 Again starring Zac Ephron but I wasn't sure what to expect since the movie was adapted into a series. I wondered how they will spin the story into a 16-episode series. It turned out so well. The usual family dynamics was shown. There was conflict and making up. I love how the emphasis on communication was shown. It became a little dragging in the middle (or maybe it was just me who couldn't wait to know the ending) but overall, I think this is a wonderful series. (P.S. I wonder if South Koreans really view divorced women as harsh as they depicted it here?)

An Absolute Beautifull Drama!
Let me first say that this drama is absolutely Fantastic and i would like to thank the actors for giving me an ultimate joy and sadness troughout the whole show.
From the first episode all the way to the end i enjoyed the show.Regardless of the few flaws that every drama has this is definately a drama you must see and will enjoy.Im sure

I wanna keep praising the show but there are also things that i wish that would had not been there.I think if the show was 12 episodes it would had been enough already.I feel they dragged it a little out.I really appreciated the sub story with deok jin and ms ok as anime fans.Gave me a little break from the heavy main actors and made me laugh.
Also i understood that Hong Dae Young wanted to be with his family but since he had the gift of being young again why couldnt they just ignore everything be together and let Hong Dae Young enjoy his basketball career together with his Son for the sake of it.The anchorwoman got her dream in the end.I feel like he got pressured into either not being together or get back together being older.I dont understood the whole dramatic part why she had to break up with him to give his dream to him.Why not both ?I mean she had also a chance to sleep and cuddle with her younger version husband..HELLO TAKE ADVANTAGE HAHA.

All that said...it was a fantastic drama and i could barely stop thinkin about what if and what after i finished the drama and the feelings are still lingering inside me.I would definately not forget this drama for a long time and i advice everyone to watch this.

Overall pretty good
I liked it but it wasn't my favorite

The story was interesting and the actors were great. The drama could've been few episodes shorter. The main plot was good but I feel like there were too much going on. Such unnecessary subplots like the cameraman and Hong Daeyoung's connection to Jihoon's brother. They really didn't go anywhere nor did they bring anything essential to the drama.

I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't disappointed to the ending. The ending was way too predictable, which made the last episodes a little boring. Also the last episodes were too cliché, which is why I ended up skipping through the last episode. I was really ready to throw hands when Daeyoung transformed into his old self. Of course I get that the story is about Daeyoung regretting his life choices, living his 18-year old life again and then realizing how happy his ""real"" life actually was and in the end regretting becoming 18 again.

Overall a good drama. Interesting story, not too cliché, except for the ending. The actors were great for their roles. Especially Dohyun nailed his role as Daeyoung. He really made the character very realistic, natural and believable. I personally would've liked a little different execution, which is why I'm probably not going to rewatch. At least anytime soon.

I've had this drama on my list for a while to watch but honestly avoided watching. I didn't really like the American version of this (the one with Zac Efron), so I was worried how this would. But I was so wrong to leave it there until now!

As with most things Kdrama remakes are more often than not 1000 times better than the other versions made. There was an opportunity for a second chance, hard-working mum, troubled kids and not to forget the romance! From the very beginning, this storyline had me hooked. It touched on a lot of topics like divorce, career struggles, bullying and more, which is why I think this had a lot more impact and gave the chance for this drama to have some really heartwarming moments.

Here are just some more reasons as to why I really enjoyed this drama:
1. The cast was great and they really helped bring this drama to life!
2. There were quite a few twists and turns that I didn't expect coming that really added to the story
3. Glimpses into the future (any more would be a spoiler)
4. Watching Hong Dae Young's relationships with his kids was really the highlight of the drama for me. It was really great to watch both sides of him (old and young) develop and see how his perspective on his children changed the more he got to know them. It was really emotional and left me feeling teary-eyed on occasion.
5. This drama had some really intense moments that drew you in, but I really liked how it was balanced with some well-timed comedy. In particular, there were many scenes with Go Deok Jin made me laugh sooo much!

This is a great drama and if it's not on your list to watch I would highly recommend giving it a go!

The is the only thing I never really got/didn't like and that was how Dae Young was never recognised by his kids even when he enrolled in their school? But you will have to make your own mind up if that annoyed you as much as it did me!

WORTH. EVERY. SECOND.
this drama has a perfect combination of romance, friendship, family and love generally. i can’t say it enough cause this drama is really really THAT GOOD. the casts did a very good job and i can really feel the emotions that they were trying to portray. this drama makes you think about life, like how you should be grateful to the people around you and it’s because they’re always around you, that you fail to notice that they’re the ones who really makes your life the way it is right now; happiness and full of laughter.

but the part that really hit me was the relationships between the father and his two kids. overall, i think the whole story is very realistic and you can relate with it. imagine if you could be young again, and being the same age as your kids, to finally understand what was going on in their heads. because there are a lot of people who as a teen, doesn’t really tell their problems to their parents, and maybe thats why i find this drama so relatable. and id imagine myself being in the shoes of the parents. what would i feel if my kids were like this too, right? also, the love relationship between them was also very cute and mature and i reaaally really like the way this drama really emphasize that communication, really is the key to any relationship in order to make it work.

all in all, id highly recommend this drama. its so beautiful ❤️

a MUST-WATCH wholesome drama
"" On rainy days, people can measure how big their love is. Even when they share umbrellas, as everyone holds them at different angles, it’s clearly visible how big their love is.""

I absolutely loved this quote from the drama alongside many other inspiring ones. this drama started off being really funny when the father became a 18 year old student because of the generation gap. However, this drama took a turn and became really emotional as the family finds out the importance of one another only when it was too late. The writing was done beautifully and the pace of each episode was right. I was especially impressed with Lee Do Hyun's acting as a father, student and a husband, its almost impossible to not fall for him after watching this.

18 Again - Heart-Warming Drama!
I loved 18 Again! It was a bit heartbreaking at first but soon changed to be a major heart-warming drama for me. It had also some sad, yet cute/funny moments; which I absolutely enjoyed. All in all, it was a great ride, with brilliant actors and amazing chemistry (especially with the presence of a huge age gap)! I think you will not regret watching this. I cried at some points when the main character got to the point of not being able to go back to normal. I'm personally a fan of age gap dramas since there's more tension going on between families and characters but I was delighted to see scenes that had chemistry in them yet kept their boundaries because of the age gap (though they've kissed multiple times rip). Again, you should really watch this drama! It was fun and emotional to watch. :)

One of the best drama of the year. I wonder how this particular Channel makes some dramas that feel so real. Hats off to jtbc once again for bringing an excellent drama. The plot wise its similar to an English movie names 17 again but i haven't watched that yet so i don't know the comparison level but all i can say that this drama has so many slice of life situations which was something really unique.

From the first episode to the end this drama gives you a realistic life journey through some relatable characters with a beautiful narration. If life gives you a another opportunity the things regretted to you and you want to correct your mistakes that made you regret this drama is all about that. The whole story point out only one thing at the end of everything that ""no matter how hard your life goes, never forget that made you smile""

Performance of all the actors was outstanding. Especially Lee Do hyun who done the younger version character of hong dae young. Also a factor that i found particularly interesting was the way they manged all the Episodes ending with an amazing epilogue which gives you a certain clarity of that family or those characters, all those references were outstanding. Overall this drama has so many things to say till the end, if you are a fan of healing or realistic dramas just give it a try.

Had me crying
This is my first review on MDL after watching 200+ dramas so sorry if this is short and awkward.

This drama had me hooked all the way through and I binged it within 3 days.
18 again definitely ranks in the top 10 dramas I've watched in terms of ability to captivate my attention.

The family dynamic and the hidden/unspoken feelings of the characters for each other reminded me of my own parents and everything they've sacrificed for me and my brother.
The script and acting made each and every emotion vividly clear and had be bawling at multiple points.

I also loved Lee Haneul and all of the acting in this drama was spectacular.

Watch it and don't regret
This drama is one of the best in 2020. The fact that the characters grow from every step they take as their desicions reflects wheter they regret it or not. I give this 9 out of 10 because Ji ho the baseball pitcher didn't get the most happy ending even tho he is happy and lastly I like Go Ja sung's character development manifesting Seojun's figure like (TRUE BEAUTY) , im just sad that i need season 2 just kidding hahahahahhaha anyways i hope you to watch it and have no regrets. Shi-a and Shi-woo's character development is also the best because they started like they were deppressed but in the course of series they are changing HAHAHA basta panoorin nyo worth it

DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE K-DRAMAS
UNIQUE FEATURE: What I liked about this drama is it emphasizes on family relationships which most of the kdramas miss out ACTING: The boy who acts as 18 y/o hong dae young did a spectacular job even though he's playing a young role you can feel his fatherhood making us think it's real OST: I think that ost's play an important role in making us like a drama and the ost of the drama did so (THE ONLY ONE is my fav ost give it a try) BINGE WATCH: Binge watching it with your family it makes it even more special

IN CONCLUSION THIS DRAMA IS A MUST WATCH!!!

18 again is loosely based on the 2009’s Hollywood movie 17 again starring Zac Efron as the main protagonists. Obviously kdrama has its own formula of incorporating their own nitty-gritty and they did that commendably well. At first I had no idea this drama has some underlying messages upon touching some sensitive issues. The story somewhat lies within the range of being mawkish to being phlegmatic with abrupt slew of risibility every now and then generating a necessary lighter mood. As a result a nice balance was created; neither allowed viewers to get not too emotionally carried away nor get swayed away with silly comic relief.

Metaphorically, some concurrent/pressing societal yet universal issues were sublimely portrayed which I would like to list down in the following:

1. Divorce rates are at rise in SK as per some authentic statistics whereas the marriage rate is decreasing every year. Through this drama it is expressed several times that life might get extremely difficult still divorce should not be the immediate reaction for a couple to break up rather both the person must respect each other’s space. Best is to talk it out and solve the issues at hand with patience and perseverance. None of the humans are perfect and both the spouse goes through some kind of hardships which they refrain from sharing from each other rather resort to superficial expectation or keep on grousing at each other making the relationship derailed and the problems irresolute.

2. Teen pregnancy is also at rise in SK. Adoption rate of these children are the highest in the world. Most teen parents (especially woman) abort the child due to heavy social stigma against single unwed mothers and also due to lack of support from the biological father. Subtly 18 again shows, mistake or whatever if you have the sensibility to satisfy your whimsical hormonal need then you must also be prepared to take full responsibility of the human(s) you’re bringing into this world. It would be excruciating to nurture but giving up should not be a viable option.

3. Respect towards in-laws. Often times it is seen that both the spouses are just sufficiently good to their in-laws on their face. There is always lack of ingenuity. However, taking care of the in-laws to the utmost and taking care of some of their basic needs is a candor habit many lacks. Just because they are aging doesn’t necessarily mean they need to be disposed or neglected.

4. Stereotypes about working mother, discrimination against women, sexual harassment, starting job at a later age and so on. All these female related issues are wonderfully portrayed and how women with utmost grit tolerate all these. Hurdles are numerous yet they manage to reach success if have confidence and hardheadedness. Empowering oneself no matter how much dirt are being thrown at and holding up one’s head high during adversities is also one of the hidden messages of this drama. Nonetheless, relentless support from the partner also makes a huge difference in boosting up a woman’s self-esteem has also been highlighted.

5. Empowering a girl child. Although the couple has twin children (one son and one daughter), mostly the daughter’s adoration, care and struggles are mostly emphasized for a reason.

6. Importance of martial arts for women. With abnormal hike on violence against women worldwide, undeniably martial arts are imperative for any women at least at a minimum. Both the mother and daughter in this drama are capable of applying few tactics during some unexpected events.

7. Workplace harassment. Nepotism, favouritism and cronyism are practiced intensely in high power distance countries like SK, where many becomes frustrated affecting their personal, social and familial life. Deserving candidates are always overlooked or are not given chance to show their true potential or are harshly treated by their higher-ups. The male protagonist of this drama has been unprecedentedly belittled by his higher up which in turn made his life completely upside down, only earned him disdain from his own family members due to their misunderstandings. Hence one issue could branch out to create several severe issues in a person’s life.

Last but not the least the epilogues stole my heart away, especially the one which says that there is no room for regret for life choices, if you regret that’s the end but if we take all the experiences as a learning process then every lesson will open a new phase in life; a new beginning will take place.

About the performances of the casts, Lee Do Hyun overshadowed everyone with his unflawed natural acting skills. What a superbly matured acting at such a young age. No wonder just after playing a supporting role in Hotel Del Luna, he landed up in a main role in a high profile drama like 18 again. His expressions, emotional portrayal, gesture, posture, looks, stares all are sufficiently perfect for the role. He might win few awards this year without a doubt.

Most importantly, the nine OSTs are the nine gems of this drama. Oh my my my each and every songs captured the right mood and set another mood which may be the scenes itself should not have done. So much feelings and emotions oozed out from every song. Especially, whenever, I listen to “Hello” and “Somebody” tears automatically rolls down, takes me back to which world or which era I can’t comprehend. They are simply magically to say it the least.

I really loved this drama a lot due to its tasteful balance of entertainment with some serious issues which was completely unexpected. Although I found the last episode bit cheesy but underlying points I mentioned above were the main reasons I have rated it 8.5.
It is overall an excellent watch.

Such a heart-warming story
I really enjoyed this drama. The story is very well written. There are some little inconsistency like, his daughter's boyfriend finding out while watching an old video of him but his kids never even questioned it when they must have seen more old pictures of him than the boyfriend, but those inconsistency are very minor and doesn't affect the viewing experience. It's more about some little stuff you realiser after watching it. Honestly i was expecting way more stuff to not make sense considering he kept the same appearance.

The actors do such a good job, especially the main three actors, they are fantastic. Even the supporting cast does a great job !

The kids story was also very touching and seeing it progress made me very happy.

I will keep it SPOILERS FREE for the first half, and then unleash the rant. I have complaints. I had hopes… and they were crushed.

The first few episodes made me so happy. I was in heaven with the cute and fun interactions between the characters. The romance was sweet and down to earth. Jung Ha was able to fight for her rights, Hye Joon stayed true to his morals and Hae Hyo was on the way to cross the villain line. And then… nothing happened.

There are quite a few plot lines here; basically every character gets one (Ha Myung Hee must be Oprah wannabe or something), but none is truly explored nor well established. At first, this messy and unbalanced way of directing and editing seemed charming to me. Life is messy and unbalanced you know. I liked how some important plot lines were not explained right away, but, for example, we got a whole scene of the female and male leads discussing how one should apply hand cream. It worked coz I was sure the plot lines will be slowly addressed as the drama progresses… Sadlyl, they weren’t.

All the characters were rather poorly written, though had great potential to be amazing. Hye Joon is boringly perfect and everything works out for him. Jung Ha has a great 180 closer to the end of the show, Hae Hyo was truly useless plot wise. All the supporting characters were there filling the space, but their motivations were never explained. Why do they do what they do? Who knows?

It had its moments. Park Bo Gum crying? A+. Well, that would be it.

⌧ So now, let’s drop some SPOILERS! ⌧

How did the relationship between Jung Ha and Hye Joon go from perfect communication and understanding each other, to never communicating what they truly want and feel and making all the decisions on their own? We had so many dramatic plot lines that could bring the tension in the last episodes, why add new bullshit one?

Why introduce Ahn Jung Ha’s mom into the picture when this story was never truly explained nor explored? She just shows up to give Jung Ha an excuse to be sad and cry, and then she is gone. They ONCE mentioned how Jung Ha has problems accepting help because of her mom, but it was never mentioned again, it has no meaning in the story itself.

Why did they never do anything with Won Hae Hyo? He was neither good, nor bad nor gray. He was just kind of there. How interesting would it be to actually see more of his internal struggle between being a loyal friend and disappointed actor?

Why give us a side romance between Jin Woo and Hae Na? Probably the most useless plot line in the whole show. This could let us explore more of the controlling behavior of Kim Yi Young or be another burden for Hae Hyo: one friend “stealing” his spotlight, and the other dating his little sister and hiding it, pushing him into “I have no one I can trust” state of mind and explaining his feelings for Jung Ha, who was always honest with him.

Why did they never truly use the Charlie story? It was always somewhere in the background, but at the end it had no lasting consequences on the characters at all. When dating make up artist affected Hye Joon more than having a famous designer as his gay sugar daddy? Where is the logic? Why even add the story when it was never important to anyone?

Kim Su Man was painfully dumb.

The ""2년 후"" aka the boring ending.

That’s it. Not really. But I have no strength left to write more. Damn… this could have been such a good show.

A “ Record” Of A Waste Of Time....

Despite its fresh appeal with Bo Gum with a suave pre- Military haircut and So-Dam’s brilliance as a witty makeup artist, the drama was simply lacklustre . Although the drama did obviously touch upon the problems of relationships ( familial and romantic) as well as career choices for our young protagonists, Record of Youth simply reduced most of the characters to nothing more than plot devices throughout the drama.

On one note of appraisal , Bo- Gum was (,as usual,)brilliant within channeling the soul of his character, Hye-Jun. Playing an “underdog” model and aspiring actor, Park Bo Gum did seem to truly step into fleshing out a character , who was rawly undercooked in depth and characterisation by the scriptwriters through his ability to portray the raw emotion of Hye- Jun throughout the drama.

Sadly, however, the scriptwriters didn’t give any justice towards Bo-Gum’s character, Hye- Jun.

This was defined by one fatal mistake by the scriptwriters’ focus upon Hye- Jun as a plot device in regards to his his relationship with Jeong- Ha, meaning that any characterisation that viewers see throughout the drama for Hye-Jun, is severely underdeveloped by the ending of the show.

The most notable example towards this problem, had to be from his sudden “ anger” to “ apathy” around his father and brother and of course his shared love for his mother and grandfather . Whilst his initial feelings towards his father and brother in the beginning of the show was understandable, it was a strange leap in Hye- Jun character to suddenly go from being incredibly infuriated at times by his father and brother, to simply “ not caring” and remaining “ cool- headed”. This would have been understandable if we’d actually see Hye- Jun progress with the plot, but instead, any emotional capacity he possessed as a character is simply thrown away by the near ending of the show. In particular, this is also portrayed by his attitude to Jeong- Ja and his careless decisions within their relationship.

This of course moves us onto So- Dam as Jeong- Ha, a witty makeup artist with her own dreams to become a beauty influencer. Parallel to Bo-Gun’s acting, So- Dam was brilliant within capturing the comical and heart driven moments of her character and therefore there is no denying that Jeong-Ha seemed to be more developed as a character upon some grounds that Hye- Jun.

This also includes the ability towards viewers actually learning why Jeong- Ha aspired to be a makeup artist from her father, something which we never really learn in depth as to why Hye- Jun wanted to be an actor apart from the fact that “ he wanted to do it for a long time”. Additionally, it was refreshing also to come across a level- headed female lead who isn’t ditsy in a relationship, or starts a screaming match with her enemies, but approaches things in a calm , succinct and realistic manner as an intelligent and reasonable individual .( Such as being professional whilst dealing with a senior makeup artist determined to make her life hell.)

Despite her strengths, sadly Jeong- Ha’s greatest flaws from the scriptwriters probably did also come from making Jeong- Ha sometimes a little too “level- headed” than for her own good. Whilst this did naturally add to the “ drama” of the show, it was just as bad for other reasons that Jeong- Ha did not speak out or communicate with Hye- Jun about her feelings or respected boundaries within their relationship. Her attitude towards encouraging and growing closer to Hye- Jun’s best friend Won Hae-hyo ( Byeon Woo- Seok) , was understandable due to her anger towards Hye- Jun, but it seemed both unfair and unkind (regardless of her excuses )towards leading Hae- Hyo on in such a manner. By the ending of the show, a lot of Jeong- Ha’s strengths were sadly greatly overshadowed by her decisions as a consequence.

Ironically, whilst normally I wouldn’t comment upon the reasons of a second Male for chasing after the female lead in such a cliche manner , Woo Seok’s portrayal of Hae- Hyo as a Male lead who has had everything handed to him on a silver plate by his mother, Kim Yi-young ( Shin Ae- Ra), did add some understanding as to why Jeong- Ha became such a figure of interest for him.

One of the biggest emotional trials which Woo Seok comes to grasp with in the show, is realising simply how overbearing his loving mother truly is within controlling every aspect of his life ( including his career) and his sister’s ( a part of freedom which manifests within his sister dating another one of his best friends).

With the fact that his best friend , Hye- Jun, has had the freedom to chase his own dreams and aspire to do acting on his own part, the aspiration of chasing after his best friend’s girl did add the note of a cliche. On the other hand, this understanding towards why Woo- Seok was intrigued by Jeong- Ha, wasn’t left blank for viewers by the scriptwriters. This was simply because Woo Seok wanted control over a relationship. This of course , did add
some explanation and depth to his decisions, but it was overly cliche and stepped across several boundaries of disrespect for both Hye- Jun as a friend and of course Jeong- Ha within the drama as nothing more than an object for both Hye- Jun and Woo- Seok to use.

Whilst of course the drama did delve into some additional “ youth issues” (including a minor plot line of homosexuality,which was only brushed upon for the plot to advance), the drama really didn’t add enough depth or even covered the universal issues as a youth drama. Although we must bear into respect Korean culture and “ sensitive topics”, it was still too glossed over not to come across a youth drama which tackles issues such as drinking , partying, or even smoking , especially with the younger characters’ ages. This is not to glorify these acts in any manner, but, these are issues which realistically, most youths tackle fairly universally ( especially in Korea). For a drama to not even mildly suggest these youths have never done such an act, seemed more of a commentary upon appeasing younger audiences to “ not do this in real life” , than to learn about the real world for youths.

In addition to that his, there was of course the glossed over image of the fashion and makeup industry as well. Whilst naturally the drama did delve into the problems of “ scandals” for Korean celebrities and of course blackmail, these issues became overly repetitive. This of course is an issue which tackles many celebrities on a daily basis in a Korea, but did we really need to have this screamed at us by Hye- Jun’s manager Lee Min Jae ( Shin Dong Mi) for several episodes without thinking to tell Hye- Jun to be more cautious? Probably, not.

In reality, there was little actually exposed about the severity of other issues in these respected industries ( especially fashion ). It’s understandable that the drama didn’t want to delve into this too much in in order to focus on the relationship of Jeong Ha and Hye Jun, but, there was still a lot of exposed ground which the drama could’ve covered on even briefly. Not least, the actual problems for young models upon eating disorders, smoking , diets and of course especially, for young makeup artists, revenue and exploitation as well. For a drama not to even cover upon the issues in addition to poor characterisation, left Record of Youth as a forgettable and cliche show which did not tread any new ground upon Korean dramas.

Let's talk about the plot. For me, I like the topic about trying to achieve one's dream but having so many hurdles in front of you that a lot of times, you just want to give up. I sensed that in the first half of this drama. I felt the hardship. Being ripped off, being seen from others as a no potential, having others stepping on you like your worthless because of your status. At the same time, we see two sides of family impact as well, barely any support and too much support to where they are controlling and you don't know how to adapt to reality. Some people may find these kind of issues in a drama boring but I liked the realness of it and I could sense it. I would've been fine with this drama had the whole drama revolved around this, focusing on the family relationship issues and the relationship hurdles when becoming a celeb now.
But here's where it went wrong. The writer lost a sense of direction in the second half of this drama. Past ep 8 is pretty much worthless to me. They added conflicts that, in my opinion, weren't needed. I think they were trying to add the reality of scandals occurring in a celebrity's life but I just didn't see a purpose for this relating to the initial plot. The annoying reporter and the stupid old manager who cheated on Hye Joon's success and growth were a real pain that ruined the 2nd half of this drama. To be honest, the last few episodes weren't handled well. The last episode may solve a few things but in honesty, a lot of episodes wasted.

Character wise, they have a few strong moments but it's really forgettable due to the overall character of the leads being pretty bland.

Music wise, this drama has some great OSTs. It's just that it wasn't played much as I would've liked to hear.

Definitely not worth a rewatch after seeing the direction the writer decided to go with this. Had the potential to be a good drama for me but failed miserably.

The Title is What the Story is About
Like the title, this show is pretty much a record of a youth story.
Why would I say that? Because it is really like a video clip that records some ordinary life story that tells a person who had hardships while pursuing his dream, how he overcome it, how he fall in love, maintain friendships, deal with family conflicts. Even the love story between two main leads are very very realistic. It isn't the normal ""love drama"" where two people have to go through a lot of misunderstanding, realising they fall in love and go through tragic fates. NO, this show doesn't have any of these, they meet, feel great towards each other and just eventually get together. The way they are dating is so realistic like what a normal dating couple will do. Even to the end, the story between the couple is quite realistic too.

Hence, to be objective, this story is quite boring. The whole series has no climax and I was actually going to drop it but I wasn't watching much show so I decided to go on. So you shouldn't be having high expectation on this, but if you just enjoy watching Park Bo Gum or Park So Dam, then go ahead and watch it. Basically it is like a documentary of someone's life, but a very ordinary one.

Well, not to mention, Park Bo Gum's acting is as good as always:) Even a small detailed expression or action, he portrays it real good, I'm impressed! Good luck for PBG's enlistment and hope he stay safe and get good drama when he's out! :)

Contrary to all the dislikes and low ratings this drama got, it actually won my heart. What I love about are some wonderful messages ROY left for the youth of this generation. Although clichéd but among so many horrible things happening all around and when many youths are lost in negativities, many are struggling towards unknown journey, suffering from mental health issues, this sort of drama is really focusing and screaming at the youth in its top pitch to take everything easily. Truly the rough patches become smooth one day and you are the sole owner to take control over your emotions and the boom and trough of life.

The drama basically depicted the cluelessness and lost feelings during the twenties and gradually becoming more matured and composed while entering thirties. It is very practical, rational and logical. Nothing what was showed was unrealistic. Inevitably to exist in any sector is quite grappling more so in the entertainment industry. Our lead protagonists, facing various odds and adversities, tried to make their own names in the industry, making honesty, diligence, modesty, humanity and truthfulness their sole weapons. Pragmatically they tried to hold on to their dreams no matter what storms swept their steadfastness, persistence and self confidence. Realistically speaking that’s how it should be. Sometimes it is difficult to always remain hard-headed, afterall we all are human. The characters' vulnerability has been shown as well. At night, during their lone time, they bawled their eyes out when nothing seems their way. Nobody can deny we have never done it many a times.

Secondly Korean dramas are always one of the best to show some practical family issues. All the issues presented with each young person’s parents are undeniably genuine. I could relate to every single of the issues, either I face some or I have seen other people facing the same problems with their parents. Despite the fact they sometimes become the terrible judge of our lives or want everything to be perfect, at the end they are ones who by default stand by us and want the best for us. Every single aspect of the familial issues shown irrespective of rich, middle or poor class families are undoubtedly most credible.

Thirdly, the romance aspect between the leads is what can be normally seen in the entertainment industry. Often times the couples part their ways due to ridiculously overbearing work schedule; work comes first before romance. Deliriousness overpowers between choosing romance and work as both are imperative for existence. Also hackneyed topic but romance between people from completely different social strata is truly sort of impossible which is portrayed by another couple.

Moreover, another point is also worth mentioning which has gone a little unnoticed is the fact that age does not matter if anyone has the motivation and will power to commence something. The grandfather of this drama took initiative to do something for himself though much later but he never despair for his old age. This also gives an appropriate message to the elderly (in fact to all ages)- ""better late than never"", a person can do anything if they set their mind into it and should utilize their time in a best possible way before they die.

What should I say about the acting of the casts? They all made me cry, laugh, happy, sad and irritate all at the same time. One of the best ensemble casts selected who made their own individual character extremely convincing. Additionally, the main leads dialogues are full of eloquence, it has smooth texture which is unbeatable. Both of the protagonists have the best lines to say in any given situations resulting into breaking any sort of monotony one might develop while watching this drama. Admittedly, I have full admirations for such intelligently written dialogues. The soundtracks are also one of the best portraying the right kind of feel during many scenes.

This is overall an excellent drama to say the least I could relate to about youth, friendship, romance, familial chaos and unity, workplace scuffle and constant fight to better oneself. Yes it could have been better but I understand the writers did not want anything flashy to make it unrealistic. I thoroughly enjoyed more than sixteen hours of my wonderful journey.

I don't understand why the rating is so low
First of all, I almost gave up of starting this drama because I thought it would be a mess since all the reviews are a bit negative. I was surprised. The story is a lot cute, there's the romance, the friendship, the visuals. I missed an OST more powerfull but that's all. The drama is refreshing, and it has a good story, the characters development it is really good, and now I ill point why I think this.
Hye Jun - It is a character who puts a lot of effort in everything he does, if it is his dream, his relationship, his friendships. His relationship with his grandpa is something that worth watch and we can understand through the episodes how he was capable of maintaining his image even after all the scandals people tried to envolve him, it was all because he's really a good person, considerate, someone who values the people around him more than status. His relationship with his dad is a bit problematic but I thought it was enjoyable in the drama too because that's life, who of us never had any misunderstandings on our own families?
Let's talk about Jung Ah, she's someone who suffered a lot because of her mom, she felt abandoned most of her life so she thinks it's better to admire and support someone who is far, someone who will not dissapoint her, I completely understand. Many times in our lives we admire singers, athletes, models, people that as far as they are we think they are amazing, because you know, life gets a little complicated when we know people personally. She choosed the right person, and you know (maybe there will be some spoilers here), I think she did right when she decided to end/postpone a relationship to focus on herself and build her own career, sometimes you have to do this, you have to considerate your feelings more before things just end up ruined. So I think it's delighting the way they meet again years later after both stay more mature, more openly to live their love fully, I think the end of the drama shows it to us too, it's not a sad ending, it's like if they are starting again, but this time being complete on their own, as individuals.
Talking about the other characters I think this is just what happens with Jin u and Hae Na (but I have to say that I missed a better ending for them), and Hae Hyo discovering himself besides his mom influence worth to watch too because it's him getting out of his bubble to draw his own path.
Anyway, I think I was rambling a bit but I have to say, it's a good drama and the bad reviews doesn't define it really well, I enjoyed to watch and recommend it to everyone who wants to watch a simple drama that you can watch with family and have a good feeling about the story in the end.

It's not what you think
Don't let the main poster of the drama fool you, this is not a drama about the three young people, it's just about PBG'a character and his family.

The drama actually presented in the first episode what's all about, the story of a young model who persuades his dream of becoming the top actor of Korea which becomes reality, he has various scandals, some families and relationship issues but after 16 episodes he made it. Oh but if you expected to see this drama -like me- because of the actress from the Oscar winning film Parasite, Park So Dam. Well, bad news cause she became successful and achieved her dream in a freaking second where 2 years happened.

The drama is so cliche, I don't even know why dating is a scandal but they dragged the story too much for this, and all the focus on the gay fashion designer, I have seen better treatment of the lgbtq community in Itaewon Class.

A disappointment altogether :(
Ok I have to say that I started this drama with high hopes, I mean, look at the cast (and I'm a huge fan of Park So Dam), but boy do I regret wasting my time on this one.

I was expecting a high paced drama, full of fashion, intrigue and of course, romance. If that's what you are looking for, don't waste your time like me, this drama is dull.

You get a lot, I mean a LOT of family drama vibes with this one, and it's actually cute, but not entertaining enough to cary the whole drama (sometimes you don't care about the main leads family life outside their interactions with the leads) and it's not the premise that brought you in.

The main leads did not have chemistry (their bickering is not sexy or smart, they just look like an old couple that is past their passionate times in their relationship) and that shows, because they are almost never together (and the PDA is scarce).

They completely forgot the FL, I mean, she had passion, a career and dreams and a mysterious background, and all of this kind of get in the backseat and is not properly dealt with.

The storytelling way of the drama is also boring, they kind of introduce you the conclusion of a situation and then spend the hole next episode, retelling EVERY SINGLE UNIMPORTANT DETAIL, instead of glossing over with the juicy bits and moving on with the next plot.

I felt like I was watching a drama with no real plot, and the person presenting the story to me thought I was too dumb to pick up the details without them being overly explained in a very fastidious way. It feels like they tried to put a lot characters and ended up not developing any of them, and that's truly a waste of talented actors.

Well, it was a waste of time (for me) so save yours and go watch something more exciting.

Lack of development and communication of the characters were the major flaws of this drama
Record of Youth debuted with great potential to be an incredible drama. The cast and the story, at first, captivated me a lot, however throughout the episodes I started to have the feeling that the story was not developing. The focus of the drama was the growth of the main characters, both personally and professionally, however the story revolved around only Hye Joon (Park Bogum), the other main characters of the plot were erased and we viewers, practically not we saw their development.

Jung Ha (Park Sodam) when it appeared was poorly developed and all the plots that the story opened for her character to be developed, ended up not gaining much focus and worsened the development of the character. I really wanted to see a little more about the construction of her salon and the solutions to the problems she had with her parents, but unfortunately, almost no screen time was given to her plot, sometimes I had the feeling that her only role in drama was to be the love interest of Hye Joon and Hae Hyo, thus creating a love triangle for the story.

Talking about Hae Hyo (Byeon Woo Seok), he, for me, was always a complex character, since the beginning of the story I wanted to know how he would react when Hye Joon started to be the focus of attention, and the story at that point it surprised me, because it didn’t turn him into the envious character who wants to take down the protagonist, in fact she showed a real character that had reactions that all of us in his place could have, but unfortunately the story didn’t develop much of his character’s story either. end we ended up not seeing his development very well after he found out that his career was practically bought by his mother, i found his end too open and it bothered me that the story didn't show how he was after the time jump.

About Hye Joon's family nucleus: For me this was the nucleus that best developed within this drama. At first I thought his father was extremely toxic, but throughout the episodes I got to understand him a little more and I liked the way he has evolved throughout history. Hye Joon's grandfather was also a great character in this drama, I loved the evolution of his relationship with his son and I admit that I was very moved by their final scene in the drama.

I thought the end of the story was coherent and I preferred to see them become friends a thousand times, their relationship was very beautiful, but from the beginning I thought that they behave more like friends than boyfriends. Their open ending was coherent and it is up to the viewer to think about whether they stayed together or remained friends.

The performances in this drama were very good, but unfortunately the characters and the story prevented the actors from shining even more in their roles. The drama ost is good, but it is forgettable.

An honest spoiler-free viewpoint; Watch the show if you are a Bogum fan
I was anticipating the arrival of this drama and I did have expectations which this drama upheld until its first half.

The idea of showcasing the 'youth' was nowhere followed as the focus was diverted into multiple sub plots which do not end in a neat format and feel pointless as the show ends. They also do not add to the interest of the viewer.
The villains lack motivation and are present just to add distress and unnecessary tension in the male lead, Hye-Jun's life. They frustrated me more than I can say and also made me want to drop the show due to massive amount of screen time they got for creating pointless drama

The poster is very misleading- It is not a drama centering the 3 leads but it primarily focuses on Bogum's Hye-jun. The entire show is focused on the story of his family ( special shoutout to HJ's brother who ended up being one of my motivating factors to continue!) along with Hae Hyo's mother who seems to have more screen time than HH himself. The Female lead, Jeong-ha is barely given enough screen time to be called a lead. The character writing for HJ and JH was extremely poor and they had no development till the end of the drama.

The one character that garnered my interest was Hae Hyo. I was keen on knowing how his journey unfolds but the poor writing of the plot as a whole does not allow us to see his character grow or for us to see how his journey finally concludes.

This was my first drama by Bogum and so I was excited to see him in action and I will go forward to say that he did not disappoint. Park So Dam was great in the acting department as expected but the surprise package for me was Byeon Woo Seok. The entire cast acted really well and that was one of the sole reasons i kept going.

The OST of the drama was excellent and if the writing of the show was better it could have elevated the drama even more.

To conclude, the drama has a strong start but loses its essence in the middle and goes downhill from there. If you are a fan of Park Bogum I would recommend watching the show as he is the primary focus of it and does his best with the little that he has.

One sentence review
Record of youth = How you felt with game of throne series!
Writing more because MDL did not allow me to post only the above sentence.
Please feel free to ignore the below sentences haha

Starts off great and half way through you are thinking what the hell, why are they doing this and then at the end you will feel like why did they waste such beautiful cast on such crappy writing.
I was so excited and looking forward to this series and in the beginning I couldn't wait for the next episode and was cursing myself as to why I started watching on-air series (which I never do). Mid-way I was like okay, there are so many different directions this show can go so I was hopefully that show might redeem but then yeah.. IT DID NOT

I don’t get why it’s getting too much hate. Maybe not for all.
If you’re looking for an overhyped drama where newbie fans end up disappointed because it doesn’t contain your usual cliches (fighting over females, cinderella leads, etc), this one isn’t for you.

I tried to analyze why it’s getting a lot of hate, and I can only come up with 2 probable reasons - the pace and the ending. If you’re into fast paced dramas with happy predictable endings, skip this.

However, if you enjoy slice of life dramas while watching real character growth, characters who are actually relatable and mature romance, I highly recommend you watch this.

Things I love:

- I totally related to this story. Being a 27 yr old who still feels lost with my chosen career path, seeing the characters in this drama go through the same thing totally gave me a great comfort. The pressures Bogum’s character got from his parents for his career choice, wow, I’m sure a lot of us relate to this at some point. I totally felt for his character every time he argued with his dad, and every single time he started to doubt his own choices. I guess I wasn’t alone.

- The romance was very sweet and raw. I love how they were both mature enough in handling some of their problems as a couple, and I love how everything was realistic (no parents throwing money to undesired partners, no chaebol - cinderella, etc). These were two people who were struggling in life and found solace in each other’s presence. I loved how ordinary everything was about them. The only thing I didn’t understand was the break up. The slow fall out due to the ML’s stardom was understandable, but the female’s reasons for her decision felt too sudden and unexplained. Other than that, i liked how raw this couple was.

- The “second lead” who never stole the girl and destroyed his friendship with the ML. I appreciated how this character also showed depth, and I enjoyed watching his struggles with overbearing tiger parents.

- A glimpse of life behind the spotlight. This drama taught me a lot of things about the lifestyle of famous people in korean’s entertainment industry (like not to instantly believe articles about our favorite artists because a lot of them may be fake news). It was truly a treat to someone who’s such a fan of the entertainment industry.

There’s still a lot of things I love - acting, OST, the writing and the metaphors used, cinematography, the use of social media to as a record of one’s youth... too many. This drama really deserves more love from people who believe in stories that are more real.

IMO - The biggest disappointment in this year!
This series had everything going for it: good cast (both main and supporting), good story background (struggle in show biz), good music (some good singers lined up for OST) but alas it was not enough to keep this series from sinking.

The show started out great! The first few episodes or rather the first half was good but the writing and direction really messed up the second half. I loved the characters of both male leads but the character of the female lead was just bad - of all the characters in the show, I disliked her the most. The acting was good but the characters that were written for these actors were poorly written.

The show had multiple plotlines in the first half and they were interesting but none of these were taken to the logical conclusion. None of the plotlines is truly explored. Why would someone want to watch a show where the plots are not concluded properly? The struggles of actors from poor backgrounds, the impact of cyberbullies on actors' lives, a possible one-sided love, parents overly involved in their kids' lives (and using money), were some of the interesting plots but god these plots were messed up big time.

The second half added atleast 1 more interesting storyline but it was just left hanging. On top of that, they add unnecessary and boring characters. The last few episodes were painful to watch. I mean the last 4 episodes, I was just fast-forwarding half the time and finishing the episodes asap just to complete the show - seriously a lot of waste episodes.

The only plus points: Music and some good acting from male leads and their families.

Bottonmine: DO NOT WATCH AND WASTE YOUR TIME! I have not included any spoilers in my review but even if you skip this show you will not miss anything. I will not recommend anyone to watch this show.

This one was one of my most expected dramas of the year and it disappointed me week by week to a point where I started to feel ANGRY whenever it was monday and I HAD to watch it because I already made it that far (and also because I was watching with friends). The #1 reason why it frustrates so much lies on the “potential” factor.

(And before I start this review properly let me address that I do like slow-burn, slice-of-life, nothing-ever-happens dramas and it's really not the case here because some things do happen here, they are just poorly executed.)

Now, ROY.
The first episodes are actually quite alright, I would say. They do make a good job of introducing the world and the characters and the way everything is connected. But here is the catch: It doesn't go far from that. Specially considering, like I said, things do happen a lot in this drama, but in the most frustrating way possible: OFF-SCREEN. In a similar note, time in this drama is used in the most bizarre way possible too, whenever something big happens they will just jump a few days, weeks, months, years without going into any trouble of revealing that to you, the viewer. You'll sometimes realize things like “So that couple is dating for over a year? But it seems like two weeks has passed at most??? How and when did that happen??” and the answer will always be flashbacks.

Not your usual, logical, quick flashbacks but the craziest and longest flashbacks you could ever imagine. Every episode ends in a cliffhanger but the next one starts in a few [days, weeks, years, who knows] before the scene where the previous episode has ended. It even has flashbacks... inside... flashbacks. It's insane.

And..... chemistry. It doesn't have much. And I'm not talking about the main couple, I'm talking about pretty much everyone. This is maybe too personal, but to me, it really felt like there's a lack of warmness between the characters that made me feel so distant from the whole thing.

Acting-wise, this is alright, they're mostly good/great actors, the OSTs were great too, but the story is frustrating and awful to be honest. Every episode feels like a car getting ready to take off in the morning and then randomly stopping before you can take out of the garage because the battery has died. Can't recommend at all.

Fractured Romance and Dysfunctional Friends and Family
Where do I start? I’m not too fond of shows where a best friend tries to take away his friend’s girlfriend, so I struggled with this one. I stopped at episode 12 for about six months. I have about eight shows on pause, so I decided to finish this one.

I would classify this as a family melodrama with a spattering of friendship issues. The story was hard to watch at times. The family was dysfunctional, finally coming together at the end. The three male friends were anything but friends, and portraying them as friends was awkward. There were a few funny moments, but the overpowering part of the story was the devastating attempt at romance. It included Sa Hye Joon’s best friend following his girlfriend around. Was it jealously, or did he think he could take her away? Who knows, but it’s the worst kind of betrayal, and it doesn’t look any better on screen than it does in real life. His girlfriend, Ahn Jung Ha, who supposedly has it all together, can’t seem to catch on? She calls his best friend late at night in the rain for a ride. He comes in when he drops her off. That should tell her what kind of guy he is. The fact that she invited him in is crossing the line. It goes on and on with him spending more time with her than her boyfriend, to the point where you become unsure which one she likes. What happened at those times they were together no one knows. The story makes a point at making you wonder. To do her boyfriend a favor and protect him, she dumps Sa Hye Joon and never looks back. We see a couple of images where she thinks about him, but that’s it. “I love you, let’s break up” is one of the dumbest lines I’ve ever heard. But she got over that ‘I love you’ part in a hurry. Telling him, that’s enough as he tries to follow her into the elevator. In my opinion, he dodged a bullet.

Remember, she went after him in the beginning. Did she think dating a movie star would be easy? His agent trying to restrict his access to his girlfriend fell flat and was unrealistic. Back to the friends. The story takes them to a cum-ba-ya moment on the swing sets. Hae Hyo acting like he never went after his friend’s girlfriend. I cringed when they even talked to each other. In the end, Hye Joon does his military service and returns, meeting Jung Ha at a movie shoot. At this point, I would have walked right by her. That would have been a better ending. She dumped him when he needed her the most. Doesn’t he remember this? In fact, she destroyed him. Who forgets that? The one minute at the end of the show did nothing to change that image of Jung Ha. Bouncing off down a path talking smack to each other was just not believable; if she dumped him once, she’d do it again. Just walk away. You can’t trust her.

Even though I didn’t like the story, the acting was good. Park Bo Gum and Park So Dam are two of my favorite actors, and they didn’t disappoint me. In fact, I watched this disaster of a show because of them. At least half if not more of this show was an attempt at some sort of weird romance. I can’t believe this was the best the writers could do. The story took you places that were just strange, leaving the romance part a trainwreck. Truthfully, I wouldn’t recommend watching this series.

Talent wasted on a mediocre script
Park So Dam - she has a great voice. I loved her in Cinderella and the Four Knights, and heard she was exceptional in Parasite, which I did not see. I'll be honest, I think any actress could have been dropped into this part and they would have been okay.

Park Bo Gum - he is a wonderful actor. He is able to portray a full range of emotions with nothing more than his eyes. For anyone that has not seen I Remember You (also known as Hello Monster), he is EXCEPTIONAL in that! There is something very charismatic about Bo Gum, and the more of his works I watch, the most impressed I am.

This show started out well. I loved the background look into the career of modeling and the concept of two good friends being on opposite ends of the economic as well as career scales. The main characters started out being very up-front with one another, verbalizing their likes, dislikes, etc. However, once they actually got involved with one another, the communication stopped. In Asian dramas, I often wonder why the characters don't just talk to each other, it was such a disappointment that this was a problem here as well.

I loved the woman that played his agent, she brought some good comedic talent to the table. However, there were so many story lines going on at once, some of which were never fully fleshed out, some of which were pointless, some of which were just downright irritating. There seemed to be more happening with other people in the show than the main three characters. This made the show seem needlessly long.

If I'm honest, the thing that kept me coming back was Bo Gum's acting. That and the hopes of a good ending. On that score I was very disappointed. The ending was so lackluster and open-ended, it felt like there should have been a concluding episode following the last episode. This is another thing that I notice about Asian dramas, they tend to use a lot of filler to make more episodes and then wrap everything up in the last five minutes. Writers could definitely take a cue from the writers of Legend of the Blue Sea, which has the best ending of any Asian drama that I've ever seen.

So, my long-winded evaluation of Record of Youth, see it for Park Bo Gum, but don't expect much otherwise.

Plot goes downhill after the first few episodes
Honestly, I loved the first couple of episodes, and drama showed so much potential in terms of character development. The chemistry between the leads was promising too. However, after the first few episodes, the plot became extremely lackluster. The same problems were rehashed again and again, and resolved with no character development from our leads. Perhaps the only character who seemed to have developed is Hye Jun, while Jung Ha and the rest were relegated to the sidelines.

I did find the resolution between father and son at the end to be sweet though. But it was too little too late; they could have done away with 90% of the father's shouting and it would have made no difference to the plot. And Hye Hyo's pining for Jung Ha just really didn't sit right with me, not only because she's attached but she's your best friend's girl??? Come on, man. That plot line was dragged out with no resolution too.

Park Bo Gum honestly carried the whole show for me. He's the only reason I continued watching the damn thing TILL THE END even after such poor writing omg. The varied roles really showcased just how good of an actor he is. And Park So Dam's talents were so underutilized!! JUSTICE FOR HER PLEASE. And may they pick better scripts next time. :')

It’s dry :(
Unfortunately, this was not a great drama, it was really disappointing since the first few episodes were quite good and it was bubbly and gave me the typical Kdrama feels, and I was buying it. Still, after like 6 episodes, it was going the wrong track because literally, nothing happened, there was no plot. The only reason why I didn’t like the drama was that there was not exciting plot or anything that made it a drama it was just like watching someone’s daily life carry on, making it really dry and not feel like a drama. Personally, I thought the message was great as it talked about how it is hard getting settled and stabilising your future in the 20s and the hardships especially what models and actors go to get into the industry and the aftermath after getting in like scandals and becoming famous. The characters were terrible in terms of personalities as I felt they were just misunderstanding or exaggerating situations, especially the main girl lead (I don’t want to spoil the drama). To wrap this up A. the message was great as it gave all of us a reality check that time heals and that time takes to get to where you want. And B. The drama did not provide any feels that is was drama.

It had potential
The beginning truly grips you and you feel for each and every character so much that you can't stop watching, but especially Hye Joon. We've all at some point been in the situation where it feels like the entire universe is telling you to quit. But, HJ is stronger than most of us - he doesn't quit, he persists, he cries, he gets over it, he succeeds.

And then it's all downhill from there. There was no personal struggle left for the writers to use, I guess, so they brought in side characters that served no other purpose, but to cause conflict. Other than HJ, they were all one-dimensional, and simply did what they did, cause....reasons, I guess.

Jung Ha was clumsy. Hae Hyo was rich. HJ's ex was evil. His mother was a housekeeper. His father played favourites with his kids. The grandpa was a burden. Min Jae was a saint. JH's mother only existed to make her cry. Literally everyone character had a one-word-personality.

The ending, however, was what really sealed this show's fate of low ratings. I don't know how we went from communicating about issues and finding solace in each other, to hiding, lying and avoiding, but I do know that I hate ""breaking up only to get back together after 3 years"" trope even more than I hate Subway product placement.
And I really hate Subway product placement.

Though Not Particularly Good, I Still Really Liked It...
I was really excited to watch this K-drama due to the hype that this series has been receiving on social media (especially the K-Drama subreddit thread). I've also heard a lot about Park Bo Gum and about how this is his last drama before his military draft. I was excited to see my first K-drama starring him. It's also pretty cool to see Park So Dam, from the Oscar-winning 'Parasite' as the FL. Though the episode was a bit slow, by the end, I was hooked! I am really liking this series so far! It is nice to see a K-drama focus on people struggling to achieve their dreams against their family's wishes or mean superiors which is definitely relatable for millions of people around the world. I also liked the cinematography, which was clean and soft.

On a side note, why is Hye-jun struggling to make money, working as a bodyguard, at Subway and as a busboy if he is a top model whose looks customers, other models and a top fashion designer fawn over? Also, why is Jung Ha's boss so b*tchy? Like she even interrupted Hye-jun who was trying to defend her? Like what?! I'm quite sure that she is allowed to do that since she is technically working for the models. I'm so ready to see her pummeled into the ground by Jung Ha's imminent success!

Watching the second episode, the pacing of the series seems to have established itself. This drama is slow. It's more like a slice-of-life drama but I'm really liking it! Park Bo Gum's character has immediately become my favourite and I found myself waiting for him to appear onscreen. I cannot wait to see him achieve success and make his naysayers, including his family, gape in disbelief!

On a side note, I love that there is LGBT representation in these newer K-dramas, first Itaewon Class and now, Record of Youth! Although the character in this drama is a fashion designer who lusts after and wants to exploit Hye-jun, it is nice seeing more people like me represented. Hopefully, they will be able to humanize him like Itaewon Class's Hyeon-yi though it doesn't seem like they will...

Episode 3 wasn't as strong as the previous episodes as not much actually happened. I do continue to find Park Bo Gum captivating and absolutely LOVE his scenes. I really feel like the drama hits its stride when it focuses on Hye-jun and his burgeoning career. I don't really care for the other characters to be honest, even the FL who I'm not really feeling the romance between the two leads. Probably because of how rushed, unrealistic and cheesy it is. The snappy dialogue between them feels unnatural too (as others have pointed out) (or at least the translation seems awkward) (not sure if it flows better in Korean though). Anyways, I'm getting the feeling that Hae Hyo is gonna backstab Hye-jun in the future. I feel like Hae Hyo is kind to Hye-jun specifically because he feels bad for him. He pities him. Having him around makes Hae Hyo feel more successful. However, when Hye-jun gets more famous and successful, Hae Hyo will try to backstab out of jealousy. He's already trying to see An Jeong behind Hye-jun's back. It seems like he likes her just because she doesn't like him, which makes him feel more attracted to her. The fact that An Jeong is a fan of Hye-jun and not him clearly irks Hae Hyo, so he wants to make her his fan. He sees her as a challenge. That's my thoughts on Hae Hyo so far. Hopefully, I'm wrong...

Episode 4 was quite slow as once again, not much happened and there were a lot of filler scenes which padded out the running time of the drama. There was a lot of Hye-jun and An Jeong moments which I didn't care for to be honest. Their relationship is way too rushed and to be frank, I'm tired of seeing straight couples. I actually ship Hye-jun with Hae Hyo lol. I did love the ending (which although a bit too rushed was satisfying) where Hye-jun gets to upstage the actor who was mean to him in the first episode though. On a side note, the fact that Hye-jun got the villain role in the film was quite big! I thought that he would just be like a friend. I don't get why Jin Joo hasn't been reported by any of the employees. There's no way that An Jeong was the first co-worker she bullied.

Watching Episode 5, my fears for this drama are starting to manifest. There was once again way too much filler scenes that focused on side characters who I still didn't care for. The family melodrama about the brother moving out was unnecessary and served no purpose. The snappy banter between the main couple still feels forced and unnatural. Still don't see any chemistry between Hye-Jun and Jeong An. That confession at the end was random and way too rushed. I still ship Hye-Jun with Hae-Hyo to be honest. The only part of the episode that shined was when it focused on Hye-Jun's career in the last 20 minutes where Hye-Jun's acting talent was displayed as he delved deep into his villain character. Hopefully, the drama focuses more on his career though I doubt that it will...

Episode 6 was much better than the previous episode though there are a number of plot points that didn't make sense. Like why is the old manager angry that Hye-jun left him when he was literally not paying him? Da fuq? How was he even able to get a high-paying job at a good company representing a top actor when his old agency was barely getting by, not being able to pay its clients? And why is Hye-jun's new manager not going to bat for him? Shouldn't she be tracking down that director and explain why Hye-jun left his old manager? And why would a director drop an actor just because he changed representation?

Family scenes continue to bore. I didn't care for the main romance, just Hye-jun and his career.
A gay relationship is scandalous while a straight relationship would have been praised. After the ground-breaking portrayal of a transgender character in Itaewon Class, this handling of an LGBT topic is just disappointing. What a horrible reporter! She doesn't even check her sources! It's so obvious that Lee Tae-su will try to slander Hye-jun for leaving the agency.

Though this drama wasn't particularly good, I still did enjoy it a lot and will greatly miss looking forward to watching it every Monday and Tuesday night when I get home from work :'( Record of Youth kind of exemplifies the charm and appeal of K-dramas for me. There's just this innocence, this purity and optimism that is just perfect for escapism, especially for someone like me who goes to school everyday studying something he hates, something that his parents pushed him to do. After long, exhausting days of school, and dreading the start of every week, it was a blessing to have something to look forward to every Monday and Tuesday night. Watching K-dramas, such as Record of Youth, calms me and gives me hope. Hope that I will be happy someday. And what more can we ask for...

PBG Fans this is THE drama for you!!!!
Okay. Admittedly I watched this drama mainly because of PBG!!!!! I think that speaks for itself. But I stayed because of the story.

While watching this drama I first thought it was about youth romance between the ML and FL but as the story unfolds more each episode I got a feeling that it was more than that. As the story gets deeper, I realized that this is about the life of the ML and what he was going through during his ""youth"", his 20s. As someone who's in my mid 20's, I found his character very relatable. The way he was going through his quarter life crisis just seemed so real. The pressure he felt to prove his self to other, the time management, building his career, finding love, and basically just finding balance in things.

One thing that I really really loved in this drama is that it showed the versatility of PBG as an actor. Since he was playing as an actor here, he was able to portray a variety of character within the drama. Hence, making this drama THE drama to watch for his fans. It was seriously like a fan service served on a silver platter!!!! <3

There's actually only one thing in this drama that I didn't like, at some point - especially the ending- it felt like the drama was cut short. I know that from the beginning it was really a 16 episode drama, but even though the ending was okay and realistic, after getting attached to other character I felt that their stories were cut short. It felt like the major supporting characters that we saw in the beginning became extras towards the end. There was really no growth. Like for Haehyo, we don't know actually know what happened to his career after. How is his relationship with his mom now. How Jinu and Haena are doing. The Grandpa and HJs dad, his mom, his brother, what are they doing after 2 years passed.

The ending left more questions asked than answered. You know if they made this drama a 20 episode one I really wouldn't mind <3 hehehehe but yeah that's just me lol

How I viewed this drama before I completed it and had only watched 8 episodes:
Original ranking:
Acting 8.5
Music 7.5
Rewatch 9.0
Overall 9.0

This drama is slow and medium-hearted. It depicts the life of the two main leads, who are fighting to make a name for themselves in a job they are passionate about. It is a drama that focuses on the real-life struggles of the leads, and the people that surround them. As a result of this, not everyone will find this drama interesting or enjoyable and that's okay.
Secondly, the acting by the cast is enjoyable and helped make the plot stand out a little bit more. As I watched the currently aired eight episodes, I did not feel uncomfortable by the way the actors chose to represent the characters, nor did I feel like one actor was outshining another, so I applaud the actors not only for their chemistry but for their ability to provide such a comfortable performance for myself as a viewer.

Thirdly, the script and plot so far, is it unique? 50/50. There are a few other dramas out there that depicted the struggles and life of someone in the entertainment industry, and the struggles of their female counterpart, however, the parts of this drama that do make this plot unique in my opinion, is the approach the writers have taken to touch upon the human aspects of some of these characters. In these types of shows, it isn't unrealistic to see the 'mean, rude, obnoxious' character(s) that constantly appear over and over and that constantly make the plot more generic. This drama does have obnoxious, rude characters, but thankfully it isn't the initial focus of the drama. Because the writer chose to focus on the humane aspects of the characters, we get a broader glimpse into the struggles these characters are going through, and rather than having them build up a facade for the public, they choose to continue to be as true to themselves as they possibly can.
Lastly. The way the overall plot is executed and the speed of the drama is slow but not too slow for my liking. Rather, I find it at just the right pace of not too fast nor too slow, to properly dive into the stories of the characters. Take note that as I stated, this is a humane drama about the struggles of the leads in their desired workplace, if the pace was too fast we would lose a majority of the plot and barely understand the key aspects of the overall story, let alone the relationships between characters wouldn't seem as genuine as they are at this moment in time. To sum it all up, I believe this drama is great for those who want to watch a nicely paced and humane drama, either as background noise or as something to just relax to.

How I viewed this drama after I completed it (UPDATED REVIEW):

I'm sorry but what the absolute hell was the writer(s) thinking? They completely lost their way the second half of the drama. The at first humble leads, who communicated quite thoroughly in the beginning, then changed and struggled to communicate and treated each other appallingly.
The various plot barriers (conflicts) thrown at them were quite lackluster as well, and the majority, if not all of them weren't needed!

I am absolutely astounded at how the writer(s) who had a perfectly somewhat realistic, and humane drama, in the beginning, could completely throw it all under a bus story-wise, and instead focus their resources in an attempt to 'cause drama and keep it entertaining' for views. As a result of their decision, the characters became really bland very quickly. Did the writer(s) even care for their characters?! As a writer myself (ie. Fanfiction and some original) I genuinely care about my characters and where they are going to end up, even if it's all fictional. Meanwhile, these writer(s) seemed to write willy nilly and destroy the original intent of the story. To summarise it all: I am severely disappointed.

RIP to my expectations.
I'm writing this only to get rid of my anger and frustration, i was so in love with the drama at first, the cast was good the story was good, everything was good until about episode 8.
After episode 8 the writer started creating a lot of unwanted problems, the chemistry and understanding between the lead couple disappeared, the friendship between the main leads everyone adored was all gone. The whole story went down hill still i forced my self to watch it till ep 15
later i found out the disappointment of an ending and didn't bother to watch the last episode.

my many problems with the story
1) hye jun and jeong had such beautiful understanding between them i was impressed, but the writer completely killed that after episode 8

2) jeong ha never actually fulfilled her dream, they should have focused on her character development but they didn't at all, it was as if she was a supporting character after episode 8.

3)hye jun's and hae hyo's friendship was so lovable at first, and i understand it all went downhill for reasons but neither hye jun nor hae hyo tried to retrieve it, years of friendship just worthless

4) Hae hyo's father was introduced in the plot so he should have had a bigger role in changing the mother and supporting the children correctly.

5) jeong ha's mother was introduced but the did nothing special with the character she was just a way to kill time and extent the episode to one hour

6) hye na's relationship with jin woo should have had a better story surrounding them.

the reporter lady was just annoying to the core, i didn't like min jae's character after a while either

the writer had such excellent ideas but why did she create problems she wouldn't be able to solve?
I'm more angry since they practically wasted PBG and PSD's talent , i had so much expectations but in the end all went down the drain where i didn't even bother to waste my time on the last episode.
i need my 15+ hours i spent on this drama, I'm so annoyed and i definately would not recommend

Record of Absolutely Nothing
I was really excited to start watching this drama and the beginning didn't disappoint. Right off, I could tell that this was different. There was no unnecessary drama. No ridiculous misunderstandings to keep the two leads apart just for the sake of it. No mysterious past connection that either one can't remember. This might be one of the most realistic relationships I've seen in a kdrama so far. Just two people who meet, start to like each other, let each other know and start dating and fall in love. It was so sweet. Annnnnd that's pretty much it. I can't remember exactly what episode it was, I think the episode that ended with them dancing in the rain. I feel like it should've ended there because everything after that was just so blah. Nothing really happened. Hye Jun became famous but that was to be expected. I feel like this drama was full of nothing. Relationships that didn't really lead anywhere, friendships that didn't really change. I gave it a 6.5 because overall this wasn't a bad drama, it was just a nothing drama with really good acting.

I’m not really sure what I just watched. I mean it was a series but I’m a bit confused. It was airy! There didn’t appear to be a plot. The synopsis is accurate but just no there is nothing more to it than that. Series is about young adults in the modeling industry, 2 models/actors, a photographer and a make up artist. It was okay but noting happened.

What you’ll get is a struggling actor trying to make it, a successful actor who is greatly supported. The series is unique in the sense that the 3 males all appear to be really good and loyal friends since childhood. Our female lead is new to the circle, kind of.

There was so cute moments but mostly tears from their struggles or peculiar family.

I can’t recommend this. I sort of feel like I just watch a long fashion ad without a chance to see full ad. This is not really romantic although the bond between the males is refreshing.

I don't understand what happened
Yes I ""watched"" the entire drama and there are a lot of people who already shared a similar opinion as mine but I just have to get this out of my head. I was so excited as I heared about the cast and also the OST and the actors also very did well.... But the story idk. The first 7 or 8 episodes were amazing in my opinion and then nothing. I think that was because they were very fast forward with the characters relationship in the first few episode. It felt like they have nothing to tell anymore afterwards and I was bored while watching it, which lead to skipping through most of the side characters scenes. I also disliked the male lead in between because it was so cliché. Idk

Gets boring as it proceeds.
This drama started as a good one. It had everything, start actors(PBG and PSD) good story(only for few episodes) good music and direction was okay. But all these things got bad after episode 7-8. There was no development between the two leads, the whole drama was mostly focused of ML while the FL seems to play a supporting characters instead of main. The bad guys were just bad and the good guys turned bad were going no where. The families will get on your nerves.
This drama is a big disappointment and huge waste of talent. The writer did a really terrible job. It's not the actors fault they are just doing whatever the script has.
If you ask me that if I should recommend this drama, I will say hell no. Don't waste your time on this you will be disappointed.

I think that ""disappointment"" is the word for my feeling now watching the end of ""Record of you"". Certainly not just for me, based on the many comments that I saw here on MDL and in some other places, but I will try to explain what made me feel like this.

When I started this drama, I was in the same vibe that most people were. The story, the romance and chemistry of the main couple, the way how we could saw another face of the entertainment industry... Everything catches me at the first sight. I really love the way how they construct the need for persistence and work to catch your dreams, the first episodes create an amazing image to the show. I think that maybe this was one of the factors that we can feel this feeling of frustration: the expectations. Mostly on Park Bo Gum and Park So Dam's performance, but also in the story and the promise of something great. With so many expectations, some script choices made the story lose its shine. One thing that disturbs me was the relation between Won Hae Hyo (Byeon Woo Seok) and Ahn Jung Ha (Park So Dam). I'm not talking about the plot itself, but the fact of this started with so much strength and in the middle of the process just was faded. We couldn't see a satisfactory closet to the feelings of Hae Hyo or an exposition of this, and the things just go on. Jung Ha doesn't show strong refuse to these feelings but also doesn't make this clear... I don't know. For me, this was very weak. I could point some others loose ends, but this isn't a spoiler review. I can say that many things are left without a good closer and leave a bitter taste on our mouth. I know that is an ""adult drama"" with real stuff and a really interesting message, but this isn't an excuse to sloppy with the story.

About the acting, I already said that I didn't know Park Bo Geum's work before, but I love him on this character. The way how we could saw the kindness and sweetness of Sa Hye Joon through his eyes was beautiful. Park So Dam also did a great job, but as I said, I couldn't embrace her character with all my strength. Something didn't catch me on Ahn Jung Ha, but this has nothing to do with Park So Dam's performance. Some characters seemed a little out of the story to me, like Kim Jin Woo (Kwon Soo Hyun) that had quickly moments on screen. When I thought that his plot would go deep, everything just vanished. The same for Jung Ji Ah (Seol In Ah) and Lee Tae Soo (Lee Chang Hoon) that could be great antagonists in the story, but just lose power in the process. With Won Hae Hyo (Byeon Woo Seok) the path was inverted... I started disliking him, but in the process, I could appreciate some characteristics of this character. I still don't like some attitudes, but I thought his plot the most coherent until the end. Honorable mention to my precious cameo: Park Seo Joon. My love. Owner of my heart. LOL.

I'm a little sad about the inconsistencies in the story and the high expectations made us a little frustrated with this show... But I still thought this a GOOD ONE (★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★). You won't find a surprising story here, but for sure you will see some life lessons and get emotional with many moments.

See you soon!
XOXO, Mari.

The best actors, the worst story
I had high hopes for this show, I saw Park Bogum and Park Sodam and expected a top tier drama to match this top tier actor list. But what did I get? Boring predictable drama. I like that they tried to keep it on a mature level, but the story was so predictable it was hard to sit through, and the characters were so ridiculously scripted into cliche characters. I dropped the show for a bit after episode 11, and ended up skipping all the way to the last episode. And guess what, I wasn’t even surprised that all the stuff they mentioned happened, and I wasn’t surprised by the ending either. I was so disappointed.

So much wasted potential
Sigh. This drama was a total disappointment.

Context: I LOVE Park Bo Gum. I enjoy Park So Dam. Slice of life? Sign me up! And yet something didn't quite click from the start. I hoped things would pick up, but the plot line became more convoluted and frustrating. We spent too much time on annoying side characters and side plots instead of developing our protagonists, so I didn't end up caring what happened to them.

My issue from the beginning was that the dialogue was weirdly snappy and unnatural. People didn't speak like they do in real life, and that took some of the immersion away. Another key issue was that a lot of the characters felt one-dimensional —  we only saw the bad side of our bad characters for so long, with POTENTIALLY some last-minute redemption towards the end. I suppose I can understand the parents and miserable people like Lee Tae-Su, but at what cost?

We never got strong enough development for Jeong Ha or Won Hae Hyo, and that's what bugged me the most. I would've preferred if the show took us down the love triangle line!

I did enjoy how the show was somewhat autobiographical for Park Bo Gum (lol @ his Love in the Moonlight remake), and I liked seeing his range. I liked the messages on enlistment, and the depiction of this cultural nuance that feels so foreign to outsiders. It's like homework hanging over your head, and it's an experience that unites people of all ages, socioeconomic classes, and walks of life. As far as the ending went, I was as satisfied as I could possibly be, considering the circumstances. Everything tied up with a neat little bow, although that meant some people acted ridiculously out of character. The unfortunate part is that the show was consistently so lacklustre that the ending was unfulfilling anyway.

Bogum + THIS IS A FAMILY DRAMA, not a ROMANTIC MELODRAMA
I am going to start this review with a message to all high school students and other underage ""reviewers"". Please stop writing negative reviews for this drama. I understand you don't get it. Maybe finishing your homework on time and trying to get into college should be on your priority list then, not writing reviews for ""boring"" dramas you clearly do not get?

If you find my tone condescending, that's because it is. I do not know HOW to explain to uneducated people that they are not educated enough and should not write anything at all. Is there a simple way to revert the Dunning-Kruger syndrome?

Next: this is more of a REALISTIC FAMILY DRAMA that examines how someone's upbringing changes the way they think and function in life. This is NOT a ROMANTIC MELODRAMA, even though it might be labeled as such. THERE IS PRACTICALLY NO ROMANCE in this drama. Stop writing stupid reviews just because it doesn't fit your immature expectations.

Now, that I have insulted everyone I wanted to insult, I can tell you more about the plot and the actors.

This drama is amazing. First of all, Bogum. He is a fantastic actor and this drama lets him show off his acting ability. If in other dramas he just plays a nice guy. Here is the real deal.

It's nice to see Park So-dum. Hasn't seen anything with her since Cinderella and Four Knights. She plays well, but very predictable ""self"".

All the actors are nicely put together, each person fits his/her role. It's a brilliant ensemble. Kudos to the casting director!

As for the plot...

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE PLOT. Don't watch it for Bogum, watch it for the plot.

A word of warning to ""fantasy"" fans: if you are hung up on fantasy plots such as Goblin, Hotel del Luna, even Descendants of the Sun - this drama IS NOT FOR YOU. Find your fix where you can escape your boring reality. This story, even though someone's fantasy is more realistic (therefore ""boring"" to all the fantasy watchers) than anything else. I would recommend this story to those who liked it When the Weather is Fine or even Chocolate.

Oh, and just for you I will reveal the greatest secret ever - Santa Claus does not exist. Neither does Harry Potter. Now go on and continue living your miserable lives where everything has to have a superficial twist. (Condescending, I know. This is the best I can do under the circumstances though).

I skipped the first episode (didn't like the dark parts of it) and went straight for the second. PLEASE NOTE: I skip the first episodes of ALL DRAMAS as a rule. Sometimes I even skip the second and, quite frequently, even the third. And guess what? It doesn't make any difference. It's just a drama, not brain surgery.

The plot is well thought out. For those who claim that the story is slow - all dramas slow down after the fourth episode as a rule. It doesn't make it any less interesting, it's still a very engaging drama. In fact, if the writer changed anything about the story, I wouldn't like it as much. The writer is brilliant - I am saying it from the perspective of another writer.

The story slowly unfolds to tell us a story of three different families. I would say, this is more like a family drama than a melodrama. The writer and director try to show us different attitudes towards upbringing and how it helps or damages the children. It was sweet to see the chain of asking for forgiveness on the paternal line.

For those who claim this drama is boring - nope. It's entertaining. The whole plot revolves around two different approaches to raising kids. Some people are born with a silver spoon when your wealthy parents provide you with full support. The rest of us have to work hard to get everything ourselves. What impact does this approach have on your child's behavior and future?

The drama tackles other issues as well such as Does honesty always pay off? Do we have to do the right thing if it is going to hurt us in the end? How to be successful in life, and what success means to different people?

The moral of the story is pretty much: what goes around, comes around. But the story is written in such beautiful, fulfilling ways.

I just don't get it: Itaewon class was WAY more full of cliches and was basically a very mediocre drama in terms of the plot but people seem to write glowing reviews. One cannot help but wonder if it's because in this drama they don't have as many gays/ lesbians/ transgender/racially diverse people. Is it because of no action/ fights? Or maybe the MDL crowd is just not brainy enough? All you want people is FANTASY and escape from reality. Guess what? The reality is not going anywhere.

In my estimate, ROY is about ten (or even more) times better than the Itaewon class. I bet it has something to do with the age of an average viewer. On a positive note, ROY scored high points with the ACTUAL viewers. The drama was rated quite high among other cable dramas. The last episode reached the highest ratings, btw, even though the first episode was the second-highest-rated so far.

Don't let negative reviews cloud your judgment. It's an amazing drama with a great plot. Unless you are a teenager, of course. And then go watch something completely removed from reality to escape your daily chores. Or, better yet, do your homework. In ten years (or twenty for some) you might be able to get this drama.

I wanted to love it so bad! But...
This show was so disappointing! I started to watch it when it first came out and took my time on it. I read some of the reviews on here and thought everyone was nuts because it was really good in the beginning. But then it dropped off and just got worse!

Story... was good up until about episode 13/14. The main leads started to drift apart really fast after they started dating. And it went downhill from there! No communication and they tell each other that they love each other but break up???? Really?? “I love you. Let’s break up!” And she dumps him when he needed her the most! I hated her character! Like the actress but poor part she chose to play. I just can’t believe they did not get back together. She still said she loved him but could not be there for him!? She was the problem. Poor guy! I felt bad for him. Yes, they left it to your imagination if they got back together or not. But honestly I HATE that! Just end it nice and give them a clean happy ending!

Acting... was really good. I think they did a great job. But dang that storyline hurt them and the show! Park Bo Gum is a cutie and I really loved his character and thought he did an awesome job.

Music... loved! Hope I can find it on Amazon.

Rewatch? Probably not! I hate endings they way they did it. And I hate the storyline! It was disappointing. I have to agree with all those low rated reviews.

If you are a fan of the actornor actress give it a try if not check it out for the plot
I have seen some works written by the writer so I decided to check it because of the hyped it was getting prior to watching the drama, but while it does talks about youth and chasing their dream. In the end, the second half wasn't as good as it could be and they have brought on some unnecessary sub plot and it just loss the sense of direction. However, I give credit to the actors for doing their best in their role, but it wasn't enough. If you are a fan of the actors/actress definitely give it a try or if you are a fan of the writer do not let my review stop you from watching it because this is just my opinion. You have to watch it and let yourself decide whether or not you like it.

So bad that I need to rant
I rated this drama very low, the reason being that it somehow got me in a depressive mood whenever I watched it. ""Slice of life"" doesn't have to be so disheartening. I don't know how to explain it really but maybe there's too much going on in the world already and instead of I don't need my daily dose of drama to tell me that everyone breaks up anyways and life is full of struggles, nothing lasts forever etc. Even the supposedly happier moment between family, friends and lovers don't seem genuine or noteworthy.

I am not a huge fan of PBG and sometimes I'm astounded by the cult following he has. He was pretty disappointing and dull. And although PSD was part of the legendary Parasite, watching her in this show was rather dry. The chemistry between the leads was more like disinterested grandma her sleepy grandkid than lovers. The other members of the cast did an okay job, but none of them impressed me. My favourite person was definitely HJ's brother who was exceptionally charming in the short amount of screentime he had.

The positive about the show would be: great idea to tell the story of an emerging actor.

While I'm writing this I realise I'm being a little irrational, but then I watch dramas so they make me happy, and this one really sucked the joy out of me. I'll let myself be a little mad.

In my opinion: don't waste your time on this.

As bland as plain rice
I’m going to be completely honest with you… this drama isn't the best but it isn't terrible.

I started Record of Youth solely for the cast because the plot didn’t interest me all that much. I loved the main leads in their previous roles but sadly these ones just didn’t touch my heart as much. I couldn’t connect or get attached to any of the characters :(

I jumped in without any expectations and came out feeling disappointed… There is no chemistry, no character development, the plot is loose and there's literally nothing to hold on to. I wanted to love this drama, I really did, but the story was bland and the characters were boring. This could have been interesting, talking about the struggles of the modelling and acting industry and how difficult it is to rise up, gaining fame and attention, especially when you’re not originally from a wealthy family.

I forced myself to continue watching ROY. It got really boring, it felt like nothing was ever happening. I was constantly using the skip button on my keyboard, because some scenes were unnecessary and repetitive - the family ones in particular. I LOVED the ost though.

The acting? Not much to say really, they were good but nothing incredible or mind-blowing. However, I can’t help but notice how unrealistic the dialogue is for each character, it’s just that everyone quickly knows what to respond and say as if they’re reading not acting - it seems unnatural. I wish they had focussed on the friendship between the male leads more, bromance would’ve probably made Record of Youth a bit better. The relationship between Hyejoon and his grandfather is the highlight for me.

This series isn’t that bad, it’s just boring without much depth. Ah well, at least I got to see a bit of Park Bogum’s adorable cheeky smile! I hate dropping dramas but I just couldn't get into this one and I felt like I was wasting my time. Who knows, maybe I'll try re-watching it again some time in the future.

The shows getting worse and worse
At this point, the show is getting worse and worse. A lot of the characters are getting very unlikeable now. The story gives off this unnecessary feel to it, and I guess it's getting repetitive. The saviour now would be for it to have a good ending.

However, I think no matter what happens, the doesn't make it into my top 10. Still, not a bad show, but gets worse, but usually shows like this a satisfying ending. My version of a good ending would probably not come true, as it involves Park Bogum moving on from Park Sodam, and that is unlikely since dramas always find a way for the main leads to end up together

a lot of wasted potential.
[[Overall opinion]]

This is a coming of age drama with a great cast, promising plot and nice aesthetic. It portrays the lives of people in their 20s as they navigate through love, success, failure and family. The drama really touches important and moving topics, I found the romance cute and adorable and we get to see an emotional, thoughtful and mature male lead which is sadly rare. Nevertheless in the second half things started getting too complicated for the sake of pulling clichés and tropes, plots were dragged for too long, some characters lacked depth and the female lead was treat poorly. I still liked this drama a lot but I was hoping so much more of it especially for the female lead.

{{SPOILERS}}

Jinu and heena’s relationship and the way it ended was also a yes for me: just like jinu said they didn’t have enough power to go against their realities, both of them were just starting their own paths and the distance between their realities was too wide, and just like jinu said again, they could meet again in the future which I truly hope so.

I love the contrast between hye joon’s and hae hyo’s parents and how they supported (or not) each their child’s dreams. Hye joon’s dad development was great: I could totally see where he was coming from basically reflecting how he felt towards his dad onto his son, which is not okay but I can understand, at the end he comes around and is kind of awkward but he was trying and when you’re an adult your relationship with your parents is also weird at times. I loved the grandpa and the manager they were really cute and supportive.
My main problem was Jeong Ha, not her character itself but the way she was “developed” She was supposed to have this complicated relationship with her parents but we don’t see much of that or how she comes around it, we only see Jeongha’s dad when she needs the money for the salon and even when the scene where he kneels was touching it wasn’t enough. Jeong Ha’s mom is the reason she doesn’t want to depend on anyone and we kind of see why on the 2 times the mom came on screen but that’s it. They left her life to the side and revolve her mostly around the two male leads, when there so much we could see of her fighting to get a name in the industry and healing her own wounds not using her salon as a prop to meet with hye joon and hae hyo.
Sad.
At the end we see her having a career and all, but on the contrast to hyee joon who the entire drama focused on giving us his story they could at least give her an episode centered on her. AT LEAST.
I agree with the breakup, I wasn’t even sad, jeongha did the right thing her career was just starting and if they went public everyone would be after her, even her mom as we could see, people would call her a gold digger, they would demised her work, celebrities might not want to work with her to not be involve in scandals and she would most likely be harassed, just look and how bad she had it at the salon, their relationship was not in good shape either: they kept apologizing, hiding their feelings to protect the other and that led into feeling guilty and lonely.
Now hae hyo , my boy you were so plain: he had so much potential to be so much more but again it was wasted, the only moments where he shined the most were when he stood for his mom but that was what? 2 scenes? The rest it felt like he was just a backup dancer on hyee joon’s musical.
the Charlie jung plot lasted way too long for my taste. I have read some people asking for a season 2, honestly I don’t see it necessary I feel the way they ended was enough and I doubt they can fix what I don’t like in a season 2.

The Record is only for PBG's character
If you started watching this thinking that there will be equal opportunity for all the so-called lead, pls runaway because you will be very disappointed. This drama is mainly focused on PBG character and PSD only got about 2hrs of exposure for the total 17hrs (approx.) that you'll probably invest in this. You will also get more story (record) on the mothers, fathers, grandpa, brother, managers, reporter, neighbour, father's shoulder... That is how much subplot this story has that they totally forgot about PSD's character. If you are a big PBG fan then this is definitely the show for you.

A lot has already been said, like some here I did like the 1st half but even then the screen time between HJ and JH is already very little. Then we get to the 2nd half and everything just got dropped!

Nevertheless this is the drama that actually made me like PBG. I hope he gets to be ugly in his next drama (perhaps play a character like that guy in I'm Thinking of Ending Things) . He is so beautiful (and righteous) on this drama I can't help but be bored with his character at times. As much as they made PBG beautiful they just dyed PSD's hair orange (the Fak!) and some of her outfits made her look so ordinary next to PBG! I think this is deliberate on the part of the production team to make her look ordinary but man the hair! PSD is so much prettier than her actual character.... So frustrating that she chose this project!

I will still rewatch this just to see some nice moments of HJ and JH time together but I will skip a lot of the scenes that I have no interest to see again. I will miss this couple specially their late night walks paired with authentic neighbourhood and parks.

It could’ve been much much better

I took some time today to reflect on my feelings towards Record of Youth. Often times I’ll finish a drama and have it all figured out and my opinions will be easily formed. With ROY however I felt like the aspects I disliked the most weren’t necessarily a bad writing choice and this is what I’ll say: the plot is not for everybody, the story is not exactly likable as a whole and it’ll be challenging to watch by the end, but it is realistic.
We have very interesting complex characters since episode one, unfortunately I felt like the plot focused a lot in conflicts and problems of the main (male) characters when it could’ve easily developed the amazing cast acting skills and their roles. It was specially disappointing to see how little we had from Park So Dam’s character when her part had so much to offer, in this case the writer is to blame.
Many situations could’ve been solved quickly and were dragged for an unnecessary amount of time, such a valuable time that could’ve made this reach a better overall result.
I won’t drag this review much longer. As pros we have many interesting subjects approached in the drama, a steady first half, an amazing cast, all love goes to Park Bo Gum as Sa Hye Jun and his grandpa, all love really. As a con we get many choices from characters that will feel awful, unnecessary and even annoying (which can be seen as a realistic point from the plot in a different perspective), we get much less character development than we needed and the final half of the drama is not the best.
Where you go from here is up to you.

So much lost potencial and a lot of frustration
It started off so strong, with so much potencial, and I guess that's what frustrated me the most.

The main characters are the least interesting characters on the show (at some point I was almost sure they forgot to write the character of Jeong-Ha and she was just serving as a plot point for others) and you see yourself waiting and cheering on for secondary plots and arcs.

Speaking of plots... there are so many of them that start out of nowhere and end - or better said, vanish! - even more out of the blue. It's palpable that they're only there to move the story somewhere and they barely serve their purpose.

Because of all the frustration of undeveloped characters, meaningless plots and overall frustration, I procrastinated watching the episodes as the series went on and only kept going because I thought there would be more to the story. But it goes nowhere and then it ends kind of abruptly on the 15th episode, which is why I didn't even want to watch the finale.

A few weeks later I decided to give it a go and I'm actually happy I did. Although very cliché, it ends nicely, with heart warming scenes and characters finding themselves. I could say my goodbyes to the show on a nicer note, which I liked... But would I go through everything again or even recommend that someone start this show? Absolutely not.

PLAIN AND BLUNT
i started watching this because it was on Netflix and one of my MDL friends said she was watching it... i didnt had anything else to watch at that time... even though i am familiar with park bo gum and park so dam, i am not into them enough to check out their projects because of them...
the drama started off relatively good but the problem is, from the first 2-3 episode itself we are obvious about the struggles and conflicts thats gonna happen and those struggle and conflicts is all that is there in this show... since its a slice of life drama, slow phase wasn't a problem with me but towards the 2nd half this turned plain and blunt... even if you skip 2-3 episodes you wont miss anything... thats how slow and plain the drama is... the drama is completely centred around the male lead and everyone else are just part of his life... at the start we might think the female lead will have her own struggle and story but she just ends up being just a part of his life... by the end she is just a non-celeb girl, the male lead who becomes a star had sincere relationship with... the romance is soo less that when they are together it will be difficult for a 3rd person to say these two dated for more than a year... the break-up of the secondary couple was more impactful and logical that the male leads... the second lead becomes quite irrelevant by the end of it... he dont even feel like the 2nd lead anymore...
the male lead is high on morals and principles and dont take a shortcut no matter what may come.... he is so straight and upright to the level that we can simply predict how he is gonna react and what he is gonna do... in the last 2 episodes the makers tried so hard to create tension b/w the ML and his manager that they wanted to create suspense whether he will renew his contract or not but just knowing the ML for 3-4 episodes is more than enough for us to understand that he is gonna renew the contract... they just simply wasted time on creating friction b/w the manager and the ML...

the bad people were bad just for the sake of being bad... none of them had any solid reasons to be bad or bitter towards the male lead... even a random journalist out of nowhere comes in just to hate the male lead... a slice of life drama dont really need bad guys or evil characters like in hospital playlist or reply series... the situation and huddles in life were more than enough... here the bad guys were added solely to create random problems for the male lead... even the problems faced by the male lead were over-exaggerated...

it did have some heartfelt scenes b/w the family and friends but only some episodes had those scenes... at the start the male lead and his grandfather had some really adorable and cute scenes but from the 2nd half onwards they barely have any combination scenes... the scene b/w te grandpa and HJ's father and HJ and his father in the last episode was good... also the last scene b/w HH and his mother...

my most favourite characters will be the grandpa and the ML's brother... his brother is the only one that's gonna make everyone laugh...

the acting of everyone was just fine... nothing amazing but nothing bad either... the second male lead is relatively a newcomer so he needs polishing... even though i liked park bo gum's acting i wont say i was very impressed with his acting... something about him just dont click with me and i dont know what it is... i think park so dam is better for movies than dramas... cheesy stuffs dont suit her and kdrama is filled with cheesy things... i am still not into them enough to check out a project solely because of them... most of the times when i complete an ongoing drama i start liking the leads enough to check out there other projects or wait for their next projects...
the chemistry b/w the leads were very plain like the drama... its not like they didnt had chemistry at all or didnt look good together... may be its how their relationship was written, they had no passion in the relationship... they just looked like two friends and not even close friends...

i finished this drama solely because i only have to watch 2 episodes every weak else i would have dropped it around episode 7-8... none of the episode endings made me restless to watch the next episode... i guess this drama will belong to the category of kdramas i forgot as soon as i finished it and wont even remember it to rewatch it again... i necessarily didnt hate it but i didnt like it either... i just dont have any sort of feelings towards this drama... i dont regret watching it but i didn't exactly enjoy watching it either... my feelings are also very plain and blunt like the drama...

the script wasted the talent
The cast will make you want to watch. Don't put yourself through it.
I intially was in love with this drama. An older than most main character, still chasing his dreams. His family and their lives. Best friend and the class differences between them. Love interest and her trying to also reach her dreams. And it's set in the fashion world. I was sold on this premise! And the first half delivered. I looked forward to the new episodes being posted on Netflix every week. Then somehow, towards the 7th episode or so, it was like I was watching a completely different show. The script and the dialogue became routine, stereotypical, see through. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON HOW A SHOW CENTERED ON FASHION TREATED THE GAY STORYLINE IN SUCH A TYPICAL AND DISSAPOINTING WAY. In the end I didn't even have the drive to at least finish it to see the outcomes. Not even to see what happens with grandpa, the best character. I honestly was annoyed at it by episode 9 and by 13 I couldn't take any more. It didn't do anything new whatsoever. The cast deserved more honestly. I can't even rec it for something light or to binge when you can't find anything else because it gets so tediously boring and monotonous.
Just skip it, honestly.

I am confused, I liked it and disliked at the same time
This is going to be a short review. This drama got me confused. It started really well, but lost it momentum half way through. It'll probably be a feast to Park Bo Gum's fans. I am not one, but he was pleasant enough to watch in this drama. My overall rating is as high as 8, because I like those down to earth dramas about people trying to live in the Korean society. I do realize the society is very judgmental, but this fact never ceases to annoy me.
Finally, can someone please explain to me why dating is considered a SCANDAL in Korea? What is so scandalous in the fact that an actor in his twenties is dating a perfectly normal girl his age? What's the controversy?

20s is a Beautiful, Messy Period of Our Times
Okay, I just finished this drama yesterday, and I actually need a day to completely re-arranged my headspace and write.
As a fellow 20s-years-old, I feel like this drama resonates so well with me. Record of Youth is astory of people in the 20s, of Sa Hye Jun's, of An Jeong Ha's, of Won Hae Hyo's, and other people around them. It was messy, hopeful, uncomfortable and beautiful.

During the first episodes, I almost dropped it because it looked so cliche. A kindhearted man got bullied, scammed, doubted and being cast aside, I think Sa Hye Jun will be another Cinderella character. The family is also infuriating and a bit dysfunctional. But I went on watching, and found out it was not like that at all.

Sa Hye Jun's family became one of my favorite story in this drama. It's a family consisted of a warmhearted but guilt-ridden grandfather, a lonely and prickly father, a loving mother, an arrogant and self-centered older brother, and our main lead. They fought and clashed every so often. Not your ideal family, right? But as the episodes went by, more dramas unfolding, the family actually became more united and got closer.

An Jeong Ha and Sa Hye Jun's relationship is also one of my favorite. It's a healthy relationship, for start! It's really hard to find one among so many dramas, but theirs are one, and I'm happy to find it. At the start, it kind of felt like a Y/N story in fanfiction, with it being a romance between a fan and the idol and makes me giddy with laughter. But the following episodes turned so serious, so I think, huh, maybe not.

One point I really liked about their relationship, is that they've changed over time. Your way of thinking, your idealism, they changed as you grew up, and sometimes you found out that some promises couldn't be kept. I loved every emotion the two portrayed when they're together!

Won Hae Hyo is another thing. I really admire him. With his situation, there is probably a lot of things that could push him through the villain line, but he stood still. It really tickles me actually, how every time he looked like he's about to do something bad, he turned around last minute and choose the other way.

Oh! Also, there were a candid manager, a black hearted and toxic ex-manager, an ex-girlfriend, a misunderstood reporter, a jealous senior, a money-oriented mother, and all those actor cameos. They brought many spices to this story, so let's honor them all, except the ex-manager, I really hate you I hope you go bankrupt.

For me, I recommend watching this if you are a fellow 20-s years old currently navigating through life. This is a good one, though it will be better if you watch this in a good headspace, because if not, you will be a sobbing mess like I was.

Happy watching!

If you the most helpful reviews you may notice that they have given it stars varying from 4.5 to 6.5 but i feel 4.5 is just too low .I am confused between 6.5 and 6 but i am giving it a 6.

so now let's talk about what this drama is about . if you are looking for a romance drama then this is not it . i personally feel that this dram is actually slice of life
this drama focuses on the characters trying to achieve their dreams and realizing when they need to give up but hye jin rose to fame just so quickly they should hv shown us some of his struggles and they also didn't really show much about the different make up styles what i mean is that they didn't actually tell us about the jobs but they told us about the hardships of that job .
as they only focused more on hardships it made the show a bit boring but i guess that is the reality of the entertainment industry . They showed us the loneliness ,struggle, love relationship problems and much more but all of them includes hardships . it was like the writer had to keep an episode limit and she wanted to show the difficulties as well so she decided not to show the happiness of the characters.
the thing that disappointed me the most was the ending. there was no conclusion . when hye jin cried in his room there was no solution to that . i mean in the end they kind of showed that after achieving his goal he actually became more lonely rather than happy. it was like some things were just left incomplete
ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD WATCH IT OR NOT I WILL SAY IF YOU HV SOME FREE TIE WELL THEN YOU CAN SEE IT BUT IT IS NOT SOMETHING WOW

A cliché Drama Experience overall...
To be frank in a way am not that satisfied with this drama. First of all i want to point out some of the interesting postive factor that i felt in the earlier Episodes, that there were not a big love traingle which i find every fresh in this particular kdrama, because usually in these kind of a plot in someway there will be a huge space for some unwanted love traingle. But here they manged to bring a good 2nd lead character without any big love fight in between the male leads. That was good. Secondly the chemistry between the couple looks so strong in the early stage Episodes which way pretty soon and was beautiful to see . So many lovely moments between them which were excellent.?

Coming to weak points, there is nothing new apart from those factors. The drama moving like a complete cliché way from the 12 th Episode to finale which looks very boring and the last 4 or 5 Episode are not that interesting or exciting at all for me. Park Bo Gum Done a good performance from a struggling rookie to become an aspiring actor character. But for park So Dom i think she has nothing to do in particular, the character was good to see on the screen but i felt she just a side role character in this entire drama and not much to do as a female lead.

The family issues which we seen so many times before was still there and it presented beautifully without too annoying and that father, grandfather characters were superb? some emotional scenes were really touching especially in the finale Episode. But again if you are a beginner to kdrama you may feel in the other way, but if you are regular drama watcher you definitely may not feel complete satisfaction with this drama. By the way i expected little more in the climax also but it was an ok ending for me..

Overall its just an average drama experience for me

What Happens When You Become a Famous Actor?
It is interesting to see all the various views and perspective on Records of Youth. Looking at the scores, it does appear one either truly enjoyed it or not at all. No grey areas here. For me, I found it profoundly enjoyable. A really good drama with a well written script.

I liked the way the director really took us into the story and characters, not rushed but was able to make me feel invested in each of their experience and journey. I was looking forward to every episode as Hye-Jun (Park Bo Gum) struggles to make it as an actor. The way he was treated before and after he became famous is like DAY and NIGHT, a complete change. The way he himself is unable to control his schedules and surrounding as his popularity gains momentum. The jealousy, the gossips, the competition, the family and friend dynamics, the paparazzi, the choices and even his young love. And when he does put his foot down with decisions, sacrifices have to be made. I liked that his character, though young, had a sense of confidence and maturity about him. These are truly what an actor/actress have to go through and live with. Wow, no wonder they get paid well and most marry late in their lives. Couldn’t help but envisioned what stars like Lee Minho, Kim Soo Hyun, Hyun Bin, Song Kye Ho, Song Joong Ki etc. etc go through. No wonder they try to keep their lives as private as possible.

I also enjoyed the acting of the entire cast. The script was so well written and it was especially good to see that each of them had a good story to tell.

The only difficulty I had was watching the relationship between Hye-Jun and Jeong-Ah (Park So Dam). It was just too polite and somewhat formal?? Almost like two best friends who do really look cute together. Being that it is about the time of youth, I wanted their love to be a little bit more exciting and demonstrative. More memorable?

In conclusion, the overall experience was very enjoyable for me. Loved this drama.

Cheers! K-drama Forever!

What was this about?
I am surprised I mad it through episode 8. This show has very little going for it. I keep watching and it just goes nowhere, then the next episode starts and I am wondering, ""What was the last episode about?"" Rinse lather repeat. There Are so many other great South Korean shows that I'm give up on this one.
The people that have the reviews with spoilers are good enough for me to read in a few minutes rather than sit through an hour each episode. Good luck everyone that stayed with.
Actors we're good, but the chemistry wasn't there.

Until the last episode, no CHEMISTRY between the leads, whats so ever
I can safely say that this drama is a Biopic of Sa hye Joon....The template was well established about Sa Hye Joon from the beginning. A struggling Model, who also loves to act but has no contacts in the industry also comes from a middle class background, very adamant about his principles, dreams...basically what a hero's characteristics should look like.

Let's talk about other characters surrounding our Main lead. Caring but helpless mom, very strict dad, ideal older brother, lovely grandpa, his 2 other friends and then there is our Female Main Lead. Her Character was super duper strong initially. I was rooting for her. But later on it just fizzled out. The character became too confusing to understand.

What I liked most about this drama was Main Leads we were practical, very relatable. I mean in most of the dramas Female leads just act cute and basically do nothing. Here both of them very practical couple. Very straightforward forward and honest with each other. Like I said in the HEADLINE this might have resulted in lack of chemistry between the leads. Wow!!! From the beginning they both looked more like friends than couple.

Sa Hye Joon and his family's graph was amazing, characters were well developed only Sa family. His friends like Hye Ho, Jin u were Ok. In the end it was really unclear to what happened to Hye Ho's career, did he make it or no.
Jong Ah is the character who hated instability, unpredictability a lot. But she left a secured job to open a studio of her own which contradicted her believes. Later on she blamed it on Hye Joon for her being unstable and broke up with him....Like i said her character got super confusing towards the end.

It is not very bad but the potential was not fully utilized. Beginning few episodes were good but again it fizzed out soon. You can watch it once as it is there on Netflix. Also, Sa Hye Joon's story is worth watchable atleast once.

A VERY realistic KDrama
Record of Youth (Netflix, 2020)
9/10
**Warning this review contains spoilers**

There have been a lot of mixed reviews about this drama, not about the story, but about the ending. This drama is a VERY realistic look at the sacrifices, and tough choices one has to make when pursuing their dreams. This drama is not for those looking for a cliché, predictable ending. Writing this right now I’m about a week removed from watching the finale, and I still don’t know how I feel about it.

Sa Hye Jun (Park Bo Gum) comes from a lower middle-class family, he works multiple part-time jobs, while he tries to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. He is naïve and his current agency takes advantage of him and withholds his pay, “for the good of the agency”. With his military enlistment looming over him his family pressuring, him to give up, he meets Ahn Jeong- Ha (Park So Dam) an aspiring makeup artist with a dream of having her own studio and own brand. She is also struggling while pursuing her dreams. Being socially exiled from her current makeup studio where she is an apprentice, by her boss who fears her talent. Jeong Ha and Hye jun become fast friends as they find comfort in each other.

Won Hae- Hyo ( Byeon Woo- Seok) is Hye Jun’s best friend from childhood, he is also trying to make it big as an actor, appearing as minor characters, but never making it big. The big difference between these two, is that while Hye Jun is trying to make it on his own effort, Hae Hyo comes from a rich family, and without him knowing, has been supported by his mother, who does whatever she can, pulls what ever strings she has to see her son succeed.

What happens when Hye Jun finally gets his break? Will he be able to keep Jeong ha by his side as he rises to stardom? Will he be able to fight the pressures of the entertainment industry, or will it suffocate him? What will happen when Hae Hyo, finds out his mom has been pulling the strings? What will happen to their friendship as Hae Hyo slowly starts to fall for Jeong Ha? How will these three survive the obstacles before him?

I thoroughly enjoyed this series, I enjoyed the realistic look at the journey to become successful in the entertainment industry. Park Bo Gum is a very captivating actor, this role suited him perfectly. He has the ability to capture such emotions with his eyes. Whenever he cried, I started to cry. The script was so realistic and heartbreaking at times, you couldn’t help to compare it to the ACTUAL industry. I am almost certain this is how the Korean industry operates and these are the pressures those sucked in go through. The price of fame is great and Park Bo gum was an accurate portrayal. I felt like we were watching his story, even though it was fictional.

You felt for every character in this series and their struggles. Rookie actor Byeon Woo-Seok, really left an impression on me. He portrayed the best friend feeling various range of emotions perfectly. I was pleased that through all the obstacles they remained friends, he was jealous with his friend’s success but he was honest with himself, and turned that jealously into something else. He didn’t take the KDrama cliché path and become vengeful or try to bring his best friend down. I really appreciated how the writer developed his character.

As far as the ending. Sigh, I’m still not sure how I feel about it. I feel like I’m going through the 5 Stages of Grief. I couldn’t believe they could end a series that way, I was hoping there was an ending credit sequence, an extra scene, a time jump, something! Why would they do that to them and to the viewers! Sure, it’s a realistic ending, it made sense. Maybe, just maybe I was thinking “Ok, I guess their story will continue off screen and maybe there will be a season 2? It made complete sense very realistic. In life you are faced with difficult choices and not matter how hard you fight your decision will hurt the other person. I still am undecided

Excellent Drama
I am currently watching Record of Youth and so far I really like it. No cheesy and over the line girl tripping over the guy just because she is a fun. I love the concept, it is different and that Park So Dam is acing her role once again. You can tell she has really grown as an actor and the chemistry is just perfect; they support each other,they both know what they want in their careers and they are willing to make it happen. They are all chasing their dreams and fighting their way through the challenges life throws at them. So far, I can say the cast is amazing...Hopefully it stays that way until episode 16!!

It's very shallow and tedious show. Watching this for Park So Dam.
First off, if you are looking for a show that have development of all characters, don't watch this show. Instead, watch Hospital Playlist because it's a better show with proper development of rounded characters.

My final judgement: slow pacing of the story line and tedious/disorganized plot with terrible transitioning.

My bias is for Park So Dam, and I'm watching this show for her. However, this show is very, very unappealing as slice of life drama. The transition between PBG's family to PBG himself is very muddle and confusing. This show jumps from explaining PBG's life to PBG's family without proper flow. Somehow, this show expects the audience to be sympathetic with the secondary characters without showing us the reason why. It's form of telling instead of showing.

There is alot going on in PBG's family as well as BWS's family. Neither plot points are very appealing, and the acting is awkward to watch. It makes you wonder, ""Am I watching Korean day soap opera?""

The focus of the family takes away the development of the female characters like Park So Dam's character. You have bits and pieces of her character, but it never show you how she comes to be. Why does she want to be a makeup artist? How does she become a fan of PBG's character? Is she successful in makeup busking? Why does she continue to do makeup busking? You ask these questions and you receive zero answer. This drama only shows Park So Dam when it is necessary for her to support PBG's character. You don't see how she works in her daily job for more than 10 minutes. And most of the time, her appearance in her job shows up when PBG needs her.

And I'm not even talking about Byun Woo Seok's character, cause I still don't get why he becomes the way he is today.

It's obvious that this is more of PBG centric show, which is fine. But when you focus so much on PBG, there is no development for any other characters.

Park Bo Gum, period.
To be honest, I was really excited to watch this drama because this is from Netflix, there is Park Bo Gum and Park So Dam. Both of them are great in their acting, especially Bogum, really genuine and charismatic. Moreover, the 2nd lead guy, Byeon Woo Seok is good looking. So I was waiting to watch this drama so bad.

On the first episodes, it feels refreshing and relatable. The story is about pursuing a dream, but we still have to be a nice guy even when the situation gets hard. It feels relatable because all of us have a dream and pursuing it, right?
And also, the story has fangirling moments, which most of us do even probably not at the same level.

On 3 last episodes, in my humble opinion, I feel the love story is so cliche and predictable. Sometimes I feel that how they build the romance scene is unnatural. didn't touch my heart. even all the actors have been acted really well, but the scene is just, like, not good enough. I feel they are too rush in making love story, I just didn't understand, how could 2 boys love the same girl that fast? when the girl did nothing? when there's nothing special moment? didn't make sense for me.

There are a lot of scenes that I think were not important, I feel so bored and sleepy, so I have to push faster button to go to the next scene.

I hope the story of the drama will get better, so I don't have to drop it, because I really want to watch Bogum in a great drama. I still gonna check the next episode. if it's nay, I'll drop it.

update:
it’s not getting better. i’ll find a better one.

After the success of the Reply series and Itaewon Class, it was perhaps inevitable that a Korean drama would come along and try to merge the two together. This series happens to be that exact drama. While there are some high points to this series, ultimately it’s the lows that this one will be remembered for.

On paper at least, the story is actually quite intriguing. Split between four distinct protagonists, this coming-of-age drama splits its run-time between three friends and a wildcard love interest in Jeong-Ha. Each of these characters has a very distinct familial structure and big dreams for the future.

Most of the big dramatic set pieces revolve around a teased love triangle and Hye-Jun’s career, which is reserved for the second half of this drama. I won’t spoil anything here but toward the midway point, there’s a consistent effort to try and add more drama and scandals, both of which work quite well to hide the growing flaws.

Unfortunately, given the desire to try and stick to realism for much of this series, the script completely forgets about character development a lot of the time. There’s absolutely no comeuppance for any of the horrible people or deeds committed across the season.

This lack of growth ultimately translates across to the pacing and overall feel of the show which flatlines into a melodramatic lull and never really recovers. While the individual bursts of drama are good and there are times where I was fully committed to seeing how this one would play out, on reflection there just isn’t enough here to make these 16 hours wholly satisfying. And that’s before mentioning the lackluster finale.

It’s a shame because there are definite highlights here but they’re far too infrequent and sporadic to make for a wholly satisfying watch. While I don’t want to use the word boring here, there are definitely moments that’ll have you wondering how long is left until the end of the eps.

And that’s a real shame because on paper this series has all the ingredients to succeed. Despite a nice heady blend of influences, the final product is something that’s simply “okay”. In a very strong year of Korean dramas, okay is unfortunately not good enough. This series is sadly destined to end up as one that’s unlikely to break records any time soon.

Good but not a very satisfying ending
(Spoilers regarding the relationship)

This drama came along just at the right time in my life when I very much needed some comfort. For that, thank you, Record of Youth :)

This drama had the most wonderful, non-toxic, respectful, kind, and not-cold ML. For the majority of the drama his and the FL's relationship was beautifully communicative, healthy, fun, flirty, and understanding. They also had great chemistry together and had their own separate lives and goals apart from each other.

I wasn't truly mad about the break-up like I thought I would be. That probably had to do with how the drama wasn't solely focused on the romance. It was more slice-of-life with a slice of romance. Lol. Pardon my lame joke. That being said, I can understand why many reviewers and commenters were upset by it. I get it. I didn't like the break-up either. I think she should have held on.

Now, aside from the romance, I loved the side characters. Hae Hyo's story was very well done in particular. And the commentary on the difficulties right from the start of being born into a poor family versus having an advantage right from the beginning was hard-hitting. He started several feet in front of Hye Joon in the race of life. Of course it would be almost impossible for him to catch up or pass him when he lacks the support and resources he has.

I hate when those in power say ""Pull yourself up by your bootstraps."" Easy for you to say. Sure, it's possible for someone from the poorest family in the poorest neighborhood going to the poorest school to become a millionaire someday. But, it's close to impossible. Possible, but close to impossible. And you can have all the talent and drive in the world but if you don't have connections it's almost impossible to get many jobs. They always ask if you know someone in the company/industry. And if you do you always have an edge over even the most hard-working candidate. It's sadly why the cycle of poverty continues. Generally, the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.

Anyway, in conclusion, I found this drama very soothing as well as true-to-life a lot of the time.

Well portrayed record of youth
It was great! This type of drama is a gem wherein there's no certain plot and is unpredictable. The main lead was too good to be true and is perfectly matched to Park Bo-Gum's image.

It was nice to see a love story different from what's portrayed usually. It was overall open-minded. They showed various points of view of characters which I commend and covered family, money, dreams, career, friendships, and relationships which composts the youth. It also gave me an idea of the entertainment industry.

The only downside was the sequence: it was confusing as they back and forth to present and past. Moreover, the scenes were not balanced; I got tired of hearing them bicker.

If you'll watch this because of romance then nope — a very big no-no. You might get disappointed because there was no single pint of romantic chemistry so just don't. But if you're into the youth genre then this is well.

Self explanatory title
Record of youth is exactly how the title says it, a wholesome record of the journey of youths with different backgrounds, upbringings and financial statuses, but same big dreams and ambitions. Moreover since the plot took a holistic approach to the characters, there was a very honest character development there with realistic scenarios that happen in the life of people pursuing their respective professions; hence the drama felt like something that might be the story of a neighbourhood acquaintance than something fictitious happening on screen. Park Bo Gum surprised me I had to say. To me he always felt like this good looking actor with a character portrayal of freshness, naivety and innocence, but in this drama you get to see really the inner depths, struggles, anxieties, frustrations, self-doubt, betrayal, anguish, loneliness, so many different shades that made his act probably the most suitable for this character over all. Other than him all the actors did a fabulous job overall playing their characters. I also liked that the friendship was so honest and didn't disappear into some dark cliches of jealousy and betrayal. Whatever they felt, wether envy or pride, they talked about it openly like good best friends do and thats another reason why I felt like this was a neighbourhood story. They also tried to show friendship beyond financial status and real understanding of each other according to how the modern world works rather than open cliche discrimination like in those old dramas. By the way, who else thought Shine Ae Ra was hot in this drama ?? Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this drama and highly recommend it!

My true feeling about this drama
When I was started watching this drama it made me feel happy and the story explain the importance of friendship, It also tells how people are hardworking to achieve the goal. In this drama, all the actors play their roles really well. When it comes to the story, the first half was really good but it comes to the second half it was quite a disappointment. I had high hope while started watching this drama but I was made so sad. I think the ending of the story can be better.
It has a wonderful Ost and cast. when I saw this drama made a reality check that whether I am doing the job I that like to do and also dream high and work hard with your sincere heart you will surely achieve the goal. I really enjoyed watching this drama. This drama has a great message for us "" When you go in of search of honey you must expect to be stung by bees"" and ""Who you are tomorrow beginning with what you do today""

Had potential and then it fizzled
I took this series on to check out more Park Bo Gum works but realised that my hopes for a bingeable series was dashed. The actors were top notch, I didn't have a problem with the acting. What didn't work for me was the story. The concept of following three people chase their dreams was fine, but it was the drawn out and fragmented execution of the storyline that got me yawning half way through the series. I think I fast forwarded the last two episodes just to finish. Out of respect for the talented actors, I didn't drop it.

I could not believe the disappointment I felt
Generally speaking I love coming of age dramas, as I am as well doing so hehe.

This one though felt really hypocritical.

At times really unecessarily painful, at other times really bittersweet and at other times completely out of touch with reality it felt like a big joke when I finished it.

Up until episode 10 I would say I had so much fun watching it but I think after that it just decides it wants to look realistic when the whole premise from the beginning is far from it. And yes maybe I am biased because of whatever it is that happened that I didn't like, but they really had it all just to let it bleed to death.

It feels as if the only well written part of this is the male lead and his family, everything else seems half-hearted and dishonest, with some honourable exceptions. Especially the way the female lead acted at times makes me think it was most definitely the script to blame because sodam is overall quite the actress.

Anyway I would HONESTLY not recommend it.
Unless you just wanna see bogum, that was the sole reason I finished it anyway. Yeah that's all.

Interesting and had a good start! Lackluster ending, unfortunately, and almost none of the character arcs had a good wrap up. I think this drama was meant to be more slice of life than it advertised itself, and than it began. It almost had the semblance of a plot.

However I feel that things came too easily to the main couple, that they lacked chemistry except for in one scene, and that the hardships the ML went through were extremely unrealistic and overplayed. It's not a waste of time to watch this, but I can't fully recommend it and it's definitely not worth a rewatch. Unfortunately somewhere in the middle it lost all the momentum it had built up and went into rapid decline.

I was disappointed and I just wanted more
There is nothing wrong with a drama being overdramatic, as long as the overdramatic adds to the storyline or actually pertains to the story. In this case, I felt like there was too much drama that was just somewhat meaningless. The male lead, Park Bo-Gum or Hye-jun, after starting to get famous kept on running into problems and honestly, after a while it just got boring. I did not feel like it added to his character or make him a stronger person, just a huge lack of character development.

Let's talk about the poster for the show itself, I felt was not really even focusing on who the show was really about. The poster makes it seem like its about those three characters mainly, when in reality, it was really about Park Bo-Gum's character, I mean even at some point the female lead gets pushed to the side. Speaking of the female lead, Park So-Dam or Jeong-ha, there was also a huge lack of character development with her or really any other character in the show. Specifically with her, we were clued into her family problems and how those issues have lead to her being cautious when it comes to romantic relationships, but those issues were never addressed. The FL continued to just be in the dark alone with her own thoughts and continued to be upset alone while the ML knew nothing about it because he assumed she was fine and that they were happy together. That was what made me hate their relationship even more, they never really knew what the other was thinking because they never spoke about their problems or when they were upset. Byeon Woo-Seok or Hae-yo, the last person in the poster for the show, I thought in a way was the only character to actually change. Hae-yo is depicted as being in love with the FL even though she has a boyfriend, but he continues to just be her friend. As the ML gets more popular than he does, we start to see a change in Hae-yo's character, we see him struggle jealousy, anger, reality. We finally see him come face to face with the fact that he has not made it this far on his own but because he has had a helping hand the whole way. He was the only character I felt actually developed over the course of the show, he struggled very much with self esteem issues and being insecure but near the end, he started to realize that he wanted to take total control of his own life, and he proceeded to do so.

Overall, I felt the show lacked in some areas. It was fun to watch at the beginning but I would say that at about episode 8 or so, it just went down hill from there. But I mean everyone has their own opinion. :)

I don’t understand the bad reviews
I’m not going around and writing reviews for every drama I watch. Either I like it or I don’t. I was very disappointed with all the bad reviews on this drama. I felt it was good. Very realistic. Not every drama has to have a soapy ending and not every story needs to be spelled out into details. I think it will drag the story and it will get boring pretty quickly. The actors did an excellent job portraying their characters and their life experiences. It was interesting to see how vicious the entertainment industry can be and how damaging the trolls comments can be to an actor’s life when all they’re trying to do it’s their dream job which is to entertain us. In the process, you’ll need to make sacrifices since life is not peaches and roses; you’ll also have your great supporters because they believe in you and the one ones the hate your choices because they think you’re making a mistake with your life choices. This has been one of the most realistic refreshing drama I’ve seen in 2020.

don't expect too much
i personally didn't mind the show and i kind of wish there were more like it. a lot of people say it was disappointing but i wasnt expecting much when i first watched it anyway. i was looking for a kdrama that didn't have much drama and i got what i wanted. yeah, it's a bit slow but it's sort of an easy finish when you just want to wind down. everyone says the ending wasnt good and even though it wasnt great, it's definitely not the worst out there. the story is literally what the title is, 'record of youth'. its borderline realist. i like that it doesn't entirely focus on love either, i kind of like how it's a bit unstable. would i watch it again? maybe not, but i don't regret watching it once.

Cute and not horrible!
A couple things about this drama, and if you watch a lot of kdramas, you’re probably used to way more drama. This is definitely not that kind of drama!

First, This is a feel good, watch characters develop, grow and overcome the pressures elders put on them growing up. That alone is inspiring and eye opening for young people trying to break through different social classes… YOU CAN DO IT!

Second, the cast is seriously amazing. They seem to work so well together… from the main characters to support characters, everyone plays their part well… well enough to hate some of them. Even those hated characters!

Third, it wraps up nicely. This is not a drama that will leave you hanging…. Though episode 12-15 are a bit boring, you see pain and growth in this time.

If you’re looking to take a break from those tear jerking dramas and just want to root for characters that you know will succeed, this is your drama!! Plus, swoooooon over the amazing cast!!!

kinda boring
I really really wanted to like this drama. And for the most part, I did. I liked the family dynamic of the main lead and I liked his struggle to fame, esp the bit where he was confused about whether to take on the last shot of opportunity. It felt relatable in many ways. However, the biggest miss for me was the lackluster chemistry between the two main leads. I liked them individually but together they were kinda boring. Disappointed because I usually really enjoy their work as actors and I was looking forward to seeing them together on screen.

I saw in it something else
Again, I am going up the river of dissapointed reviews. Again, I saw in this drama something else and I don’t regret it. Again, I want to be that weird one and give you my opinion which will be totally confused.

I know I often focuse on psychology of characters, which is pretty basic, but I have feeling that this part of this subject doesn’t take much of our attention. Which I don't like much, maybe. Supressing emotions, communication that no longer works as before, personality problems and more. These are topics I would love to see more in dramas. And yeah, Record of Youth gave me this in full experience, that I was anxious. Maybe I liked it because I saw myself in main characters, maybe. Or maybe not and I loved it for thought which created this story.

Record of Youth doesn’t tell a story about romance which never won’t die, we won’t get many miracles here and also not many dramatic scenes that we are used to from dramas like It’s okay to not be okay and so on.

I can understand why many people don’t like it, second half just hits differently and even though this part of the story gave me headache and I was feeling like I was watching my life crushing, the bigger impression from this show I have. In second half, story turns of, it’s not about a girl, how she falls in love with boy in real life and the same goes for him, we follow life change: Hyejun starts to be more popular and their relationship begins to stagn, it is on place where way out of it isn’t that sure anymore. They didn’t communicate about their hardships and they are with themselves pretending they are okay. She doesn't want to burden him, he does the same. It was amazing watch how it doesn’t work anymore, atmosphere of their relationship got me, not happy anymore, it was just sad and even sadder was how they couldn’t talk it out.

Every character has his space, not much, but has. In the end, yeah, I didn’t get answers on all of my questions, but this is again something, which I somehow like. There were plots which were only outlined, but not finished, still it suited the story so much. Because timing of everything was off and story told us everything is not that easy and it definitely can’t be.

This show definitely has lacks, I admit, but the thought which it gave me was more important. We got a story about a topic that is not discussed very often, I am reminded of ""At a distance, Spring is Green"", these shows work differently and maybe people are not ready for it or maybe I am just weird, I don’t know that yet. But I love it.

Also big applause for cast, Park Bo Gum gave his best and Park So Dam was fabulous as lead heroine, Heo Hyo was for other people plain, but I saw his internal struggles and again, here we are, with supressing emotions, not talking about it that much. Every character somehow won me over.

I definitely recommend it, but also – you need to have similar thinking as me to like it, it’s a little hard to watch, but worth it.

Are you surprised with the high rating that I give, I have my reason ⬇️
When the most simple scene helps you reflect on the thing that you do, you know that it’s sincere.

This drama is full of sincerity and that what unite all the pieces you’ve seen throughout the story. When I first watched the teaser, I question the genre, “would it be romance? Why does it only look like a slice-of-life drama to me?” Well, it does feel very slow-paced and “boring” in the beginning but later you’ll see that every scene matters. Every character in this drama might show you every side of yourself. Yes, you. In one scene you’ll feel like you know Hye Jun like you’ve been in his shoes, on another scene you’ll feel like no one know you better than Hye Hyo does. Yes, everyone is so relatable as the writer shows everyone’s story.

Can you imagine being all wet after enjoying some ""good rain""? You will catch a cold and feeling all uncomfortable, but you glad you took the chance to have fun there when it happened. Watching this drama feels like that to me, so does everything that happened in the story. You will wonder if you've done the right thing, regret it, but you then think you might probably do the same thing if that would ever happen to you again.

I appreciate the writer for appreciating every character in the movie. Although there’s nothing new here, the plot feels like it was not made to satisfy the viewer, but to let the characters be honest with themselves. That’s cool, tho! — OOT but, from this drama, I realized that people can stay being who they are but their thought & action toward certain things (and or people) can change. That is a realistic yet hopeful point of view. Love it, hehe.

This might not be most people's cup of tea, however...if you have not watched this drama yet, I would still recommend this! Who knows that this drama would help you appreciating a silent night and your own room like never before.

IT REALLY ISN'T THAT BAD.
I was really put off by the show because of all the really bad reviews but not everyone is the same so I decided to move forward and watch it for myself and I don't regret a single minute/second of it. This show truly isn't as bad as people are making it out to be but I also mean; to each their own. I've watched so many dramas and sometimes it's so repetitive and we expect so many things but when people see big named Actors like Park Bo Gum, they instantly have high expectations but I go into shows with the minimal and let it speak for itself. I think when it came to this show, so many people saw big names and instantly wanted to be wowed and was let down because they didn't really pay the story much attention and to me, it was a really nice story. There was a lot not explained and so that may have been a little off putting but it honestly was such a good show, I am not disappointed at all.

It starts off with 3 people that have a dream, your ML who is an aspiring actor, your FL lead who wants to be a huge make up artist and the SML who is in the spot light the and ML is kind of in his shadow, not because he's not good enough but because he's genuinely a good person and just sees the good in everything and everyone and that's a down fall. I'm glad there truly was not a love triangle, because maybe then I would've been pissed but the SML really laid back and it wasn't terrible except for when he wanted the pity because of his downfall but really, he needed to figure it out on his own, he wasn't a bad person though. I loved the ML and FL together, not the chemistry we expect but they had a decent connection and worked well together and I liked it. Now the ending wasn't what we wanted or expected but honestly, I was not disappointed at all, I was hoping and praying that the ML got his big break, that he was finally going to make it and make himself happy along with his family, especially his grandpa and that's literally everything I wanted out of this show and more.

The acting truly was great. I don't expect anymore or any less from Park Bo Gum and Park So Dam, they truly are a beautiful pair in their own acting style and I appreciate it to the end. I also really enjoyed Byeon Woo Seok and their friends. I really liked everyone. The family, the extras, it was all exciting.

The music was fantastic! I love this OST.

I personally may rewatch it down the road but I'm not sure when, I think the downfall of this was like any drama where they ran out of things and needed to spice it up so they did what they did. With the extra drama when he became big and etc; also let's not forget their relationship, but I mean, I understand why it happened and the choices and I stand by it.

Overall, I personally enjoyed it and thought it was binge worthy; I see SOOO many terrible reviews and opinions and honestly, don't let that determine whether this was good or not because it truly was a good story, with good actors and actresses and though not mind blowing, still a all in all good show. I think so many people went into this show with the highest of expectations because of the names and really held it to such a high standard and you really just cannot do that with any show you watch tbh. Every persons piece of work and style is different and you just can't expect the same again and again. I liked that it had a normal feel to kdramas but also it's own unique story like I said. I really did enjoy it.

It had potential
This is the first drama that I watched while it was airing. This was definitely an interesting experience, and I’m almost certain that this skewed my overall opinion of this drama in a positive way. Because I never had to watch the drama for more than two episodes a week, there was no way I’d get tired of the mundane storyline that some people in the reviews are claiming for this drama to have. While I definitely agree that watching only two episodes a week helped me break up the drama into watchable chunks, I do still believe, looking back at the drama now, that the story in the second half never really progressed anywhere. The beginning of this drama was beautifully executed. The conflicts that both of the characters were facing were not exactly creative or new, but they felt fresh nonetheless. Watching a wannabe actor struggle to get hired for even the smallest role was extremely interesting, and I waited to tune in to every new episode to see Hye Jun finally achieve all of his dreams. I will only briefly address the fact that his rise to fame was extremely unrealistic. I don’t believe that a small role in a drama and a cute face are enough to turn a desperate actor into a national superstar, but I’ll just attribute that to the magic of kdramas and move on. Jeong ha’s character was quite different from your regular kdrama female lead because she was independent and wasn’t willing to give up her ambitions and beliefs even in the very last episode of the drama. Nevertheless, I got slightly frustrated with her when she said something along the lines of, “I like honest people,” or “I never lie to people” for the THIRTIETH time in a row. While my engagement with the drama went up with every single episode even in the second half, I will admit that the first half of the drama is really where it shined. While the tensions in the second half went up dramatically, they never led anywhere, and I was left with a feeling of unfulfillment when the final episode ended. I realize that the writer was probably trying to leave the ending open, but she wasn’t quite able to pull it off the way she tried to, so the viewers were left confused and unsatisfied. None of the side stories really amounted to anything, either, and I wish there was a proper conclusion to the second romance story arc and Hae Hyo’s internal struggles with his self esteem and his relationship with his mother. As a last random concluding point to this review, I would just like to bring up the awkward crying scenes in the drama. I want to say there were at least 4 different characters that had a “crying” scene in this drama, and I swear to god, every single one of them made me cringe SO HARD. Anyway, I’d still recommend this drama for Park Bo Gum (how fitting that his last drama before his military service is a drama about a character who left to do his military service at the end of the drama) and Park So Dam (She’s so cute what the heckkkk). Just don’t get your hopes up and have a good time with it. The drama had some very nice moments if you look past the disappointing ending.

Must watch
A very good drama frankly. The story is not common ... I expected their friendship to the three guys to be broken, accompanied by brawl, hatred, revenge but everything is settled unexpectedly 😲😲😲 ... I expected to have second lead syndrome since the woman is not going to like it back but they presented the scenes in a sweet way frankly ... the story didn't focus on that. The ex of the lead role, not at all viper ... I love ... there were more big-hearted characters. The family reunion was just touching. Friendship and family was just magical ... I highly recommend it ... it is a must see ... you will not regret it.

Realistic and Relatable
I really enjoyed this drama. I will surely miss it! The characters are relatable, this made me reflect on my life as well. My goals, dreams, and other stuff in life. I learned a lot.

I liked that this wasn't just a love story, it's also about family relationships and friendship.
I understand that many people are disappointed maybe because it's too realistic and can be boring for some, dramas are usually dramatic and exaggerated to be entertaining but this was a fun ride for me.

The romance part was also realistic, that's how celebrities love life normally are they don't last long, they break up because of busy schedules, but of course, in this drama, it was more than that. You can't just have it all at once, that's life. Also, I love the OST.

The Title is Correct
This series was like an entire journal entry of someone's 20s. It went through the emotions and changes that can occur during young adulthood. Although I knew by the end of episode 14 that this drama wasn't going to give the typical ending, I still held out hope that I was wrong.

Acting:
Park Bo Gum. - this isn't the first film I've seen him in but omg can we talk about these guys acting. SUPERB! legit makes you FEEL everything. great acting and directing!

The friend Group - I appreciate that this time i watched a drama with a group of male friends, I loved their chemistry and how they portrayed their characters.

Female actresses: played their roles. I respected Park So Dam's acting but her character just made me so annoyed sometimes.

Recommendation:
I am not rewatching this. I much rather watch something new.
I am not going to say it was a waste of time, because I enjoyed the first 14 episodes.
It can be watched as a filler when waiting for a new drama's episode or if you want to watch something that won't leave an emotional imprint on your soul - like the typical kdramas

its a inspiring drama so maybe many people did not liked this drama. But for me this drama is worth watching and i binge watched this drama.. all the male leads were handsome and there friendship and carrer literally helped me alot for my carrer. FL did a great acting. specially the role of mother's and all family members of both male leads were literally stunning. i gave 9.5/10 because ending was somehow incomplete and maybe rushed. i did not satisfied with ending but i can move on because of whole series. it was good experience watching this series. ♡ IT IS ACTUALLY WORTH WATCHING INSPIRING DRAMA ON CARRER AND DREAM. GIVE IT A TRY WATCH IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND IF YOU WILL WATCH THIS DRAMA FOR FUN MAYBE THEN THIS DRAMA IS NOT FOR YOU. ♡

A really beautiful and comprensible love story
This is my first time reviewing a drama because even though I didn't a gave the highest score doesn't mean that I don't think you (my beautiful people, that are reading this❤️) shouldn't watch this. You all shall see!
I did enjoyed this drama so I don't understand the low reviews. This is a story about 2 normal people that understand and love each other. It's a very plausible love story with some ups and downs but nothing over the top, this is the type of love that I want to have in the future (my single ass hoping for me to find a Park Bo Gum in Portugal ) I know that some people love the cliché - the cold CEO that is fond for his sweet secretary (including myself 😆) or the big ""star"" that has fallen in love for a girl when he was in elementary school (and for some reason they lost contact) but still after 15 years, he still love her (totally love it😍).

- : the casting is awesome (me evoking Vvveeeerrronnniiicccaaa Park -TSLoMS) Park Bo-gum and his sweet and lovely eyes and Park So Dam with her carismatic presence, both of them are great actors. they did acted so well the lifes of two young lovers that understand each other and are struggling to be someone better or to achieve a goal. I did liked the friendship between ML and his friends, the love of ML for his family and the FL. Loved to see how independent and goal focused is the FL, she isn't expecting to receive any kind of favor or benefits just because she is dating a famous, the only thing that she is expecting is his caring and love. She is girl that without stopping to support her lover she can make time for her friends, family and work.
I liked the main story but really liked too the others ""universes"" in the drama ML's family, the second lead story and his family.


Overall I am a weirdo with Netflix in home that is obsessed with Asian dramas.

I mostly liked the ending & the drama
I read some of the reviews before I finished watching Episode 16 Finale. So my expectations
were low, but when I finished I had a smile on my face.

I read one comment saying this drama seemed like a fan pleasing story of the real Park Bo Gum. I somehow feel his career life showing his professionalism and his kindness and that his huge success has not changed the essence of who he is -- I hope that is true. If not, his acting is off the charts lol.

I especially loved the last scene in the ending montage where Park Bo Gum playing the resident doctor and gives that mischievous smile as he is walking out the door. That one moment made me a fan. I've only watched him in 2 dramas: Encounter which I could not finish and Hello Monster.

Back to the ending - it was an open ending but I like to think her wearing those sneakers a lot (they looked worn) with the adorable cartoon couple depicting the happiest moments of their relationship gave me hope for a reconciliation. I hope the writer will offer some clarity on her intention of that scene,

I do agree with another reviewer that there was a lot of wasted time with the reporter, the agent and Do Ha. That time could have been filled with followups on the characters that the writer spent writing time developing characters that we became invested in & grew to love . We definitely got shortchanged! Hae Yo is listed as a main lead! And some followup with Jinu & Haena would have been nice too. I'm going to lower my 8.0 because of being cut off mid story. Too me, that is not an ending if you do not tie up story lines. This is Writing 101, track the. arcs of your characters! They did not even get the benefit of open endings. Makes me appreciate even more the writing perfection of the Stranger & Stranger 2 writer.

Disappointed + Low-key hurt
I love Park Bo Gum soooooo much, his acting has never ceased amaze me , and has always held my interest, even in this i passed his pain to me, every time cried i almost did. But, this storyline is not good, they did not even used the female lead well, she deserved so much more. Also the second lead 's character was kinda annoying. I was so disappointed by how the lack of chemistry between the ML and FL, they were just forced together, and neither of them seemed ready for a relationship. I had to drop this drama because the romance in the storyline was so forced.

ok I think my short interpretation of this would be a modern 21st century love story that is still stuck in a cliche mold?
their relationship/chemistry feels natural and they dealt with the fan thing as best as they could (the best thing would've been no fan-to-lovers, but oh well)

the families are booorring and unfitting, I do not care for them one bit.

and I don't really care for the male friendship, even the bromance feels flat.. I don't get why or how they are friends, they just feel like 3 people that are in the same space. also the fact that they didn't give the fl any sort of friendship or family is alarming ;/

so the worst point of this is the super duper cliche arc they used for the fl! the drunk pity party that makes the guy fall for her weak ""cute"" side, the ""it's all my fault everyone hates me!"", the ""I've never dated before becasue I am a sad unworthy person"", the fact that she bickers back with everyone and then suddenly becomes docile is just bad writing...
in ep2 she was answering back to every criticism her boss told her as if they were friends and now she's the weak silent victim to the crazy boss who's randomly out to get her ;/
and then the ml is being possessive already? ""don't drink with other me becasue you look cute"".. you don't own her ;/

the worst sign is when I skip an ep and I don't feel like I missed anything, I didn't realize I didn't watch ep3 until ep4 was over and I was looking for the next ep xD
I personally have a rule, I give dramas 1/4 a chance and if I don't like them I drop

a really cool premise with refreshing characters, but extremely poor writing.
Let's not play pretend and acknowledge that this drama is one of the mid-tier range ones that does not shy away from cheesy dialogues and kdrama stereotypes. (eg: What's Wrong w secretary Kim, Weightlifting fairy) It is not one with cool and sophisticated storylines- it does not try to appear like that. So once you treat it as just a Mid-Tier Drama, it really becomes much more enjoyable as it lifts off the pressure of expecting anything life-changing from it.
This drama is definitely not everyone's cup of tea and a disclaimer of it being a really ordinary and typical drama should be made. With that being said, I still found myself getting hooked in it really fast and thoroughly enjoying it! Esp the leads' rship.
But firstly, here are some major blind spots and weak points that caused this drama to be less enjoyable.

1. The relationship dynamic between Hye-Jun and Jeong-Ha was not developed enough to start a dating relationship so early on in the series. It is definitely a tendency for kdramas to drag on the “should-we-date” phase, forcing you to watch more eps of their flirtations- so it is definitely something to applaud that they did not waste time on this and simply cut to the chase that they were dating. But sadly their relationship dynamic was not stable enough as a couple, it felt so sudden and forced. I really really enjoyed their friendship dynamic in the first few eps (that’s what got me binge-watching). It’s such a waste to quickly jump into a dating rship, they had such a strong friendship going on. With that being said, it was not about starting the relationship per se that ruined the show - it’s how they completely changed So Dam’s character after they started dating!

2. Bad character writing for Jeong-Ha (Park So Dam)
I think this is the weakest point of the drama. As mentioned, what really drew me into the series was their friendship dynamic, and this is largely due to the character of Jeong-Ha. She’s ordinary, hardworking, and witty. When she was in scenes with Bo Gum, her character shined even brighter. But right when they started dating, she instantly became this flat character- nonchalant, apathetic, and just overall stupid??? It made their relationship looked super weak and one-dimensional. The lines they said also felt super scripted. I saw a lot of comments saying this as well, but I think the root problem is actually the bad character development for So Dam. Which I’m so mad, bcs she is the freaking actress from Parasite. Like, Parasite. Like the one that just won an Oscar??? She was so amazing in Parasite, so it’s impossible to say that the problem is her acting skills. It’s definitely the character writing- why didn’t they milk her acting chops more??

3. Really, really, really unnecessary sub-plots. (as with many kdramas....) Even if they were necessary, they always just left it hanging with so many loose ends left untied.

Most reviews commented on this as well, specifically directing it to the scenes with the leads' family. But I actually enjoyed Hye Jun and his family’s sub-plot especially when they showed how Hye Jun is faced with opposition within his home. That was a really interesting topic to cover in a k-drama, but as they went on...it felt kinda confusing...and unnecessary. Like the scenes about the father’s work, or the scenes about the brother’s work, or the scenes about the grandad’s modelling job (necessary, but they gave TOO MUCH screen time for that small plot). They should’ve just streamlined and stuck to the dynamic between Hye Jun’s acting dream and the rest of the family.

Then there are the extremely unnecessary characters just to fill screen time and to create more “noise”. Like the ms.Kim reporter? Like who tf? The ex-manager Tae-Su and bitchy actor Park Do Ha? lol.
Like Charlie Jung? I think first few episodes context was already enough, idk why they brought him back later lol and included a very weird sub-plot about gay rumours...yeah it’s not gonna age well. And Hye-Jun’s ex LOL, like we literally do not care. As well as the sub-plot of Jin-U and Hae Na's rship... I might even dare say that the scenes w Hae-Hyo and Jin-u became more and more unnecessary, couldn't feel their bromance at all. Just really bad momentum overall in these sub-plots.
——————--------------------------
Overall, it’s still 8/10 for me, even with all these weak points.
Here's why you SHOULD still watch it:
1. You should definitely watch if you like Park Bo Gum, his character is the one that was maintained well throughout. A few were saying how this is somewhat biographical to his story, so you would definitely love him more after watching this. This is also his last show before he got enlisted into military!! (tbh i suspect that's one of the reasons why the plots felt ao rushed haha, cos they have to rush for his enlistment maybe??? who knows)

2. I also really appreciate the relationship between the leads, despite point no.2 above^. It’s really mature and easy to relate to. Esp the part where they portrayed consent in their kissing haha. It's also somewhat unique and a fun arena to explore, with the whole fan-and-bias rship.

3. Make sure to not rush this show. It's a slow watch and that's the way it should be. The first time I watched it I binged 4eps in a row and I would feel so queasy after that. But when my brother was watching (in a much slower pace), I found myself re-watching really enjoyably and finding a deeper appreciation for some scenes I deemed unnecessary at first.

4. A really cool premise to explore! With the whole modelling and acting and part-time gigs that PBG had to do, it was so fun to have a glimpse on how the K-entertainment industry looks like (even though it might not be that realistic). I actually wished that spent more time to flesh out this aspect of the drama- instead of so many unnecessary sub-plots- this is after all that made this show stood out.

5. Also,,, ad-placements were not too bad. So that’s a good thing. Unlike The King 🤮🤮

This drama was make with the feelings of us fans taken into consideration.
This is one of my all time favourite dramas, and for one reason in particular: it feels like my imagination came to life.

The story ofhow Jeongha, a fangirl of Hyejun gets to meet him and actually become friends with him is something that I am sure most fans would love to experience.

Its not just a romance, we get to experince friendship at it's finest. Passion and determinate at it's peak. The story is just so inspiring.

You can learn so much from this drama. You can laugh and cry and relate to almost everything.

What made this drama really memorable to me was thst fact that I watched the episodes as it was being realeased while on call with my best friend.

Due to Covid, we could not watch together but just having that phone call while watching such an amazing drama was enough. Seeing the friendship between the characters even strenghtened my friendships!

This drama is so amazing, its worth the watch 100%

Wow, there are very mixed opinions on this drama! Some would say this drama went absolutely no where and others would say that this was a beautiful and compelling story. I stand somewhere in between (despite my rating).

Reasons I watched this drama:
1. It's story about the the entertainment industry
2. Park Bo Gum
3. The mixed reviews

Reason you should watch this drama:
1. A dive into family dynamics and relationships (grandfather-grandson, siblings, mother-son, father-son etc...)
2. To understand the struggles of the entertainment industry - on screen and behind the scenes
3. A message of keeping to morals and principles, despite the pressure from others

Reasons why people may have disliked this drama:
1. The ending
2. Slow pacing/ The lack of action
3. Unnecessary plotlines


Story
This drama isn't supposed to have a dramatic storyline. The key focus is supposed to be on the familial, romantic and platonic relationships that the characters have, and how entering the entertainment industry will effect them.
I wasn't fussed about the slow pacing of the story line.

Episodes 1-10 were enjoyable. They delved into Hye-Joon's and Jung-Ha's relationships, aspirations and principles well. I liked watching the struggles and the determination needed to reach their goal. I fell in love with the Grandpa and his dynamic with everyone.

One thing that I especially enjoyed was the looming enlistment time. Although I, myself, am a female and not from South-Korea, so I will never have to go through it; I learnt how difficult it was to choose when to join - to drop your career, to leave your family. It was an interesting process to watch.
Everything was smooth sailing with the occasional drama with Hye-Joon's ex and Hae-Hyo's growing jealousy.

However, I will admit that from ep 11 I began to skip through episodes. I lost interest in the continuous scandals and rumours. One scandal plotline would have be fine, particularly the Charlie incident, as it explored Korean society's views on people in the LGBTQ+ community. But back to back scandals were too much to take. The former manger was not an interesting antagonist, he was just boring, repetitive and annoying. And I have a hard time believing that a news reporter, who's job is to alter and obscure the complete truth to captivate readers/ viewers, would completely believe what one of their sources told them without considering that they may be lied to.

The plotline between Hae-Hyo and his mother was not the most interesting of plotlines, although it was necessary for a drama about the entertainment industry. I felt it would have been better if the audience was also kept in the dark about the fact that his mother was buying followers. Hae-Hyo was proud of his follower count, and if it were revealed later in the story to the audience that his follower count was fake or even when he found out himself, it would have been more gut wrenching. Because we found out so early on, I pitied him every time he talked about his success, or that one time when Hae-Hyo was chosen over Hye-Joon for a role because he had a higher number of fans - I just felt bad for him.

A plotline that was kind of glossed over, is the fact that Hae-Hyo's parents clearly were having some marriage issues. They don't communicate well with each other, they don't agree on the path for their children, they don't even sleep in the same bed. She even tries to suffocate him with a pillow while he's sleeping and it turns into a comedic scene. I felt that their plotline was there, just to prove that being rich wasn't perfect and to make you sympathise even more for Hae-Hyo.


Cast/ Acting
This was an anticipated drama for many, being the last drama of Park Bo Gum before he enlisted for his mandatory service. He most definitely didn't disappoint. His crying scenes felt so real and raw that I was half convinced that this was merely an opportunity to let out his emotions in a façade of acting. This is my second drama with Park Bo Gum; my first being 'Love in the Moonlight' (which I have yet to finish), and in both he played his character well. His ability to play a sweet, innocent guy, to an antagonist in the production that Hye-Joon was in, was mesmerising.

Although I have yet to see Parasite and Cinderella and the Four Knights, I know that Park So Dam was also highly anticipated in this drama. She has a very natural way of acting, like she isn't playing a character, but is actually Jung-Ha. She portrayed both an independent, strong willed character and a fan girl extremely well.

Romance/ Chemistry
At first I was sceptical when he confessed his feelings only 5 episodes into the show, because, as we all know, if the lead gets into a relationship particularly early into the drama the characters are either, not the ultimate couple (second lead), or they will break up with a whole lot of drama, then get back together before the end. Luckily, there were no issues. The romance wasn't explored too greatly and was by no means the main focus of the story, so it was sweet when they had scenes together.
The chemistry that they had was very natural, and they can banter and play off each other without having to force it.

There was an intention of a love triangle. But, I don't believe that Hae-Hyo ever stood a chance as Jung-Ha seemed completely loyal to Hye-Joon and even admitted to regretting calling him for help, when Hye-Joon was unavailable. The ex girlfriend wasn't pushy enough to be a part of a love triangle. She knew that she should back off quite early on and she was mostly introduced to cover up the rumours.

The chemistry that the Sa family had was perfect. Although I am not from a large family, I felt that the dynamic between them felt very familial and real. The relationships between mother and son, and grandfather and grandson, made me want to be a part of their family.

The Ending
Many did not like the ending. I however enjoyed it, only a few things irked me. We end with Hye-Joon and Jung-Ha breaking up and Hye-Joon and Hae-Hyo enlisting in the army. Which I am completely fine with. I felt that this shows that not everything will go as planned and life isn't as smooth sailing as in the dramas. I especially liked the line she says when they break up 'Promise me that you'll remember the time that we spent together', (that's roughly what it was since I don't have the drama in front of me). I felt that would have been a good closure to their relationship and the drama. Saying not only to Hye-Joon but also to the viewers, that although we watched a drama about their relationship, it doesn't mean that it was insignificant to their lives.

Then we have a two year time skip...

A time skip that I probably wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't literally filled the screen with the words TWO YEARS LATER. They continue as if they never left. We start with Jung-Ha who's driving to her next job. Then we see Hye-Joon being all successful; despite, not having a stable career before he left and we see him unpack his things. Had I looked away from the screen for a couple of minutes I would have thought that it was the same scene as when he was packing to leave.

I liked that the Grandpa's modelling career was going well and that he thanked his son, which made my eyes water. It was a given that Hye-Joon and Jung-Ha would meet up again or else viewers would be dissatisfied, but I felt that they should have just left of with them looking at each other and smiling (something like that) rather than a conversation that they had.

Overall I gave this drama an 8, which may seem high compared to the many negative points I made. However I did enjoy it for the most part, I was intrigued enough to not drop the drama and I did find myself pondering about it during school work. Was it the best of the best? No. Do I regrets spending my past couple of days watching it? No.

Good Enough
I'm torn whether this drama was good or not. It wasn't boring, but it had a rather slow pace; it wasn't cliche, but it didn't really lead anywhere; it had interesting cinematography, but a messy timeline.

So, what drama is 'Record of Youth' ? It's a slice of life, family drama, with some romance and a bit of friendship genre into it. It contains two of the most popular nowadays actors, who, to be honest, could have worked in anything they wanted and yet they chose this drama(...). Simply stated, it's more like a drama about the life of Park Bo Gum with some fiction added to it.

Now, for its components, the slice of life was okay, portrayed with interesting editing and a youthful outlook. The romance was refreshing, original, but, at the end of the day, will not be memorable. The family drama, however, was the driving force of the story. The dynamics of the three youngsters with their families were probably the best things in the drama, as they were real and one could sympathize or even identify with them.

Finally, the performances were great and the atmosphere was spot on. However, there were multiple times when I thought that the story was just pointless and I didn't have anything to anticipate.

So, overall, five and a half out of ten.

a very light drama, the storyline was literally a record. where it was about life of a guy, what he goes through, his relationships, his struggle, stuff like that. at first i find it very fun, i enjoyed the light-ness of the drama, and the way both lead worked hard but stay humble. but i guess i was expecting a lot. in the 2nd half i feel like it was kinda draggy, slow, nothing happened. the issue was handled lightly, so i couldn't feel his and her hard times. there was no climax as well. as much as i enjoyed its lightness i wish more dynamic could taken place, because the potential was there. but still, i love his character, humble no matter how successful he is, and the message the struggle would still be there wherever you are. all in all, i do like it minus the boring slow parts.

Amazing Family and Career Drama
Upfront: I do not understand why this doesn't have a higher rating... I stayed up until 7am to finish this! Let me give you the rundown as to why:

PRO
- This was the first kdrama I've watched (admittedly, I haven't watched a ton) where the story and the characters felt emotionally and psychologically realistic. It's amazingly written and acted and there was no drama for the sake of drama, everything happens for good reasons and all the characters react to problems in individual and believable ways. They felt like real people, not like cardboard cutouts, which is always something I'm looking for in a drama.
- Park Bogum is an amazing actor and he does a fantastic job. Period.
- All the family relationships (Hyejung's, Jeongha's and Haehyo's) were really interesting and realistic. I could especially relate to Hyejung's situation and I cried several times seeing his sweet relationship with his grandpa. I was so happy that most of their family difficulties could be put to rest by the end. It felt really earned, too.
- There were several amazing quotes in this and I might rewatch this drama just to write them down.
- I'm curious about the realities of the acting/modelling life so I found all the behind the scenes stuff really cool. I also liked how seemlessly they wove the scenes from the movies/dramas they shot into this drama. It's a bit overused, but I like this joke where you watch some really intense action scene and then someone yells ""cut!"" and you realize that action scene was just that: a scene, and in reality everybody is at a movie set. They did that a few times. On the same note, I liked that they actually put in the effort to shoot some real scenes for movies and shows that the characters are in and used that to further the story instead of going the cheap route and omitting those things. (My favorite of those being the first movie that Hyejung is in, where he gets to beat up Park Doha. He had such a menacing aura, I would've watched the whole movie but alas.)

Now for the stuff I didn't enjoy 100%, but keep in mind these were minor things (tho I write a lot about them, but that's down to me being able to talk forever about very small things that annoy me, so take that as you will).

CON
- They did my boy Haehyo so dirty. That guy was really nothing but soft and nice and supportive and encouraging and he got jackshit for that. It's not like he didn't have a character arc, bc there was definitely something satisfying about his development. I just felt like he kinda got the short end of the stick in the end. Not even mentioning Jeongha... He was so in love with her and she was so damn rude to him all the time... It got kinda infuriating towards the end and after a cople times I really started wondering why he even liked her.
- Speaking of which: I wasn't super happy with Jeongha. Park Sodam is incredibly cute and pretty (I was in love with her hair in this drama btw), and obviously a great actress, but for me she gave too much of a dead-pan performance. I got almost nothing from her, which stood out because both both Park Bogum and Byeon Wooseok gave really emotional performances (and that's not even mentioning the amazing supporting actors like Park Sooyung who plays Hyejung's dad and Han Jinhee who plays Hyejung's grandpa). I saw her in a state of normalcy, frustration, or happiness. Those were all the emotions I could identify. It's not that her portrayal of the character wasn't realistic, bc Jeonha definitely felt like a real person, it's just that the way she played the character was a bit unlikable bc of the lack of emotions. For example, when she delivered her breakup speech, it felt like a kindergarten teacher explaining something to her students instead of a girlfriend making an incredibly emotionally difficult decision and trying to tell her boyfriend about it.
- Like so many others I also didn't really understand why Jeongha broke up with Hyejung in the end. I empathised with the crushing weight of his immense popularity, I totally understand how that would put a relationship through the ringer, but that wasn't mentioned at all when she broke up with him. So why did she do it? I sure couldn't tell you.

In conclusion: The family drama aspects, career aspects and friendship aspects of this drama are amazing and some of the best written and acted stuff I've ever seen. The romance on the other hand... Gave me very little. You should still watch it for the other stuff.

But that's just my two cents.

Started strong but ended flat
Likes:
1. I really loved Park Bogum in show. Extra special because it is almost like him and not Sa Hye jun reminiscing about his 20s and saying goodbye to all the fans.
2. From the title and from the narration i already felt like they were talking about the past and the romance was always about making good memories so i already braced myself that they were going to break up. I also expected the time jump. I honestly think they are better off as friends. There was something off about their relationship. It was too fast and surreal. And i felt that Hye Jun loved Jungha more. But it's not bad i think it was a prefect way to sum up their 20s.
3. I really loved all the scenes with Hyejun's family. Esp loved how much Gyeong Jun, Grandpa and Yeongnam matured. And how they grew closer.
4. Super loved Minjae! I was hoping we see her get more clients after 2 years and be more successful.
5. I really loved the start with the 3 friends together but it dwindled in the middle and we barely saw them together. At least the last two episodes they were back to almost normal and are close again.
6. I love the ways the drama tried to portray different relationships between parents and children. In the end, parents just wants the best for their children. And children should learn to appreciate their parents more.

Dislikes:
1. The show really started strong. I loved everyone and all the possible storylines, but after Hye Jun hit big time, the story slowly went downhill. Then ending was underwhelming. The romance fell flat. Lots of storylines were never resolved.
2. Park Sodam and her character didnt get a lot of screentime and her character was underdeveloped. It felt like it's Sa Hye Jun show and the girlfriend was a cameo.
3. Too much about Charlie Jung and the endless scandals that are false. I hated Suman and Taesu, they never paid for their misdeeds and are still working. That's how scary media can be and how they can ruin a person's life.

Rating: 7.5/10 ?

I don't know
There are so many I don't know why's as to the aspects of this show. I don't know why I binged it for two days straight. I don't know why I wanted to see certain characters get hit by a truck. I don't know why I dislike the second lead so much. However, what I do know I that this was an ok show with an ok plot, that just hit the spot for me. The story in general is pretty basic, there isn't much conflict faced by the lead except for what the main antagonist caused him when he achieved his dreams. Even though I understand how basic this show is I couldn't help but feel attracted to this. Coming from someone who does not know Park-bo gum I did not come for the hype. I just saw a cute little show pop up on my recommends that I ended up binging. This show does not have a deep plot, but its pretty attractive especially with how the main lead prioritizes his beliefs over fame even if it means looking bad in front of the media

Now onto the negative stigma on this show and why I understand why this is rated so poorly
First of all this last part of my review spoils whether or not there is a happy ending so pls proceed with caution



The last episode was so satisfying for me to watch. To be honest, I was mad at Jeon-Ha's decision, but we kind of had it coming. I mean this story's whole idea is about growth and acceptance and I felt that everyone was so much more mentally stable in the finale which was so much more important than whether or not she accepted. Yes, it would have been nice but I'm not complaining.
As to the second lead I just felt like he liked Jeang-Ha because she was his bestfreind's girl. Since, out of nowhere he began to feel things for her. Which only occurred after the lead got more famous than him and his inferiority complex began. I do feel bad for him in terms if the bs that his mom put him through. However, I still can't come to liking his character, even with all of his crying scenes I can't empathize with him.

Remember at the top when I said I wanted a few characters to get hit by a truck.
Well, hahahahaha you'll meet them :\

All in all, basic plot, basic score, amazing acting, amazing expressions all around. Such a satisfying show to watch, It's not to intense, romantic, or just anything really. I don't know why but I found it to be nice.

Why is the rating so low?
So this is probably one of my current favorite series that I am rewatching. This reminds me a lot of the genre slice of life, something I haven't watch in a while. I am not usually into watching Korean drama because of the eye candy with bad acting but this blew me away!! Park Bo Gum do you have to drive me crazy each time you cry, smile, or just do what you do best! :D

I totally recommend this if you're looking for something that is different. It is not your typical k-drama. The stories between the characters felt so real. Their struggles, their weakness, their relationships, and how each individual portrayed them was probably one of the biggest reasons why I kept watching this series. I can't say enough about how much I love the chemistry between the characters, especially the female and male first lead. It is so beautiful and light-hearted, definitely reminds you of youthful love. I like that it wasn't ""wow you're so beautiful and now I'm in love"", it wasn't a shallow chemistry between characters. The development of understanding what you like and dislike, coming to understand and come to terms with why the relationship grew apart, I love everything about it.

Story-wise, I think it's a simple story of struggles youths have to go through. They're trying to find their next steps in life, either they're a momma boy living under the light and the protection she gives, or you're struggling to try to live your dream regardless if you young or old like grandpa. Most people probably hate the ending but I found it beautiful and different. The ending was open-ended, left a lot to your imagination. In my mind, it was still a happy ending!

Music I am pretty bias when it comes to this because I love Wheein from Mamamoo. Beautiful voice!

Overall, this is probably not for everyone but if you're looking for a good slice of life, family drama, great chemistry between leads, and acting give this a try!

First of all, I have some time that I finished this drama. I didn´t write a review then because it left me with a meh feeling. Maybe because I had bigger expectations than the reality.
The drama starts really interesting. Actually realistic stories than can happen to someone. Normal families, normal relationships. It tries really to speak about the life of someone in theirs twenties. But as the story continues it starts making no sense. Ok, the story and sudden success of Sa Hye Joon, it is a bit strange. Second, the love story between Jung Ha and Hye Joon, in the start it was really nice and it was great that it wasn't the main plot until it became. And I didn't understand what became their relationship in the end. Third, what exactly is the role of Won Hae Hyo in the plot? His friendship with Hye Joon was interesting, but in the end there was there only for the love triangle, which is completely unnecessary. And the end was completely unsatisfying.

REFRESHING!
I really enjoyed this drama! It was different, mature. It got a bit stressful at times, but it was more of an inhale/exhale kind of stress than an ""I want to punch a wall"" one. Now, I did have to skip through some of the episodes towards the end because characters were getting on my nerves a little TOO much(the people who called this drama boring LIED TO ME...).

PROS: PARK BO GUUUUUM(he is too fine), the acting was SUPERB, none of the stakes were too high, the grandpa(too adorable), REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF RELATIONSHIPS and how different sides view different events/conflicts, the way they handled the conflict resolution was perfect, NO PETTY EXES, good communication, funny, happy ending, Jung Ha, and Ms. Lee(MVP).

CONS: The music was aight, it didn't really do much for me. The back and forth of the timeline for each episode was a BIT confusing at first, but I got used to it. I also would've had a couple of characters trip down the stairs...

A beautiful failure
This show had such a strong cast that could have acted the heck out of the poor storyline, but alas, even they could not save this train wreck. I don’t know if covid is to blame or just poor writing. How can a show start off great and then nosedive not even midway through the show? It felt so repetitive and boring that I’m honestly shocked I managed to finish it and didn’t give up midway.

Park So Dam is So Dam talented and yet she is treated as a mere side character. I feel like the mother’s had more screen time than she did. Forget the fact that the relationship between the main two characters just lost its spark after they first got together. There was absolutely no physical affection. Was it because they were afraid to shoot them due to covid? I guess we’ll never know.

I know this drama since it came out and I didn’t watch it until the final episode come out because I thought that Park Bogum and Park Sodam drama will be so fun and I hate it to wait fot a week for another episode.
So I just finished watching this drama, it is lower than my expectation cause I expect a lot from this drama BUT it’s actually not bad, it is just because I expect a lot, there is a lot of cringe scenes (for me) that somehow most of it I couldn’t handle, but if you like it then this is recommended.
You’ll know how entertainment work in this drama, how celebrity work their ass to be popular, dark side of celebrity and how celebrity get hurt by fake scandal.
Overall I enjoy this drama, Park Bogum ❤️❤️❤️

A change of scenery, though not as different as I thought it would be
I'd like to acknowledge that there were indeed many things about this drama I liked, just as much as I disliked.

First off, the pros. A lot of aspects in this drama felt fresh and new to me, a change from the immensely cliche conversations and the promises of some form of a happy ending for the main couple. Contrary to what many other reviews might say, I mostly enjoyed the use of dialogue between the characters. It took me aback at first - because why do most of the characters always know what to say, and in another case, why do they all speak similarly, following the same wavelength of ""smart comebacks"" within every tone of voice? - but then I chose to look at it in a positive light. The randomness of the main leads' conversations made me feel the playfulness they shared together, and offered their chemistry before they even became physically intimate. The script was written with the audience in mind, I could tell - they wanted to steer away from the cliches because the intent of the drama was to perceive the reality of youth in their 20s. A lot of people I've befriended and encountered in real life like talking about just anything that comes to mind, and that sense of relatability shined within these characters.

I like how they chose to perceive the main couple. Somehow, it felt like the perfect balance of cliche tinted with self awareness and reality to me. They choose to be this cheesy couple while also laughing about how cheesy they are. They choose to approach their problems maturely. And of course, when their relationship eventually fell apart, it completely washed over that sense of reality that this drama intended to have. I also like how there was no period in time where the two of them would just be endlessly pining for one another - they begun their relationship as real people do, and perhaps ended it the same way.. When it came to the second lead, it was such a nice change to see the male lead not get so aggressively jealous over their mere existence (which probably has a lot to do with their established close friendship). He instead thanks the second lead for being there when he couldn't be, but at the same time has realistic reactions when it came to it. Not a sprout of long term bad blood developed between the two men, and that was so refreshing to see.

I liked the theme of the drama. A lot. The whole ""follow your dreams and work hard for it!"" is never new when it comes to these romance dramas, and this was just another approach to the idea. I liked that all the characters were neither inherently bad nor good in an attempt to make them seem more human. It did a lot to make this drama different and less bizarre than others, and it would be a lie to say that I didn't get invested with the course of the plot. It didn't exactly motivate me, but I liked seeing the perspectives of people in show business, seeming as they're the most likely to be reaching for the stars, perhaps much more than others. They included more honest and blunt aspects to the world of Korean entertainment than I expected and enjoyed.

Also, the decision to make Hyejun the essential ""main character"" and Jeongha the clear ""love interest lead"" was interesting to me, because as we all know, female leads usually take the reins in leading the narrative of the story.

Now, onto the cons. I agree with several of the reviews that state that they should've expanded the other characters' stories, aside from the Sa family. I would spend several episodes wondering what Jeongha was upto, and was left unsatisfied when we saw none of the actual growth when it came to her career. Jinwoo and Haena's storyline quite literally went nowhere besides being some kind of anecdote about how you don't have the power to choose who you marry in your 20s, which was in itself....kind of weird.

Also, if one would dig deeper, one might find an important message to Haeyo's storyline. And sure, there may be - he decided to take initiative of what he wanted to do instead of being his mother's puppet. He cared less about what the public thought of him, and chose to love himself. However...that's literally it, and it's disappointing because it had so much potential. What of his career after his draft? What about his dreams, his goals, after that whole dilemma? They quite literally left us on such a bland note. Even when it came to his feelings for Jeongha. Because if I remember correctly, he oh-so proudly proclaimed how he decided to choose ""love over friendship this time"". and left his statement as it was. And to add to that, I have no idea why he even began to like her when they barely interacted at first. I could only understand why and how he fell for her when they started to get close. But the buildup of his own emotions came from absolutely nowhere.

The conclusion in itself wasn't as impactful as I thought it would be, but it worked. An open ending was an interesting choice, but it's funny how the only closure we get from Jeongha's story is ""how is your salon doing?"" ""it's doing pretty well."" Like, I thought we followed her journey career-wise to see her at the peak of her success? What about her parents, and how they feel about it?

I can bring up so many other questions this drama left unanswered, too. Not only that, but despite how it tries to push for realism, there were many instances that just felt too good to be true. Everything had to be convenient for our leads to get what they wanted. The plot went around in weird waves and didn't feel like there was a certain point I had to be on edge except for the couple breaking up (but then, I didn't know I had already reached the conclusion). And Charlie Jung's existence was just a push for an intense plot, one they barely did anything with. I did enjoy the whole ""love has no gender!"" and ""loving people isn't a crime!"" comments thrown around during that arc although it being the bare minimum, but besides that, getting involved in a scandal as big as that didn't feel....needed? Especially with the whole vibe the show was trying to give.

Waehyo and Haena's mother is the character that was truly left with minimal development. I found her character in itself to be very interesting, but they went nowhere with delving into her, which I kind of wish they did more of. Maybe I'd even throw Kyeong-jun in the list, but he got enough spotlight from being in the Sa family, haha.

In conclusion, I feel like they could've done much better in terms of direction and plot. This was a semi enjoyable watch, but the kind that you can really just consume only once. The actor cameos were really cute and surprising though (I think I screamed when I saw Lee Sungkyung and Hyeri LOL). I'd still definitely recommend it to people, despite it's nuances.

Records of pain actually.
Let me start off by saying I'm not a professional critic just a girl saying what's on my mind so do with that what you will.
Into the thick of it, we go.

It's great I was in pure bliss for the first few episodes, but why would they take away my happiness like that. I remember just watching and being like, ""Something isn't right, this is going too well too fast...this means pain."" They should have been together man. Why couldn't it have been a slow burn why did they move so fast just to break up. Their chemistry was amazing but it was obvi that they wouldn't end up together because of how quickly they got together. I mean I know their reuniting kind of insinuates they get back together but I didn't watch it to use my own imagination dude come on. I also know the show wasn't mainly about romance but also following your dreams and blah blah which I liked but DAMMIT WHEN IS IT MY TURN TO BE HAPPY. If you like pain watch it. Each to their own.

watch those first 10 episode, Cause its like second lead of a drama.
Record of youth was really something. But i know in the end it did break a lot of expectation's

I will just quote my personal experience. I watched the drama ongoing. I smiled and felt so good for the first 10 to 11 episodes. Then came the 2020 part of the drama. That was kind of expected but it went a little bit overboard. It made me sad. Almost disturbed my sleep. I realized how bad it is to take a drama seriously. But believe me, I couldn't help cause it was sooo good before that sad part. The acting was good. Everyone did their part beautifully. At times there was some lag in the story when the story focuses on hye jun's family. But u can just skip it .

The chemistry between the actors park so dam and park bo gum was something out of the page. Park bo bum will make u cry along with him and in the next scene make u smile for an infinite time even after completing that episode. It will really make u believe so much in love. It felt magical.

Anyway, that won't be your opinion once you reach the end.

I just want to let u know this. Don't decide not to watch this drama because of all those bad reviews.

It did break a lot of expectations, it made everyone cry. But this still first 10 episodes were so beautiful. Every drama lover should see that at least. U can of course drop the drama after that. If those were the last episodes of this drama. record of youth would have got a rating above 8.5 for sure.

The first part of the drama deserves so much better than this. Just like the second lead of a startup. A must watch first part .

This review may contain spoilers
Ah phooey. This was my most anticipated drama release of the month AND THE YEAR, but compared to my expectations, I was sadly a bit disappointed. The second half of the show just really lost the juice that was driving the beginning and I started to feel detached. First of all, I personally felt that the leads lacked chemistry to the point where I didn't care about what happened to their relationship. They were almost too perfect for each other, but the breakup was a bit too sudden in my opinion, especially since they were depicted as super stable. Which brings me to my main problem with the couple: they felt underdeveloped. We soared through their ""crush"" phase (which was incredibly short, making me wonder why they even liked each other) and when they were in a relationship, I quickly got bored of the couple. Surprisingly though, this show didn't seem to focus on the romance, and was much more focused on Hye Jun's family.
Side notes:
What happened to Hae Hyo? I was so prepared to feel for him and get some angsty second lead syndrome, but he just kind of disappeared? He quickly lost relevance in the middle, making me wonder what the point and importance of his character was. He got more screen time in the end, but I just did not empathize with him at all as he felt underdeveloped.
Hae Na and Ji-u were so cute. They deserved more screen time and development and I am devastated.
Hye Jun's character and struggles in the beginning made it super easy to feel for him. However, his character got lost in the second half. My fears were confirmed: the show just became less interesting for me after Hye Jun got famous and rich.
A couple of times I felt like they skipped through time too much. It was a little choppy, like when Hye Jun was suddenly finished shooting a drama or when Jeong Ha quit her job and was teaching? I'm not even sure what she was doing it was never explained.
We never got to learn too much about Jeong Ha in my opinion. This show was focused on Hye Jun (which was refreshing since kdramas usually focus on the female lead) but it made me feel detached from Jeong Ha's character and I couldn't really grasp who she was and never got to the point of rooting for her or relating to her.
I'm not sure if it's just me, but there was kind of a lot of acting that felt a bit awkward.
The OST was super good. It fit the youth theme really well and was quite refreshing!

Excellent
I loved everything about this series. I did not know Park Bo Gum but he is a great actor,. This story is about young people trying to follow their dreams but it is not what I found deeply moving. What is what all about was what the fame and being a celebrity bring you. This shows the other side of the medal: the fake news, the loneliness, the jealousy, the power of the media that can ruin someone’s career. The difficulty for the family to deal with that fame. And the sacrifices it implies in terms of relationship with someone you love. And in that I found the story really interesting. I loved the female character who was so real. As a parent I found it really interesting to see the different positions adopted by the rich and the poor parents regarding their kids ‘dream I of becoming actors. Would I have supported my son if he had declared he wanted to be an actor...?

Life is life
Despite all the negative reviews I took a chance on this drama. Afterwards I'm glad I did. To ne true I can't understand why so many negativity.

Record of youth, is about family, friendships, carreers and unanswered love. The story develops easly and aloud us to peek in the life of models and actors. Also interesting to watch how easy social media (news channels, bloggers/youtubers) can impact the lives of those struggling to have a life.
Well, life isn't always fair, people is not always friendly, but at the end we all harvest what we saw.
It was a great watch. I did really enjoy it.

Thank you for your attention.

Pretty Good
This drama is really fresh and I love the actors. One thing for sure is there isn't as much drama nor suspense in this series, so I'm watching it at a really slow pace. It just isn't a drama that caught my full attention. The storyline is great as well as the actors and the problems in this drama seem so realistic. There are some teary-eyed moments but overall I'm hoping it gets better as I keep watching. At the beginning it's really hooking but the further along I get, I get bored. There isn't too much to say but it's not like other juicy dramas I've seen. xD
Just a tad bit more drama and it would be better and the focus isn't too much on romance so that's probably why I'm not as hooked.

Since I belong to the minority that hasn't seen Something in the Rain, I am going to review this show purely based on the story that it brought to me, regardless of what came before it.

Let's start with the story, One Spring Night tells a tale of two people who fell in love despite the whole world telling them not to. They tugged at my heartstrings with their beautiful, mischevious relationship that not only had to bear the weight of internal struggles but also had to face the societal pressures that came along with being Korean. It's as much a social drama as it is a romance story, so please go into it keeping that in mind. The cultural differences will make some decisions hard to understand but all of them make perfect sense, regardless. Jeong In and Ji Ho's slow burn romance coupled with extremely lovable side characters, realistic and fleshed out ""antagonists"" (though I'm not sure if I want to call them that because they weren't inherently evil, just handicapped by their circumstances, upbringing and morals). All in all, OSN offers what most dramas tend to lack these days: authenticity. It makes you feel like you're there with the characters and you grow fond of them. A beautiful, minimalist love story.

The acting is so extremely well done that I don't even feel like I'm watching Jung Hae In or Han Jimin (or any of the actors for that matter). Everyone, EVERYONE, did a brilliant job of internalizing the characters. From the minor characters to the major ones, all of them gave a very natural performance that made me think that the characters were people that could actually exist IRL. I would also like to applaud the writing and directing. There are plenty of scenes whose artistic value could be seen even through my inexperienced eyes. The drama is a treat to watch.

I also really, really loved the music. It fit really well with the setting of the scenes. Best of all, I feel like the OST wasn't used to manipulate the mood of the show which gave it an even more authentic feel. It complimented the scenes and wasn't distracting at all. They do have limited songs playing in the background but tbh I didn't mind that at all. I'll think of OSN when I listen to We Could Still Be Happy haha.

I want to add that another reason why this drama is so special is because of its exceptional secondary characters. All of them feel like you could be friends with them. They're flawed yet extremely raw and realistic. They aren't caricatures or used as a plot device to further our main couple's story but instead they power through struggles of their own. They're all very different from each other but equally endearing. This show deserves an award for creating characters like them.

Anyway, I really loved this drama and it has become one of my favourite dramas of all time!

Redemption
You can't talk about One Spring Night without mentioning Something in The Rain.

Because OSN is the result of what SITR could've been. It's about growth to both the drama and especially to the writer. One Spring Night is a take on modern Korea where the youth have to face the older generation, but not with guns or lawsuits, it's all about dialogue.

The first two episodes give the viewer an amazing introduction to the story, something most kdramas really fails to do, and the supporting cast is probably the best of the year. Every single person here has a story, no matter how much screentime they got. I dare to say that at least 3 or 4 supporting characters could easily have a drama to call their own, even if they just appear for a few minutes each episode. The music is soft and the editing makes the transitions between conflicts fit in nicely with the narrative.

Remember when I said this drama is about growth especially to the writer? Well, this drama is not perfect. It has its problems but that's what growth is. It's not a straight line to success. Don't come to this thinking all the missing points from SITR were fixed and that you won't get annoying sometimes. But the acting, damn, the acting.

I don't like to compare performances because I like to believe that actors can't only do so much if the script isn't good. But what an amazing performance by everyone.

One Spring Night is (once again) about growth, and I believe that the best score you can give to a drama is ""I want to watch whatever this writer and director are doing next"".

For the first time in a while, I feel bad that I can't see a drama on my 'currently watching' list anymore. There's no ""I want to finish this quickly so I can watch another one"" with One Spring Night. In a world where people consume so much media, not seeing a piece of content as a simple checklist is one of the best adjectives it can get. That's what happens with OSN.

Binge watch it, watch two episodes a week, whatever works for you. If possible, watch it on a Spring Night.

First and foremost, let me just get this out off the way; I am a sucker for romance and I have seen Something in the Rain (multiple times). This will be a lot to read, so kudos to those who get through it.

Many of you will know that SitR ties closely with One Spring Night, whether it be the casting, music or directing styles. This doesn't mean that OSN is simply a carbon copy. No, it's much more than that. This show is a picturesque amalgamation of modern romance, societal pressures and conservative values without the unnecessary plot devices employed by other Korean dramas. But that's just Ahn Pan-seok's (director) style, and it's why I am a huge fan.

Lets go through this methodically so I don't lose track of my objective here. OSN is a story of two people with their own complicated situations, falling madly in love despite the inevitable backlash that will result from the stigma imposed by their cultural values. This is also something that should be kept in mind. This is a story based within Korean culture and society so there may be huge differences in values to what you are used to. Nonetheless, there may be decisions and moments where the character's rationale is incomprehensible. I understand that, but try not to let it detract from your experience. All that aside, this is a drama that provides an important social commentary on modern day Korea's outdated values, something that Ahn Pan-seok (director) and Kim Eun (writer) have successfully conveyed in their earlier work, SitR. Akin to SitR, OSN provides a realistic take on the romance in question. While it is a gradual progression burdened by eventual complications, it is an authentic romance between two people that can't help but tug at your heartstrings and make you feel all giddy inside. There are one or two unresolved story points, but I feel that is largely appropriate and shouldn't be taken as a gripe. This is a realistic story and not everything can be resolved at once. The essence is that things have fallen in place and the rest will be resolved in due course.

Acting/Cast? Perfect. Jung Hae-In and Han Ji Min were both superb in their roles as the couple deeply in love despite their 'flaws'. Their chemistry was electrifying, similar to Jung Hae-In's performance with Son Ye-Jin in SitR. I truly do not believe that anyone else could pull of Han Ji Min's role as well as she could. That's not to say that the side characters weren't also quintessential to the story. Unlike many of the other dramas, the side characters in OSN are seamlessly natural in their performance and appropriately impactful on the main characters. They aren't caricatures or plot devices used to fuel the story, but rather, they have their own lives and accompanying struggles. Side note, it's a bit jarring seeing Kil Hae Yeon as an endearing and accepting mother in OSN, given that her character in SitR is quite the antithesis (and one of my most hated characters).

I feel like it's also appropriate now to talk about directing styles. As you can probably tell, I revere Ahn Pan-seok's modern-romance directing style. He has a way with capturing a scene that encompasses all the quiet nuances and raw emotional value in a colourful, minimalist fashion without any unnecessary distractions. These scenes convey a beautiful and somber melody that truly captivate viewers like myself. It's a style hard to perfect, and something that a lot of directors and producers should aim to achieve nowadays especially when grappling with romance.

The music in OSN was also flawless and appropriate to the story. It boasts the ensemble of Rachael Yamagata, who produced many of the OSTs in SitR, as well as a song from Oscar Dunbar and Carla Bruni. These songs aren't just great for their addictive repetitions on your phone, but they seamlessly blend into the settings of OSN. One song in particular, Spring Waltz by Carla Bruni. My lord, that song was perfect for OSN and an absolute delight to listen to. Even if you don't watch this drama, which I highly doubt by now given how much you must've read of this review by now, you should google that song and play it on repeat. These songs are limited, just like in SitR, but it shouldn't really be an issue.

Rewatch value is ambiguous. Personally, I'll be going through this again very soon (maybe in 2 or so days), but for others, it depends on your enjoyment for romance. I highly believe that this is a drama worth at least one rewatch. For the sceptics, give it a couple of weeks after you've finished the last episode to play it all again. I do concede, however, that I have seen SitR about 4 times by now, so there may be some slight bias but I know OSN will give it a run for its money.

Overall, OSN has ranked definitively in my favourite Korean dramas of all time. It's needless to say at this point in the review, but the casting choices, music and directing styles were all impeccable. OSN showcases a captivating love from one to another with endearing characters from varying social backgrounds. It's truly a romance that will keep you engaged in the show from all their ups and down. I will definitely miss seeing this on my 'Continue watching' list on Netflix, but all good things must come to an end. There is this faith between the main characters that persists throughout the show, and it's a faith I have for the romantic dramas to come from director Ahn Pan-seok and writer Kim Eun.

I loved this one so much! The chemistry between the two leads is amazing, and they're both fantastic even on their own. It's a relatively gentle pace throughout and just such a good story I was always looking forward to seeing them face their next challenge. There's lots of similarities you could draw between this and Something in the Rain - it's got a lot of the same cast even, same ML but different FL and other parental roles moved around a bit. Having literally watched Something in the Rain just before this it was a little surreal with husband and wife from one now in separate families in the other but... that's ok :)

Where Something in the Rain tried and failed, One Spring Night tries and scores a home run.

He is ""flawed"", he is a single dad of a son. She's got a boyfriend at the start and are starting to talk about Marriage, but she's not on the same page and frustrated with the relationship. This sets up the tone for a story with lots of factors working against the couple, whether it's the notion that she might be considered to have ""cheated"" on her boyfriend, or whether others will accept that she wants to get involved with a single dad and all the ""baggage"" that brings. Parents on both sides bring challenges but they're different, the ML's parents are over protective about things that might bring him the kind of sadness that left him a single dad and the FL's parents are traditional and ""difficult"".

I was absolutely delighted with the FL's mother in this, you can see her growing and evolving around the changing situation around her and reacting in a really great and supportive way - even if it takes her a bit to get there. The same actress played the absolutely nasty mother in Something in the Rain so this was a redemption from my perspective, as odd as that might sound :)

Initially I was confused about why the FL wasn't being more direct about breaking up with her boyfriend, and I must confess that I'm married to my first love (24 years now) so... i'm totally inexperienced in this kind of thing... but as the story progressed I grew to appreciate that it hadn't been a binary switch-off, it made the time that things properly change that much more valuable when it happened, and also meant that her previous relationship wasn't trivialised and thereby her attitude to relationships in general wasn't.

It did also somewhat talk to one of my other general meanderings - if someone cheats, betrays a partner, and goes to someone else... surely the new partner must always have in the back of their mind - that person has already demonstrated that they have the capacity to change, to betray and to move on, what worked in their favour today could happen again but against them. The ML's insecurities about this surface at an important point and it creates some tension but I thought it was dealt with well.

There are other arcs in this as well, I think that the general arc that follows her and her sisters around and the things happening to them is probably just as important as the main love story.

I struggle to find flaw with this, I was just so happy watching it all the way through, other than towards then end when I realised I was going to run out of show and this amazing couple were no longer going to be in my life, but, i'll probably get over that when I start my next drama :-P

Highly recommended, and as the flow is not really ruined by knowing what happens, it makes it all the more easy to re-watch again if you want 16 episodes of lovely warmth to keep you company on a cold weekend.

(long commentary yeehaw)

This drama is so tiring to watch, and that's the reason why I loved watching this drama. It made me tired not because of its literary elements, rather because of its resemblance to the reality that we have as humans. How bounded it's by realism and its relatability is how it's able to sell itself to the large population of viewers. This isn't a drama you should watch when you need an escape. Rather, this is a drama you should watch if you want to be slapped by reality.

Arguably, this drama is welcomed with mixed reactions because of our own moral dilemmas. Some are saying that this drama romanticizes cheating. However, I think that's not the case. In our reality where cheating is usually seen as black-and-white, we realize how there are different shades of gray that comes into it. While the act itself is bad, we can see more of its complexity, giving us more room to understand. However, that doesn't mean we are condoning the act. The themes that the drama has are cliche but the way it's presented made it so interesting.

The characters in the drama are complex WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FACETS AS TO WHY THIS DRAMA WAS ABLE TO PRESENT ITSELF MORE EFFECTIVELY. Almost every character in the drama has an interesting and complex characterization which enabled the story to tackle several issues we see in our reality. Despite being a drama, its effectivity can serve as a commentary on modern Korean society with how raw and fresh it feels.

This drama is the second drama that Kim Eun wrote. With the reminiscent style of writing and vibe, I can confidently say how this drama highlighted her growth with regards her craft. While Pretty Noona Who Buys Me Food felt like a prototype, One Spring Night felt complete and more realized.

I can only have praises for the acting and the casts of the drama. Most of the cast present in this drama can also be found from Pretty Noona Who Buys Me Food. With this drama, we can see their improved capabilities especially for the fresh faces like Jung Hae In. A year difference showed a lot of growth not only for the writer but for the actors as well. I honestly can't critique them negatively for the acting as I find it so compelling to the point that I really wanted to strangle Giseok and Sihoon because of how pathetic they are. ELECTRIC CHAIR!!!

I also have a lot of praises for the music this drama has. This elevated the emotions and the quality of the drama. It gave a nostalgic vibe with a spice of hopefulness and tranquility in every listen.

Overall I'm giving this drama a 9.5/10. It's not perfect in all honesty. However, the growth and charm the drama possess made it deserving of a high rating :>.

Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
I pick up this drama after I dropped SITR, since I was starting to get interested in Jung Ha In. Even to this day I still find myself going back to watch clips of One Spring Night. I was so invented on each episode and fell for both leads, as they're so into their role that I feel like watching some real-life event in front of me.

One Spring Night tells the story of two people who fall in love at the wrong time. It was as if the whole world telling them not to. They had to bear their own internal struggles, and also the pressure from society that comes along. This is not your typical romantic story as it also touches some social subjects, especially in Korea's culture. Not to mention they both have their own insecurities to start their relationship. I'm not a fan of slow-burn romance, but somehow OSN managed to make me crave for more with how realistic the story portrayed and how lovable each of the characters is.

What can I say about the characters - I freaking adore them. Lee Jung In is one fierce girl. She knows what she wants, she knows where she stands and her happiness lies beneath her independence. Ji Ho is a down to earth single father living inside this conservative society bubble. He is a man who never put himself first and always deciding things wisely by considering the people around him. Combine both and you got this mature relationship that dialogues their way into knowing each other. I also love how the 3 sisters always have each other's back through thick and thin. Especially the youngest one!

Arguably there are some mixed opinions on how the whole picture acts as a romanticization of cheating. But honestly, I think feelings can't be seen as black and white, there are gray in between and sometimes the lines are a little bit blurry. I wouldn't blame Jung In though, there must be some reason why she can't make up her mind on going the marriage route - although she's been in a relationship for so long. When you can't see the person you're seeing now exist in your future, I think that's one flag of no good in pushing marriage into it.

The OSTs are good, they're not distracting and somehow just fit into every scene. There were not a lot of songs in this drama, but Rachael Yamagata's No Direction stuck in my head for a long time and whenever I listen to the song I feel like the whole scenes played before my eyes.

Anyway, One Spring Night successfully gets into my all-time favorite drama list, and I would still happily re-watching it over and over again.

Viewers will be quick to compare this drama to “Something in the Rain”, which shares the same Director, Writer, and Male Lead, and they would be at no fault for doing so. Like SitR, One Spring Night utilizes a slow pace to portray the relationship between the main leads. However, the pacing and characters of OSN are superior to SitR because of their steadiness. I recommend this drama to all kdrama watchers and promise that you will also slowly and steadily fall in love with the leads episode by episode till the very end.

Story:
I will be honest and say the story outline is similar to SitR, focusing on a relationship that is heavily critiqued by the leads’ friends and family. I believe there are 2 key differentiators which are the strength of the supporting stories and the methodical pace of character development. The supporting cast gets a fair amount of development throughout the drama, and they, themselves, change instead of folding into 2D one directional characters. This actually adds to the “slowness” of the drama as precious time is diverted away from the main leads.

However, I do not find fault in the slow pace. I admit the 16 (32 halves) episode format changes the standard for pace, but I also believe that there is a range of acceptable pace in kdrama. I find bigger fault when the writer/director strays away from the slow pace to try to close certain plot points or make characters behave erratically, which OSN does not suffer from. If anything, OSN is not shy in leaving interactions with little explanation and limited expose/monologue.

This may make it harder for viewers to buy into the relationship between the main leads, but I thoroughly enjoyed the romance that resembled something out of real life rather than a kdrama. One lead doesn’t have to save the other or be connected via childhood past to develop feelings for one another. OSN is the closest example of a life-like relationship in a Korean drama; any more and it would be no fun as a drama (you know you’re trying to escape reality watching kdramas).

I applaud the director/screenwriter for running it back by producing such a comparable drama within one year. They improved on all areas of the plot from SitR and remained true to their style instead of bending to every criticism levied at SitR, which I still ranked at 7.5. I look forward to their next projects with a small longing for something more different.

Acting:
Let’s begin by looking at the Male Lead since, again, it's easy to compare to SitR. Jung Hae In’s acting is markedly improved from SitR. This may be due to his growth as an actor, the improved writing of OSN, the chemistry with the cast, more trust from the director, or some combination of all of the above. He displayed a wide range of thoughts and emotions throughout the drama, and I was especially impressed with his acting when facing the second Male Lead.

Similar compliments can be said for the Female Lead, Lee Jung In. And her chemistry with the male actor was amazing. The biggest evidence of this being how electric the dialogue between the 2 felt; Their conversations conveyed more chemistry than any of their skinship scenes. The acting of the 2 main leads really complimented the direction of the drama, which heavily focused on interactions rather than monologues.

The supporting cast also performed admirably. For example, seeing the FL’s mother in OSN can be quite a shock after watching SitR (or vice versa), but she still nailed both roles and truly deserved to be part of this cast. The FL’s sisters were also great and their acting really conveyed how their characters were shaped by their shared upbringing (and I have a soft spot for “sismance”).

Music:
Funnily enough, even a good chunk of the OST is sung by the artist who contributed to SitR, Rachael Yamagata. Although English in Korean media is improved, it does not compare to having a native English speaker. This should significantly improve the drama viewing experience for international viewers given that some subbers do not sub Korean lyrics.

The actual music works very well with the story and pace. I thought each of the songs in the OST carried tension, even the “happy” song. This tension is well utilized because the story does not have the outrageously tense moments of a thriller or typical melo, so the combination of the story and song was important in conveying conflict and emotional resolution.

Rewatch Value:
There is a high rewatch value for this drama given that it covers a multitude of nuanced issues. Even as a native Korean speaker, I plan to go back and rewatch the drama to better understand and enjoy the conversations and chemistries between all the characters.

The next episode previews were the worst part of this show, so I look forward to not having to deal with them now that it is fully aired.

One Spring Night was a drama that wasn't really for me. The series starts off very slow, picks up a little, but it didn't pick up enough for me. I forced myself to finish it, hoping for it to get better and it didn't in my opinion. I don't know if it's my patience or what, but I tried my best to change my opinion on this series and I just couldn't.

At first, I couldn't get past the first few episodes, because of the slow-starting plot. Although, the plot was well written it kind of disappointed my expectations with what I thought it was going to be like. When you watch it, you mainly get a minimalist and calming feel from this series. I feel like it may have been too calming and slow for my liking, but I like the feeling that this series was going for.

I would say, even though it wasn't my kind of drama the acting was amazing. The cast all played their parts well. The soundtrack fits with a lot of scenes and was very captivating. Not really memorable to me, but the song choices were amazing. I definitely wouldn't rewatch it again, but I am happy to say I have seen it once.

I would recommend it to people who are more interested in slower plots and a calm feel with a minimalist touch to it. The chemistry is also amazing and I really love that aspect of it more than the drama itself.

When I first read the plot I wasn’t interested in this drama at all. Per coincidence I watched the first episode and was instantly hooked. The atmosphere of the show was amazing. Calm, lovely and honest. The leads deal with their very own problems and lived their lives by the rules.

Lee Jung In, the female lead, knows what she wants. Her happiness grounds in staying independent. That’s one reason why she dates the selfish bank employee Gi Seok. But when he’s interested to tie the knot after four years different views crash. The characterization of this relationship is very honest and brutally cold told. The motivations of each collide with their happy relationship. When Ji Ho enters the stage Jung In experiences for the first time deep emotions that make no sense at all. Her inner fight is worth seeing and reflects realistic behavior at his best.

Ji Ho is a single father in a conservative society. His role symbolized the tolerance in korean society. It was interesting to see the moral standards of Koreans and how they deal with strange problems. The whole portray of this society was exciting to watch and made me fall in love even more with the characters.

The family members of both symbolizes different point of views and have to deal with problems of their own that aren’t less interesting. I loved everyone besides her dad. He was annoying from the start.

Seeing every episode made me happy. Each one was worth 10 points. I wasn't Ever invested in a drama like this one. I also give rarely 10 points but this drama clearly deserves it. I can just recommend it and will watch it again...soon. It’s a delight!

Started out so well, and then the main conflict gets resolved around the half way mark and the drama loses it way, and gets buried in cliché. The will they or won't they is the most integral part of any rebound romance story and if you take that conflict out, it's hard to sustain a story for the length of so many episodes. And you can hate me for it, Jung Hae In is GORGEOUS but he wasn't convincing at all when he was supposed to show sadness, like otherwise he was fine, but a lot of actors, are not great at everything but they are great at showing sadness which for a show like this and for kdrama in general was very much needed.

Maybe because of this and the lack of real conflict in the second half I ended up not buying their relationship AT ALL and both the characters seemed to feel unfinished and not well thought out. Acting wise though the rest of the cast was really doing well and you know there's something wrong with a drama when I was honestly siding with the ex lol seriously the two son in laws should have just hooked up they were so good together. Seriously, I really got involved in the other sisters story a lot more. And the sociopathic son in law from hell the actor was so good and all the actors who played the sisters same, I liked both the sisters! Especially the youngest, she was badass.

The problem with a story about cheating couples is if you don't have characters who are conflicted about their emotions and they show some emotion for the ex is what makes the character a worthy protagonist for a romance. If they say they have no feelings for someone they were with for four years not only do they sound self serving but you also are unable to believe they will be any different in the new relationship. Like you waited till you had a hot guy with a stable job to leave someone you claim you didn't have feelings for yet you were sleeping with them? And saying you'll get married, I mean the guy didn't even do anything besides 'not give her enough time' when he was in a business meeting! ! Is she going to resent the new guy when he cancels on her because he was working?

I mean I did not buy she was going to continue to be 'selfless' long term with the new guy it's just a matter of time.

Another thing that also became annoying was the fact that the perceived 'villain' in the story, the ex, was the not really evil and the stunts he pulled become so lame you're left watching a boring story because look the villain actually has to win at something to be a convincing villain! Lol here none of the 'villains' or the antagonists were actually scary and everything got resolved through a single conversation, lol literally, like that's why I was so bored.

That said I did enjoy it but mostly because Jung Hae In is GORGEOUS and I liked the cast, the ex even I felt bad for him.

Frustrating, repetitious, drawn out, illogical
This is the most frustrating kdrama I’ve ever finished. Granted, I haven’t finished many, and I should have dropped this one too. However, the first couple of episodes were pretty decent, and after I got invested in the characters, I felt compelled to see how it played out. What a mistake and a waste of 18 hrs of my life.

I don’t know what was worse, the music or the script. Both were relentlessly repetitive torture. The directing was bad too, unless stretching out a minimal plot to fill up the airtime is a skill.

Most of the acting was good though, except for a few key roles, like Ji-ho, who was wooden. But regardless of how good the actors were, the writer had them acting like total idiots. Jeong-in is supposed to be strong and decisive, but she was so frustratingly wishy washy, she brought all her troubles on herself. Why did she continue to lead Gi-seok on like some prick teaser, even accepting his engagement ring? And why is her human doormat of a sister Seo-in just letting her psycho husband and dad walk all over her while she keeps silent about her problems and insists on working it out herself just by talking with her psycho hubby every couple of episodes, even though it never ever gets anywhere? Isn’t she a glamorous celebrity who you’d think had some backbone and drive to get to her position? And why don’t Jeong-in and Ji-ho communicate better? They never tell each other when they’re meeting with Gi-seok or his dad or what happened.

Let me offer some advice to these characters. First, all 3 sisters need to tell their dad to shut the hell up and go fuck himself, since he’s clearly just a selfish clown who no one should take seriously. Then Seo-in needs to call the cops on her slimy hubby, maybe after paying some thugs to beat the shit out of him and sexually humiliate him. Of course, this is after flushing her fetus down the toilet just to see the reaction on her hubby’s face when she tells him that was his rape baby. (Why would she make it so much harder to divorce a monster by continuing to carry his baby to term?) And instead of resigning and refusing promotions, she should just ignore the gossips and stand proud as an abuse survivor who gives courage to others in her situation. And what the hell is the deal with Gi-seok’s dad? It seems like the show is trying to portray him as this shrewd, no-nonsense mastermind, but instead he just seems totally confused, not just to the audience but also to Gi-seok, Jeong-in, and her dad, who can’t figure him out because his behavior is so muddled. Ji-ho should just forget about his wishy washy adulteress who drives him crazy and just marry the person in the world who knows him and loves him best, his nuna at the pharmacy. If she’s too old for him, then that younger girl at the pharmacy would be fine too. As for Jeong-in, I have absolutely no idea what she’s thinking so I don’t know what’s best for her. Probably some guy totally different from anyone in the show. But I think Ji-ho is too damaged and priggish for a wish washy girl like Jeong-in for the long term.

Thank god for a few likeable and sane characters, like Jeong-in’s best friend and her younger sister and Ji-ho’s guy friends and pharmacy co-workers. Seriously, I wouldn’t mind watching a series all about Jeong-in’s co-worker friend, as long it had a different director, writer, and music staff. She would be a great catch for a sensible guy, like Ji-ho’s banker friend.

I had to wait a few months after this drama was completed to settle my feelings before I could write this.

As with many fans I associated One Spring Night with Something In The Rain although the premise was different the overall style, chemistry and vibe was the same, which was to be expected. Although irrelevant I did enjoy SITR even when asked to suspend belief, I did it amicably and was still able to become enraptured in the show. This however was not the case with One Spring Night.

As the first few episodes progressed I was captured with the story and the acting was compelling. I can view each character's selfishness and empathize with them and mildly hate or love them. But then as the story progressed the premise started falling apart. My ability to suspend belief was sorely tested. By the end I hated the show and not in a good way. Knowing that this show was to improve upon the short comings that plagued Something In the Rain, I was sorely disappointed. The director and screen writers had not learned their lesson in my opinion.

The fault lay not with the acting but with the script. Following the story I was entranced by the complicated relationship bonds between the cast and the ultimate build up which lead to a big fat nothing. And that in essence is what destroyed the entire show for me. Ki Seok is a man spurned and felt his life wasted and lost, finds himself adrift and alone which is to be expected. He then threatens and harasses which is also to be expected. The story is accelerated to this epic climax of sorts where Ki Seok would have been pushed to his limit and has no choice but to retaliate in some form but is then crushed under the weight of some forced drama between the romantic couple, which was weak at best, and then fizzled into a lazy ending which left me so unsatisfied that I wanted to scream. To me this is the worst crime possible because the drama smacked of no effort rather than poor execution. Another pet peeve was the supposed manly stance of Ji Ho who postures a lot but ultimately does nothing. In fact no one does anything in the end. The show just ends.

While I did not want a kidnapping scene repeat, I was still expecting Ki Seok to commit an act that was horribly embarrassing where he would then have to hide in shame, on top of the fact his girlfriend left him for another man. Or I would have settled for Ji Ho defending his maiden's honour in some form.

The dissatisfaction I felt for this show was immense and I could not understand how others enjoyed it so when I equate watching One Spring Night with eating a cupcake but all the frosting and cherry fell off the top.

Not a show/10

This was meandering garbage, it was an improv-exercise. I could be convinced that it's a show if you were to argue that it's supposed to be viewed as a horror series, wherein the characters seem to be trapped in psychological and social circles with no hope of escape. But it wasn't. It was supposed to be a slice of life drama.

The director seems to have identified everything that was wrong with Something in the Rain before amplifying it and omitting any and all ideas that weren't shit. I watched this whole thing with my family as each episode was released on Netflix, and we unanimously agreed it was the most aggravating Korean Drama any of us had ever seen, hitherto surpassed only by The Smile Has Left Your Eyes. At least with the latter there was some comedic value, because its premises and conclusions were so ridiculous. This one is offensively bland. Profoundly boring. Like, I'm taking it personally here.

I just want to address the music composition straight away, because whoever is in charge of timing musical cues in Ahn Pan-Seok's dramas is UTTERLY incompetent. The showrunners choose these obnoxious covers of pop and folk songs that beat you over the head with their messaging; the songs play at random - like you might get one while a character makes some food or punches someone in the face - so they're often tonally dissonant with what's actually happening on screen. Plus, these fucking things sometimes play *multiple times per episode*. By the fifteenth time Rachel Yamagata breathlessly whined, ""we could still be happy"" my group was just about ready to turn the t.v. off and give up on episode 4 altogether.

The editing was generally terrible, though, so maybe the decrepit state of the drama's soundscape can be chalked up to whoever was charged with editing the fucking endings. Episodes would end in silence, with Ji-ho walking towards Gi-seok, building and foreshadowing some sort of tension, only to lead to a hilariously banal opener in the next episode. We actually started laughing when episodes would start, because the only time we were ever interested was when episodes ended, and when they began we wished we hadn't bothered. The word 'cliffhanger' barely describes these endings. They were more like wet farts that get progressively quieter and increasingly smellier.

We were intensely bored and annoyed by the acting and dialogue. Some dramas have very kinetic acting, with characters moving while they talk to each other, but this one falls into the category of shows wherein the audience is challenged with the task of guessing when the showrunners have replaced the actors with cardboard cut outs. EVERYBODY JUST. STANDS. Staring at each other. It's one of my issues with J-Dramas and older Korean dramas, and when you combine that flaw with the weirdly long delays between Jeong-in and Ji-ho's sentences (seriously, count the number of seconds that pass after someone speaks to them before either of them makes a sound... it's awful when they're together) you get extremely low energy on screen at all times. The lead actors had absolutely no chemistry, either. They've both played charismatic characters in the past, but it's like they were a little high throughout the entire show. That might explain the delayed response times, actually.

Their lack of chemistry wasn't entirely the actors' faults, though. Ahn Pan-Seok has a problem with dragging out specific plot threads long after they should have been tied up. His strategy for ameliorating the inevitable fucked up shitty pacing that he produces is to have characters repeat the same conversation endlessly until the last two episodes. That's when people bend, and fight, and start acting randomly compliant where they had been obstinate for fourteen episodes.

The story line with Gi-Seok, for example, should have ended midway through the season. He stalked Jeong-in for basically the entire series, to the point where even the dads were, like, confused about how deluded he was about forcing Jeong-in to marry him. He has this weird misogynistic rivalry with Ji-ho that was so stupid and chauvenist I actually started wishing Jeong-in was just end up single by the end, but there's no resolution! The rivalry is built up for basically 16 episodes and it doesn't end with Gi-seok and Ji-ho confronting eachother to the end that Gi-seok finally relents, it ends with Gi-seok eating dinner with a rapist and going, ""nah dude, because the series needs to end I'm just going to chill out now,"" before just, like, walking away?? Wtf

Jeong-in and Ji-ho's relationship was unbelievable too, so we couldn't get invested into the OTP vibe shit that (let's be honest) most of us watch this shit for. Since 90% of the conversations anyone has in this show are ABOUT those two, this wasn't just a minor problem. They meet and basically fall in love instantly. Ji-ho sets some clear boundaries, and then they both start acting like being apart is the WORST form of torture annnnyone could have cooked up. How about a few episodes where they get to know each other? Where they just vibe as friends, run into each other in public with their friends and family? How about SHOWING us Gi-seok joking about breaking up and hurting Jeong-in's feelings, or how his dad disapproves of her, rather than dumping that information into exposition? How about some new sideplots? I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS SHIT FRESH. I need SOMETHING to suspend my disbelief when Gi-seok randomly starts suspecting Ji-ho is sliding in on his girl. He sees Ji-ho's shoes in her apartment with multiple other pairs ONCE and he's immediately convinced something is afoot. GI-SEOK IS NOT THAT SMART. None of these characters are believable! Everyone's life revolves around Jeong-in and Ji-ho! And the only side plots are Jae-in's flirtation with her buddy-bae and the eldest sister's fucking traumatizing ass story line. Basically all the dialogue is arguments!!! I can't listen to these people argue about Ji-ho and Jeong-in anymore!!!! holy fuck!!

TL;DR - all the conflict that's introduced in the first episode is basically all that you get until episode 14. It does not develop. It's completely inorganic, and it's a case study in a screenplay for a film stretched thin over 16 hours worth of content.

The delays in the acting, the dragging plot, and the illogical and inconsistent characterization feel like they're consequences of something being made up on the spot. Like, instead of giving the actors scripts, they gave them general subjects to have an argument about, so the leads are constantly pausing to figure out what the hell they're going to say next. There's no imagery as strong as the umbrellas in Something in the Rain, and the spring metaphor was shoved into random meeting scenes at Jeong-in's work. They're ALWAYS meeting up at night time, which spring night is the significant one, exactly?

This one is my new bottom. Er, of the list. Bottom of my list. OF MY LIST.

I forced myself to watch this k-drama.
OMG I am so sorry I did. It was the most aggravating show I have watched after SITR.
The music itself made me want to shoot the television; what kind of idiots came up with playing the same songs over and over and over again in a show? Seriously we don't want to hear the same song constantly; regardless of how good the song is. It kept reminding me of the ""Stand by Your Man"" song that played every chance they could play it in ""Something in The Rain"" AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!

The dynamics between Ji-ho and Jeong-in were also terrible; it felt completely forced; there was ZERO chemistry between the two and they acted like infants; NEWS FLASH; they are adults, not children; they should act like that.

The funny thing was Jeong-in's mother, she was horrible in Something in The Rain but was the nice one in this series; the acting was exactly the same except that she played the nice parent instead of the psycho one.
The fathers of the two!!!! Seriously? How much are they going to be talking about forcing the two couples that are broken up to set a wedding date? Even in episode sixteen, they were at it, I mean seriously???? Such unrealistic stupidity that it was beyond comprehension.

If I sound angry during this review it's because the show was so bad that it made me angry. This was complete garbage.

One Spring Night took me aback with it's poignant anecdotes and life lessons spoken from those in different positions in life. I originally had this drama on hold after the first episode because I believed it would be slow paced and boring, but I deeply regret not picking it up sooner. This is such a beautiful, gentle show that contains almost everything I could ever ask for in romance storytelling.

STORY - 10/10

The general setting of One Spring Night circulates between the love story of a woman who seems to have the rest of her life planned out for her and a man who struggles trying to make plans for himself, and the many societal issues that correspond to them falling for one another. The situations the leads placed themselves in were unlike anything I had ever witnessed before in a drama - they were so grounded, realistic, and handled that way too. It wasn't exaggerated or taken into a dramatic approach for the sake of the drama's contingency. The concept of a woman in a dying relationship and a single father who only lives for his son is one I could not have picked up simply if not for the amazing way the drama was written and directed. Alongside this, the side stories between Jeong-in's sisters became a reminder that this is what love may resort to. Love may become diluted and dark, or merely simple and fleeting, not always the shiny bright sparks and cherry blossoms that many kdramas seem to provide us.

However, the writers give us their own interpretation of such a love with the main leads in such a deep and devoted manner. While countless romance dramas and films have made me feel envious towards relationships and the usual feeling of ""wanting romance in my life"", this one really takes the cake. Jeong-in and Ji-ho's developing love for one another is so gentle and natural that it almost feels like slow burn. You constantly root for them to finally be happy together and individually, and you're left with the realization that this is what love is SUPPOSED to be. Forget the cheesy skinships and the inevitable heart racing moments - two people who remain devoted to supporting and loving each other despite the countless difficulties that unravel just from the thought of being together? That's what I want.

The overall reason I gave this story a 10/10 is because while the plot is not outlandish and the kind that garners attention or extra viewing points, it's a real love story with real people. It makes me feel like I'm experiencing it myself and feeling it for myself. The aesthetic that comes from such a concept served a lot for how much I loved the show, too.

ACTING/CAST - 10/10

God, where do I begin? I loved the cast so much. I initially started watching this show for it's two main leads. Han Jimin, who starred in my other favorite drama, The Light In Your Eyes, and Jung Hae-in, who I just adore in general regardless of what character he plays. Their chemistry was out of this world and added onto the realistic touch this show loved to go for. While skinship wasn't exactly as excessive as, for example, Weightlifting Fairy, they take their character's ages and personalities into consideration to develop the perfect formula of a couple in their late 20s-early 30s. Each character served a purpose in the story and almost none could really be considered an antagonist in their own sense (except for the abusive husband. He could go screw himself lol), which is what amplifies my love for this drama even deeper.

MUSIC - 9/10

I usually never listen to all of a drama's OSTs after watching, but this came as an exception. Although I finished One Spring Night several months ago, I still find myself listening to the OST every now and then. The music is so soft and calming and suits the drama perfectly. I loved the old retro feel the music gave to the show as well as how it precisely gave that sense of belonging, fear and slowness the story represented.

REWATCH VALUE - 7/10

I usually never rewatch heavy dramas, and the slow pace of this one certainly contributes to why I wouldn't prefer rewatching the entire show again. I'll certainly stick around for their adorable romance moments, though.

OVERALL - 9/10

Beautiful storytelling, a wonderful cast with a gorgeous soundtrack. If you love slow paced yet satisfying romance with touches of realism and lack of cliches, then this drama is definitely for you.

Great characters and direction make this drama!
""One Spring Night "" is a hard drama for me to rate only because I have some American perspectives that contribute to my lower rating. This is a slower, slice of life paced drama, although the romance progresses pretty quickly, the overall pace of the drama does not. That could also be because although I was very invested in the characters I was less impressed with the actual plot. The stakes just didn't seem high enough for all the drama, to me, and things get repetitive quick. Still, I just couldn't stop watching this drama, and through all the frustrations while watching my fascination with the characters kept me hooked.

The cast is what makes this drama, especially the main couple. The story starts with a chance interaction between Jung Hae In as Yoo Ji Ho and Han Ji Min as Lee Jung In, and from their very first scene together I knew I would love their chemistry together. I admit that Jung Hae In is my favorite thing about this drama. His baby faced good looks and performance made it impossible to not root for Ji Ho no matter the circumstances. I adored all the subtle expressions he's so good at. I was really impressed by him from beginning to end. I also really liked seeing Han Ji Min in a more mature role than I've seen her in before. Her character was written to be annoying at times, but her performance was so great! I liked that she was so flawed, including her temper, and I love how real things felt between them... their flirting, their awkward glances, their tears, their fights, their romantic moments... all of it. Their conflicts and obstacles however felt too overexaggerated. This is the part that is likely a cultural thing but what is considered scandalous and taboo is just not a big deal to American me, and how characters reacted to Ji Ho's situation just seemed way too close minded. Also, the obsession with marriage seemed crazy! What I did love is the dynamic between all the characters and how they all connected, and that was way more interesting to me than any particular thing that happened or was revealed.

Kim Joon Han as Kwon Ki Seok also gives a great performance. He rounds out the main trio with a character that isn't very likable but is still sympathetic in a pathetic way. Yes, this story is absolutely about a love triangle, a pretty messy, and petty one. I like a love triangle done right, and performance-wise this drama does a good job, but Ki Seok's actions are ridiculous throughout. Some of his obsessive and delusional behavior made me almost want to skip scenes after a while. It was just too much for me. I preferred the more subtle scenes about how to navigate a love triangle amongst mutual friends and acquaintances than the traditional parents getting involved tropes or him . His stubbornness went from sympathetic to creepy quickly, and since that's a huge part of the story it made things drag more in the later episodes.

I loved the rest of the cast as well. All of them. Family, Friends, Coworkers, and Frenemies alike, and that super cute kid! I really felt like I got to know everyone to the point that no character really felt like a filler character after a while. I give more credit to the actors and director than the writer for that because some of the characters were written as more one-note in their actions. It was the performances that saved them from becoming complete caricatures. That's especially true for Lee Moo Saeng's role which I wish was given more depth since he represented heavy subject.

Speaking of the direction, I think it set the mood so perfectly. Even settings felt like characters I knew, the pharmacy, the apartment building with that cool staircase, the library, Jung In's hallway... the attention to certain details really made a difference. I loved the direction so much, especially how it gave insight to different character's perspectives too which highlighted their performances even more.

Another weak point in the writing was that I didn't much care for the side stories, which may have also been my American pov. Once certain things were revealed I felt they kept revisiting the same point over and over and I was bored by it after a while. The performances were fine, but I rather stick to the main story. Some scenes had depth without the characters having to say anything, so I think Ahn Pan Seok deserves a shout out for that .

Would I watch this again? Even though I did like this drama I would be too tempted to skip through a lot of the scenes in a second viewing (like every Dads plotting marriage scene, or her older sister's scenes). I would be more interested in watching certain performances and scenes more than rewatching the entire drama. I almost want to say that this drama should have been shorter, but I admit that by the end I was sad that it was over, and the ending is well done.

The music is also tough to review because although I liked the songs they were so distracting! Maybe that's because they were mostly in English, so much harder for me to tune out, but it also could be that they were played too loudly and too often. In some scenes the music felt jarring, and that took away from some moments that didn't need it.

Overall, I can see why this drama has such high ratings, especially if you're interested in a love story that isn't too stereotypical. I would recommend this drama to romance fans but don't expect any major plot developments or twists to drive the story. If you're not into the story by midway then you should probably drop it because it's just more of the same till the end. I personally appreciated the theme throughout of not taking the safe, boring, or expected road and following your heart instead, or not putting what's considered socially acceptable above what you feel is best for you. I felt inspired after watching, which I didn't expect, and I am glad I stuck through the slower parts. Also no, I did not watch ""Something in the Rain"" but for Jung Hae In and this director maybe I will... maybe... lol

After watching this series, I must say that it was way better than ""Something in the Rain"" in terms of how realistic the approach was on how one should deal with different types of problems/adversaries.

I really admired how practical the story was. Jeong-In (HJM), who was seemingly trapped in her own four-year relationship with her boyfriend, stumbles upon an unexpected affair with Ji-Ho (JHI). The plot itself was very relatable because I think at some point we all found unexpected love from someone. For me, this was how SITR was suppose to happen, and for that I give a lot of credit to the writer for totally making it up from the previous series. It wasn't perfect, but it was less flawed. It shows a lot of growth and maturity to be able to exemplify such norms and beliefs and how it can greatly affect relationships in this modern society.

The first few episodes might seem ""boring"" given to the nature of its story, but it actually gives you everything you need to know from the characters and the entire series. I like how the writer points out different taboos when it comes to dating/marriage. No offense to those who believe in certain things but in my own opinion, this series shows exactly how ""love conquers all"". The last three episodes were near perfect, as it shows how the main actors deal with their own problems. Everyone does have something to say regardless of what you do so why not fight for what you believe in, especially with someone you love.

I also would like to point out how great Han Ji-Min was. We already saw how capable Jung Hae-In in SITR, and we almost saw Son Ye-Jin again in OPN (but she declined). I first saw her in Hyde, Jekyll, Me, and since then I have been binged watching all her works. She is very versatile and matured to play any kind of role, and their chemistry in this series was really sweet and real. No other actress could have played this role better, and one of the reasons why this series is a must watch if you're tired from the usual romantic-comedy setup.

The OSTs were also well tuned in a way that it mixes with the scenes and the emotions throughout the episodes. It could literally give you the ""feels"" especially at some of the climatic parts of the series.

Overall, I gave this a 9.5/10. It was a near perfect redemption for the writer after SITR. I expect more series to come with the same concept and hopefully would be as good as this one. This is a must see series for everyone!

The first word that came out of my mouth in the first few episodes were ""Scandalous"", as a joke of course. The main premise of this show felt very real as iv'e never seen a show quite like this one. One Night Spring isn't just a simple romance story to me becasue there were many things in which i havn't seen in other dramas other than this one, bare in mind I started watching dramas last august.

The story intriqued me alot becasue it was about the female lead Jeong In having issues with her relationship with her current boyfriend and then meeting Ji Ho randomly and found a spark. The first thing I want to say is something about the whole cheating thing in this story. In my opinion Jeong In didn't cheat on Ki Seok because she stated numerous times to him that she wanted to break up and we could clearly see they were having problems so Ji Ho just sped up the inevitabal and also save her from a life of misery in my opinion. This also taught me is that if i'm ever in an relationship and im not happy with it and I met someone else in which i could be happier with, i would pursue that (of course i'd break up with my current gf because if I wasn't happy with out relationship in the first place, we wouldv'e broken up anyway.)

The characters in this show were all very well written and no character was wasted in the writing of this show which is very rare in any type of show, everone in this drama had a purpose. Firstly I wanna talk about Ji Ho's son Eun Woo, he is the most cutest thing i have ever seen in a show and he made some of the scenes so nice to watch. Jeong In's Ex firstly I would like to say that I did feel sorry for him at the start but I realised how ungratefull he was and how obsessive with beating Ji Ho whicc was annoying becasue he looked down on him because he had a ""flaw"". The Husband of Seo In was just a complete dick in my opinion with the whole verbal and pysical abuse he dished out and showed us exactly what not to do in a marriage. Both the sisters were so refreshing to me because i rarely see sismances in dramas and it was great seeing them support each other and look out for eachother which was good to watch.

I lastly want to touch on the topic of everyone in the drama with seeing how having a child is a flaw, I understand it is probably a cultural difference but I know many people with step-fathers or mothers and I just thought everyone was overreacting but I know there is most likely a cultural difference.

Overall this show was a breath of fresh air to me as I have never seen anything like it. I highly reccomend it if you want to see something diffrent and also thrilling in my opinion to watch.

As much as I would love to compare this to the Kdrama Something in the Rain, because of the similar storylines and the same actors, I will try to do that very minimal. I had very high hopes for this, but it all started going downhill very fast. The story was mediocre, and got even more destroyed as the main couple did not have any chemistry in my opinion. The lead actor was as charming as always, which I loved, but none of the other characters. Jung In mom's character also surprised me, as she steered away from the typical Korean mom image. The cinematography was amazing (explains, why it is a Netflix Kdrama), the English soundtrack was charming. There's plenty of other mature romance shows, I would even recommend Something in the Rain instead of this. One Spring Night did not amaze me, and I do not think it is worth anyone's time, maybe just for a light watch.

I looked forward to watching this drama because I liked the actors, writer, and singer-song writer. Unfortunately, I wanted to like it more than I did.

Story-The Good
A lot of US shows I’ve watched have a 6 to 2 or 7 to 2 ratio of male to female characters unlike real life. Strong female relationships are often sorely lacking. The writer of OSN has about a 50/50 ratio of male to female characters. The FL has close relationships with her sisters and friends! And surprisingly the mothers aren’t harpies. I found this encouraging and refreshing. I will seek out future dramas by this writer.

The Bad
I have no problem with slow burn romances but someone forgot to turn the crockpot on for this one. As of episode 18 the story was still trying to find traction. I struggled to connect with the FL’s motivation, the ML’s and her ex’s.

The Ugly
The FL had the characteristics of MLs I dislike. She was domineering, selfish, and unsympathetic. Just when she seemed to have some character growth she would revert back. The one time the ML showed vulnerability she pulled back instead of reassuring him and later punished him in a humiliating way. I couldn’t figure out what he saw in her and why he fell so hard when he had been burned badly before. I wanted to feel caught up in their romance but it felt flat to me.

Acting
I was underwhelmed by Han Ji Min and I loved her in Hyde,Jekyll, and Me. And who took the light out of Jung Hae In’s smile and the salt out of his tears? The baddies seemed tired and toothless as if they couldn’t figure out why they were doing what they were doing. Overall the acting wasn’t terrible but I’ve seen several of these actors do a much better job.

OST
As always, I love Rachael Yamagata’s music. However, the music clips often didn’t match the mood of the scene.

Rewatch Value
Not likely. Or maybe one day I’ll try again when I’m in a different mood and it will speak to me. Sadly I don’t think that it will as much as I will want it to.

This is a beautiful drama and I am having withdrawal symptoms! I initially wanted to skip it think it would be too serious and slow paced. It was actually amazingly paced especially considering how many episodes are usually wasted in kdramas where they have to play the cliche games between ML, FL and any second lead. This drama was a mature romance where people said what they meant (for the most part - that happens IRL). That’s the thing. It was just so realistic!

The couple had great chemistry. I ship them for real <3

The sisters’ relationship was phenomenal and made me miss my sister.

Strong female roles, especially FL. She spoke her mind, stood up for what she believed in and didn’t put up with anybody’s bs, including her own father’s.

Every character’s acting was on point! The dialogue was written so naturally and all of the actors delivered.

I loved the little kid. In fact, I wish there was more “family” scenes because it was just so heartwarming.

I am sad it had to end and I can’t imagine finding another drama as sweet as this drama was. I seriously looked forward to every episode!

I literally believe this trio of the Writer ,Director and Jung Hae In can create magic.The story, direction, acting,music have given a fresh vibe.I was fed up of the same story in almost every drama how the couples were connected in their childhood or suffering from insomnia.Earlier I used to watch dramas depending on my favorite actors.But for the first time I searched the Director after watching Something in the rain.Jung Hae In's acting is undoubtedly the cause I am stucked to One Spring Night.His expressions are much louder than his dialogues!The soft spoken yet so tough Ji Ho suits Hae In perfectly. I will look forward for the future endeavors of this trio.This drama is a must watch.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Not just happy ending but this is one of a kind love story.
It does not start in most love story start.
I like both the Male and Female lead in here.

They stood their ground for their love but at the same time still respect their family and friends.

When they live, they love deeply.
Fight without hurting others
I admire their character
I never skip a moment

The script is written very smart. The writer must be a really talented one.
There's many sweett moment. I just love each of them.
Itss super romantic!

My fave movie of the year!

Ps. The male lead has this really sexy body and the female lead is very pretty. I hope they keep this instead of the super skinny male and female lead.

Calm, lovely and mature. The leads deal with their very own problems and lived their lives by the rules and were bored to death.

Lee Jung In, the female lead, knows what she wants. Her happiness grounds in staying independent. That’s one reason why she dates the selfish bank employee Gi Seok. But when he’s interested to tie the knot after four years different views crash. The characterization of this relationship is very honest and brutally told. The motivations of each collide with their happy relationship. When Ji Ho enters the stage Jung In experiences for the first time deep emotions that make no sense at all. Her inner fight is worth seeing and reflects realistic behavior at his best.

Ji Ho is a single father in a conservative society. His role symbolized the cultural mores in Korean society. It was interesting to see the moral standards of Koreans and how they deal with outside the box living. The whole portrayal of this society was fascinating to watch and very similar to the US 1950's standards. The pressure and social mores were strict.

The family members of both symbolizes different point of views and have to deal with problems of their own that aren’t less interesting.

This is my very first review of a drama and it’s even extremely late but I still want to do it.

I just have to say that I want to slap myself for taking this long to find this precious gem of a story.

This drama is amazing. It is realistic, if not very close to reality. My very first impression of this drama is: “wow mature and responsible main leads”. I love it. I love it that both of them act like the adults that they are. I love it that this drama is mature.

At first I thought it really slowwww. I’m not a fan of slow burn dramas at all but this one, despite the cinematography that makes you feel in slow motion and the atmosphere that takes forever, it didn’t feel like that at all. I mean it was slow in a comfortable way. I did have moments like “quickly car, you don’t need 40 seconds of the time to get off screen” or “do they really have to shoot her walking up the stairs to his apartment, he lives on the third floor for goodness sake” moments but when I remember what kind of drama I’m watching it calms me down. LOL. It’s really nice to just watch calmly and wait for things to unfold slowly. It’s very fresh when things unfold in a normal realistic way instead of the overdramatic feeling we often get from most kdramas.

The next thing I love about this drama is that it makes you think, sympathize and empathize with the characters. If one doesn’t stop for a moment and think, he/she will never really appreciate this drama. This drama made me think about the situation and why the situation is not working out; I think of the factors why it was difficult for them to start a relationship; I think whether they even really deserve to be together. I love that I used more of my head watching this rather than my emotion. Of course I still cried and smiled and got frustrated with the characters but despite that I can understand why everything is turning out that way.

Next is the Romance. Needless to say, their relationship is amazing. Sometimes I can still see unrealistic moments with them but since they’re sweet, I can forgive that. Their sweet moments are to die for and I appreciate that they’re not holding back with their acting. Han Ji Min and Jung Hae In did an AMAZING job. It makes me look forward to their next projects.

I would definitely recommend this drama to anyone who wants a break from too much cliche and overdramatic scenes. This drama is sweet. Like drinking a cup of coffee on a Sunday with rain pouring out your window.

This was my third Asian drama. It firmly cemented my now kdrama addiction. Fantastic acting. Oh my...Jun Haein smiling. His whole face just lights up and exudes deliciousness. Great story. Heart warming with the little boy. Characters are relatable and realistic. Very entertaining as it’s not another Chaebol drama. The music was a shade distracting as it sounded like the same song over and over again. I’ve since added the OST to a relaxing playlist and get warm fuzzy feelings whenever I hear it. It grows on you.

Super Comfy!
I love this show! it is because both male lead relation grew by time. I love the pace they fell in love, it is not too fast or too slow. This drama is really something for me. I forgot, but i kind of remember that Jeong-In said to Ji Ho in one of the episodes that Ji-Ho was comfortable like a used pillow. I do feel this drama is so comfortable to watch. It didn't get on my nerve, I even love the ambience this drama brought until the happy ending. The main lead situation was unusual, that made it more interesting.

Painful Acceptance, The Road not Taken.
This drama, GOD, where do I even start?
First of all, you can't talk about this drama without mentioning Something In The Rain.
This drama is what Something in The Rain could have been, and I for one am GLAD that it wasn't.

This drama is like an extremely poorly made-version of Something In The Rain, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a pretty decent and realistic romance drama compared to the usual unrealistic fantasy lovey-dovey K-dramas that we get, but in no way does it even come close to SITR's level.

But, each drama should be rated on its own merits and problems instead of just giving it a rating or review compared to how it was with other shows.

This drama started out really great, the first two episodes were VERY, VERY promising, but with each episode it started going downhill, the pacing of the story is the main problem that this show had, it was painfully tiring to watch, it took 16 episodes before the drama started going anywhere, that means out of the total 32 episodes, it took HALF of those before the story really started to progress, the story of this drama could've easily been crammed into just 16 episodes and ended gracefully, but the fact that it was unnecessarily dragged on killed my interest.

The other problem that this drama had was the absence of any REAL conflict, I mean there was absolutely nothing in this drama that can be counted as a real conflict, it was just a few useless skirmishes and arguments that didn't even lead to anywhere, the little conflict that the drama did have was completely forced and inorganic and could have been completely avoided altogether, it's like the characters were forced to create whatever little fake conflict; and the absence of any REAL conflict coupled with the fact that this show had 32 episodes is a complete disappointment, how can the writers and directors justify dragging the drama for SO LONG without having any real conflict or purpose?

And it was because of the absence of any real conflict that I just couldn't buy the fact that the two main leads were both in a relationship, absolutely COMPLETELY unbelievable.

The other problem with this show was the absence of chemistry between the two characters, I mean the chemistry and dynamics between them were forced, it didn't feel natural or very organic AT ALL!

The next problem with this show was the MUSIC, I mean what were the directors thinking when they played the SAME soundtrack ever since the first episode again and again, AND yet again?

This drama didn't have any emotional moments that made my heart flutter or shiver in the least, the drama basically lacks excitement, there's nothing in the drama that excites you and encourages you to watch it, there was nothing in the show which really showed how the characters bond became strong, especially in the first half.

This drama instead of focusing on the two main leads' relationship together, focused on other useless things that had no business being in there.

This drama didn't have ANY moments where it really showed the two main leads bonding with each other which made their entire relationship COMPLETELY unbelievable.

Now about the acting, the only good acting in this show is by the mother of the girl, the rest of the acting in the show by every character is a complete rip-off, especially by the girl's new boyfriend AKA her friend.
The dialogues of this show were again one of the problems, no proper meaningful dialogues or impactful conversations were held by the characters with each other, there were absolutely ZERO emotional moments.

Now let's compare it with Something In The Rain since this drama is by the same director, Ahn Pan Seok.

It's like with this drama, the directors and writers figured out everything that was wrong with Something In The Rain and managed to multiply it 100 times!

Something In The Rain for me is the Gold Standard of realistic romance dramas and I can comfortably call this drama the bottom of the barrel standard.

The show started out amazingly in the first few episodes but by the 8th episode I had to force myself to watch it, I was hoping that something in the next 2 or the next 2 episodes after that will have something exciting happen that'll captivate my interest completely, and I watched the drama till the first 16 episodes and there was absolutely nothing that excited me, by the 16th episode it was just a matter of watching the drama JUST to end it.

This drama didn't just break my heart because it was so bad, it made me so angry and disappointed because I can truly imagine what it could've been, it broke my heart because I know the potential it had and the fact that it wasn't able to fulfill it.

I can imagine how amazing it could've been, and the fact that it wasn't is just truly heart-breaking and extremely disappointing!

I'm going to keep this very simple: For me this was a drama where the end felt complete, no loose ends.
Of course there were certain short comings in the writing but you can easily overlook that when you feel the naturalness of this drama. The development of the characters felt so real, this triumphs any up and coming romantic drama for me. Nothing felt remotely fake, there were some strong potrayal of women and not just one but a few. This drama overcame the stigma of society pressure a little.
All in all for me this is a drama that I'll definitely recommend.

Frustrated. But, maybe?
Not going to lie, I really wanted to love this. I read reviews on it and it sounded amazing. I went in thinking it was going to be everything I would love, but it just disappointed in ways that overpowered the parts I enjoyed about it.

I felt that the way Jeong-In was depicted as a character throughout this story was quite selfish. People kept on saying that Ji-Ho should be thankful that someone like her was willing to love him, a single father, that he should be basically praying to the Gods and holding on for dear life to her. But quite honestly, 1) there is nothing wrong with being a single parent, 2) Ji-Ho deserved more than what Jeong-In has to offer and that was proven to us in the later episodes when Ji-Ho got drunk and exposed one of his insecurities. During episodes 14 and 15, Ji-Ho happened to get drunk and exposed the fact that he still worries about letting a significant other into his life because of a fear of them leaving. He asks, ""Will you leave us too?"" Jeong-In makes this whole entire situation about herself. She gets angry, storms off, ignores calls, and then proceeds ask to meet up. When meeting up to speak about the incident, she makes it yet again about herself, she says that she knows exactly how he feels, that she also has insecurities about their relationship, and proceeds to ask for a break to take sometime to reflect on herself. But see, the insecurities are not the same, Ji-Ho has a right to these insecurities because he has a child, it is not just his heart he has to worry about, it is also Eun-u's heart he has to worry about too. This was not the only incident that I felt made Jeong-In seem selfish and less deserving.

Naturally, this will draw comparisons to Something In The Rain. Similar backroom staff, same male lead, similar vibe in the story but this plays out much smoothly and has a way more satifying ending. The love story is heartfelt and relatable even if you're not in the same situations. The ordeal with the parents and side characters is more bearable and fleshed out. I like that there was no real villain. Ki Seok's character is bullish and arrogant but in some way, he's still down to earth and you can feel for him at times despite the character's stalkerish tendencies. The marriage proposal was wonderfully laid out. It was so casual yet loving and perfect. Getting the kid to do it for you - a magical moment.

The acting was super strong and nuanced. I can't rag on any of the cast for their performances. Whether it was the leads or the side characters, everyone had a distinct, interesting character. Everything seemed to natural and seemless. I had no probably parashuting into this world and accepting the characters for their choices.

The soundtrack might cause a few debates. The song list is limited but the songs are memerable and add to the scenes they are used for. That's all that's required.

I think the re-watch value is in the Jung Hae-In and Han Ji Min chemistry and on-screen relationship. Every scene is worth watching with them in, from the beginning of a reluctant friendship to a blossoming relationship.

What is cheating?
The chemistry was there from the very first time and so...

First thing I want to talk about is that the answer to my initial question is very difficult:

This is a question I've had for a while as I was watching this drama and reading the discussions about it.
We can discuss it through the whole drama because over here, the FL was in a monogamous 4 years long relationship with the Second ML, they are having problems, many issues as there is no more passion between them the 2ML takes her for granted and so she communicates him that their relationship is not right, therefore she doesn't feel like marrying him.

Then she meets the ML, a sweet handsome man that is a single father, the type of man that has no time to lose into relationships. He is so confident and that makes him so attractive, but that is because he has to, life and his son taught him how to be strong and overcome everything that might come to ruin his family.

The problem between the leads is that they like each other from the beginning and they try to stop the clear chemistry plus connection they have. They also try to stop themselves due to moral, ethics and society but it seems that life is in the way. So they decide to become friends and of course feelings start to surface the FL tells the 2ML that they have to break up.

I really like the fact that they break up not because of the ML, but because of the issues they have had during their relationship. Also, the FL tried to give herself a time before she jumped into another relationship.

It seems like there is no cheating unless an emotional connection is actually consider cheating. As I said before, we can discuss it, but the FL said it a couple times ""I cheated"" ""I'm a bitch"" and is self aware of the fact that her feelings have changed in her previous relationship so they might change later on.



The second I want to highlight is the relatable characters and story:

I like the fact that in this drama they don't try to portray innocent people that cannot break a thing. There are real adults with moral issues, problems, consequences and ego.

I love the relationship between the three sisters and their mom, females bonding, protecting each other like real family. Even if each one of them have very different point of views in society, their love is there to protect and help one another.

The 2ML was really annoying by how obsessed he was with the FL, just because of status and ego he was willing to do anything just to go back to his ex and get her. Sadly this is something that actually happens in real life, many times you don't love someone you just live how they boost your ego and how they give you status in society.

I love how they speak volumes about our patriarchal society and how hypocritical law is when we talk about about domestic violence, is very relevant to educate people properly in these topics.

The ML's friends are amazing, they are honest and kind, supportive and each one have a story to tell.



The third main thing is:

Acting, the main actors had an amazing chemistry that made me feel all fluff any time I saw them together, I was wishing to have something like that.


The fourth thing:
Scenery and music: Jesus I looooove it. I'm gonna download every single song is played over here. That's all.
Also, the title makes sense at the end because of the scenery, is so romantic I can't.


Finally, I recommend this drama for people that like strong healthy love relationships but are not judgemental, if you are into slice of life, healing, type of drama, this is for you.

""We could still be happy""
There are some dramas that you just don't watch for mere entertainment instead they make you think, leave you speechless and leave an impact on you even after days of completing it. One Spring Night was exactly that for me.

After watching the first episode itself I knew this one was going to hit me hard emotionally. I am not saying this drama was perfect because well, it's not everyone's cup of tea considering the fact that it's a slow burn and has minimal humour. But the way it portrayed the lives of some imperfect people perfectly was enough to get me hooked.
It tackled some of the very hard pressing problems of living in a prejudiced society in an extremely realistic way that every viewer might just find it relatable at one point or another. The main focus was obviously on the relationship between the leads but the inclusion of family traumas and taboos like single parenthood, infidelity, domestic violence and male chauvinistic pride in the plot as heavy and loud backdrop will make everyone sit up and take notice even if one doesn't wants to.

Coming to their take on relationship and intimacy. Oh, it was such a beautiful journey to watch. I could probably feel them fighting their emotions but at the same time also surrendering to it. As problematic as it seemed, it was dealt with absolute care. The romance wasn't rushed at all. The leads took their time at resolving both their inner and outer turmoils one by one (as it should be) while also acknowledging and accepting their feelings for one another. I mean every plot arc hits so close to the heart in this one. Which just shows the realistic and mature efforts put into it as a whole.

Cinematography was so breathtaking that every scene can be screenshoted and put up as wallpaper, no kidding.

The background music can come off as a little repetitive at times but that's only because the music matches the vibe of the drama perfectly and Rachel Yamagata's voice is so soothing that I couldn't possibly have complaints in this department.

At some moments you'll wish to fast forward this drama but control that urge, know that you're gonna miss out on its essence. This drama unapologetically sets its own pace and I had a wonderful time following through each and every second of it.

Also, bonus points to the writer for creating such independent, fierce and strong willed female protagonists. You hardly see that anymore.

So if you're tired of watching them cheesy rom-coms and need something close to reality that pulls on your heartstrings with great plot and even better acting, this one's probably it.

I gave this drama an 8.5 rating initially but considering the fact that it keeps replaying on my mind at random moments, I had to do the needful.

Watched this right after I completed Something in the Rain, so couldn't completely relate to Jung Hae In's character as in my mind he was still with Noona :p But apart from that, this is a mellow story that progresses really quickly into a quirky little love story between two characters albeit they have their hardships in 'trying' to be together. It's a sigh of relief to not see the usual trope which is always one of the families not being supportive of the main characters ending up together (let's make an excuse for the dad) It has a great selection of OSTs (think the director has a trend of overplaying the OSTs in his shows though, he did the same in Something In The Rain) and a lot of characters to be invested in. Definitely a casual breath of fresh air!

I’ll keep this quick and simple. You have here beautifully written characters, probably the most fleshed out I’ve seen since prison playbook and my mister, a romance that has every reason to be cliche but is fresh and exciting, a female lead who is strong without trying too hard, a male lead who is realistic and extremely likeable, supporting characters you actually care about, romantic scenes that aren’t childish and are classily and artfully done, an atmosphere that’s emotional without being suffocating, and just an amazing story. This is what something in the rain had the potential to be. This is the highest potential of an authentic romance. This is what happens when you strip away the glitz and glamor of the everyday romcom and are left with a drama that’s still worth watching because it doesn’t need anything other than what it has to offer. This is what you need to watch immediately

It is a very poetic drama, the title gives us a taste. Everything bloomed in the spring, especially love. Through the episodes, we dive into the lives of our two protagonists with humility.
We get to know the story itself, the hassle of everyday life. It is a mix of emotions, feelings, courage, affirmation and the word not to forget ""love"". I enjoyed this poetic drama from beginning to end.
It is simple and sincere, it is good for the heart and we do not need more. He delivers wonderful messages of encouragement in life, such as fighting for what we love, being courageous and loving sincerely. I really liked the evolution of the characters, which are played with authenticity and purity. They make us grow with them.
Congratulations to all the team for this successful drama.

I was not watching it at first because I already knew that it is going to be a very slow story. The plot seems very interesting to me so I started watching it but …………
Overall it was good but slow and last 3-4 episodes were torcher to watch
Firstly
Lee Jung In and Kwon Ki Seok relationship creep me out. He was not her boyfriend but a stalker. How many time she try to breakup with him but he still keeps following her and still talking about marring her is ridiculously uncomfortable for me to watch
Secondly
Lee Tae Hak [Jung In's father]. Who want a father like him? He forcefully want to marry her second daughter for his personal benefits then when he get to know that her first daughter is assaulted he still forcing her to not to get divorce
These two points were very uncomfortable but it is good to watch female lead to stand for herself and she chooses her own path and fight with these two creepy persons in her life and find true love. Shin Hyung Seon [Jung In's mother] is a very nice character who struggle for her daughters to get them their rights.
I am really disappointed they did not do anything with Kwon Ki Seok in the end. He really needs some learning of ethics but he still got a nice end
I started watching it but i forced myself to complete it

22 episode in and the story hasn't progressed much. This might put off a lot of viewers but this is not a drama that you can pick up when you feel like procrastinating, where you try to skip past the conversations to get a gist of the plot. The beauty of this drama can best be appreciated when you are bored and have absolutely nothing to do. This drama is not about cheating but about people falling out of love and finding someone you can cherish. The depth to which this drama takes the emotion in conversations is unparalleled.

What makes me fall in love with this show is that it doesn't dilute the intensity of character progression with plot and is paced perfectly. There are times when the main leads just sit and do nothing, it makes you think and understand what is going on in their heads and how they are feeling. The OST fills these silences perfectly. I can keep rewatching the conversations between the main leads forever. The side characters are fun and play a good role in supporting the main cast.

This drama is simple, beautiful and satisfying. I hope you give this a try.

Ok, so we've hit the halfway mark of the show and I wanted to share my thoughts so far before the show finishes... This is a show that is filmed and written very similarly to Something in the Rain (same directors and same writer). Both of these dramas carry a reality to them that most dramas now a days don't have. This isn't to bash lovey dovey rom coms, or fantasy/period dramas; I believe each genre has its place and if done well they are fun to watch and enjoyable. What CAN happen though with these dramas is a highlighted dependence on the abnormal and unlikely that dilutes the intensity of plot/character development and conflict resolution. It leads to shots that don't progress fluidly; skipping scenes that only capture the highs and lows of emotions but nothing in between because only SO many crazy, unbelievable things can happen at a time. This can lead to shallow characters that have shallow backgrounds that lead to shallow romances all with tropes and cliches from every other drama out there.

I think what makes this show and SITR a bit different is that it takes out the abnormal, the ""other worldly"" aspects out of the picture and SLOWS IT DOWN. This forces the drama to find emotional highs and lows, conflicts, and character development elsewhere like in realistic social issues, duty vs desire, and a realistic romance. I love the scenes where they sit and do nothing sometimes not even looking or talking to each other BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE SOMETIMES. When reading music the goal of silence is to carry the tension and this show does just that. In the silence the viewer is forced to think about what the character's might be thinking about and creates a tension through just silence itself.

The OST itself reflects the simplicity and beauty of the drama. A lot of people have complained at the short and often repeated songs. I think that the OST is brilliant because it accentuates normality; life is normal, repetitive, and quiet most of the time. Now some songs individually I think could have been written better but the soundtrack as a whole I thoroughly enjoy.

Most dramas take you out of your world to take you into theirs and that's what makes it enjoyable and fun; but this leaves a dissatisfaction when you know that it's not real and it would never happen in your life. This drama and SITR takes you out of your world and into a world that could be your neighbor's or your friend's or maybe even back into your own world. I might not have that same 'high' of riding the lows and highs of most kdramas but I am confident that I will have left this show thinking that it seemed real and that it could happen somewhere in the real world even in mine. That's what makes this show exciting and fresh.

So far I am about to watch the succeeding episodes. But what I like in this K-Drama is that the plot is so realistic and almost everything that is being shown is happening in real life; the stigma of being a single father, the controlling boyfriends, the controlling parents who wanted to choose whats best for the child, and the reality of falling out of love and loving the new one that comes to your life.

Hooked up so far!! I also love the acting of the actors. The support is also amazing! Keep up the good work!

So refreshing
I genuinely fell in love with this show instantly. It felt very real and palpable in a way that dramas in this genre never really fully grasp. I cried and got goosebumps so many times and it wasn't even necessarily because of the main couple. The drama deals with so many real and important topics and does so in a very healthy manner, without romanticizing or downplaying them, which was so refreshing to witness.

They build up all the characters really well, maybe even too well. Because my one complaint about this drama would simply be the ending, or more specifically the last two episodes... The characters just simply acted way out of character in the end, I guess it was to add to the suspense or whatnot, but that would be the singular turn off for me. They built these characters up so well that at the end you could really go ""Ah, this isn't what the character stands for."" if that makes sense. I think the ending could have been used a bit better to tie up some more loose ends, exactly because they spent a lot of time building up side characters, and then only tying up the few main ones.

But other than that, nothing but praise for this show. It handled a lot of interesting topics, from morality to how women are treated and viewed in the world while also keeping a somewhat light hearted atmosphere with the romance.

SPOILER ALERT!!
One of the most frustrating things for me how throughout half the show the entire future and love life of the main character was decided upon by three men who simply would not listen to a word she says. Especially her boyfriend at the time. All I could think was: THE AUDACITY!!!! And that really left me thinking a lot and then paired up with the domestic violence topic and how the men handled that one... It couldn't leave many unfazed I think and that's really what adds value to this show, in my opinion. Its ability to make you think about some sensitive topics and its ability to make you sympathize with the characters without downplaying these topics as the only thing they have going for them. It shows their struggles dealing with them rather than just going ""All you have to do is say no more and it all goes away!""

So yeah, idk if this makes much sense and I'm about two years late watching this, but I had to let this all out somewhere. The show is an amazing watch, and I'd recommend it to anyone!

I wouldn't call this forbidden romance, cheating story, or anything of that sort. The long-relationship, the female lead was in, was over, before she even began anything with Jiho. Most of the male characters and their behavior and actions fueled me with rage. While I would like to believe the situation is this dire only in S. Korea, I know that many men live by these principles all over the world. Also, I wouldn't label this as noona romance, she is only 5 years older than him.

+realistic portrayal of long-term relationship or relationship with a person you have nothing in common
+realistic portrayal of male-driven society, esp. in conservative countries like S. Korea
+natural skinship, kisses (due to it being on Netlflix maybe?)
+strong sisters' bond
+Jung Hae In and his puppy eyes

-most of the male characters will stir up hate inside you
-1 song used repetitively, while it's a nice song and I did not mind that much, for some it could be annoying
-some people might not enjoy the slower pace
-occasional weird fashion choices

It's such a good show, though it's slow-paced for some people
I’m not sure If it’s everyone’s cup of tea because it is slow-paced. I love the plot, though the guys in the show piss me off so fucking much, except Ji-ho. And the people that watch it, maybe iffy about it because of how slow-paced it but there is just enough action to try and move onto the next episode. It’s a nice show on a cold day. The girls all of them made me so happy, Jeong-in, Seo-in, and even Jae-in are incredible and I do have a thing for Ji-ho. The actors were all really good and the scenes made me feel comfortable. Most people might compare this show with Something in the Rain, I see it, I see the vibe. The soundtracks in this show are so good, I listen to it on repeat. I think the way Ji-ho and Jeong-in’s relationship started was my favorite, how they stuck with each other for the whole time. And since I have a thing for kids, I am not living out Eun-u, my baby he’s amazing. All throughout the show, I didn’t want anything to happen to him and Ji-ho. Even tho I didn’t like the other men in the show, they are great actors cause obviously I want to punch the hell out of them. Again the actors, mostly the main ones are so great, their chemistry on screen was so good, everything about that show was so peaceful. Something about this show seemed so calm but there was still something little about it that made you kept watching. Anyways I hope you enjoy the show, it's not everyone's cup of tea as I said.

Tedious
After not enjoying SITR (unlike everyone else in the world, apparently), I should have known better than to waste my time on this drama, considering it's the same writer, director, and main actor.

I'll start with the good - there was nothing wrong with the acting, everyone played their part well, I enjoyed the interactions between the sisters, but I think that's as far as I can take the compliments.

STORY: Oh my gosh, there were so many unlikable characters! The ex-boyfriend, both sets of parents and yes, the female lead. Female lead - I think she was supposed to be this outspoken woman, but apparently that only came out with the male lead. With him she was bossy, demanding, cranky and immature (""It must be nice to be able to eat, you must not be bothered by this at all."") She spent almost EVERY episode meeting up with the nightmare of an ex-boyfriend. She was a weakling where he was concerned, even though she knew she didn't love him. Was she trying to be nice? I couldn't quite get it. The ex-boyfriend trying to get her to marry him went on until the next to the last episode. He was just creepy. Give it a rest! Seriously, she should have gotten a restraining order or something. And then there were the parents - I know that it's important to respect your elders, but when your elders don't have any respect for you and won't listen when you say you don't want to marry someone, there's something wrong. Each episode seemed to be just a rehash of the previous one. Should she pursue this new relationship? Should she give the ex another try? The male lead was smitten with the female lead because she came in for hangover medicine? Why these two liked each other was never made clear. Almost all of the conversations revolved around how they were going to manage, because everyone was against them. I realize that Korean mores are different than American, but they made the male lead out to be a terrible person because he had a son. Then when the female lead APOLOGIZED to her mother because she was involved with a man with a child, that really irritated me.
CHEMISTRY: Kisses. I didn't feel chemistry between the leads at all. There were a couple of technically good kisses, but again, I didn't sense chemistry.
COSTUMES: She was a librarian. Was it absolutely necessary to make her dress in such a dowdy way? The clothes and shoes she wore made her look so much older than she was.
OST: Three-four songs on repeat throughout the whole drama. The songs were in English for no discernible reason and they were very distracting.
REWATCH VALUE: Not on a dare!

A sprinkel of cuteness over a harsh reality
While Jung Hae In sprinkels his charm over the screen and Han Ji Min lightens the mood with her humor this otherwise heavy and beautiful slow paced drama sheds a light on the difficulties of breaking loose from harmfull relationships while having to face societies prejudice as well as the importance of letting go and moving on. Oh and also shows some pretty good parenting advice.


This is the fourth K-drama I watched and like many others I watched it for the first time after watching something in the rain (the drama that made me completely fall in love with K-dramas).The creators of this drama are nothing shy of amazing with all from casting, to storytelling, pacing and visuals. If I have to complain about one thing it would be the choice of clothes for the leads (especially the first episodes, and the sock-less shoes) but they do fit their part so I cant even complain about that.

The casting for this drama is spot on, every singel character fits their part, the side storys enhance the theme of this drama beautifully and while some male characters make you loose all faith in men (and parents for that matter) others restore it so it evens out beautifully showing the difference between love and obsession/possession.

Jung Hae In does an amazing jobb showing a range of emotions where as his character is extremely calm, sweet and kind. He is forced to hold in his emotions most of the time and this is done beautifully. If you haven't fallen for this guy you defiantly will after you have seen this drama.

There is no doubt that Han Ji Mins character is this really cool librarian she is strong, independent and smart she finds it difficult to decide and break loose showing that even the strongest person will struggle in this situation.

The second male lead is also shown as complex, on the surface this really understanding and loving guy but beneath it a competitive, possessive, manipulative, prejudice ass something that shows you really cant tell.

So in conclusion this is a must watch, it may not always be an easy watch but a JHI smile and HJMs sweetness are never far away and will be there to comfort you.

Note! this is not an easy to watch drama, the pace is slow, you will not always understand or agree with the characters choices and if you make it threw the whole drama without getting frustrated and angry at at least one of the leads and the side characters at least once you may be the most calm person on earth.

P.s I really love the whole library and pharmacy setting and is just another one of those things that will make you fall in love even more with this drama.

Kinda flat
First the good, the OST is quite good and I still listen to it...particularly the Rachel Yamagata songs. Beyond that, it's a monotone exercise in melancholia. Appropriately, most of the scenes are rather dark as if electrical lighting outside of the pharmacy maybe, doesn't exist. The characters seem to sleepwalk through their scenes wallowing in their minor yet seemingly intractable problems. There just never is any change of pace or real energy to liven up the show. I get why people like it, but definitely a disappointment in my book.

Authencity and realistic story
If you started watching this drama after ""something in the rain"", you might want to reconsider or wait a bit. Even through there are similarities , dont watch ""One spring night"" as season 2 .


The characters are really realistic . I like the attention given to the second charactereS : they aren't caricatures or used in order to deepen our main couple's story but instead they power through struggles of their own. They're all very different from each other but equally endearing.
The acting is so well done , all of them gave a very natural performance. It really made me think i was witnessing a slice of life of real peole.

The story show us different people struggling with the korean society expectation ( societal pressures and conservative values ). The romance is really slow burn ( a bit too slow for me) but reinforce the aunthencity of the story.

On the negative side, the music. The style fit the drama fut it felt like the same song was playing during the whole se

This is the drama to watch if you are looking for realistic story without the plot employed by other Korean dramas.

A light romance drama with a story that grips you
If your looking for a light romance drama that has a story that grips you and characters and situations that are believable then this is a must watch.
The acting is great. Charecters are all memorable. I adore the child actor. The story is beliveable. I belive this is a important statement as a lot of drama's give plot twists or scenarios that you doubt would happen in real life.
Even the supporting charterers had great parts and brought depth to the story.
Over all, a very satisfying watch.

Am huge jung hae in fan after I watched him in prison playbook.
I just read the synopsis and jumped to my screen with popcorn and binged this beautiful drama.
I havent watched SITR which is so much said in other reviews. Well tbh I skipped a few scenes of the supporting character as they were really annoying.
•Story-The synopsis is just a tip of iceberg the story is more vast,developing,romantic and deep.
This show had lots of heart-wrenching moments.
Even though the breakup was taking longer episodes, but that was where the character developed.The three sisters bond was amazing.

•Acting- junghaein, as Yu ji ho was very mature and intense. He just blended in the character. His handsome face was real appealing to this role.
Hanjimin as Lee jeong in was confident and powerful acting.
•Music- each song was beautiful and meaningful. The lyrics,the music, was soulful and catchy. I even updated my playlist with osn songs.
no direction was a catchy song with upbeat music, makes me humm it while it plays in background.we could still be happy, when this was played as BGM it was so apt for the situation. Spring rain, is it you, spring waltz were also worth listening.
•Rewatch-its a beautiful romance, I would watch it when I have forgotten the story to fresh up my mind as I already know the story.
•Fav scene
When eun-u calls jeong in mom I couldn’t stop my tears.
Bonding of mothers even though there was no dialogue,the emotions kept overwhelming.

Jung Hae In has become one of my favorites, and this show was redemption for his last drama - Something in the Rain which ended so disappointingly. He was perfect in this, as was Han Ji Min, who has risen up to my favorites as well this past year.

My biggest complaint with the storyline is that the issues with the ex-boyfriend drag on way longer than they had any need to. I thought his role in the story would be done by episode 7/8, and they could move on to other issues. But that wasn't to be the case. As with SitR, One Spring Night has that realistic, raw feel to it, with great use of mood and tone.
My second and last complaint about the show is that, as also in SitR, the music was played too loudly in some scenes and although gorgeous music choices, they overplayed them quite a bit.

I loved the emotional Ji Ho and the forthright Jung In. I could relate to them. I loved Jung In's sisters as well, and wish their storylines had been explored a little more rather than the continuous merry-go-round with Gi Seok. Gi Seok's character was tied with Jung In's father as the least likable characters on the show. It made me both sad and a little angry thinking that Korean parents might actually be anything like Jung In's father. The other parents of the main couple were really enjoyable and sympathetic to me. And little Eun-Woo was adorable! I would also liked to have seen them interact with him a little more.

You'll see many of the same actors/actresses that Ahn Pan Seok likes to use, and they all are amazing.
But I'll warn anyone off of it that hated Something in the Rain. All the things that you may have disliked about it are still present in this drama, just with a better last few episodes. I'm well aware that my 8.5 rating is because I personally enjoyed the show and loved the actors, the music, and the romance, and for the sake of the romance with 2 of my favorite actors, was willing to overlook some flaws in the storyline.

I write review based on my feeling around 24hrs after watching a drama. I fee this is enough time to sit back and think of what went on without judgement being clouded.

The casting I believe was all wrong. Ji-Ho character was fine but Jeong-in looked far too mature on screen for her age. I thought nearly the whole time (until it was mentioned) that she was older than him and that it was going to turn into a forbidden love due to age. The clothing was all wrong! Who wears her kid of outfits/shoes even to work in your early 30’s? Not sure if they were trying to dress her as an image of her job but imho it looked stranger.

Even as a well educated lady, I struggled with the dialogue. Whether it be the translations or not but I found a lot of it was question and answer. Why do this and why do that. I struggled to comprehend in part exactly what the problem was as the answers were never straight forward.

The music we all know was rubbish. The songs themselves were easy on the ear but by the end you know the lyrics off by heart it plays that often.

Overall, it’s a good watch if you like realistic stories of Korean culture. For me, it seemed to far fetched and frustrating at times due to the push and pull of the love triangle, the MF family and don’t get me started on the secondary storyline of Seo-in.

A disappointment!
I shall try to be concise but I would like someone to explain to me how is this drama better than Something in the Rain?!?
It is so bad that it is difficult to watch! What a waste of excellent actors and interesting storylines: single parenthood and home abuse!
I came to it after being totally bewitched by SITR and wanted to watch something similar by the same author.
What a disaster!
Main male character is a 30 yr old pharmacist and a single father of a 6yr old son being looked after by his grandparents. The pharmacist sees his son on the weekends and the rest of the time he is a free single guy, seeing friends, drinking, playing basketball and having fun with them. The actor chosen for this part is severely miscast: excellent actor but too young!
Main female character is a 30 yr old librarian, rude, loud, bad tempered and mostly in awful mood. And of course, her wardrobe is typical librarian cliché: frumpy and ugly. She has two sisters one of whom is married and beaten regularly by her husband. Her mother is sweet and understanding (same actress as in SITR, but the character is the complete opposite!Nice!).
The pharmacist falls in love with the librarian one moring when she comes to his pharmacy hungover and in the bad mood! Love at first sight! Unbelievable!
From this moment on it is downhill all the way! And it is only the first episode!
The second is even worse: he asks her for permission to stalk her (he has been doing this but she caught him!)Alarm bells ringing in my head! What kind of love is that?!?
Don't make me start on her relationship with his son and the way she manipulates him to get what she wants!
There go twenty hours of my life wasted!

Would I recommend this? If you're a sucker for romance, want some eye-candy (Jung Hae-in), a realistic storyline and don't mind slow paced dramas, Yes.

One spring night starts off really well. Episode 1 is everything you would want a drama to be and more. As it progresses though, watching it sadly becomes somewhat tiresome. It just drags on and on and on and nothing really interesting happens. Of course there are some tension filled scenes but for the most part, its not all that gripping. But towards the end it picks up again thankfully.

At certain points it was also like 50% dialogue and 50% staring at each other, or the main characters would just be shown looking super sad by themselves. It makes sense though because the slow pace of the drama kinda makes it more realistic but then it's not exactly entertaining. As a result, the rewatch value for this drama is close 0. It took me about 2 months to watch the whole thing, that's how uninterested I was.

The acting was superb though. Everyone did phenomenally well so I don't think any of the actors/actresses could have done that much better to make it a bit less boring.

The music was really good but there were certain episodes where it felt like it was 50% drama and 50% music, that just makes you get sick of the music at times.

Overall I am satisfied with the way things panned out but I kinda wish the time spent showing Yoo Ji-ho and Lee Jeong-in being sad was used to explore other aspects e.g. the complicated and toxic relationship between Lee Seo-in and Nam Si-hoon and/or the fun loving dynamics between Lee Jae-in and Park Young-jae.

The fact I didn't like it shouldn't detract from the great story and acting...
... As per my headline, the ratings suggest that I should have given this an 8, but I didn't like this drama so I couldn't bring myself to do it. I would however draw your attention to why I might be biased or why my review might not be as objective as others.

I live in the UK and although I've watched a fair, few asian dramas, there are lots of societal and cultural norms synonymous with countries such as South Korea and China that I've just never been exposed to. The main subject of this drama is just one of those things I couldn't quite grasp as a big issue and I think, besides the story and the acting - it just meant that I was just at odds with the main subject matter.

The story is about a guy and a girl who fall in love, albeit they know they probably shouldn't because of their current situations. The girl is unhappy because she is unsuccessfully trying to break her 4 year relationship with a selfish and aggressive man (he is antagonist 1) after she realises that she's bored, doesn't love him and doesn't want to marry him. Admittedly, she realises this before she meets our male lead but ending the relationship becomes more urgent when she starts to interact with him.

Our male lead is a father of a young boy (probably 4 or 5). He is not with the boys mother anymore and he has custody of the child. He works hard to provide and care for his son and whilst he works, his parents are the primary care givers but he sees the boy on an almost daily basis. People, namely his male friends, gossip about the fact that he'll likely be single forever because no one would want to date a single father, unless she has something wrong with her - and it appears that this is common opinion, especially amongst the older generation.

This is the primary reason why, even if our female lead was single - it would not be deemed acceptable for her to date our male lead. Why this is discussed excessively is a big part of why I don't like the drama... Because I think it's a non-issue, but I recognise that korean cultural and societal measures are different, especially when you factor in what the older generation expects of the younger.

What further bothered me though is that to some extent, the actions and behaviour of our 3 main antagonists (and you could argue there were more than 3) were deemed to be acceptable and expected.

And this is where, I have to hand it to the actors because they played their parts beautifully and never have I felt such ire against our villains as I have here. I'm not sure if I would have hated them more or less if they were not all male but I guess we'll never know. Regardless, I couldn't fault the story line nor the acting in this regard as I think the script was well paced, the dialogue and especially the conveying of emotions in what was a very 'heavy' production, was on point. But back to the issues I had...

Antagonist 1 was the ex-boyfriend. The girl was honest and clear with him as to why she didn't want to pursue their relationship (even before she met someone else), but he wouldn't accept it and he plotted to simultaneously maintain a relationship with her as well as disgracing her for trying to enter a relationship with a single father. He was selfish and became aggressive... But was a loathsome individual.

Antagonist 2 was our female leads' brother-in-law. He was a devious, gold-digger who was hanging on to the coat tails of his beautiful and famous wife; spending her money and beating her black and blue when she attempted to stand up to him. When she tried to divorce him, he refused and continued to manipulate deeds to their properties and their finances to ensure he could continue to profit from their relationship even though she was doing everything possible to distance herself from him and his abuse. This got worse when she found she was pregnant with his child.

Antagonist 3 was our female leads' father and I think he was the worst of the 3. This man had 3 daughters. His eldest, a successful broadcaster, married to antagonist 2. His middle child was our female lead and his youngest was a headstrong student who loved her sisters dearly, but didn't like being told what to do. She had spent time abroad to essentially get away from her parents. His wife was loyal and loving, with her own hobbies and he was a high school administrator, nearing the latter years of his career and looking forward to a prominent position within the school system that would see him working less up until his retirement. The problem was that he wouldn't accept that his eldest daughter wanted to end her marriage even though he knew she was being beaten by her husband because he couldn't stand the disgrace of having a divorced daughter. (Genuinely, if my father even thought my husband was laying a hand on me, my other half would be dead by now). He tried to arrange the marriage of his second daughter to a man (the ex-boyfriend) he knew she didn't love and wanted to leave because, the ex-boyfriend was the son of his employer whom he didn't want to annoy, fearing his new job would be compromised. He tried to dictate what the youngest would do with her life (even though she was an adult) and she often went month's without speaking to him and finally, he berated and spoke down to his wife regarding her life choices, her relationship with their daughters and her hobbies. I'm glad to say that towards the end of the series, his wife had moved out of the family home and was considering her next steps but this man was the epitome of despicable.

I was sad that the things these 3 men did could even be brought up in a drama produced within the last 5 years, let alone the fact that our female lead had to tolerate being associated and affected by any of them.. And that's the reason, I didn't like this drama.

But as mentioned above, it was a fine story, script and production in general and the fact it affected me as much as to incite me to write a review, says it was certainly good enough to leave an impression on me... But I wouldn't watch it again just because of the uneasy feeling it left with me. I would still recommend that it should be watched, if nothing else to see what the director and the actors are capable of as that element cannot be praised enough.

I liked it, but
It was a culture shock on many levels for ME, so I can't say it was a terrible show. I liked it, but I was getting heartburn while watching it. First, I don't know how much of this could be right with relationships in Korean/China/Japan. I understand that storylines can be fabricated to bring on the dramatics, but so many people would have been placed in jail or had a restraining order placed on them for their unruly conduct in the US. So, I tried to digest it all instead of arguing with the television. I told myself: ""HEY, these are fictional characters living in a different country. Chill out. Why is it that damn song, again. Why didn't they pay for at least five songs?""

Well, don't let me be the judge. Please watch it yourself.

Ahhhh i wish there was more of Ji-Min and Hae-In

The passionate yearning and chemistry between Ji-Min and Hae-In was so remarkable and authentic.. that i often kept on forgetting that it's a TV series, and not Real life. Very realistic and excellent TV series. It's hard for me to not believe that Ji-Min and Hae-In are not in love IRL..

Real love, is just like that. Most people doesn't even realize that they are living a convenient lie, and it's not actually LOVE. But if it does ever happen, it always happens UNEXPECTEDLY.


Unexpected, You.. So appropriate

The Perfect Everyday Kdrama.
I watched this after trying to watch Something In The Rain without knowing that it was the same director and I can definitively tell you that One Spring Night is much better. There are not as many scenes that drag on uselessly (walking down the street, eating, things like that) and useless conversation. The flow of the show, the character development, the acting was all wonderful. All of the actors were terrific in this drama. Eun-u was so adorable. Every scene with him in it made me melt. Definitely worth a watch if you're looking for something with not a whole lot going on and easier to relate with but also something that doesn't drag on. I probably won't go seeking clips of it online or rewatch it right away like I did with many of the other dramas that I watched, but maybe in the future if I'm watching a really heavy drama like Itaewon Class or Goblin I'll turn this one on as a palate cleanser.

NOT YOUR AVERAGE DRAMA
Do you know when I knew that I was going to like this drama?

When I saw Kim Chang Wan. Just kidding, but it`s becoming a habit to like everything this man picks, I don`t think I saw one bad project of his. On a serious note, it was when I skipped over to the last shot of the last episode, hearing Carla Bruni sing ""Spring Waltz"" and seeing a couple go in and out of the frame, laughing and kissing.

In a pharmacy of all places. If I had to use one word to describe this drama, it would be `natural`. Just most things about it feel natural. The music choices(even though I adore all the songs they used and have them on my phone as I type this, they do get repetitive), the acting, the way almost every shot is composed, even down to the actual locations, which are set up perfectly and when you see dramas with such fake sets, you come to appreciate this attention to detail a lot more. I went into this drama not knowing nor expecting a whole lot, since I haven`t seen ""Something in the Rain"". I also couldn`t draw any conclusion from the poster alone. The title sounds unassuming. In fact, I didn`t even read the synopsis. And in hindsight, I think that`s the best way to approach this drama. Let me warn you first though, it`s SLOW. Locations rarely change, there`s no exciting actions nor dramatic revelations. Which can turn off some, but it was such a welcomed change of pace for me. After a slew of dramas incorporating memory loss, childhood friends finding each other again, stupid, easily solvable misunderstandings and more, seeing actors portray characters that act like PEOPLE, like you and I and many others off the street, was borderline exhilarating.

And I didn`t even start talking about the actual show yet. First off, the acting. What acting?These actors ARE their characters. The things they talk about, the way they make small gestures, it all counts for something. If you can`t find anything else to enjoy in this drama, be assured that you`ll at least love the acting, because it`s that good. I`ve skimmed through some of the reviews for this drama, and while some are more than valid and helped me understand why it`s(in my opinion) underrated, some were downright confusing, citing lack of chemistry and acting. Let me elaborate. With a script and pace like this, you have no other alternative but to depend almost exclusively on the chemistry and banter between your actors. To put it bluntly, had that really been the truth, this drama, with all its potential, would have gone down the drain. In fact, someone used this as a negative but I would wholeheartedly use it as a positive. They wrote:""This whole thing feels like an improvisation.""And I agree. It feels real, not clumsy. Even when some questionable plot points are brought up, the way characters react to them is not good or bad, it`s just real. And they all have flaws that can sometimes even be glaring, making you forget that hey, they do have some merits as well. Jeong-in is smart and cunning, but she`s also overbearing and rash. I heard that this role was first offered to Son Ye-jin, and boy, am I ever so glad that she turned it down because this is Han Ji-min`s character through and through. She plays the jaded, at time lifeless, drudging along life Jeong-in like a pro. Same goes for Jung Hae-in, whose Ji-ho unanimously reminds me of ""It`s Okay to Not be Okay""`s Gang-tae. He suppresses his thoughts and feelings for both his child and to not be hurt emotionally again. It`s believable, frustrating and, at times heartbreaking. Their relationship isn`t perfect either, like they usually are in dramaland, until some big twist occurs.They don`t agree on things and argue, but they do it in such a way where you almost want to be like: ""Hey guys, it`s fine."" And they`ll reconcile. I`m a big fan of such portrayal. I really connected with them and am so glad that they got their happy ending. It almost felt like bidding goodbye to good, old friends, knowing that they`ll be happy for sure. Don`t be mistaken however, the rest of the cast does its job exceptionally well. Especially Lee Moo-saeng, whose role of an manipulative and abusive husband of Seo-in, Jeong-in`s older sister, is so convincing that I felt creeped out. The way he changes his tone and facial expressions from pleading, affectionate to pure, white rage, is beautiful, in a twisted sense. It`s disgustingly realistic. Same goes for the character of Gi-seok, who started off as someone worthy of some sympathy and ended up being someone so calculating and pathetic, that you just wanted to squash him. Bottom line is, all of these characters feel alive and like someone you know.

To be honest, I really couldn`t shake the feeling of being a voyeur almost, spying on these people and their conversations in secret, feeling the spring air envelop my body in a comfortable cocoon. The shots breathe, they are handled with care and are sometimes impressive. The writing is rather average, but there are some notable moments, like the ""Don`t cross the street"" scene and such. Also, and I didn`t see anyone else mention this yet, but the humor in this drama is spot on. I would by no means call it a comedy, but the lines of dialogue that should be perceived as funny, are, in a realistic, dry sense that I find amusing. Again, this is my review after all. And the jokes that land, do so on the back of relatability. We`ve all gotten drunk when we shouldn`t have and we`ve all been teased by our friends for our dating choices. And it still comes off as funny, that`s what I like to see. Now for the drawbacks.

I have to thread lightly here, as many people have so many cons when talking about this drama, but I only have two. Characters won`t get as much character development as you think they would, and the things you want them to solve, probably won`t be solved conclusively. What I mean by this is that we love to project our hero complexes and like to expect positive results from drama characters, stemming from expectations we imprinted upon them. It`s inevitable and we all do it. So don`t be disappointed when things don`t go your way, even though they should. I won`t spoil anything, but you`ll know what I`m talking about when you experience Seo-in`s storyline. Also, and I can`t stress this enough, be prepared for a lot of lingering shots of people doing everyday things. Be prepared to see a lot of mundane activities displayed and, even though you may think that they are showing you something pointless, this is also how you can let your audience in the minds of your characters.

In the end, ""One Spring Night"" is definitely not for everyone and you do have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it, but at the same time, I feel like this is one of those dramas which will get more recognition as time passes by. I eagerly await that spring day when I can recommend this drama to someone and to hear a reply like ""Oh yes, I watched it. It`s a classic.""Because I think it just might deserve it.

Heartwarming to the core
This drama was so heartwarming that I could not put it down and was up till 03:30 after beginning it just so I could finish it in one setting! I was skeptical at first to start this as I find young child actors can ruin a drama due to inexperience and it also seemed a bit cliche but after the first couple of episodes it blew all my worries out of the water, it was amazing.

The story at first seems a bit cliche but it varies quite a bit with all the sisters stories, even having the male have the child instead of the female is a refreshing change. It shows you some of the struggles a single parent can have trying to find love again and how situations can make you a lot more skeptical.

The romance between the main characters was cute! The way the female lead was so warm towards the son just made my heart melt. I enjoyed watching the younger sister for her spunkiness and the older sisters story was very interesting but also very saddening with the situation she had gotten herself into. The were so caring and worried for their son and how they did not want him heartbroken again and the typical parents dictating the females romance life for the daughters that is found quite common in dramas.

I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! Its too beautifully done to miss!

Do not miss out on this drama, it's pure perfection
It's a drama but not to dramatic, it feels like your friend telling you her love story

The cast has played their roles v well and they make you care for them. It's a simple love story that delivers deeper message with respect to society.
It's beautifully writen and even more beautifully narrated .

The male lead makes you yearn for him by his sincerity and love. The female lead is an epitome of a modern women.

I absolutely fell In love with kdrama thanka to this gem of a show. I am constantly on lookout for more such drama ""s.

Ps this may not be for those who enjoy tooo dramatic shows, it's a simple slice of life drama

Do you ever feel that you don't want a kdrama to end, like ever? You feel satisfied by just watching the show characters going by their life with no sophisticated plots and events worth mentioning. This kdrama gave me these feelings. A huge part of it was the chemistry. Not only between the FL and the ML but between the sisters, friends, and parents as well.

At first, I was afraid that this is going to become a cheating/affair kdrama. And as many see it this way I don't. Yes the FL did have some curiosity towards the ML while being with her boyfriend. But this doesn't mean that she was emotionally cheating on her boyfriend cause she did tell the ML about her boyfriend and offered him a friendship instead. The second thing is that the intimacy between her and her boyfriend was already fading away and it had nothing to do with the other guy, she was going to leave him sooner or later.

What I liked about the FL is that she didn't settle just because she had to. And as she mentions multiple times throughout the show, ""I don't want to marry someone just because I'm a suitable age for marriage"" and as a woman, I couldn't agree more. She made it clear that she wasn't thinking about marriage and didn't manipulate her partner.

Many people thought that the drama started very slow and complicated, but this is how adult relationships are like, you don't just meet someone, and boom you're dating and they're your soulmate. When you're mature enough you'll know that even when it comes to love and relationships you'll have to do some thinking.

For the ML, I did like his personality as well, he was nice, caring and, understandable. However, what I didn't like that much about him, is that he wasn't being completely true to her. When he got drunk and expressed his fears that was the moment when he was fully honest. I know it's difficult to talk about your fears especially in front of someone whom you admire, but still, in order to have a healthy relationship, you should express your fears and let your partners become aware of them, which eventually did happen so I have nothing to complain about regarding the flow of the show.

One Of My Fav
Watch it at leat 5-6 times and thoroughly enjoyed every moment.

Solid story telling of falling out and into love and fighting for relationship against odds.

Subplots added realism and blend well to show relationship amongst sisters.

It showcase very real life situations and expectations like a retiring father looking to a position, societal pressure on divorce, single parenthood etc.

I enjoyed the support and fight lead couple had for each other. Their friends also provide support and it was gratifying to see them together.

All casts portrayed their characters solidly and as one reviewer mentioned, there is no real evil characters.

One of the best.

A calm redemption
Oh Jung Hae-In, I love you so much.

If you've seen Something in the Rain, it is impossible not to draw comparisons. The team clearly learned their lesson: we got wonderfully empowered women this time, as well as the mom's big redemption (I like to pretend this actress is playing the same mother... haha!). At the same time, this show continues to deliver behaviour in line with my expectations — artsy cinematography (tbh sometimes too much division / foreground-background nonsense), a slow pace, super realistic / relatable scenarios, and the same few English songs on loop (but at least I like the one about seasons changing, albeit it's a bit on the nose). It doesn't quite reach the heights and chemistry of Something in the Rain though, unfortunately. The highs aren't as high, but the lows CERTAINLY aren't as low. Thank goodness.

Top highlights: Eunwoo, the giggly cute lovey-dovey scenes, the emphasis on books!, the wonderful friendships and strong sisterly bonds. I really enjoyed Seo-In's situation, and I wish we got a bit more detail there. I'm glad we got to witness Ki Seok's slow descent into madness. He started off as a bland, inoffensive guy and turned into a stalking monster with a vendetta. This got old pretty fast; at some point he was more like an annoying gnat that I wished just went away. The eventual soju/restaurant scene was sad, but HECK, THEY DESERVED IT.

The show unfortunately dragged in the middle. I think a 12-episode format might've worked better, or a couple of additional plot points would've made things more interesting (like a direct confrontation with the mother). Still, the writing didn't fall off a CLIFF in the second half, and I got the chance to stare at Jung Hae-In a bit longer, so that made it a win for me.

perfect romance drama...
It is love at first sight for pharmacist Ji Ho (Jung Hae In) with Jeong In (Han Ji Min) when she steps in his pharmacy for a hangover cure. The cliche here is that she is already in a relationship that has gone to the stage of marriage discussion and he is a single dad. The story revolves around how they overcome the hurdles around them and take the chance, to be honest with their love for each other.
Ji-ho and Jeong-in realize how difficult it would be to have a relationship with each other, so they intend to leave it be. However, tension builds between the two as Ji-ho cannot deny his feelings for Jeong-in and Jeong-in struggles to suppress her feelings for Ji-ho. There are many times where she calls him and wants to meet with him for no apparent reason. After some time, she decides to follow her heart. Both Ji-ho and Jeong-in have to make uncomfortable decisions, and the road for them is never easy as they prove to their parents and friends the sincerity of their feelings.
One Spring Night is not a typical K-drama, it is a thought-provoking series that will make you question and reflect on realities for what they are. If you like slow-burn stories that grow on you slowly but deeply, please watch this show, and you will be all set for an emotional ride.

A Note for Western Audiences
Here's the thing. The central points of conflict--the suffocating stigma attached to being a single parent in Korea, and the rigid sense of filial respect and duty leading to a lack of autonomy in personal decisions--has no direct translation to Western culture. (Honestly, if someone wanted to respond with an in-depth explanation of these values and how they influenced decisions, that would be helpful and so very appreciated. I'm particularly confused by characters hiding their sometimes significant difficulties from those who would support them—in other words, the noble sacrifice trope. Our main couple's more mutually supportive dynamic feels obvious to me, a Westerner, and not like the anomaly/cultural shift they're fighting for, so I'd like to learn more about what I'm missing.)

That said, to an extent it doesn't matter if you don't entirely get it. The stakes are clear and high, and the characters act consistently based on their values. Assuming you have even a basic and vague understanding of the two central societal expectations, you can understand in a broad sense how A leads to C, even if you don't understand the murky nuances of B.

The fact that OSN's main strength is exploring the murky and nuanced B is a double-edged sword. As others have noted, this story is a masterclass in realism, just with the guaranteed (and, I found, highly satisfying) HEA. While the slow, gentle pacing was essential for the story, in the long close-ups I often wished I could listen to the FL's and ML's internal monologues. So in some respects, I wonder if this wouldn't have worked better (at least for those less familiar with Korean culture) as a book. Yet maybe not being fully aware of the characters' internal life enhanced the story. Yes, it could be frustrating, but it was also true to life. We often DON'T know what others are thinking, even those we know best.

OSN has provided a lot of food for thought, and I love it for that. Few K Dramas have that level of depth to them, and seeing the way this drama was directed has provided an important counterpoint that's enabled me to better articulate my loves and frustrations with the genre as a whole.

One of my all time favourites
Finally decided to write a review for this drama, after rewatching 3 times, first watching it in 2019, and then one in each of the next two years.
Honestly, one of my top korean dramas. I don't know why I love it so much but it has a special place in my heart so I would 100% recommend it to anyone trying to decide if it is worth the watch!!

Without spoiling too much, honestly Ji-Ho (main male lead) really touch my heart (might be slightly also cause of the actor) I feel like you don't often see much representation of young single dads much in korean dramas, especially being the main character. so this really gripped me in (not to mention the kid is so adorable).
For the Jeong-In (Female lead), I mean I liked her, some people might have different opinions to me but I don't think she did anything wrong, when she fell in love with Ji-Ho despite being in a relationship. Now let me explain, well for the get go we see that she doesn't exactly seem happy in her current relationship, the 'current' boyfriend also shows himself as a douchebag in my opinion, he doesn't seem like a great person at all. which is further confirmed by his actions towards both Jeong-In and Ji-Ho. As well as this he continues to bring Ji-Ho down for being a single parent saying ""no women would want him for the reason of him having a child"" (this might be a cultural difference, but I don't like it) . I feel like we are meant to not feel sorry for him when she choses to leave him and go to Ji-ho.

Also another part of this drama I fell in love with is the music, honestly if you are not persuaded by the story I mean the music playlist is one of my favourites. Every song fits perfectly with the characters so much so that I find myself visualising different characters as some of the different songs. They fit so well !!!

Overall I love this drama with my heart, I would recommend it if you want a calm drama with a nice romance. :)

This is what ""Something in the rain"" should have been
A lot of people draw comparisons of ""Something in the rain"" with ""One spring night"", and they'd be right to say that these stories are similar, and they'd be right, both the dramas are very similar. The cast are largely same, and the use of similar soundtracks and the pacing of both dramas give them a similar air, but they're different enough that you will gain something different from both.

The fact that the leads in One spring night are handling the problems that they face with mutual respect and with the understanding that both of them are adults and capable of taking care of themselves is quite refreshing. In most dramas, and especially in ""Something in..."" the relationship dynamic is such that both people are trying to protect the other and this feeds in to the toxic narrative that one should always sacrifice themselves for the other in a romantic relationship for it to be ""real"".

Apart from this difference in dynamic much of the issues that the drama deals with are different. Of course there is overlap in how families and social standing are involved in romantic relationships between two people, but most of the other topics the drama touches upon differ in either content or execution.

The soundtrack for this Drama is absolutely beautiful, and compliments the scenes perfectly, the production value is good, and the acting is impeccable. So if you want to see a drama which will pull at your heartstrings without frustrating you with the actions of the leads, this is the one you're looking for!

(Very mild spoilers on 2nd paragraph)

I don't even know where to start, I'll just say that if you're watching this drama for the romance... don't.
I just didn't understand how the leads came to fall for each other (and so fast?? the whole show happens in the span of 3 months). They meet, she is kind of bitchy towards him after he lets her go without paying, they have some kind of spark, and suddenly they're totally obsessed with each other. She memorizes his phone number after he said it *once*. And don't get me wrong, I understand that it sometimes happens that you have an instant connection with someone, but it felt so out of place? 2nd episode and the guy was head over heels for her following like a puppy after she was only mean and dry to him?? and told him she had a boyfriend?? I just did not understand why and how they were so into each other after barely speaking. And what I first thought was the characters acting awkward with each other because they just met, was actually the actors having no chemistry with each other. They did get a bit better by the end, but still. The dialogues between them completely sucked too, so I feel like I can't really blame the actors. There's also the fact that I could never believe the characters were the same age because Jeongmin (FL), looked way older than Jiho (ML), at the end I googled and indeed Han Jimin is 6 years older than Jung Haein. They could've made her character older but I guess that would've been just too much for her family lol.

Then there's the main conflict of the show which is Jeongmin's boyfriend (Kiseok) and their parents. I don't know if all Korean families/people are like this or if it was just being exagerated on the show, but they were really getting on my nerves. Jeongmin's father specially. I get it was pointed out all the time how he was in the wrong, even by his wife, but by the end it was just too much, the man seemed insane. And Kiseok, oh my god. At the beginning I thought, 'well he's kind of a shitty boyfriend but he's not that bad, doesn't deserve his girlfriend emotionally cheating on him'. By the end, I just didn't understand what he was doing. His character didn't make sense. Neither did his father, I could never understand what that man's intentions were.
I enjoyed the relationship between the 3 sisters and their mother a lot though. They always had each other's back. I also liked Jeongmin and Jiho's friends and workmates, loved the dynamic between her sister and his friend lol.

Another thing I didn't enjoy was how 90% of the conversations happened while eating. I know it is a thing in K-Dramas, but in this one it felt way to excessive. I just couldn't catch a break between meals. Please find another place to have a conversation. And the music... probably the most annoying part of the whole show. They had 2 songs that were played over and over again every few scenes. And they felt so out of place most of the time, they didn't really go with the mood. I'm not sure if they were original songs because they were in english? It was weird.

Overall, this drama didn't suck. The story was fine, but the script fucked it over. The actors did a good job with what they had, but it's a shame the leads didn't have any chemistry. The soundtrack was pretty bad.

content interesting, very slow, kind of everyday life scenery
The theme could have been more developped, but I guess the budget was very very very tight, everything was tight even the end which was exactly the same combinaison of scenes and song we saw at the beginning. Conclusion: the feeling you get while watching this drama is the same as taking a walk around the corner just to go outside a little bit...so, how was your walk really depends on how was your day at work or in general, and how was the weather. What you learnt watching this drama is that when you have a tight budget, just stay frugal and keep eating the same fried chicken while listening the same song.

This review may contain spoilers
I ended up really enjoying this drama. It was romantic, very emotional, and had powerful things to say about family and social status and the idea of 'propriety'. There were moments that were just unbelievably tender and felt so real that I almost felt like a voyeur watching real people. I did have some issues with the drama and felt like there were areas where the writing wasn't as good and the pace didn't work for me, but on the whole I can recommend this drama freely to other people with a clear conscience.

First of all, I love our leads. I felt like I was falling in love with both of them as the drama went on, which rarely happens to me. Jung Hae In was astounding as Yoo Ji Ho (a character far more nuanced and complex than his role in Something in the Rain) -- he portrayed all the many sides of the character so well. Obviously he was practically born to play puppy-dog sweetness, but he was also so good in the more bold and fierce moments and the vulnerable ones. I felt like there was a depth and softness to him that a lot of male leads never get. I also loved Han Ji Min as Lee Jung In, even though it took some time to get used to her. She also felt like a real person: bold but not reckless, blunt but not rude, prickly but still warm. I would say that initially I felt a bit disconnected from her character, but by the end of the drama I was completely on board. She says she doesn't like adventure, but she's brave and confidant by the end of the drama. I also really enjoyed their relationship. They communicate A LOT and spend a fair amount of time trying to get on the same page with each other, which I enjoyed. It does take some getting used to (a more naturalistic and nuanced portrayal of a relationship), because it's so rare in dramas to see this that it can feel clunky for the viewer. I also felt like they had a very domestic and comfortable chemistry, so I wouldn't describe this drama as 'sexy', but it definitely made you feel very alone watching it as a single person! They are crackling onscreen, but not in the same sultry and sexually charged way as in dramas like Something in the Rain or Before We Get Married.

I was surprised by how much this drama focuses on social issues. Misogyny, family hierarchy, marriage, domestic violence, divorce, single parenthood, wealth -- these things were all front and centre in the drama, to a degree that I wasn't really expecting. Where I'm from single parenthood and divorce aren't really taboo at all. Getting divorced won't really 'harm your image' and being a single parent doesn't make you some king of social pariah. I didn't really understand what the big deal was until we were halfway through the drama and I realized that these things (at least according to One Spring Night) are still shameful. While that made the drama heavier than I thought it would be (the guilt Ji Ho feels for having 'saddled' Jung In with his shameful reputation as a single dad, the dilemma Jung In's sister faces between her career and getting divorced, the pressure Jung In's family has for her to marry the man she's in a loveless relationship with), but it also made for a very impactful and emotional story. Watching Ji Ho and Jung In face very real obstacles like their parents' disapproval was painful, but it only made their love feel more miraculous and powerful.

Here are the things I didn't like: I found the start of their relationship really uncomfortable. I felt like it took WAY too long for Jung In to really firmly break things off with her boyfriend, and the sneaking around and secret friendship made me very anxious. I know this is par for the course, but their dishonesty both with each other and the other people in their lives was a murky place to begin a relationship and got in the way of me feeling any chemistry between them. I also felt like their actual dialogue in many of those scenes was disjointed and clunky, and the character motivations felt off. After they actual got together and Jung In's more firmly broke up with her boyfriend I felt like his scheming stuck around for way too long. I felt like there were a lot of repetitive scenes in that storyline (I know that to a degree that was the point, but I also felt like there was a point where it just got ridiculous. What! You're meeting him again?? To tell him that you're sorry you broke his heart? Didn't this already happen like FIVE times?). There were definitely some skippable moments.

On the whole, this drama is solid. There is such a powerful central love story here, even if it got off to a rocky start. It's also a very heavy drama, with a lot to say about many social issues. It's a tender and painful depiction of love and families, and finding the balance between our duty to ourselves and our duty to others. A solid 7.5/10

Shouldn't be compared to Something in the rain
Well, I'm here after watching both Something in the rain (first) and now One spring night. If I haven't seen people comparing the two dramas I wouldn't do it either but I feel I have to after I read some reviews for both dramas. As I said to the review of Something in the rain I don't understand the lower ratings. Both dramas are very good, they are dramas that touch on serious real life problems and analyzing overcoming social and gender stereotypes.

Just because the writer of the stories and some actors are the same to both dramas that doesn't mean they are similar. I personally divided them in my head and I formed unbiased opinions for each one. Here's why there are not the same. Something in the rain is intense, it has spark, it's more dynamic while One spring night is more chill, a slow burn and shows much more vulnability from the characters. The romance and chemistry of the 2 main leads in Something in the rain is top-tier, you feel the emotions in your bones, I also felt sad, frustrated and I was unsure about the ending. On the other hand with One spring night I felt more calm, I lowkey expected the ending, and the story is mainly about the conversations between the characters, so it felt like reading a book.

To conclude I liked both dramas but Something in the rain is closer to my taste because I like intense drama and feeling the same emotions with the characters. At the end of the day is all about personal taste, but I suggest to watch both dramas because they talk about very serious issues.

worth rewatching
I just finished binge watching it after 1 year, and this time I noticed the details even more. The drama is so well written that though I have watched it before, I was completely addicted for two days straight. It is quite realistic and opens our eyes to several different things which we look down upon generally in reality. It elaborates how situations leads to certain circumstances, you can't paint most people in black or white, there are grey zones. It show how wonderful some humans can be and how powerful some are to be able to overcome massive emotional toll. Loved it from the bottom of my heart the first time, this time even more.

A slow pace drama but worth a shot
Mainly this drama has different story which portrayed the actual difficulties in real love life. I really enjoyed this drama but little disappointed (bored) because at some time the story got stuck and repeating the same things(scenes) but I don’t regret for watching this. Especially the FL character I most impressed, she is such a determined and committed to love or the decisions she made but I what I felt is the ML doesn’t deserve the FL because for him she endured so much pain and made so much sacrifices but he couldn’t quit alcohol for her even once it resulted in almost break up, and cheat her even he pledged to her not to drink more than once in a month (punishment for breaking the pledge is break up). He has a son but still he doesn’t have any commitment or responsibility to cherish her.

A slow but worthwhile night in spring
I found this show very difficult to watch initially but persevered because of the upcoming Snowdrop show featuring the same male lead.

The premise of this show is beautiful, and socially relevant by flipping the single parent stereotype. But it's a slow-burning show and the crawling pace of developments in the first few episodes really made it difficult for me to get into it. I gave up on the show before coming back and I'm glad I did because after episode 6 it gathered momentum. The pace of the show didn't change much but it had finally entered its meaningful stages of conflict where the storytelling and dialogue were rich in quality.

This show flourished from having excellent stories all round that didn't detract from the show's underlying message, but rather added it to it. This was a story of finding yourself, freeing yourself and doing right by escaping tormenting, abusive and painful relationships. Broken hearts and broken relationships lead to broken people. This show took on conservative norms and ideals and challenged them powerfully whilst being nuanced, empathetic and grittily realistic. There was a lot of beauty found in the small, meaningful dialogues where characters reassured and confided each other, and a lot of power in how they faced up to the reality of the truth regarding the state of their lives and their relationships. This show underlined that relationships do not exist solely on love but respect and reciprocity, and that abuse can be emotional and physical.

For that, I applaud it. It began slowly but it only got better and better with each episode and by the end was a fantastic watch.

Romance and healing in equal parts
I have not seen SITR so I'm not going to make any comparisons.
I could write an essay on this show but I don't want to bore you so I'll keep this short.
This show is not an easy watch. It touched on a number of Korean societal issues. There were relationship breakdowns, familial pressures, prejudices and more. Through finding love and supporting each other did the OTP heal their emotional wounds and find happiness.
The story was beautifully told. It was not hurried but each lull are bracketed by impactful codas. You can take a breather and maybe even enjoy some swoon-worthy moments but you can never let your guards down. It is that underlying tension that lift the show above the pack. It is not a dread in the pit of your stomach but a sense of foreboding as you know that it will not be plain sailing for the leads. And fight they did, to find love, to be allowed to love and to preserve what they won.
Acting of the leads were superb. You feel their sadness, confusion and joy. Even the support case were great. Each have their own story arcs and the sum total of their contribution was certainly great.
Ultimately, it was an enjoyable and satisfying watch. You will feel a bit worn out but it only make the reward that much sweeter.
OST was good. Crafted to suit the drama being played out. Rewatch is a given.

One Of My All Time Favorites
Melodramas are my absolute favorite, but it is very easy to mess up if it is not done right, especially since you need to understand how to pace it to where it is not too slow, and how to write your characters to where they're not too boring. One Spring Night is not one of those dramas at all, in fact, it is one of my favorite dramas of all time and I rewatch it multiple times a year. This show was my introduction to the gift that is Jung Hae-in and for that, I am also forever grateful to the show for introducing me to one of my favorite actors. Now on to the actual review...

The pacing of One Spring Night was done so well in that, the conflicts the characters were facing were never rushed, and even while I was impatiently waiting for Ji-ho and Jeong-in to begin their relationship, the will-they won't-they trope actually made sense and wasn't written to be frustrating, but rather heartbreaking. You can see how they struggled to maintain the lives they already had in place while desperately wanting to fit the other in it, and so you just couldn't be annoyed even if you wanted to.

Every character was fully fleshed out, from the leads to Jeong-in's sisters all the way down to her parents. Arguably, I wish we had seen Ji-ho's parents more, but that is just a personal preference due to being attached to the characters and wanting to know everything about them. Anyways, every character had a story to tell and I was never bored with any of them. The writers did an incredible job of giving all the important characters a story all while making sure that our lead characters got most of the spotlight. Every person in this show felt so real, which brings me to my next point.

The actors on here did such a wonderful job portraying their characters, and Han Jimin and Jung Hae-in were so lovely to watch. Their pain, frustration, motivation, and happiness felt so convincing and the characters never strayed away from who they are, even as they grew together. Jeong-in is a headstrong librarian who doesn't believe in Korea's standard of what a household should look like, and she makes that a point by consistently defending Ji-ho as others judge him for being a single father. Ji-ho is a shy pharmacist who struggles with opening up and speaking his mind but has the heart of gold, just like Jeong-in, and has so much love to give. Seeing the way their personalities mesh well together as well as the way they clash was truly the highlight of One Spring Night.

The chemistry between Hae-in and Jimin was so beautiful, it truly brought Jeong-in and Ji-ho's relationship to life, and it is the main reason why I keep coming back to it. The way the characters love one another, support one another, and grow together was so lovely to see and they made each other a better person. Ji-ho showed Jeong-in that she deserves to be loved for who she is and that if she ever feels frustrated or upset with something he does, she can always go to him because she knows he'll listen. Jeong-in shows Ji-ho that he should be confident in himself and not worry about the opinions of others because he is a great man and a great father who deserves all the love in the world. Even when they clash, they're able to come back and talk about their issues, unlike before when they had to keep their love a secret. Now I will say that although their relationship had toxic tendencies in the beginning, the toxicity isn't consistent and they are able to fix that issue once they're able to be open and honest with each other, themselves, and those around them.

If you love melodramas, warm and cozy characters, and a realistic and beautiful storyline, One Spring Night is the perfect show for you. I will always recommend it to those who love the genre and those who want to kick back after a long day and watch something peaceful.

Feelings change
8/10 iis my rating. This is a 2019 South Korean romantic drama with 26, 70 minute, episodes.

After four years with Kwon Gi-seok (Kim Jun-han), Lee Jeong-in (Han Ji-Min) is wondering why her feelings toward her boyfriend have become lukewarm. Still, with family pressuring marriage, that would have been the likely result if a surprise romantic interest did not unexpectedly come into Jeong-in's life. Jeon-in is a librarian and Gi-seol is a banker who has family wealth and would be considered a ""catch"" by most. One spring night Jeong-in has a drinking party with her close friend and stops by the pharmacy where Yoo Ji-ho (Jung Hae-in) works to get a hangover remedy. What could have been a inconsequential meeting develops into sparks of interest when Jeon-in discovers she forgot her wallet and Ji-ho, immediately attracted to the vivacious Jeong-in, offers to let her pay later. After a series of missed texts, Ji-ho finally revisits the pharmacy to pay back Ji-ho and he expresses interest in her but she firmly tells him she is in a relationship so they can only be friends. Admitting interest in someone is not a frequent or easy thing for Ji-ho as he is a single parent who went through many years after heart break after his girlfriend left him and his son. In South Korea a long term relationship is a form of commitment and with both families in agreement for Jeon-in and Gi-seol to marry, it is taboo to break up, particularly to immediately enter another relationship with none other than a single dad. Single parenthood in South Korea still carries a lot of social stigma and Ji-ho has suffered derogatory comments since his son was born. So, while their situation makes it nearly impossible to be together, they find they actually run in the same social circles and repeat encounters lead to undeniable feelings developing between the two.
Jeon-in finally decides to end her relationship with Gi-seol and follow her heart with Ji-ho. However, not only has Gi-seol, who had been slow to propose marriage, suddenly decided he can't live without her, he also does not want to lose her to Ji-ho who he considers beneath him. With all the obstacles in their way, Ji-ho and Jeong-in have to constantly evaluate if their relationship is worthy and their feelings strong enough for each other to sustain their love for the long term.

*spoiler alert. I liked the overall theme of this which is which was love can conquer just about anything. Jeong-in did not feel the fact that Ji-ho was a single dad to be a detriment to having a relationship with him. It wasn't that she did not realize it made things hard for them, because she did, she just did not personally care that he was a single dad. In fact, as someone that loved kids, she grew to like Ji-ho's young son almost immediately. The ex-boyfriend became extremely obsessed with getting Jeong-in back and it felt irritating at times because it seemed that he was fairly lukewarm about their relationship until he realized he had competition. Jeon-in's dad was very frustrating because he seemed to be more concerned about social status and appearances than the welfare of his daughters. It was very satisfying when Jeon-in stood up to him about not wanting to marry Gi-seol to help advance her father's career, and later when she stood up to him about her right to love Ji-ho. The music in this one was very antnoying. They played the main song loud and so frequently hat it became irritating. I understand the cultural stigma on single parenthood as we like to think in the United States that there is no stigma but, having been a single parent myself for awhile, I can tell you there is. Many people do not want to take on a ready made family and, for the single parent, you have to be very selective about who you would be willing to interact with your children. It did not suprise me that the main character was so accepting of Jeong-in's son as she mentioned she loved children and, since that is the way I feel about children, I understand it. I lreally like children so I know if I were in the position the fact that the person I loved had a child or even children would not deter. It also explored domestic violence and the feelings of shame and denial. It ended and wrapped up well. Recommend for those that like mature themes.

One of the rawest, most honest, passionate romances I’ve seen.
Crude. Feels like open flesh
If feelings could kill I could’ve died.
It is so frustrating. And also, frustratingly good.
I cannot express enough.
I thought I wouldn’t feel this way watching a drama again. I thought it wasn’t possible to fall in love with another drama this way. The burning passion.

Burning, passionate, warm, frustrating, raw, expressive, heated love story.
It is anything but cliche.
It is incredible how the story is told. Realistic, yet intensively romantic.

I have stopped caring about the world for 10 continuous hours. And felt like I walked in spring’s breeze.

The story really could have gone bad if it wasn’t for the director (and writer). It could have been another slumping cliche.
I have respect for the director Ahn Pan Seok, and I can’t help but feel greedy and want him to cast the same cast and crew he does every time, especially Jung Hae In.
Yes, I hated some characters, but I loved the writer for including them. They’re all given almost equal importance.

I wish that in the future more directors and writers learn to capture our feelings the way they did; with an original story and captivating characters.

Parting with it is so hard and so difficult. I wanted a painful love story, and I got it.
This might feel like a cozy drama, but it is a devil of pain in disguise. Definitely not light.
I read what someone said in their review “this drama is so tiring to watch” and I 100% agree with that.

It's so memorable down to the lines.

I have written so much but nothing about the acting. That is because it was not...

IT DID NOT FEEL LIKE ACTING. It felt so real. So, so real. Really.
(and it gave me a hard time trying to believe that it’s not real and get over it).
It was like their eyes were speaking to you; pouring their emotions out. As if they weren’t the actors but they were the characters themselves. Everything felt so sincere. I’ve fallen for Jung Hae In's acting in SITR, but he was someone else here, but still with a big loving heart. His body language spoke louder than him.
Han Ji Min has a very special place with me now and I regret not appreciating her more seriously before this.
Joo Min Kyung is a show stealer!

They felt like real people, real families, real friends, real sisters, real fathers, real mothers, real parents, real grandparents, real children, real incidents, real problems, real world, yet it was just a melodrama.

I don’t understand the way many people say that this drama is similar to SITR …
Yes, if you look at the big picture they may seem similar. I would definitely recommend one if you liked the other.
But not if you look closely. They are both romances, that start in secret, about two people falling in love, and then trying to get accepted by their families. But in reality, the stories are so different. A whole different kind.

The music that many people criticize, it beautifully carried the show with passion. It was perfect.
I couldn’t get the drama out of my head and I had to listen to the ost but then…
I cried my heart out listening to the ost. I sobbed, when I didn't shed a tear while watching it. I was engulfed then.
It makes me go crazy, this drama.

I really like older dramas (from before 2013) much more but this drama makes me forget that I miss them.

A line that broke my Heart: “If I go after the thing that I want, will I get punished?”

I found the premise interesting and the discourse insightful. I didn't realize that such a strong stigma existed against single parents in Korea. I also enjoyed seeing that contention play out within the female lead - what to do in a situation where you will face personal backlash and also negatively impact your family. Those aspects were good, but it was very slow overall.

The second male lead was relentless to the point where it didn't make sense. The female lead was insufferable at the beginning, and despite understanding the turmoil she must've experienced, she was acting unfairly and playing with both leads' feelings. The wishy-washy attitude, which persisted throughout the drama, was underwhelming to watch. The female lead's dad constantly trying to use his daughter to advance his career was infuriating. I'm so tired of the narrative where parents' views are the end all be all (as was also the case in Something in the Rain) for women who are in their 30s (albeit it was substantially toned down in this drama). It's getting old.

I can't give this drama higher than a 7 because there isn't anything special about it. The story isn't that great: it's essentially a mirror of Something in the Rain, except instead of age being a factor along with a dad who remarried, throw in a single dad instead. One Spring Night has a repetitive OST, frequent lack of chemistry between the leads, and uninspiring storytelling during many episodes. I am glad I finished it but I am not too sure I would recommend it to anyone else unless it is for a specific reason.

I may be in the minority, but I much prefer Something in the Rain. While SitR may have been more frustrating, the passion and romance at the beginning made it exciting to watch.

TLDR: an indecisive and frequently selfish female lead who isn't afraid to hurt others' feelings (I did like her character a bit more as the story progressed but not significantly); a second male lead whose actions rarely make sense and an obsession that doesn't seem to be rooted in anything. Watch it if you want to learn more about single parents in Korea (or at the very least how they may be viewed by society and the hardships they face). Don't watch if you want an exciting drama. Although it is thought-provoking at times, I don't think that is redeeming in itself.

Its all about the small things
The only thing i felt the entire time watching this show is Heart warming and butterflies. This show really opened my eyes alot more about love and the pressure on single parents in korea

This drama is one of the best so far. The plot is well written. The flow and the directing its all perfect. Ok im gonna break down my insights

First the flow and directing. It is not overbearing and draggy it has the element of content. Meaning it gives you enough to understand the situation and the little things between jiho and jeong in is soo precise it is enough to take my breath away. The directing is so good the way the scenes is taken the aesthetic the angles even the entrancthe ost is on point not too much but enough.

Second the characters and their individuals stories. The way the characters are slowly introduced is soo good the flow is wah amazing and kudos to the actors of jiho and jeong in their acting is so on point Jiho's character is a single dad with so much pressure from society he gave up the thought of falling inlove. But here comes a jeong in coming into his sight. Jeong in is a librarian whose in a long term relationship that has lost its spark. The romance between them is soo realistic and raw. And i feel so sad for jiho the way he is soo sincere and innocent. Like you guys be the judge and give me a head ups after you watch it i mean you guys need to get it haha


Third the side characters. The side characters did so well on the upbringing of the drama if you can say they are the main roles becausw without them the drama is incomplete. It feels if you are there present giving third person advice yeah thats how its so realistic. And the turns of events these characters gives us more flavour.

I’m slightly disappointed in this drama. The style and acting in this series is very similar to ‘Something In The Rain’ but lacks a bit on maybe the editing. I solely went for it because I became a fan of Jung Hae In. So far I like the story (SPOILER A young single dad finding love with an unmarried young woman which would be going against traditional views, the main woman also being completely headstrong and against marrying, her sister going through divorce (end SPOILER) but they spend so much time running in and out of their houses/ office or sitting quietly contemplating the difficult love for longer than necessary. Maybe I am getting old and so losing a bit of my patience but the episodes could have been reduced the amount of time spent doing nothing to help progress the story at a faster pace. 8 episodes in and there hasn’t been much change. The side characters are all interesting but again slow progress on their story too.

I hope the story picks up.

First of all, i love han ji min and jung hae in. I think they perfectly fit well as a couple. If only for the acting, i have rated it 10 but the storyline was a bit too cliche already. Although the story is quite okay but not very good. In my opinion, as a reviewer, they could've done a bit more twist to it. Plus the middle part of the episodes became too draggy. But as expected, jung hae in can really make you fall in love by just looking in his eyes. You can feel the emotions with his body and facial expressions. I just wish that there were more to it in the story. Neverthless, the drama is still okay to watch one time. But nothing new for me.

Very slow story
I haven't watched Something in the Rain yet and decided to give OSN a go. It's different to other kdramas as the pace of the story is extremely slow and some scenes are added without being necessary. There are moments of daily live - like showing them doing many things that we don't really need to watch/aren't interesting - there are lots and lots of dialogues and not many action-focused elements. This drama is therefore focused on small details and conversation and directed to an audience who appreciates that and won't get bored by the lack of actual things happening.

I usually never skip any scenes but here I was jumping a lot because I didn't care to hear the same, repetivive dialogue over and over. Lots of the side characters were simply uninteresting to me and I didn't care about them.
The female lead was very difficult to like. In the beginning I struggled to understand her motives, her reasonings and her decisions. She was very harsh and had a mean and somewhat bullying attitude at times, but then she kept being indecisive and not acting as tough as she pretended to be. It honestly didn't make much sense and I couldn't relate to her at all. In the middle of the story she became more likeable and I started to connect more with her, then later on she started to act up again. She seemed very much the center of attention, as if the world revolved around her - her friends/colleagues, her sisters, her mother, everyone seemed to run after her and pay so much attention to her personal dramas (even though her big sister had much more pressing issues tbh). It was that typical ""lead character"" thing - but I prefer kdramas where even the side characters have their own lives and don't just exist to support the male leads.
The same goes for the male lead - his friends, his colleagues and his parents all focused their whole attention and support on him. It seemed like neither of them had their own lives. That was very lazy from the writer.

The beginning was dragged for such a long time while the ending left many things in an unsatisfying way....I definitely feel like the writing was very lacking and I don't know if I will watch Something in the Rain, even though it seems to be very popular/well known.

i was hesitant to watch this drama after reading some of the reviews, but if you're in the same boat as i was, i would recommend watching it. the first few episodes were a little slow for my liking, but as the drama went on, i fell in love with many of the characters. i rooted for the main couple, i wanted to kill the ex and the fathers, i loved the sisters and overall rooted for a happy ending to all the storylines. i guess that's all you can want from a drama... interest in a resolution. the acting was also pretty good, with a few blips (the main actor wasn't so amazing at showing sadness and the fake cries were quite cringe-inducing). i also LOVED the inclusion of the son... i find this lacking in many other dramas including single parents. it's usually overshadowed by the romance, but it was pretty well incorporated in this one.

now onto the negatives. i can't talk about this drama without mentioning its never-ending looped soundtrack. seriously. the same few songs play over and over and over again - to the point of them losing all meaning when used over a dramatic scene to convey meaning. the songs themselves aren't bad... but you may just want to bang your head against a wall after hearing ""No Direction"" for the 5 millionth time. moreover, the constant repetition of the scenes with the ex and the main characters' fathers sitting down and plotting ways for them to be married despite her having already broken up with him and moved on with someone else is tiring to say the least. i think they could've come up with a more interesting conflict to cover the latter half of the drama. it was just ridiculous after a certain point, as you knew it was never going to work and was just a waste of screen time.

despite my little rant, i would still say this drama is well-worth the watch. perhaps not the best one out there, but still filled with many sweet and heart warming moments that i would like to think outweigh the bad.

Deep, Intense and Heartfelt
I postponed watching this series several times because I just didn’t know what to expect however I am really glad that I watched it. It was so sweet and heartfelt. I must admit that the writers did an amazing job revealing so much depth and character growth in those 32 episodes. If you watch it on Netflix it’s 16 episodes because they show a full hour instead of a 35 minutes. I just feel that the series was a welcomed refresher. It really displayed how relationships grow and stem from the smallest of things but it also reveals how some people stay in relationships not because of love but because of familiarity or consistency. I love the family dynamic in this series I love the sister bond in their relationship and commitment to support and love each other. I really really enjoyed it and if I could change one thing about this series I would change the ending just a little bit. When you finish watching the series you’ll have a really warm and pleasant feeling because you know that “hey everything is great.” I enjoyed it. I also want to point out that the chemistry between the two leads was absolutely amazing, the acting was amazing, the display of love and devotion among the mother and the daughters was truly awesome. Overall it is so worth the watch.

Jung Hae In who played Yoo Ji Ho and Han Ji Min who played Lee Jung In romance chemistry is there, my problem with this romantic drama is the back n forth with these two. I'm not blaming the actor and actress but I am blaming the story writers. My other problem, the writers chose the female main lead to show tendencies of emotional abuse towards her partner in the present day which tapered towards the end to have a happy ending. Domestic Abuse is rated high in most countries presently. I know this is a story but stories project to the audience ideologies to commit abuse by copying a scene. Other than that the rest of the story was good. Thanking the cast for a job well done.

I went into this drama thinking it was “what Something In the Rain could’ve been,” and even though a lot of plot things are different, I agree and can’t help but compare the two as I watched, considering how similar the vibe and style are.

I was nervous to start the second half, fearful of it going downhill the way SITR did. But that never happened. I felt like the entire drama was paced well, and I loved the mellow atmosphere. There are some moments I felt were a bit repetitive — after all, how many times does a girl have to say ""let's break up""? — but ultimately the slice-of-life feeling was calming.

The best of this drama for me was undoubtedly the sismance. It’s honestly rarer than it should be to see sismance in kdrama, and this one did it beautifully, with the way Jeong-in, Seo-in, and Jae-in all supported each other through everything. The mother was also great in this one, as was Ji-ho’s parents.

Because there was a support system around both of our characters, the drama wasn’t nearly as frustrating to watch, even if we knew there were social stigmas and other disapproving family members and annoying exes that would stand in the way of our main couple.

As a huge fan of friends-to-lovers, I bought into SITR utterly and completely because of how natural they were around each other right off the bat. And because of that reason, it took me a while to love Ji-ho and Jeong-in, who were just so awkward for the first half. As the show went on, they definitely started feeling more natural and I grew to love them. I still feel like the chemistry in SITR’s first half was more heart-fluttering, but OSN did an amazing job of portraying head vs. heart and highlighting the insecurities in a relationship that still exist even if you’re a 100% sure you want to be with someone. Jung Hae-in is amazing at acting ""taken aback + in love"" and it's adorable every single time.

Jeong-in's character development was subtle, but it was there, and I love the type of female lead that's strong, not in the ""can do taekwondo"" sense, but in the ability to sure in her convictions and decisions.

Despite that, I think my favorite part of this entire drama was the sub-plot with Seo-in trying to divorce her domestic abuser. It gave me all my crying moments, and doubled down on the sismance moments which gave me all the feels.

I do wish Jae-in got a stronger sub-plot too — personality-wise, she was my favorite out of the three. and it felt like she came back to Korea, said she would find something to do, and just never really did, even though as a sister character she did everything the show called for.

I know a lot of people complained about repetitive OST in SITR and OSN, but I honestly did not have any issue with the songs, which I loved. They added to the mellow mood of the entire drama.

Also: Eun-woo is the most adorable bean ever.

This is obviously very good, so the 8.5 rating is definitely justified, having seen the other reviews here all the good points were already mentioned, so I'll just focus on what I did not like.

The OST is just as repetitive as in Pretty Noona, yes it's very good, but there are only like 5 songs & there are episodes where the ""seasons change"" song plays more than 4 times.
Pretty Noona has become terrible after the midpoint, here the start is not quite as explosive, but still very good and the show never becomes terrible, but there is a lot of forced drama in the second half that I did not like. Especially episodes 14-15(28-30 in the stupid numbering system) were quite eyebrow raising at times. Having a second male lead like this is fine for maybe 2-3 episodes, but for 16 it's just ridiculous, at least this was handled better in Pretty Noona. People talk about how real this show feels, but this character is completely immersion breaking & the same is also true for how Jeong-in interacts with him.
From a Korean viewer's standpoint this show is probably quite progressive, but frankly I don't like it when the dark side of Confucianism is showcased this much. (parents forcing their will upon their grownup kids , the barbaric Korean divorce law and Korean social stigmas) Also there were some acting hiccups here and there, overall the acting performances were incredibly good for the most part, but I felt that nearing the end the actors have ng-ed scenes at times, but the director just let it go for ehm reasons, but I realize that this could be considered nitpicking. The flow of the story & character progression have some inconsistencies , I sense that there were some script rewrites & character micro adjustments, I feel that I would not have noticed much, have I not been watching all episodes over the course of 3 days.


edit: I was bored and rewatched the show.
I was impressed by the early episodes a lot more than the first time around. They way how fate and extreme attraction is brought to life in this show is just beautiful and there were just so many great conversations & touching scenes all the way to the end.

Bro's before hos
Just like her parents, I'm not in favor of her relationship with jiho. Well, first thing, there wasn't any proper back story to actually hate gi seok. If she wasn't happy with him in a long time then why even drag it for that long. She's just a bitch plain and simple. Also with jiho, where's the bro code dude?

I like to think that the story was to address some hard situation women are facing in Korea. But that's not how it's supposed to be. Like I can understand how the older sister is in a bad marriage and the stigma of divorce in a very conservative society. But jeong in and ji ho's relationship is just plain cheating. You cant possibly make an excuse from that.

My daughter would watch this drama show next to me while I am doing work. The drama is so so so slow, and the girl never smiles or laugh. Watching her makes me sad and miserable, i feel like my days are dragging. The most irritating part of this show is the background music that plays same music over and over and over and over again. Did the producer ran out of money and could not pay for other title rights for another background music!!!! Please on your next project that my daughter might be interested in watching, have multiple music on the background. If you can't afford the rights to the music, don't apply it to the show.

It is quite interesting story, but I don't understand why would a guy like Ji Ho wants a girl like Jeong In so bad.
Jeong In has the worst personality ever. She talks to Ji Ho if he is like a piece of sh.t. Ji Ho is the best guy ever he is kind and understand Jeong In, he didn't tell her to broke up with his bf, he just tell her that he likes her, and wants to be with her, but if they are not going to date, then don't even see each other because he can't be her friend. But she acted like: ""you are so selfish I am the one who suffers the most."" Like what the hell?? She doesnt like her bf, she just have to break up from her ""relationship"" which shouldn't be that hard because it's almost does not exist.
Whatever her bf is saying to her, she gets mad and arguing, but she was coward to broke up with him like for ages, and she was lying about if she is seeing someone else. Furthermore before she even break up with her bf or something, she went to Ji Ho's house to see him. What did she want? He was suffering from her, but she went there and acted like she did nothing wrong.
As you can see I gave 7 point for acting, because the actress is great, I saw her real life personality in a video, I feel sorry for her to play such a bad character in this series. The main actor is amazing.
I am not sure if I can go on this series. I can't stand how she treates Ji Ho and his boyfriend as well.

Its really, really sad, just as Shin Se Kyung destroyed the 'Bride of Haebek', Han Ji Min is killing this serial, scene by scene, episode by episode. My sincere apologies, I mean no personal offence but I truly am upset.
Ep 6 has just been released and I simply cannot watch it any further. But I will because I don't want to miss Jung Hae In and the other cast performances.

I love the storyline, I love the rest of the cast. I wait for their scenes, and Jung Hae In is outstanding as usual, the support cast is great, but Han Ji Min is so flat, so lifeless, so one-dimensional in her performance that if I could I would skip over all her scenes. Which means skipping over most of each episode. As I said, this is a subjective personal viewpoint. But I do feel that the team that cast this serial could have chosen someone with more acting clout to act alongside Jung Hae In and the rest of the stellar cast.

Story:
I liked the story a lot, definitely a mature and difficult subject to discuss. It's slower then other dramas, but works well with this one. It perfectly shows the struggles of being an older adult especially one going against the norm. The different relationships are presented well and are just as interesting as the main plot.
Cast:
I honestly loved the cast. The characters are my favorite part of the whole drama. Each person stand out and portray the story of each character very well. The two male leads are my favorite, you can easily sympathize with both and understand both sides. I only have a problem with the female lead. Maybe it was supposed to be her character, but she seemed to wishy-washy with how she feel about the two male leads and the situation. She also took forever to solve the problems. Her sisters are both great as well, both strong and smart women that deal with thier own issues the best way they could.
Music:
The music isn't bad, it just not as great as the korean osts I'm used to. Korean osts stand out and match the emotion of the scenes so well, but theses ones were okay as you heard them more but didn't provoke the same emotions
Note:
I'm kind of torn on the random basketball scenes. I enjoyed see the male characters interacting on the court without the involvement of emotions, but scenes related to the basketball scenes were unnecessary. They would randomly has scenes just to talk about Giseok needing to reserve the gym, more than once. honestly the plot could deal without all the extra basketball scenes

My Review: One Spring Night (2019)

To be honest Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho seduced me to watch this drama. I watched a few of his other works

2018 Something in the Rain  16 Seo Joon Hee Pretty Noona Who Buys Me Food
2017 While You Were Sleeping  32 Han Woo Tak
2015 Blood  20 Joo Hyun Woo

He has a way of drawing you in. Something about his smile that makes you want to cry. This is a new drama on Netflix. I’ve paid for Netflix in New Zealand. What I like about it it is that the quality of the product for the viewer is outstanding, perfect colour and clear crisp picture. Sound doesn’t affect me because I’m a bit deaf and I’m watching the subtitles anyway and I can read fast. If I need too I can stop it and rewatch it. Music yeah its there in the back ground sometimes I turn it down anyway because in interferes with my enjoyment of the story or stresses me out. I just started it.
I have discovered there are three sisters, Han Ji Min/Lee Jung In lead actor, she a librarian. She has a long term boyfriend Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho but the glow has come off her relationship and she doesn’t want to marry him. Im Sung Eon/Lee Seo In [Jung In's elder sister / News Anchor] not happy in her marriage wants a divorce. I think he’s abusing her but she’s keeping it hidden for her families sake. Joo Min Kyung/Lee Jae In [Jung In's baby sister] bit of a roaming, attractive woman and just come back from France where she was stalking a guy. She said France has got tough laws on stalking so best for her to come back to Korea.
Han Ji Min/Lee Jung has met Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho a pharmacist who is single but has a young son. So far just sparks are twinkling between these two.

I know I said thematic doesn’t move me but somehow it playing on my deep psyche. It because they are thinking about each other and I here the music soft and serious. Is it in English? It is moving words and music in English.

Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji does these sad crybaby roles so well. He doesn’t cry but us the viewers do. His face tell the whole despondent story. You just want to hug him and say keep going baby its going to be alright. He was like that in “Something in the rain”. I love his words ”If you come to me now they’ll be no turning back.” So exciting so final. So irresistible to me anyway. Wasn’t he having a secret love affair in “Something in the Rain?” Oh man he’s going to be typecast as the guy who has secret romances and breaks his own heart. Forbidden love is so exciting.

The Three Sisters are so good to each other supporting and watching each others back. But Korean parents just drive me crazy. Let your kids make their own decisions and who cares if your girls don’t ever get married. Why do they need to get married? If they have got a good job that is all they need. Don’t they have family support and old age pension in Korea. My sister’s and I are good to each other but my grand daughters are the best supporters of their nana.

That Kim Joon Han/ Kwon Ki Seok is so patronising. Acts like women don’t have a brain to think for themselves. It makes me annoyed when he says what did I do wrong? I did everything right by her. Yeah! Nah! Bro, you took her for granted. Went off with the bros every night. Forgot to get in touch when you were late. Your motto was bros before hoes. You only got in touch when you felt like sleeping with her. Not cool bro.

It annoys me so much when I get into these dramas and I realise that the next episodes not until next week. I start surfing the next and trying to find the continuation.

Get over it move on. In real life these things happen. She had already told him she wanted to finish with him but he just wouldn't accept it. So when a new guy comes into the picture. Get on it grab it with both hands. He might be the one who going to make your dreams come true. Test out the waters. He hadn't even given her a ring. He hasn't made a commitment to her. They don't live together. Just sleeps with her occasionally when HE feels like it. No way is this love. They are just dating. Going steady maybe. His parent don't even like her. Dating is the time for testing your feelings. For sure its going to wake up the ex and maybe he'll make better moves. Thing is though in New Zealand it can be a dangerous thing to do. Many male ex's have killed the female ex for less. It so annoying and frustrating that they are not accepting that she has broken up with that Kim Joon Han/ Kwon Ki Seok. She doesn’t want to be with him. Its only episode 11 so anything can still happen. I couldn’t stand it if my parents told me to stay with the two me I had children too. When its over its over. One I had a baby to when I was young and the other one I married.

Then there is the old sister who pregnant with an abusive spouse. Her parents still want her to stay with him. No way Jose carry on and get a divorce from that maniac. She showed her mother pictures of her injuries. The other finally understood and wanted to deal to immediately.

I have spent a lot of time infuriated and angered by the behaviour of some of the men in this drama. Arrogant, dictatorial, controlling, selfish, and indifferent to the feelings and needs of the women in their lives. Why would you force marriage on someone - making everyone's lives miserable? Why would you demand your daughter stay in an abusive marriage and forgive her abuser? (With hints he is also a rapist). Why is their father supporting and enabling the subjugation of his daughters?

Stupid woman she took his ring. That is going to cause a problem. Now his(Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho) heart is broken. How can a woman be so stupid. She even let Kim Joon Han/ Kwon Ki Seok hug her. How she going to get out of this one. Its getting more and more like “Something in the Rain “. So pitiful! She finally gave it back to him and he threw it into oblivion and she just walked away.

These Korean Fathers are so horrible to their daughters. They just want them to marry rich men so they can be comfortable in their old age.

Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho is such a sook and they are both crying. What is the problem with a man having a child, in New Zealand about 1:4 single men have a child and many New Zealanders live together without marriage. Don’t tell me he’s going to cry again after she ask the son if he’d like her to be his mum. He suits these romantic roles so much.

Seo Jung Yeon/Wang Hye Jeong [Ji Ho's colleague] she is the owner of the Pharmacy that he (Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho) works at. She must be a relative of Yu-mi (the mother of (Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho) son. He is very close to his child and worries that his mum will turn up and take him away. When she tells him that she had married and has a child (Jung Hae In/Yoo Ji Ho) has a bit of a break down. Gets drunk and says a dumb thing to Han Ji Min/Lee Jung. She doesn’t take it that well but gets over it. Just analysing his reaction to this news. He was probably upset because she just proved to him that she really just didn’t want him or his son. He should be grateful she left and both him and his son can carry on without a woman who doesn’t love them. They’ve got Han Ji Min/Lee Jung now and she is going to be a great mum to the son.

Jump to the ending its a bit ambiguous to but I think they are going to be together but nothing is really solved with their parent relationship (her dad). Lots of loose ends not tied up. I don’t think I understand the subtleties of Korean courtship.

I think story lacked story wise, I think Ji Min and Hae In were amazing, but these adult dramas normally lack plot. They faced realistic issues together, but it seemed the drama wasn't really thought out completly and they wasted a lot of time on the same issues throught the drama. Therefore, it felt very repetitive throught and boring, until the final epsiodes that they actually solved them. I think if they put a little more thought into other plot lines it would've been more interesting. I also think that both actors lacked chemistry, they both seemed like bland characters, they could've worked a bit harder on their personalities to at least drive the story. Shame, because all the OSTs are fantastic, it was one of the best things that came out of it.

Watched it because of Something in the Rain, was expecting similar pacing and acting. Overall progression is lousy and lacks any excitement. Characters are great but hard to relate with at times, especially when we talk about modern-day dating. Don't recommend it. Forced myself to sit through the first 5 episodes.

The music was very unbearing, maybe because I read the comments and someone pointed it out but it was excruciatingly timed. Lots of pointless scenes that try too hard to show longing and slow down the drama but in reality can just be filled with blank space.

Drag drag and drag...
I think the writer of the drama wanted to make a daily soap out of the script but then they faced some production issues and for the sake of just making it they had to squeeze the whole thing into a 20 episode drama, even when they didn't want to.

Let me get to my point straight, I didn't like it. Not like I hate it, but I hust couldn't bring myself to like it. On that note, my review will be short as well, which is more like a rant.

""The King's Affection"", originally titled as ""연모"" (Affection) fictional sageuk drama which is primarily based on the typical gender-bender concept where the female lead disguises herself as a male and the male lead anyways falls in love with a man, just to realize in the end that he had been loving a woman. Well, I don't hate that concept but it's already been outdated and also experimented in historical dramas before. Moreover, given the basic plotline the execution is not up to the par; I mean it could have been a decent price if they had not Incorporated all kind of typical sageuk elements into the script.

Let's get a simple plot. The Crown Prince's Consort gives birth to an identical boy-girl twins but citing it an ominous sign, the King orders the girl child's death, since only the boy can climb up to the throne. The consort however sends the baby far away who somehow ends up in the palace as a maid after a decade. The siblings come across each other and adms the Prince one day is in the girl's disguise to sneak out of the palace, is mistakenly gets killed. At the same time, the girl in the Prince's disguise remains in the palace and to hide the late Princes demise, she continues to grow up as the Crown Prince, upon her mother's advice.

She shuts all the door to her heart in order to become strong but her starts to waver as she meets her childhood first love whom she had met in the palace as a maid and had a beautiful encounter. The person not knowing the king-to-be is actually a girl and in fact his first love, grow fond of her with time. The story is about their journey of love, affection and struggles on their way to togetherness. It also involves the usual period politics, conspiracies, secret revelations, fightings, unusual deaths, etc.

Park Eun Bin plays the girl Dam-i/Yeon Seon who is in the disguise of her late brother, Crown Prince Lee Hwi. Rowoon plays Jung Ji Woon, a great scholar & Royal Inspector General's Son, who is also Dam-i's first love. Nam Yoon Su plays Lee Hyun, Prince's cousin and son of the previous king. Lee Pil Mo plays King Hyejong, Dam-i's father. Yoon Jae Moon plays Left State Councillor Han Ki Je, Prince's Grandfather. These are the major characters who are also known for good acting; Pil Mo and Jae Moon ahjussi infact the veterans. I (have) loved Park Eun Bin's acting and Rowoon has still a lot to do though his performance was up to par. Nam Yoon Su is amazing as a rookie actor. Lee Il Hwa is also there as the Queen Dowager, the Prince's Grandmother. There are in fact many good and familiar actors in playing key characters of the story.

Special mention to 3 actors...Baek Hyun Joo playing Court Lady Kim Sang Gung whose delivery was nice and her firm voice :0; Go Gyu Pil playing Eunuch Hong Bok Dong whose expressions were very funny; and Choi Byung Chan playing Prince's Bodyguard Kim Ga On, ofc for his visuals.

The thing about this drama I loved the most is the childhood love story of Dam-i and Ji Woon. The way they encountered each other and became friends gave off immense romantic vibes. Them spending time in Hanyang and gradually growing fond of each other in just those 2 episodes, really melted my heart. In fact when they met each other after a decade as The Prince and the tutor, their longing hearts trying to find each other made me cry so much. It was difficult seeing the ML struggling with his sexuality but also mesmerizing the way he was falling for the King-to-be not knowing his real identity.

The old Korean poetic verses, philosophy and the characters deciphering those is another thing I loved about the drama. Obviously yes, all the historical Korean dramas have this element but I particularly liked the way the writer in here has accurately used and related to life and their situations.

The problem with the drama is it's plot development, content and the thorough execution. The first 2 introductory episodes are good enough to keep you hooked, in fact the best episodes of the drama though you'll have to cry every now and then. After 2 leaps of 10 years each, when the characters appear in their final stage, it becomes more interesting. The premise is gradually set up by intriguing screenplay methods and the romance between the leads begins with initial tease-party. Simultaneously the politics sector of the drama develops steadily. Despite all that, the drama seems to be lacking a specific destination with which it is supposed to end; it becomes unclear where exactly the drama is heading to.

However, everything goes smooth for a while. Somewhere around the 9th episode, the drama starts to be uninteresting with the beginning of crude romance between the leads, which is very typical and don't spark any good chemistry any longer. Events happening for the romance plot of the drama becomes repetitive and unnecessarily dragged to a great extent. Also, the love triangle of the story doesn't create any firm impression on the viewers; like I don't get why was it even there in thr script? Great waste of Nam Yoon Su's skills, ngl.

Starting from the 2nd half, i.e. the 11th episode, the drama becomes a greatly typical sageukk with the cliché elements like power struggle conspiracies, Ming Envoy visits, corruption among ministers, revenge game among families, etc. Given that the drama has 20 episodes and it already runs out of substances right at the interval, It didn't interest me at all to even finish it and I was forced to watch the rest at 2x speed. They try to send the plot to peak several times by incorporating twists here and there but it was clear, they were trying their best to drag it to make it a 20 episode drama. The script didn't even deseve 16 episodes to being with, forget about 20. Simply, it could have been a decent drama at least, if they had planned for a 12 episode set.

Writer Han Hee Jung seems to have not improved over these years. Among her works, the only thing I liked was ""Gunman in Joseon"". ""Clean with Passion"" was a wasted potential too. She was the reason I didn't have high expectations from this but I was hoping she might have bettered than before... well, meh! Given the basic plot, the script is totally exaggerated in the 2nd half and the main problem is with the lenthy writing and many unnecessary plots as well as characters. I wish it were a 12 eps drama.

Director Song Hyun Wook is actually experienced and have produced many good dramas but I guess for the reason that it's his first sageuk (historical) drama, he couldn't prevent the flawed outcome of the drama. Screenplay is average given how it runs out of substance sooner than expected. Cinematography is quite well handled, I should admit. The natural elements as well as architectural aspects were taken care of properly. Screen-editing is also good but the dragged script makes it uninteresting and difficult ti keep up with.

I loved almost all of the OSTs. The composition by Tae Keun is very good and he's been able to produce such beautiful tracks, perfectly fitting to the mood of the drama. My most favourite is ""Shadow of You"" by SuJu K. R. Y; it's soulful and gladdening. They're my favourite trio in the world of Kdrama OSTs. ""One and Only"" in heart-wrenching vocals of Lyn is another favourite. Baek Ji Young's high notes in ""IF I"" are very emotional. An Da Eun's ""I Believe"" felt like a classical sageukk OST. ""Hide and Seek"" by VROMANCE is a jolly track TT. ""Full of You"" by Hae Yoon is a modern romantic song and very likable; it's also covered by Vromance. Loved Rowoon's smooth vocals in ""No Goodbye In Love"" which also makes me cry so much.

In overal, The King's Affection felt like an exaggerated version of Lovers of the Red Sky. I can't help but compare these 2 because they are produced around the same time period. The former is obviously a lot better than the latter but still the amount of dragging the script to produce more episode is the same. Also, the ratings of both the dramas are hugely influenced by the cast and not the quality, everyone is aware of that.

I still wanna insist that I love the basic plot line but the script is pretty mediocre and around the average. Yes, I am disappointed even though I didn't have very high expectations. The cast was obviously the reason I had anticipations but the flaws of the drama amounts to my disappointments, hence I won't recommend this drama to anyone, even for an one time watch, unless you want to give it a try for the visuals.

P. S. I ended up writing a lot anyways haha.

Will This Drama Win Your ‘ Affection’ ?
Screenwriter Han Hee Jung and director Song Hyun Wook’s ‘ The King’s Affection’ attempted to offer viewers the best of two worlds; a Sageuk ( historical drama) and an arguably more “ modern” love story. However against its more intriguing setup ‘ The King’s Affection’ found itself shoehorned into a slow-paced trope extravaganza by the second-half.

Han Hee Jung’s facilitated writing techniques in the first-half of the series seemed to indicate towards foundational world-building and characters- rough around the edges with mystique driving forward many of the characters, but still establishing an intriguing storyline. However whilst Han Hee Jung’s first-part soared with potentiality the actuality of the latter-half gradually began to descend into a cataclysmic attempt to keep the plot interesting- uninspiring “ plot twists” led little time to truly develop more intriguing characters whilst seemingly paramount plot lineups were given an anticlimactic or loose-end outcome.

Of course a director or screenwriter choosing to convey modern twists or themes in a historical drama isn’t always necessarily a “ bad thing”. It can give opportunities to highlight or echo current issues, themes which are still present in today’s world and present different takes on the past through the director/ screenwriter’s objectives. However whilst it was easy to understand ‘ The King’s Affection’ desired depiction of different forms of love, it often felt as though the series would rarely touch upon more prominent issues of the time and today ( e.g. gender expectations, political division in society, social status and prejudice) in more depth. This often resulted in the second-half of the series feeling like a composed accumulation of romantic tropes and cliches against a gradually decadent plot-drive by the final episodes .


Main actress Park Eun Bin undeniably offered one of the strongest performances of the series; adding an air of charm to her onscreen counterpart. The female lead Dami was undeniably the epitome of the “ inserted” and frequently-used cross-dressing trope by having to play the role of her brother l the Crowned Prince Lee throughout most of the events of the series . Whilst with plot context it was necessary for driving the storyline, there were a lot of loose threads considering other story points including exactly why her grandfather ordered her to be killed ( aside from merely just being an “ unnecessary girl”), as well as one evident fact; the female lead’s feminine features and vocal intonations are evident even as her male counterpart . Admittedly whilst this may have just been passed off by members of the royal court it did hit a point blank in plot logic when many scenes and close-ups easily giving away Park Eun Bin’s softer features. Later episodes did little to truly allow Dami to come to terms with these cut-out subplots surrounding her storyline, ultimately reducing her seemingly intriguing character-drive to the equivalent of cannon fodder by the latter-half.

Costarring alongside Park Eun Bin is idol-actor Rowoon. Rowoon’s performance as main lead Jung Ji Woon did undeniably see some surprisingly bittersweet performance moments as his onscreen persona comes to terms with his sexuality and growing feelings for the Prince, as well as his initial motives for entering the palace. However Ji Woon’s initial establishment as the “ mysterious tutor” is subverted in later episodes to the “ lovelorn sweetheart”; pledging his own life to “ protecting” Hwi ( despite his initial reasons early on in the series) and benignly chasing after the female
lead’s affections in a dragged-out and anticlimactic love story. This often resulted in a test of patience for viewers as Ji Woon and Hwi’s sense of gradual chemistry and growth was shoehorned into a lacklustre onscreen relationship despite dominant screen time.

As a consequence of lacking development time potentially intriguing characters such as Lee Hyun-Hwi’s protective cousin ( Nam Yoon Su), the Prince’s mysterious bodyguard ( Choi Byung Chan), Shin So Eun - the daughter of the Minister of Interior ( Bae Yoon Kyung) and Noh Ha-Kyung; the youngest daughter of the Minister of War ( Jung Chae Yeon) were often enforced into staid plot setups and cliches with their character arcs and drives often being cut short.

The cinematography and OST of the series could admittedly vary from scene to scene. Whilst there were some admittedly beautiful shots and powerful soundtracks combined with scenes of the palace and period outfits presented by director Song Hyun Wook, more subtle emotions and scenes could often feel lacklustre from poorly-placed camera angles and song choices onscreen.

So what is left to say about ‘ The King’s Affection’? Is it worth watching or is it a waste of time? The ‘ King’s Affection’ is the epitome of a “ hot mess” series - stunning outfits, an intriguing premise, a fairly good cast lineup and an especially dynamic performance from main actress Park Eun Bin undeniably remained the drama’s greatest takeaways. However the twenty-episode formula applied to a storyline which was written better for no more than sixteen- episodes, created a slow-moving and disengaging second-half for viewers with intriguing subplots and characters left in the background in order to make way for a lacklustre romance which gradually dwindled to an unsurprisingly anticlimactic resolution. Overall whilst the 20-episode drama whilst not unwatchable and certainly decent enough if you are willing to watch out of sheer boredom, it does admittedly lack a more definitive spark of feeling well-rounded also.

“Be it hatred or resentment... learn to live with it. As long as it gives you the will to live.""
Yeonmo is a poignant and heart-wrenching tale about perseverance, love and sacrifices. It's centered around a little girl whose only fault is being born as a twin into the royal family, an ominous sign at the time. Her existence eventually leads to her twin brother's death. Trapped by the circumstances, she's then forced to secretly assume his identity and grow up under the watchful eyes of her maternal grandfather, the main culprit behind her brother's killing.

What immediately drew me to this show is not only the cast and plot but also its gorgeous settings, clothes and OSTs. The child actors also did an incredible job in setting up the narrative, especially Choi Myung Bin playing both the young FL and the twin brother. Her versatility and expressiveness truly remind me of the young Kim Yoo Jung in Moon Embracing the Sun.

Park Eun Bin is giving me major girl crush vibes. One moment she's the handsome and fierce Crown Prince that makes me swoon so badly, then she turns into a gorgeous lake fairy in the next to blow me away. It's a complete makeover from her timid and reticent role in Do You Like Brahms. Eun Bin's androgynous portrayal of Lee Hwi makes the cross-dressing extremely convincing, especially the intense stare and low voice she would use when confronting someone which gives me the chills. But we also get to see the lonely and vulnerable side of Lee Hwi. A young girl who has to put up the facade of an ""Ice Crown Prince"" to survive the ruthless palace battle. She has to remain distrustful and vigilant of her own family members, who all seem to have a political agenda of their own.

And yes, we can't not mention Rowoon's historical debut. His acting has improved a lot from Extraordinary You and She Would Never Know. I love him as the playful and carefree Ji Woon. It was hilarious watching him falling head over heels for Lee Hwi, I mean who wouldn't? The leads' chemistry is just chef kiss here. The switch in power dynamics is definitely a refreshing twist on the classic gender-bender trope, with how Lee Hwi is put in charge and Jung Ji Woon is tailing along but not without the occasional witty comebacks. However, I do notice that Rowoon sometimes falls short on the more serious and emotional scenes that require a bit more desperation and refined articulations. But overall, I would still give him a solid A for effort.

The second-lead syndrome is real! Lee Hyun is such a sweetheart, I can't believe this is the same Nam Yoon Su who played the bully in Extracurricular. I immediately fell for his cute dimples and duality. He's extremely protective and devoted towards Lee Hwi. It's still a bit weird that they're distant cousins but I guess that's historical royalties for you. I think one of the best things about this drama is the vibrant side characters. We have the dashing yet mysterious bodyguard Kim Ga On, the funny and loyal Enuch Hong, and Court Lady Kim who's like a mother figure to Lee Hwi.

While the show has a very strong start, I feel like the middle part seems to drag a bit. It does pick up a lot near the end, but now they also run out of time to fix up some of the plot holes. I wish they've cut down 2-4 eps and kept the pacing consistent so that the story is more cohesive. It's also unnecessary to have the 2 side female love interests when their characters are not even fully fleshed out, especially when there's already a love triangle between the 3 main leads. It just makes the love line look messy. But that aside, I do like the complex relationships FL and ML have with their fathers. Both the King and Chief Jung deeply care for their children but have to hide it because they're also bound by their duties and political standings. This leads to even more misunderstandings to drift parent and child apart, until they inadvertently end up on opposing sides. It's touching but also bittersweet and somewhat tragic.

It's almost like an Easter egg hunt with the OSTs. We've got Super Junior's Shadow of You and I can already spot our OST queens, Lyn's One and Only in the opening and Baek Ji Young's If I. Plus, we can't miss the sweetness overdose in Hide and Seek by VROMANCE.

Overall, while there are some wasted potentials, it's still a well-made sageuk drama with fairly easy-to-follow plot and lovable characters. I think it has a good balance between romance and palace politics, intense at times but also fluffy when needed. I guess the ratio is really just based on personal preferences. It's a fun and interesting watch, as long as you don't nitpick on the details too much. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the journey.

FAVOURITE QUOTES:

“I have never lived my own life.” Lee Hwi

“On the day I was born, what did my father say? Did he also agree with those who wanted to terminate my life? That a girl was of no need and should be killed?” Lee Hwi

“I will not die. You know better than anyone what I have endured to come this far.” Lee Hwi

“The palace can be as dirty as the mud. Lotus flowers bloom in mud, but they can cleanse their surroundings. And the leaves have the ability to shake off murky water. There’s no trace of any dirt on them. Just like the lotus flowers that stay virtuous despite its dirty environment, I hope that you will become a strong king."" Jung Ji Woon

“Like the good rain that falls when most needed, I will be someone you can count on. Just like you were to me when I needed you the most.” Jung Ji Woon

""Only people like you who are born into noble families had the chance to make decisions. This was the only path I was given. So I merely walked my path. Even if I were to go back, if this is the only path that remains, I would be here again.” Ji Woon’s father

“I got married when I was your [Lee Hwi's] age. I made a family at a young age. So I didn’t know how precious it was or how to protect it. So I failed to protect my family. But I didn’t want you to make the same mistake."" the King (Lee Hwi's father)

It started on a very strong note with the great performance of Choi Myung Bin. This story needed a good foundation with a background story and that's what the first two episodes served. And I thought wow, with this intense start this ride will be action-packed with surprises, a lot of tension, and game of thrones but then... it fell from the cliff, with every episode I was waiting for action, something big to happen, it'll get better.. something more than just fluff, and miserable humor when that moment comes 'Damn not the action starts' it just gets back on its fluffy track as an addition to my boredom.

The writer seems to have forgotten logic for most of the parts, or we viewers are taken as IQ like those naive FLs in CEO dramas. I'll just point out some parts.

~Identical Twins:
The most important part of the drama is biologically impossible. How on the earth twins with a different gender are identical? There is only one case possible but then girls always have turner syndrome. Oh, please don't tell me about sesquizygotic twins they only share 50% DNA so they can be half identical.. or identical as babies but not as growing teens. (Sorry for starting biology class here.) Though I was impressed by Choi Myung Bin I can't let it slide how illogical it is.

~Sexual Orientation:
First I do not have a problem with the concept of love without thinking of gender, or loving person/human. But I'm very disappointed how sensitive issues like this are handled carelessly in the drama. Ji Woon was more bothered that he fell in love with CP than the fact that CP is a man.. damn how can he not question himself for a single time that his first love was a girl how his preference change overnight.. then he starts to imagine Lee Hwi as a girl, but then says he likes her as a person, not gender.. damn what a mess? I mean we have seen Han Gyul (Coffee Prince) getting tormented in the twenty-first century... we like talking about Joseon Era, but no the male lead should be perfect he shouldn't question his love... even if it looks way unrealistic.

~Attack on CP:
In the envoy drama that happened, his guard u̶n̶intentionally attacked Lee Hwi and he just gets away with it.. okay it that possible? first, it was clear that the attack was intentional but even if it was unintentional how can a mere guard get away after attacking the CP of the nation... it's a very big thing.

The story itself is grand as cross-dressing is on a big level... it's not like she's dressing as a man to become Eunuch, or to get in school or university but as the future king of the nation which is a big thing.

Romance is bland, politics completely sucks... action, is there any? just some bits. The writing is inconsistent, it lacks substance. The king's affection is an absolute example of lazy writing with poor characterization. I was hoping for some great, well-written politics, mind games...Politics, what can I say? probably all budget went over a shot of Rowoon carrying flowers around the palace... as I have never seen court this empty with just a few ministers (sometimes it suddenly has a lot of ministers)... with only 2-3 who can talk. but not it has nothing to offer. I don't think this setup needed 20 episode format as most of the part feels like filer.. even the main thing romance. Love-pentagon most unnecessary thing, it doesn't even create that much tension it should have.

The most problematic character of the series is the male lead Ji Woon.. no it's not like he's a douchebag or something.... he's clueless, legit he has no freaking purpose for his existence other than being a love interest of Lee Hwi. He's a typical nice, goofy guy who does nothing but fangirl over Lee Hwi for half of his screentime. His character is written one-dimensionally... there's nothing particularly interesting in him that makes me root him with Lee Hwi lol

Lee Hyun is more interesting than Ji Woon.. at least he is three-dimensional with different shades, he's not that nice guy all time but can take action when it's needed. I liked Ga On from the very start he has that mysterial aura around him.. that made me take interest in him, generate curiosity about his back story.. and I was waiting for that BIG revelation all time, then when it happened it all goes flat. All mystery they tried to create.. and what was delivered is a disappointment, but I'm very glad they didn't drag him in love-pentagon to make it hexagon. I like So Eun but she has a very bad first impression... It took me forever to get warm with her due to it, but then I adored her. Ha Kyung clumsy, little stupid girl... she's the only person with whom I sympathies in the whole thing, coz she's nothing but an innocent, pure soul who got dragged into this mess... just coz she loved a man, who's not a man.

The best thing about the drama is Eun Bi, she's phenomenal... the Lee Hwi she portrayed was charming. Most of the time voice is neglected in cross-dressing dramas, but we can see Eun Bi also worked on her voice so that she can sound like a guy. This is one of the very few believable gender-benders where FL can pass as a boy... yes her weight, height is not ideal for the role but the body language, her presence, the way she acts... make her perfect for the role.

I adore and respect Lee Hwi, this character had so much potential (kinda wasted with romance)... there were many changes to how she can be a great, wise king but fewer actions prove that. The character growth was less explored due to induced fluff. In more than one half of the drama, she doesn't have a purpose why she remains as CP, king is a good person so power isn't in the hand of the wrong people... but her king gonna lead her grandfather to get power and her becoming pawn in power play. And it's not like that many people's lives are on skate as other than Eunuch and Court lady no one knows her secret. When she gets purpose... as the story forwards it's already too late coz drama has lost its charm.

Music is forgettable... it's high-quality production serving great visuals but the color scheme is bright, not ideal for watching on the big screen as it's too bright.

Don't bother if you are expecting great Sageuk with the realistic portrayal, action as most of the time it's just filer romance with lack of chemistry (I just don't feel anything for this couple) and try to disguise with some bits of action here and there splattered. Apart from Eun Bi and her Lee Hwi, nothing is amazing or mesmerizing... it's only grand with the name and set up but everything is just mediocre.

To love and be loved
The King’s Affection is one of three sageuk produced by KBS this year, following River Where the Moon Rises and ending right at the start of The King of Tears, Lee Bang Won. It is also one of eight sageuk set during Joseon Dynasty, as well as nine overall to be aired this year. 2021 truly has been inundated with a number of K-historicals and fans of the genre are all the better for it!

This firmly belongs to the fictional romance variety, the likes of Rookie Historian Goo Hae Ryung, Love in the Moonlight and the more recent Lovers of the Red Sky as well as the currently airing The Red Sleeve, albeit purportedly based more closely on historical records. The thing with romance-centric sageuk is that there is generally a wider scope of themes being depicted, in addition to the love story between the leads.

In this case, they include palace politics, melodrama, comedy and a fair amount of “fluffiness”, while commonly established tropes are added into the mix for good measure, comprising childhood connection, contract marriage, crossdressing or gender bender, found family, love triangle, and the star crossed lovers. So if you’re in the mood for a sageuk that isn’t too heavy in terms of historical accuracy or the seriousness of the politics but with enough light-hearted moments mixed with a dash of heart-wrenching events and a big dose of passionate romance, then this is definitely one to consider.

The drama tells the story of a pair of royal fraternal twins who switch places, with the female becoming the Crown Prince in her brother’s stead before eventually succeeding the throne, hence the appropriately given title for the drama. Along the way, the “King” develops affections for one of her subjects, amidst the intense political rivalries between various factions in the palace. Further complications arise to the already precarious situation in the form of dysfunctional family dynamics, forced marriages and murderous antagonists who are hell-bent on furthering their nefarious agendas.

The screenplay by Han Hee Jung, who previously wrote Gunman in Joseon, is adapted from the manhwa, Yeonmo (연모) by Lee So Young which was serialized between 2011 to 2014 and revolves around the fictional King Namjang but with references to real life historical figures from the late Yejong to early Seongjong era of the Joseon Dynasty. This is the first work from directors Song Hyun Wook and Lee Hyun Suk that I have seen.

Being a pre-produced drama that began principal photography in April, filming finally concluded in late November, halfway through the drama’s airing schedule, due to a number of delays caused by Covid infections to the crew and a fire that reportedly broke out at a filming set. Yongin Daejanggeum Park, the iconic MBC film set for historical productions, served as the primarily filming location along with several other famous landmarks and notable locales. These include Minsok Korean Folk Village in Yongin, Sangdangsanseong Fortress in Cheongju, Gwanghalluwon Ojakgyo Bridge in Namwon-si, Jeongseon-gun Doroni Pond (Gangmujang Pond), Itaesarangbawi Rock in Geochang-gun (Gangmujang Cliff), and Andong Seaside Film Set.

What I Liked

The production values are obviously very high and reflected not only in the nationwide filming locations but also the quality in terms of the visuals presented. In addition to the cinematic feel to the atmospherics courtesy of the excellent cinematography and post-production effects, the aesthetic art direction as well as the beautiful elaborately designed costumes certainly enhanced this aspect significantly as well. There is quite a fair bit of slow-motion immersive and “romance-themed” framing. I truly appreciated this approach to the visual language.

The direction as well as editing absolutely complements this aspect of the storytelling because the entire drama takes its time allowing certain key moments and scenes to breathe and leave a memorable impression on viewers. Although nothing to write home about, the action sequences and the choreography for the sword fighting appears quite decent for the most part and progressively intensifies as the story approaches the climax.

The grand scheme of the overarching plot and the conclusion. As soon as I had read the synopsis (which is rather spoilery, by the way), I knew that the conclusion to the story was going to be limited to only a handful of options, some of which probably would leave viewers somewhat distressed. Without spoiling it, I will say that the outcome of the story surprised me a little but in a good way. I also think that the drama ends as strongly as it starts, with episode 19 a particularly thrilling rollercoaster of emotions and adrenaline rush.

As far as the characterizations are concerned, the FL, her grandfather and the ML’s father stand out for me. Especially during the more serious segments of the plot development pertaining to the court intrigue. Each of them is extremely grey and buried beneath the many layers that they have embodied into their persona that sometimes I, as a viewer, become unsure of which mask that they put on is the ""real"" them. After years of pretending to be a man, the FL probably does not even know what it means to be a woman anymore, until her affections have been awakened by the very person whom she first developed feelings for, as a child. Physical attributes aside, her demeanour is utterly that of a royal Crown Prince.

The Left State Councilor, Han Ki Jae is a man who will stop at nothing to preserve his political powers, including his own flesh and blood. At times, the villainy of this character is truly awesome to behold. Likewise his retainer, the cold blooded and ruthlessly efficient Jung Seok Jo. If Han Ki Jae is Emperor Palpatine, then this man is Darth Vader. But beneath the facade of unrelenting malice lies a truly conflicted and tormented individual who knows deep down that he has sold his soul to the Devil.

The performance by all 3 actors for the aforementioned roles are the highlight of the drama for me. Park Eun Bin is absolutely phenomenal. This lady has so much potential given her track record for compelling portrayals in recent times, and her iteration of the gender bender is one of the best I’ve seen. Yoon Je Moon provides the perfect delivery of the antagonistic grandfather and politician of the Joseon court, where his subtly expressed passive-aggressive undertone imbues an added dimension to the depth of the characterization. Bae Soo Bin is much more action oriented given that he portrays quite possibly the best swordsman in the drama, Jung Seok Jo. In addition to the physicality and despite being a man of few words, the nuanced microexpressions on his face say it all, really.

Apart from the impressive trio, Bae Yoon Kyung’s Shin So Eun is noteworthy considering that she lacks screen time because she steals the scenes whenever she does make her appearance. I have to mention the child actress, Choi Myung Bin. Out of all the child actors I’ve seen this year, and there have been many, I do think that her portrayal of both Lee Hwi and Dam Yi is the best. Of course, at 13, she’s considered quite mature but her duality in depicting two vastly different characters, one of whom is male, sold it for me.

The soundtrack is very good, and I wouldn’t expect anything less. If there is romance involved, one can be sure that the music will no doubt play a major part in tugging at the heartstrings with emotional love ballads, of which there are plenty in this production. In this aspect, TKA definitely does not disappoint. My personal favourite is the main theme by LYn, which gets significant airplay via the infusion of countless MV scenes of the lead couple.

LYn (린) - One and Only (알아요)
Ro Woon SF9 (로운) -No Goodbye In Love (안녕)
Baek Z Young (백지영) - IF I
SUPER JUNIOR-K.R.Y. - Shadow of You (그림자 사랑)
An Da Eun (안다은) - I Believe
VROMANCE (브로맨스) - Hide and Seek (숨바꼭질)
Haeyoon (해윤) of 체리블렛 Cherry Bullet - Full of You (티가 나)

Room for Improvement

As much as I have waxed lyrical about the positives, TKA is not without its flaws but on the whole they aren’t overly detrimental to the storytelling. I think at times, particularly midway through the story, the fluffiness probably receives slightly more attention than is perhaps necessary. As a result, cuteness overload features prominently as fillers, where the leads behave out of character and out of place with the setting. Adorable but ridiculous at the same time.

Rowoon, portraying the ML Jung Ji Woon, has the physique to match the action scenes well. His chemistry with Park Eun Bin, as the only CP in the drama, is quite apparent and their scenes together are pretty convincing. My only gripe is the emotive aspects of his performance. Park Eun Bin appears the more superior performer and it truly does show, IMHO. The same goes for the other supporting cast of Nam Yoon Su and Choi Byung Chan as Lee Hyun and Kim Ga On respectively. I’m actually rather intrigued by the character of Kim Ga On, who I wish could have been more fleshed out because despite the potential of his backstory, his character arc never fully materialises into something more than the stoic persona throughout.

As far as the other supporting characters are concerned, Lee Pil Mo as King Hyejong, the FL’s father, appears somewhat inconsequential to proceedings before eventually becoming a mere plot device to the overarching plot. The character of the psychotic Prince Chang Woon who has a penchant for unmitigated violence, played by Kim Seo Ha, is clearly a cliche and written to be nothing more than an OTT antagonist. He comes across as a cartoon character whose only job is to provide angst and cringe. Meanwhile, Jung Chae Yeon has the unenviable task of playing the annoying airhead and occasional comic relief, Noh Ha Kyung. That said, the character is rather pitiful and I actually feel sorry for her in the end, which is a credit to the actress’ interpretation of the role.

Overall

The pros outweigh the cons, and I have absolutely enjoyed Park Eun Bin’s performance here. The story also provides an acceptable closure, much better than I had initially anticipated. The King’s Affection ranks as one of the better produced romance sageuk that I have seen this year.

It didn’t need 20 episodes
This drama really didn’t need to be a 20 episodes one. Started strong with potential but became flat at the end.

It is supposed to be more romance-centric yet there isn't enough romance after the first half of the drama. The focus shifted to some weak power struggles and became unnecessarily draggy.

The last 6 episodes especially, the storyline really gets dragged out. Suddenly there’s an addition of Ha Kyung and her one sided love towards the king (whom she doesn’t know is a lady). The whole ha kyung + king story is really a bad filler, with no value adding to the whole storyline.

Towards the end, the drama tries so hard to inject more complications and depths by bringing in lord Wonsan (who wants the throne), forcefully putting back lord changun (who came back from afterlife briefly and died once again) and injecting more “power struggle” plot into it but imo has failed terribly. The petty little acts to expose the FL as a lady by lord wonsan and people around her just seem… lame? Instead of putting in more power struggle plays with bigger plots and schemes, they focused on the whole exposé of the FL’s gender.

The whole “evidence collection” to bring down lord sangheon also gets so dragged out and got very slow which after a while began to feel exhausting to watch.

The ending? I don’t even know where to begin. The writer could include pointless brief scenes like the dream of FL & ML getting married but they can’t even be bothered to explain why the FL survived the “poisoning” scene but her grandpa died. We can probably infer from the earlier scene that it most likely got to do with the pill she ate before drinking the tea, but isn’t it important to include a short explanation to bring the whole story to a full circle?

I also cannot grasp why they didn’t expand the backstory of ML’s dad (inspector jung seok jo) a little. Granted, the ML's dad is not the lead and this drama is to be more of romance but I mean throughout the drama, there were many parts where they hinted that there’s more to this than meets the eye regarding why the ML’s dad is so cold hearted and so compliant towards lord Sangheon? If they are not interested in expanding his character then those scenes were quite pointless. There were many scenes that hinted viewers about his past, where he mentioned about how the choice is only available to people born in nobility and not people like him. And how he showed sadness when his old friend commander yoon got killed (he even told his subordinates to stop firing those arrows)??? And the scene where he was dying, ML SAID HE HAS STH TO TELL HIS DAD THAT HE HAS NEVER GOTTEN TO, but there were go again, it stops there and the ML NEVER got to reveal what he wanted to tell his dad? What’s with all these little missing details???

The bodyguard character and his backstory also showed so much potential. Kim Ga On got close to the FL (&her father, the ex king) to assassinate them to revenge for his father (the royal preceptor whom the king and crown prince (FL’s twin brother) had loved back then) who was framed for treason and executed due to lord sangheon’s schemes. After finding out that the king and the FL’s twin brother had loved his dad, he ditched his assassination plans and helped the FL instead. The initial build up to him was interesting where there was some mystery to his identity but the final great reveal really fell so flat.

But then again we have time to go through Ha Kyung’s life as a commoner at the end… for? By this time I’m sure most viewers already forgot about her existence since she has already been granted leave from the palace after her dad has been found to have colluded with lord sangheon. But no, the writer HAS TO include her again where she mentions about why she prefer being a commoner??? This bit of airtime could have been used to help other stories develop / come to a full circle.

In all, the drama started rather strong and showed great potential with but ended up getting flat towards the end.

I did enjoy the first half of the drama though. The kid actors did well with their acting. The king’s chubby eunuch was a joy to watch too!

The goods:
- great main FL, they really casted the FL well. She’s a major girl crush! She can look so fierce and suave in male clothing and then so beautiful in her female clothes!
- good OST
- first half of the drama was well paced
- they managed to keep good characters like court lady Kim & bok Dong from dying
- consistent support provided by lord jaeun who stayed true towards FL

In all, if you Stan rowoon, and appreciate good acting and great FL, this is a drama that you can pick up but probably need to bear with some draggy parts towards the end.

A WOMAN WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN BUT REALLY... HE'S TOTALLY A WOMAN
While I'm still on the fence about this drama, I do admit the kids, in the beginning, set the stage for this show. They were very good. However, I find it ironic that K-dramas can be so strict on ""bedroom"" and sex scenes but when it comes to scenes with the murder of children, it's fine. I always have a hard time with those kinds of scenes or storylines, but whatever. Luckily it was all in the first episode. Nothing gory but still sad. Kudos to the child actors though!

Anyways, my hesitancy about this show is because I think it's a hard pill to swallow trying to make it believable that the Crown Prince DOESN'T look or act like a woman. To me, it's very obvious she's a woman. Maybe it's just a wrong casting for the FL but that's my opinion. I didn't expect her to be overly masculine, butchy, or brawny, but there's just something missing with her character. Luckily the ML, the second ML, and the bodyguard all make up for it. Bunch of handsome men... and now I just realized there are not enough female actresses. They should've given her a close confidante at least the same age as the FL. Even the ML and SML have a bromance.

All the acting is good so far and the storyline is interesting enough to keep me watching but by now, knowing what and who the Crown Prince knows about those who tried to kill her early in the series, you'd expect her character to be tougher or show more enmity over the years towards them. It's like she's constantly cowering in their presence. I think this was a missed opportunity for the writers to make the FL character stronger and gustier. Maybe this could've contributed to making the FL more believable as a woman acting like a man.

(As of this writing, I've finished E6 and I'll wait to see if I'll revise or update my review when the series concludes).

Park Eu Bin is fantastic in her role as Yeon Seon/Lee Hwi
I love this drama ... Finished watching from episode 1 to 18 .. i am excitedly waiting for the last 2 final episodes ( episode 19 and 20).

The situation must be stressing and too dangerous for Dami/Yeon Seon to act as the crowned prince Lee Hwi. Becoming a King must be more complicated, dangerous and too risky especially when the King Dami/Yeon Seon - took a wife (got married) to become his (her) Queen. A lot of suspicions about him (her) as a woman and rumors about him/her with Jung Ji woon.
The has fallen in love but both of them cannot make their love and relationship into public. A lot of sacrifices, betrayals, greed and revenge.

Park Eu Bin did pretty well on her role as Dami/Yeon Seon and Lee Hwi. This might be the most challenging role that she were able to portray amazingly. Job well done Park Eu Bin. You are amazing and very talented actress! love you!

I don't usual write a review of shows I haven't finished but this was a struggle to continue
""This series was written by a woman who intended to write the romance purely to create a ""forbidden love"" out of historical implications behind King's/Prince's position but remembered, last minute, it was still historical so they slapped together some cheap politics to create tension."" - Me at the start of the drama.

I'm proud to say I was not wrong by the end of it. I do have some positive feedback to give so this isn't 100% negative. Just 90%.

I'll start off by saying I don't understand why this ended up being 20 episodes. It could have been concluded with the typical 16 episodes. HALF of the show didn't progress for it to deserve more. This is a classical example of bad writing. If it was shorter, the flaws of the drama would be less glaring.

My biggest problem with this series is the politics. If you are not a fan of politics, this drama is for you. However, out of all the historical dramas, this had to be the weakest power struggle I've seen in forever. The worse part? It ties in with the characters development/motives of our main lead because if the politics is weak then the character development is WEAK as well. And that's where our female lead come to play.

I'll admit that one of the best part of this drama is our female lead. She is charismatic, badass, emphatic and a woman with survival instincts. However, her potential is wasted on a writer who can't think beyond the romance. What's the point of making survival as her motives but do not take ANY MEASURES in ensuring she does? You can't seriously tell me hiding her identity is the powerful, woman empowerment development everyone deluded themselves into thinking? She does NOTHING except try to work hard within her limitations which makes no sense since she needs to create a path if she wants to survive. But instead she goes where the wind blows. Since she is a woman pretending to be a MAN (CROWN PRINCE) that means she will get married... how was she planning to keep her secret as a woman? She will eventually be pressured to give a ""royal baby"" but again, NO PLAN. She only tries to come up with something WHEN it happens. What about when she gets sick or gets hurt, does she have a trustworthy royal infirmary to help her? Nope, NO PLAN. Nothing. She kisses in public! Forgetting she is PRETENDING TO BE A MAN... again, no measures whatsoever. You can kiss in hiding... that would have been the MOST LOGICAL kiss scene... but NOPE. There was even another point I would mention that really shows BAD writing but that would be a manhwa spoiler so it won't be mentioned. She is one of those FL that start cool, promising, badass but then barely does anything after few episodes. You remember those dramas? This one is one of them.

She is a character that could be morally grey if the writer wishes her to be. The enemy are barely scheming against her. If anything, whatever they are scheming IN HER FAVOR from BOTH FRACTIONS. As I said, weak politics. I wonder if the writer realize the potential they had when they wrote this story. This could turn very dark or fluffy based on what direction the female lead could do if she took ACTUAL measures. It could also be a revenge story or self destruction story if the author realized that the female lead is a double edge sword that can use her identity for revenge. One of those ""If I go down, you go down with me."" It's such a shame she was a wasted potential.

I'll end this review with a positive note that this is for people who want fluff, romance, and the temporary misunderstanding/breakup before everything ends perfectly. People who enjoy rom-coms and want light hearted historical drama. Romance is positive aspect and this is really cute. If that's what you are coming here for, there is a high chance you will love this drama. It's sweet, diabetics and the chemistry is good. It's why people love it. I'm just disappointed they sacrificed the side plots for romance when they could have had BOTH.

|| OVERALL ||

Started off strong, then gradually lost its way and started to drag during the course of the drama. For me, what kept me watching every week was the romance of the two main leads. I enjoyed watching the romantic scenes, and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of intimate scenes they had. The light-hearted scenes were a great watch, but was unfortunately always sandwiched by melodramatic and supposedly heart-wrenching scenes which got a bit frustrating as it started to feel forced. The plot was decent overall but certain parts that felt important were just brushed past whereas some less important parts just dragged on and on. I found myself fast-forwarding more and more of the episode near the end. Also can I just say, it's ridiculous how fast their wounds heal. Other than Lee Hwi's injury that Ji-un attended to which had a more realistic time frame, I found it absurd how it takes one scene for the males to go from slashed up at the brink of death to suddenly up and running as if nothing happened. Anyways, this is the first Park Eun Bin drama I watched and not to say the others are bad at acting, but she was clearly the star of the drama. A good romance drama nevertheless with a unique and interesting premise.

**I recommend this drama to those that like historical romance dramas. The romance was well executed with plenty of heart-fluttering scenes. I wouldn't categorize this as comedy despite there being more light-hearted scenes, as I generally felt it was more somber than happy for the most part.


|| DETAILS ||

= Story =
*Premise - Explores the aftermath of the birth of twins, one of which is the heir to the throne. Unique and rather interesting as it is based on the belief that the heir to the throne sharing the same womb with a twin let alone it being of the female gender is an ominous sign. Just as there cannot be two emperors, it is frowned upon for the heir to be a twin.
*Genre - A historical romance drama with well executed romantic scenes. A bit too melodramatic at times, otherwise not much comedy and the action scenes were rather mediocre.
*Main plot / love line - The main leads' romance was the highlight of the drama. From them meeting and falling in love as children, separating then meeting again, falling in love again, overcoming hardships, the general love story was great to watch. Additionally I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of intimate scenes we saw, despite some of them being the cliché getting jealous of each other and treating each others' battle wounds (I enjoyed those too). Honestly though, I did cringe every time the title of the drama was mentioned. The reveal that Lee Hwi is a woman felt a bit rushed as it took an episode or two for many people to either expose they knew all along or realize she is a woman. The affection between the two were well executed, though, as I did feel they really loved each other. The politics on the other hand was a bit boring, as I was still able to get the gist of it despite fastforwarding most of it. Action scenes were mediocre and it was very unrealistic how they kept getting slashed but in the next scene they are fine again, except that one wound Lee Hwi sustained which Ji-un tended to for a whole episode. The healing time is just crazy fast. It was nice to have alternating happy and somber scenes / episodes, but somehow those sad parts seemed forced close to the end and dragged for too long which got a little annoying. In the end, though, because I did enjoy the romantic scenes, they made up for it.
*Supporting characters - Understandably there needs to be other love interests for the main leads, but I found it a bit redundant for there to be three. I feel the drama could have done without Lee Hyun's unrequited love as it was so superficially explored and nothing happened in the end anyways. He could've just been a good friend and loyal subject, and it would've just been the same for me. I felt that the characters Kim Ga On and Shin So Eun were rather unfortunate as they seemed like decorations and just placed there for brief periods of times when the plot needed some fillers. Shin So Eun didn't even appear in the last episode. The antagonists did well though, they were rather annoying to watch. Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong were also great additions to the plot.
*Symbols / Motifs - I felt like the symbol of the lotus flower and the wooden cubes could've been used more to add more flavour to the drama. The drama made it sound so important in the earlier episodes, but neglected to mention it at all and seemingly forgot about it in the latter episodes.
*Ending - To be honest, I was very pleased with the ending scene as it was simple and did it's job in concluding the drama. However, the ending as a whole, especially the events of the battle, it felt very random and some parts didn't really make sense to me. I can overlook it though, as the ending scene is usually more important for me as it's the last thing I watch from the drama.

= Cast =
*Acting - Park Eun Bin really stole the spotlight for this one with her stellar acting. Her subtle reactions when there was no dialogue spoke volumes. I also really liked her contagious smile. Kim Seo ha (Prince Changwoon, Lee Hwi's uncle) was also quite good as he really did get on my nerves. Otherwise, the other actors did not stand out too much for me.
*Chemistry - Park Eun Bin and Rowoon had good chemistry, and their acting did make me believe that Lee Hwi / Dam-i and Jung Ji-un loved each other. Their romantic scenes were swoon-worthy.

= OST =
There weren't that many songs so certain songs were repeated quite a few times. Despite this, I didn't find the background music repetitive. I'd have to say that the OST was quite good, especially the light-hearted songs which I particularly liked.


|| A LESSON ABOUT INDIVIDUALITY ||

Be the lotus flower, sparklingly clean and blooming despite being surrounded by mud. Inevitably there will be times we are surrounded by undesirable circumstances or situations that urges us to compromise our values and beliefs. To stand strong even if you may be alone and believe that your individuality is something to be cherished rather than just being swayed by others is the true challenge.

one of the most disappointing dramas ive ever watched
This drama started out really promising, the story line was interesting and the acting was good too. I was especially surprised by Rowoon as I was expecting him to be inexperienced and more lacking. However after the first few episodes i kept losing interest and around episode 10 I was really close to dropping it. It just kept dragging on, adding more and more stereotypical kdrama tropes that ruined not only the plotline but also the characters; I started being annoyed at the constant back and forth in their relationship.
definetly not a ""must-watch"" as there are many other, and better (historical) dramas with a similar plot.

A misstep, this show gives late 2000s vibes
The visuals of this drama were captivating for a sageuk. I have seen more than a handful of historical kdramas and with all due respect to the creative minds behind this project, I did not like The King’s Affection. Just like a lot of dramas, this started off promising with enrapturing sceneries, acting performances, and plot. Unfortunately, the cracks began to surface during the middle episodes and the show makers were not able to maneuver the storyline and just succumbed to be a bland and generic sageuk. Characters who were once smart and sophisticated became predictable and outright boring and mundane. Starting from episode 15, I was watching it at 1.5x speed, perhaps the series would have been better off if they conduced it to 16 episodes. The ending was disastrous, like really, didn’t the allegedly “smart” characters somehow foresaw that the antagonist had an actual army that he could use to fulfill his evil plans. Cant believe also that they used only 2 songs throughout the series, officially there might be more, but the same song was just playing over and over again from the first to the last episode. The acting of the leads were just good, the acting of the supporting characters were able to show more emotions than the leads though. Overall, I would not recommend this, there are a lot more better period kdramas than this. Only watch it if you are an avid fan of the leads.

How to lump as many Kdrama tropes as possible
I was excited for this series because I watched a ton of BTS videos on Youtube between Park Eun Bin and Rowoon and they have some of the best chemistry I've seen. They're so cute and so funny together.

The series was a giant hot mess. From start to finish, I began pointing out all of the stereotypical KDRAMA tropes from, ""we met while children and became each other 1st love then fatefully reunited later as gorgeous adults"", love triangle, female-disguised as male but falls in love with the right hand, etc etc etc. It just felt like the writers wanted to lump in as many tropes as possible while simultaneously stretccccching out the series to an unnecessary 20 episodes.

I liked watching Rowoon and loved that he accepted his sexuality and loved Eun Bin despite full-heartedly believing she was a man, versus Park Bo-Gum's character in Love in the Moonlight falling in love with his eunuch and discovering he was a she BEFORE the kiss scene, which felt a lot like gay-baiting to me because I loved his self-discovery regarding his sexuality too and thought it was a cop-out for viewers to be tricked into thinking he still thought Hong Sam Nom was a man during the kiss scene than in the very next episode revealing he'd seen Sam Nom change her clothes and reveal her true gender before he'd kissed her in the garden.

I couldn't finish this series. I literally skipped through the majority of them after faithfully watching the first 6 episodes. If you want to watch great chemistry, watch their BTS videos online. This series ain't it.

The affection is all there
This drama started strong. It pulls you in with the child actors and the curious story. I don't usually watch historicals, but the 2 lead actors I loved watching in other dramas. As I progressed with this drama, the cinematography became a beautiful element to this drama and so was the OST. The middle of the drama is a bit draggy with all the politics, the romance is sweet but few and far between. But the end again pulls you in and all in all I was very satisfied.
The character of Park Eun Bin was fun to watch. She gets 10 gold stars for her portrayal of this character. This character is probably one of the most strong, yet the most sensitive female character I've seen. She's in love yet she has the run the country behind a guise. This was so worth the time and effort for a 20 part series.

Just, read the history, people
This was an adorable gender bender drama within an ACTUAL historical setting. As in, I knew from the 2nd episode (when I looked up the king, and discovered who was who), that our dimpled 2nd prince would end up on the throne.
The WRITERS didn't kill off anyone, HISTORY did. That poor brother of our lead girl, for instance. Sad but true.
It's like The Prince & the Pauper. Since we've been hit over the head with a gazillion retellings of said Prince's DADDY (that would be King Henry VIIII), we know what happens to our cute prince (just, go read it - Twain's awesome).
Anyway, I just loved this drama for the most part. It had it's angsty moments, it's WTF stuff, it's political intrigue (I mean, yeah, necessary, but not my fav stuff), but overall I enjoyed watching this - I mean, SF9's Rowoon & Victon's Byung Chan were VERY easy on the eyes plus gave good performances, and Nam Yoon Soo, oh my my my!!
I thought our leading lady did a credible job of acting like a boy - the real prince was 18 when he ascended the throne.
The supporting cast did their usual phenomenal task as well.
My biggest beef is that the writers didn't let the Queen Mother just hush it all up. I mean, NO, that girl would not have survived revealing that she became king! Under any circumstances!

I love everything about this drama, the storyline, the visuals, the storyline, oops I already said that. The storyline got to me. You have to watch and know what I mean. Park Eun Bin who played Yeon Seon / Lee Hwi / Dam Yi, did great portraying a male
from crown prince to ""your majesty"". Another strong woman in a man's role. Loved it. Rowoon is tall, he towered over Park Eun Bin, I loved him, his humor, his smile, his acting for this particular drama was on point. All the other main actors and actresses as well as the support did awesomely. This will be a must rewatch for me. Thank to whoever the writer(s) are. You did fantastically and I applaud you. Rowoon, I hope to see more of your acting! Now I have to hear him sing or dance... since I read he was in a group.

just watch it and judge by yourself
imo reviews and comments are too extreme - i agree it isn't the best saeguk out there. it has several flaws in the writing and the plot sort of fell off after ep 10-12. if you came in looking for a politically-driven drama, this was definitely not it since the beginning. if you read the synopsis of this drama and expect strong politics, that's on you tbh because it screams romance-centered. ""political"" is not even a tag here, so judging it for having weak politics is out of place, since it wasn't even part of the main plot. the plot is clearly about how the female twin survives as the CP and develops feelings for her royal teacher, and that's pretty much what delivered. now, again, i agree it wasn't the best after the leads got together and the second half was underwhelming and draggy, but most of the reviews are focusing on things unrelated to this particular drama, and bringing up plots from other saeguks. the fact that it's a saeguk doesn't mean it needs go be politics-centered.
that said, it would've been better off if it had 16 eps as the regular format so that some of the writing mistakes wouldn't be so noticeable or bothersome. i feel like the writer forgot about certain characters throughout the drama and remembered them only by the end (tho they did have a purpose), which shows kind of lazy writing. it feels like the writer ran out of inspiration in the second act and didn't know what else to throw to the plot, but kind of recovered by eps 19-20 and produced a nice 3rd act (for me). these two were the best of the second half and gave a nice closure to the drama. overall, i did enjoy it but i'm also a rowoon stan, so i'm aware that my judgement isn't completely unbiased, lol. tho i wouldn't really recommend it to someone who isn't into saeguks, and maybe only if they like a lot of romance and rowoon, lol.

I Enjoy It !!!!!!
Love the story and the strong female lead character. I always support dramas when they have a women lead and she strong and smart and shows that she can do just as good as a man. This drama has both. It was a very well done beginning and as she grows up. To fill the roll of a man as a women and especially the crown prince was great. The emotions that she goes threw and hiding does feelings so no one can be aware of her true identity was perfectly performed. I love both love interest. The actors were great in their performance and the ups and down of emotions that you get while watching. The intense that you feel as you worry if she will be discover made me nervous and biting on my nails. I loved it.

Sometimes good, sometimes infuriating...
Let's start with the good :

- The overall concept was very good.
- The ending was okay for me.
- Park Eun Bin's acting at its best.
- Interresting bad guys.
- OST: fine too.
- Visuals: very good.


Now.. for the bad, i'll start with the huge problem for me:
- The male lead character: Infuriating, thoughtless, useless most of the time, bad decisions all the time.. From my perspective, he was the main enemy in this drama lol

- The 20 episodes format: the 4 extra episodes was a bad idea. Some parts were almost not entertaining at all.
- The secondary characters, i did not feel anything for them. Their presence was way too inconsistent, episodic.

Yet, do i recommend this drama? The answer is yes. My rate might be a bit low, but the story was original for a historic drama and the FL is carrying the show very well.

Could have been better but 20 episodes was definitely TOO MUCH
This one had a good beginning and actually it was stable but after EP12 everything felt too draggy. The story was interesting in the beginning, simple but interesting, but they couldn't maintain at the end and I was a forced to finish this only because I liked the characters. The plot itself wasn't the strongest thing in this drama, actually it was the weakest, and I think 20 episodes was too much for this plot. For me the good things about this drama are the characters and their chemistry and the OST (which is AMAZING probably one of my favs of the year).

Talking now about the characters. I had mixed feelings with Dam I in the beginning because altought I understand she had to become cold and self centered to be the king, her character was a little blend in the beginning and I only liked her later. But omg Eun Bi was perfect in this role, she's an amazing actress. Ji Woon for the other side, was the opposite. I loved him in the beginning and all this ""love beyond gender"" was amazing. He was so cute and perfect omg I died many times. But later, he became too blend and it seemed like he was there only to be Dam I partner. I like cute characters but I think that he could be more than that. But of course, I loved them as a couple. I saw some people saying that they didn't have chemistry but I loved their chemistry and they were really cute together. Lee Hyun omg...he was perfect. I shipped Dam I with Ji Woon but I had second lead syndrome here because of of him. Seriously why they had to choose Nam Su for this role lol I knew I would fall for him the moment I saw he would be in this drama. So Eun was a pretty good second female lead too. I also liked the Courty Lady and her relationship with Dam I. The only character that disappointed me was Ga On. Byungchan was so hot here but his character only had beauty lol For me this character seemed lose in the script and I couldnt see anything strong in him.

Well thats it. For me the drama its not bad, it does have a pretty good beginning and almost all characters are interesting or good but for me 20 episodes was TOO MUCH for this plot and everything felt too draggy as I almost dropped if it wasn't for the characters.

It didn't need 20 episodes
This show had a great premise and great actors. I even liked the OST even though it was a repetitive 1 or 2 songs played at the correct time. However, as other reviewers have stated, it really didn't require 20 episodes. 16 would have been more than enough enough. I only once felt sad for the 'king' in recognising that they couldn't be together. And they only had maybe 1 episode of being together as themselves. The rest of the time was dreary politics which wasn't even really useful. We didn't see her as someone who cleverly schemed to thwart the baddies or to help those around her.

Concurrently airing was Red Sleeve Cuff which as a sageuk is superior in every way. The plot moves faster, and even though there isn't much court politics and intrigues, the love story was very real and well done. I much enjoyed that instead. If this wasn't on Netflix, I would have given up at episode 6. I only finished it because I was subscribed to Netflix.

Apparently I´m one of the people now that start with: I´ve never had the urge to write a review but this show had me glued to the screen which surprised me after reading the reviews on this site.
I read that The King´s Affection dragged the story, started well but lost it´s tension along the way.
For me this is one of the most interesting historical dramas I´ve seen so far (which are a lot :-)) I´m a sucker for romance and a lot of the political scenes drag for me in most of these dramas. Don´t get me wrong, I think they´re an essential part of this genre and when executed well I don´t get tired of them. This was the case in this drama. The mixture between romance and politics, friendship and intrigues, laughter and tears was perfect for me.
I had characters I loved, others I hated and others where I just shouted at my TV because they were annoying and thoughtless.
The story kept me engaged, I was always wondering what would happen next and also how people were gonna react to certain realizations.
I couldn´t help but root for the characters, the villain was worthy of that position. The heros proved that it´s possible to choose the right path over and over again, even if it´s the hard path.
The ending was satisfactory, I couldn´t stop smiling. The only thing I don´t like about the ending is that the new king didn´t get a happy ending. Loosing the closest people to him seems to bring him to lead a very lonely life. He deserves better.
So here you have it, my very first, probably not very stringent, review.

In short: Def a recommendation

an emotional ride between heart fluttering cuteness and wanting everybody dead...
This is one of those rare gems with the great combo of high entertainment value and high quality good drama, easy to binge, easy to scream, infuriating and heart fluttering all at once.

Honestly I kept jumping between the emotions: ""ooohhh they are soooo cute"" and ""KILL THEM ALL"" and experienced everything in-between...

A while back I wrote an article called: Crossdressing in K-dramas: Revealing Inequality or Just Another Punchline
(link in the comments). And people kept mentioning this in the comment section making me very cureus.

This drama is THE clearest case of revealing in-equality and definitely not just another punchline and it does not even cross the line to homophobia, than many of these dramas otherwise balance.

this shows clearly how little women and well anything outside the norm were (are) valued in the past, as well as clearly show the real villain and complexity to the hunger for power... What people would wan tthat power for is a different question....

It has several great portrayals of friendship, a cute cat (but barely noticeable), butterflies (both in and outside ones stomach) flowers, scenery... found family... and a lot of blood and excitement, and a pretty ost. So really what is not to love? If you are not faint hearted and actually do appreciate historicals, that is... If you do not like historicals with all their regular power stuff then you will not like this either.

Oh and it has very few scenes with overly annoying characters at all! hateable, despicable, evil jerks yes!!! plenty but not those oh this is just stupid types that often come in to ruin stuff!

To be perfectly honest I was pondering whether to give this a 9,5 or 10 but landed on a 10... it is in no way perfect but tics enough boxes to earn that rating...

A great concept with bad execution.
This will be very short review:

It started great, fast paced first 2 episodes. From episode 3-16 was just pure boredom. Lacing the drama with a lot of clichés and typical power struggle trope that weren't good or original at all. The last 2 episodes were so anti climatic. That's it? pure disappointment.

It's like the writers watched a BL and Sageuk dramas simultaneously, got inspired by it, wrote a drama fusion between a BL and a Sageuk but found out they couldn't air it on Korean's National TV so they decided to put on a Crossdresser trope. The result? disaster.

Good title. It was Affection indeed. Not Love.
1/STORY

GOOD : The dramaturgy of the early episodes. Endearing leading teen actors. Cute first Love story. Nice twist of fate.
BAD: The palace schemes and action part only in the beginning and in the 2 last eps. The drama is 20eps but a long part of it is about a fake love story because it is rather Infatuation from his part and Affection from her part. It can't be called Love when it is plagued with lies and confusion and deception. The final part is rushed, messy and quite ridiculous.

2/ CHARACTERS:

- Dami/Lee Hwi:
GOOD: Dami was great. Lee Hwi was consistently written and well portrayed (kudos to Park Eun Bin and Choi Myung Bin). She was credible as a woman forced to live the life of another person and carry on the mascarade while trying to protect the ones she cared about.
NOT SO GOOD: Never understood why she kept living as CP and King just to avoid death. We all die sooner or later. Living just to avoid death means you are already dead. I was expecting her to live for something greater than herself as a woman, a person or a King. Nope. It was just about saving her butt.

- Ji-Un:
GOOD: Good kid who grew up to be a fun young man, talented, charming, a tease, dedicated to people and keen on justice.
NOT SO GOOD: He soon became a sorry character stucked in an unconditional puppy love and crawled back to his daddy to be a part of the props and be able to see the CP/King.

- Bad Grandpa: Never understood why the guy was so feared. He did not look so powerful. In the end he is a very weak vilain and his demise was a bit ridiculous and pathetic.

- Grandpa's dog: Ji Un's dad and a children killer. A man full of lame excuses for his terrible actions. No redemption for him. Straight to hell.

- Hyun: I did not like his obsession for the CP at first but he grew on me. A dedicated man, a good brother and a good friend who ends up on a high note.
- Ga-On: A man with a sword and his own agenda who achieved his goal and helped others at the same time. The real silent hero of the drama rewarded with a cute ending.
- Noh Ha Kyung and Shin So Eun: Two sad fates who are endearing enough to create empathy from me.
- Also I liked Commander Yoon good soldier and a man of duty.

OST:
I really started to hate the main song. Because it was played on every ""romance"" scene between the two leads and that ""romance"" was draggy and lopsided.

REWATCH VALUE:
Zero. Nada. 20 eps of that again? Surely not.

OVERALL:
A promising drama at first but ended draggy and disappointing with a thin palace plot and a draggy romance you can't buy because the FL and ML are on different agendas. It did not entertained me actually so I will not recommend it. 7/10 for it still has some qualities.

The King's Affection: a Sageuk Done Right
I decided to watch this drama firstly because it's a sageuk, and secondly because of Rowoon and Park Eun Bin, and the story at its opening did not fail me. I don't think I felt this much admiration for a character in a historical drama, as I did for Yeon Seon/Lee Hwi/Dam Yi, and all the credit goes to Park Eun Bin. She was brilliant in this role and worthy of an award. The King's Affection wasn't only a good script, but also riddled with many brilliant talents.

From the Crown Princess/Queen Jang Sun, played by Han Chae Ah, who is beyond impressive in her limited but impactful cameo appearance, to Bae Soo Bin as Jung Seok Jo and Jung Ji Woon's (Rowoon) father in how brutally and precisely he fulfills his duties to the royal palace, and the same goes to Yoon Je Moon, who is phenomenal as the demon grandfather. So is Choi Myung Bin in the dual role of young prince Lee Hwi and princess Dam Yi, but the actor who stole the show for me was Nam Yoon Su in his unshaken stance to protect those that mean the most to him, regardless of who he had to go against to do it.

As I continued to watch the drama, I wasn't sure if I should be enraged at the royal place for believing twins were abominations, or for the measures they took, or laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. But then I reminded myself of the era and the deeply knitted beliefs of the times, and felt utter sadness for the many lives that must have been lost because of those beliefs. Some elements of the story reminded me of Mirror of the Witch, but unlike it, this one was cruel with its carnage. But it stayed true to the idea that choices make people who we are -- people are the culmination of their past actions, which have a way of creeping back up to them unannounced and when least expected in their present. No evil deed goes unpunished.

At the core of it, this drama is a story of courage in face of adversity, but also about immense cruelty, betrayal, treason, and unconditional love. The most impressive parts of this drama have been in its loyalties. From misplaced loyalty, to firmly edged subject to royal loyalty, to loyal love and brotherhood. Even the unrequited loves in this story are engulfed in loyalty. At the same time, the story is also about greed, fear, and the injustices committed in the name of loyalty. But most of all, it's about courage and how an unsung hero born out of circumstances rose to the occasion when she could no longer coexist with the hypocrisy that was the royal palace, and gained the respect and loyalty of many, even her enemies, but also the love of her life, hence the title: The King's Affection.

The King's Affection is a drama that stayed solid to the end, which was fitting to the story it told, from suppression to betrayal, love, and the fight to be acknowledged, as a human being worthy of the life she was born into, a twin and a princess, who through her trails and tribulations came to understand her worth, which made her powerful. Her world gravely needed a hero, so she became that, a strong woman disguised as a man who took no nonsense from anyone. A thousand and one kudos to the writer, director, and all the cast, production team for a job beyond well done. A drama worthy of your watch!

Drags on and on
The concept is fresh and the first few episodes were quite fast-paced, with lots of plot twists happening. However, once we get to the middle part, the whole story just drags and drags.

1) the political intrigue was the strongest point of the series. Lee Hwi's grandfather gave some superb acting. He is soo evil and sinister and I was super invested in finding out what was happening with the court. I also liked Lee Hwi's father for his really great performance as a father

2) romance was so cringey. I started skipping all the scenes of the main couple. So cringe. The encounters all felt forced and their intimacy felt contrived. There was zero chemistry. I wish the story focused on the political intrigue instead

3) very repetitive. Episodes would pass and nothing has changed. Ji-woon is still angsting about his love, Lee Hwi is still trying to hide her feelings for him while pretending to be a prince/king, the grandfather is still threatening people... Also, it has got to be a joke how many people secretly knew Lee Hwi is a woman. It's like an open secret. Second of all, it's ridiculous how many characters were actually there at supposedly 'private' meetings and eavesdropping. And these eavesdroppers weren't even properly hidden! They would just be standing in the open and somehow nobody sees them.

It started of well, got lost in middle
First of all I want to say, if you are looking for politics? Skip this one. For romance? Watch on your own account, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this.

I had started this drama even if historical isn't my go to because everyone was talking about it, praising it and plot sounded interesting enough. Drama had so much potential in the beginning with switching twins, the king being secretly a woman storyline. The beginning was paced well and you get sucked into this drama pretty quickly, just enough events to keep you interested, but not too much to leave ""how will they execute 20 eps?"". Yes it had cliché storyline in the beginning but it was well executed, you will likely not mind it at all. However, if you don't like first few episodes and wondering if it gets better? Do not continue.

Most storylines of characters were presented well right off and it just makes you care and wonder about everyone, not only the two leads. Lee Hwi and the male trio were done well (well, Hyun was more later on rather than the beginning), but issue was with the female duo, So Eun and Ha Kyung. They were supposted to be important characters, even have main role listed on here, but they lacked depth, motivation. It is kinda like the writer got lazy writing their characters. Actress did well with their roles, kudos especially to idol turned actress, Chae Yeon, but they just didn't have space to do anything more noticeable, they were just used as plot devices rather than them influencing the plot. Even what was supposted to be So Eun's growth as chatacter wasn't well done, it felt forced and unnatural. Sadly, for those two it didn't change until the end.

My issue considering writing is great with Ji Woon's and Ga On's characters. Ji Woon went from brave, admirable and interesting character to just Lee Hwi's loyal puppy. He lost all dimensions he had on the start and just became bland character, his father in the end had more depth and dimensions. Ga On had amazing potential, his storyline was great, I would say even the best one of the show, but it was badly executed. His, what was supposted to be great revelation, was underwhelming and after it, he was just there, for eye candy I guess. However, both Rowoon and Choi Byung Chan did well in their roles, their blandness in second half is writer's fault, not lack of their acting skills.

Chemistry of leads was great in first half, you care for them and their relationship so much, you root for them. Even tho Ji Woon's sexuality could have been dealt with better, it didn't impact the main couple. And just like everything else, it was also ruined in second half, to the point I didn't feel anything for them anymore, I didn't care if they end up together, all I felt was annoyance with their storyline.

My another great issue is pacing. It was well done for almost entirety of first half of the drama, and second half was just marked with unnecessary and out of place events that didn't serve the plot nothing but to drag it to 20 episodes. It could have easily been 16 eps drama, if even that much.

Last few episodes I was just annoyed watching it and often skipped through some scenes. I hoped the ending will make up for some of this drama, but it left bitter taste, to put it nicely. It was NOT well done and it was so unrealistic. Kinda like they created a whole mess with everyone included, and they just ended it with everything solved but with a million questions of how.

Rewatch is definitely not in my plans.

Lastly, I want to say a few good things to justify an 6 rather than lower number. As I said, first half was just well done. Outside of it, actors did great job, from mains to supports, all were good or outstanding in their roles, especially Park Eun Bin and Bae Soo Bin, and even new actor Kim Taek whose first role is this one, what a start! Also, some support characters like Grand Queen Dowager, Jil Geum, Eunuch Cho and Court Lady Kim just made the drama better. Even tho I skipped some scenes, I still watched an episode as soon as it airs, so it was interesting enough, or I am a masochist.

Overall the drama is just badly executed cliché after a cliché with many known and respectable faces. So if you are expecting great story, great historical drama? You will likely be disappointed. But if you can make through pointed minuses of drama, you can give it a try, to waste your time, to bless your eyes, an easy time passing drama (if you give up on expectations) with great names and great visuals with OSTs worthy of your library.

The King's Affection started explosively but soon declined in terms of entertaining, probably due to the fact it is 20 episodes long. However, I am glad everyone got what they deserved. I also expected more from Rowoon, heavy chemistry with the fl but you don't always get what you want. The bodyguard was so good-looking, he and the King carried the show for me. Good show, but I wouldn't watch it again. The King's Affection started explosively but soon declined in terms of entertaining, probably due to the fact it is 20 episodes long.

Seemed innovative but it just didn't work
So the start of the drama was so good it sucked me in immediately. Why? Well, first the child actress did so well, like she seriously made this really good she cobveyed the right feelings everytime and just did an outstanding job. Second, the storyline in itself was pretty interesting, it is certainly something new. You may say it is not a new concept since there are many other dramas in which a girl or a boy disguises as the other gender. Yes i agree, however never have i seen it with ancient times dramas. So i thought oh wow pretty interesting. And it really sucks you in. In the start you start wondering hiw everything will play out. Like lets be honest how the hell will you hide the real gender of a king? They are expected to marry and have children at a young age and how would no one notice. OK, now lets go to the problem. Well don't get me wrong but honestly not many of them knew how to act like, some of their acting was sloppy they did not make me feel like i am living with the characters, like i feel what they feel, that was very very lacking. This, could be because of two reasons or they really didnt know how to act, or the script was written poorly. Honestly, I believe it was both. And that brings me to the fact that the storyline just became uninteresting, just so unclever, and unrealistic. Like, why the hell is the grandpa so fixated in making him king, he has no legitimate reason and when he gets asked why and you expect this elaborate answer he just answers with its my desire like bro wtf. also the amount of times they bring flashback scenes is just not it like bro i know already you have showed the same flashback like a million times, this made the acting feel so poor like legit it downgraded the whole thing. Also, why the hell did everyone start becoming so helpless. Like legit they drag the crown prince away and the dude be seeing how people be fighting for him/her and he/she just stands there like bro you also know how to fight pick up a damned sword and fight with him. Just everything makes no sense the story is just a bunch of cliches badly excecuted like dont get me wrong oh how i love a good cliche. Again GOOD cliché. This was just poor writting and editing like i am also dissapointed about the osts. The songs are legitimately good, its just they play them overand over again to make scenes more dramatic but it doesnt because they overplay them so it just makes the scenes less captivating. And ma man you cant tell me you broke a leg and was fine and then you legit get a scratch on your arm from an arrow and you almost be dying. Also that part is really a mess they be looking for you and then wait a whole day to start looking again and then miraculously start finding blood traces like no no no . And after that you carelesly go to the market and enjoy the day then the crown prince is left alone and gets kidnapped they didnt even show how the hell they found his whereabouts just out of nowhere they know where everyone is hidding and bruh i really am about to drop this show. The only thing stopping me from dropping this show is because i want to see how they bring down the grandpa. Also i mean you can watch the show it just isnt that great. Watch it for the repeating love scenes. Which get boring after some time and the good visuals. They all pretty faces.

Great watch!
Even though it's not up there with Mr. Queen, it was a great watch and I looked forward to new episodes every week! ROWOON is so cute to look at and I love his non-conforming male behavior. I think he played a bit more of the feminine role here but it complements the female lead who has to play the male role! I felt the plot is unique and interesting. It's simple as in other than the villain we already know, there's not a lot of misunderstanding or evil side schemes that comes between the major evil scheme. There are some minor flaws in the plot but what drama doesn't have flaws? All the supporting characters played their roles well. The ones you should love and the ones you should hate. The dad and male lead had a complex relationship but it worked out. The supporting female characters were lovable. I enjoyed the last episode as it was true happy ending, not a half-@$$ed 5-min cut of an implied happy ending.

Nothing special, pretty cinematography and good cast
I watched for Park Eunbin. The cinematography and color palette reminded me a bit of Rookie Historian Goo Hae Ryung which is not a bad thing for me. Overall the plot was not the most riveting but it's certainly not the worst I've seen. The ending seemed rushed but I'm glad it ended well. Unfortunately, I think this drama might be a forgettable one for me. It was a nice drama while it lasted though. The OST's are wonderful and really nice to listen to. If I forget this drama, I will still remember it's OST.

Yes, She Can: Themes of Power and Love…and Feminism
I love the cast and most of the series. It is true that at some points its narrative pace weakens, and there are some transition issues perhaps from time constraints. However, when this 20-episode drama is good, it's very good. Some scenes are delightfully hilarious, others charming or deeply moving: the makers did a great job of developing characters and relationships. I think if it had been tightened and trimmed into 16 eps, with a less hurried writer, the series would have been gold. Still, the story and characters are strong, and the themes of loyalty, protectiveness, devotion, and love are explored tenderly. The series never is boring unless one views the dark sides of historical sexism, homophobia, classism, jealousy, abuse of power, political intrigue, assassination, murder, and struggles for position or justice through combat and power plays as boring. Or one never finished the series at all. For me, the real excellence of the series is its belief in friendship, loyalty, and love that ""sees"" and embraces the beloved, no matter the shifts and even threats. It is the series' greatest theme, and the actors deserve praise for their gifted performances in telling their characters' often tragic but also triumphant stories. And the most important take-away is that “Yes, she can.”

One of the best worth watching Historical Drama

Am very satisfied with every single aspects of this wonderful drama. Personally historical is my favourite genre. Thanks to Netflix for taking its streaming rights because of that we got an amazing visually grand historical drama. The story was very interesting from the Beginning, when i first read the plot i thought this will probably follow the same pattern of love hate and love triangle boring patriotism and politics till end. For love triangle there were several people in that cycle, but i desperate to watch mainly because of my favourite actors Rowoon and Park Eun bin.

I don't enter into the plot because you can read it on mydramalist website, but in short a girl pretending to a king and she has to live her life with this secret, sounds very interesting and so as the drama also very beautifully narrated with a good screenplay. 20 long episode, i don't felt any dragging at all ( binge watching experience may different). After every episode by episode it kept going very nicely. Eun bin was nailed it with her outstanding performance. It's not an easy task to transform into a men, but her appearance was quite impressive, There was so many characters and the screenplay is well balanced. Also not much love triangle, but still there some. But they give less space for that which was good actually.

Even the finale episodes were very satisfying, all the emotional moments with some beautiful osts played a big part to make this drama worth watch. Highly recommended if you r a historical drama lover. I enjoyed a lot.

a roller coaster story with alot of twists
I don’t know why this drama getting bad reviews, but I beg to differ, will just honestly share what I think of this drama, in my own opinion

At first, I was not hooked with the Young FL & ML’s acting, I am quite irritated how the young FL acted. But given her dual role as boy & girl, I tried to hold on until they get old.

While this was ongoing, I stopped watching at Ep8, because I knew I’ll best appreciate this drama once it was finished airing because I’ll be able to watch the rest eps in one go. Hence, I didn’t regret.

I thought on Ep11, everything was going well. I even told myself, the writer gave Dal-Yi few more episodes to be a girl, but… I was quite frustrated and disappointed when just after 2 eps, everything just go back to what it was used to be.

But I realized THIS IS A HEAVY DRAMA which requires A LOT of TWIST & TURN of story. I decided to trust the writer’s flow of story and director for extending this drama upto ep20.

This is not just a typical light story where she pretended to be a boy, has childhood first love, etc.

I barely got to ep17, because I just cannot take the heaviness I am feeling about this drama. But I kept holding on how this story will turn a happy ending.

So… I endured all the people that have to die, skipped the bloody battle because I cannot dare to watch it whole.

I thought on Ep20, everything was just a dream, I almost throw my phone! I almost hated the whole cast tbh! I was telling myself after all those bloody battle, cries, laughter, they have the gut to tell everything was just a dream?! How dare they?! Lol. But good thing, it wasn’t the case.

At the end I AM MORE THAN HAPPY HOW THE WRITER, DIRECTOR ended the story. They let the deserving people to die. Except young prince ofc. But TBH I AM NOT SATISFIED because Yeon-seo. was only given a few minutes to enjoy her new life as a girl. Grr. I was actually waiting for more few eps of her as a girl!!! Huhuhu

I realized, so the writer intentionally made the ML be great at curing sick people because of the ending.

For me, the writer carefully planned the flow of the story, and the director executed it well together with the actors. Given that this is a HEAVY DRAMA. Each character has its own persona and they all stick to it until the end. They became consistent with the character development. Plus the great acting skills of all the cast! Kudos to all the team.

Some people might not be able to appreciate this, but I would like to let you know, I am happy I watched this drama. No regrets.

Court Lady Kim, Bok Dong, Ga on, Hyun, all these supporting cast and all other cast acting were exceptional and I highly appreciate thier hardwork for this drama.

I hope to see them to another drama again, especially my personal bodyguard Kim Ga-On. Hahaha

easy to binge and not take so seriously
I think if you stop wishing for this to be something it's not (an 80 episode political sageuk epic or a fully comedic fusion where bad things don't happen to any character and no one dies... it's neither) and just accept it for what it is which is a somewhat lighthearted somewhat serious sageuk with a romantic focus, interesting character interactions, a constant looming danger of discovery, and some bloody consequences... it's a lot more fun... and if the actors had been less talented it wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable as it is (Park Eun Bin in particular is great)

this drama also taught me to never raise my sword to slash at someone because someone will stop me with an arrow or by coming out of thin air 95% of the time lol

Not enough story for 20 episodes
At the beginning, this drama actually made me look forward to Mondays so much. On my watchlist, I had this drama at a perfect 10/10 star rating for about ten episodes until it started getting ridiculously repetitive and the plot felt very dragged out. Overall, the story was great with amazing characters, cinematography (those color palettes!), and romance. Unlike Lovers of the Red Sky, their love story felt very organic and well-paced. As the drama progressed, the focus naturally shifted away from romance and became more about court politics and family drama (in typical sageuk fashion) and while this was not as interesting to me (as someone who lives and breathes rom com), I saw it coming and expected something like that from a historical, anyway. It was fine. Until the love line also got needlessly angsty. These two literally spent the better two thirds of the drama trying to figure out if they should or shouldn’t be together. The same problems kept arising over and over again but were dressed up as slightly different issues. The political story also got quite stale and followed the format “let’s go investigate something, have lots of fruitless dialogue about that thing, and kill a bunch of people.” This is the main reason why I dislike anything action, but I digress. In the last couple episodes, I also became an avid hater of Dami, something I never thought would happen. Her hero complex and suicidal tendencies disguised as selflessness got incredibly out of control, and it was hard to root for a character who was so hopelessly throwing herself at danger and calling it self-sacrifice that I just wanted her to die at the end and have the drama be a tragedy. The lie she told Jun Ji Un (that I won’t spoil) before doing something unforgivable (at least in my opinion) was something that I wished he would hold against her. It was such a majorly fucked up thing to do that I completely stopped rooting for her at the end. Despite my hundreds of complaints, this drama did bring many good things to the table, and I absolutely adored the male lead from beginning to the end. I’d still recommend the drama to anyone that has some spare time, but just be prepared to use that speed-up button if you’re impatient like me.

What a beautiful epic
I have to admit right from the start I loved this series. Great story, stunning performances by all of the actors involved and chemistry between the leads that was as moving as it was passionate. The costumes were beautiful and the action scenes were virtually nonstop so that to me the pace never faltered. The music was well placed and catchy to the point that I found myself humming it in the car. Would I watch it again? Most definitely. Would I recommend this drama? In a heartbeat, it was just that good. Do yourself a favour and watch it too. You won’t be sorry.

love, loyalty, politics, power and greed
This is truly one of the best I've ever watched. First, amidst the historical portrayal of societal prejudice against women in power, the heroine's persona is an epitome of someone who had proven this preconceived notion of weakness attached to women otherwise. Secondly, the story depicts how true love transcends beyond gender and status. Although this type of unconventional relationship is a deal-breaker to a male dominated culture and era, the plot was carefully elucidated in a realistic multi-angular lens.

The story shows how power corrupts the minds of some, but brings out the best in others.

The cuteness of the cast is overwhelming. The soundtrack is phenomenal.

Great Casting
One thing I can say about Kdramas is that more often than not, they manage to cast actors and actresses with great onscreen chemistry. Everytime I doubt a pairing, i end up wrong. This is one example.

The King's Affection was a joy to watch, in my opinion. I was watching this simultaneously with a Queen for Seven Days; and while the stories were different, QFSD was a bit dragging for me. TKA's cast did an amazing job of bringing their characters to life; even the secondary ones.

I cannot wait to see more of these actors in future projects

amazing drama full of excitement, romance, betrayal, friendship and more
I just finished and what an exciting drama and below does have spoilers, but only on the outside. The actors and actress were picked to perfection for. the characters they protrayed. I am sorry that a few of them I wished to have seen more of the good ones that were killed off to early and the ones i wanted dead earlier lasted to the last minutes of there lives. I enjoyed the storyline of twin's being born in the palace and according to King it would cause an abomination that a boy/girl shared the same womb(what a load if s**t). The Crown prince begged the king to keep her, and but the princess own father the left state chancellor ordered that the baby girl and everyone that knew of the twins killed immediately to hide the secret. The crown prince followed orders and disquarded his wife's request to keep her alive and so the doctor did acupuncture which made the baby appear dead for her father eyes. Then she had Yoon the CP Hyejong's bodyguard and her friend to take the girl out and leave it at the ministry door and hopefully she will have a better life. The princess has a hard life as the ministry closed down and Dam-I found herself homeless and then at the age of 11 becomes a palace maid and loving it and her new friends. When she meets ji woon in her hideaway hidden and they become close friends(each others 1st love) until someone states that she looks like the CP. The princess has Courtlady park investigate and bring the girl to her as she is happy she is alive and sad because she ended up in the Palace after all. The CP also learns of her and has her switch places with him a few times so he can go out and play until his grandfather finds out and send his henchmen to kill her, but by mistake they kills the prince. The princess now explains to Dam-I that she is a twin and her dtr. and wants to send her out again, but learns the CP was killed in her place and now she has to learn to be a boy and CP. This is now her adventure as the CP and a girl watching all the horrible things and corrupt people around her, but due to her GF she is made a puppet against her will to save everyone she care for. This goes on for years and her father had learned that the CP was actually his dtr when his wife was dying and so he trunk caded a charge and had the CP removed and sent out with Yoon and a dress & letter asking to be forgiven and her to be a girl. She meets up with Ji woon after being hunted and hurt he finds outs she a women and the beginning of there relationship. Unfortunately the GF disagree and kills the king and brings the CP back making him the king under his control again(still doesn't know she a girl). There story continues and she starts to fight back so please watch as it's so exciting and sad till the very end. A great Drama and if you live Rowoon like me it's an extra bonus.. Enjoy 🙂

Decision is yours to watch or not.....
I'm writing this article wishing this will help you to take a proper decision whether to watch or not.
According to comments and other articles most of them writes that this drama is boring waste of time of watching.
In my opinion the drama has few faults in the middle episodes but the ending is wroth watching. At the beginning the drama start with dark plot where most people sacrifice there lives, so on later when the girl who becomes the crown prince with the hidden identity is very strong and cold hearted with lack of trust with people(another reason to watch the drama for the main female lead who is strong and shows her power). The other reason is Main male who is clumsy, smart and also strong which makes the story more brighter.
There are lot of crying, laughing, curiosity and anger emotions I went through while watching this drama.
Each and every episode is intense to watch for me, but some few episodes were there which was story line flopped, it was because the writer took the scenes very slow and made the last two episodes in rush which made the viewers to drop the drama.
Well all the episodes are available, so the struggle to wait for Monday will not exist now. It is easy to binge watch for you guys.
The story main idea is:
- why can't a girl have power and right live?
- how to trust someone?

GIVE IT A TRY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO THE ACTORS WON'T DISSAPOINT YOU :)

A Misnomer
Judging from the title, I expected a king who was ambitious and selfless willing to sacrifice personal desires. But no, the MC can't even protect herself even after training several years, falls down by just a poke, nor she is caring for public and the people who sacrificed themselves for her. It's okay if MC didn't care about her position but how wonderful this story would have been if she actually did. How cool it would have been if she had been like Zhan Duoduo of Joy of Life or Queen Rudrama Devi.
Had I been warned that this is not about a king but a person with identity crisis then I might have skipped on this one.

The Affection part is an eyesore as well. Imagine forbidden love but no my heart didn't flutter. Childhood connection is so overused now. Except for the hunting ground intro scene, much of the romance was so-so.

About the storyline, much time is wasted in childhood storyline and palace schemes part is nothing special either. It was so draggy, predictable and cliched. There are better political dramas to watch than this.

But then the drama was so perfect it had good cast, good production, good music which was an earworm but without tighter plotline nothing can save this mess.

A drama with an identity crisis
OVERALL
Mmm...Skip, unless you're bored.

THE STORY
This drama is weirrrdddd. It's like someone wanted to produce a BL but was asked to produce a straight love story, so they decided to do something in between...and failed. The drama never really addresses the fact that Female lead basically lives like a guy, but at the same time, never addresses the fact that she's actually a girl. It's just SO weirrrrrddd. You can't make a gender-bending drama without addressing gender! What's the point? haha

On the good side, if you can not care too much about the romance, the political intrigue is interesting, enough to keep you watching until the end (even if not really hooked). On the negative side, the melodramatic, messy romance is basically 70% of the drama so it's a bit hard to ignore haha

THE ACTING
Good, I guess. Not much chemistry between the leads, from what I could tell, but it's not bad enough.

THE MUSIC
No comment.

REWATCH VALUE
Very low.

A cute storyline with a well-written ending that did not have many loopholes. Honestly, I really enjoyed the storyline and characters this drama had to offer, especially when the audience learns more in depths about the motivations of the characters. The role reversals were well done - I love how assertive the female character is (albeit she is dressing like a man and is the crown prince/king). I love how the ""childhood lovers"" trope was not the only thing that tied the two main characters together. Overall a satisfying drama that I'd recommend.

Traditional costume romance w/ really dark undertone.
I love the backstory, although it was the typical formula: ML and FL met while they were young, lost contact, met again as different person's. From adversary's, to friends, to lovers.

Even though this was supposedly a traditional costume romance, it has a really dark undertone. The story got a little draggy at some parts that I had skipped. Still, I managed to push through.. Glad the writers gave FL a happy ending that she deserves.

Good chemistry between the actors, even the young ones did good. This is not the first show who did the cross dressing as a major aspect of the show, but they did good. Not as awkward as other show I've seen.

Okay, despite the bad reviews I've seen, let me tell you this.
I think the genre most fitted to Yeonmo is royalty and slice of life, with maybe a bit of drama.
We are shown how life is at the palace, how a young royal live their life against the harsh palace and grow up to be a benevolent and wise leader. It is serene, graceful, sometimes intense and filled with delicate schemes.
The cinematography and coloring is exceptional. Yeonmo uses a lot of flower and tree sceneries, bright and warm colors, and takes up a rather slow pace. A lot of the actors and actresses are young and new talents, but their characterization and chemistry are so good on and off camera! It's really refreshing to see.

Also! This is one of the dramas that portrays the purest definition of love. I absolutely loved it, you have to watch and see for yourself.

That being said, I think this drama is best watched one episode or two at a time, not to binge. There are minimal violence, I think, and no adult scenes (if you exclude kiss scenes which every K-drama have). Totally recommended!

This was awesome, the perfect drama for Xmas time: funny, sweet, romantic, intriguing, the whole package. I admit, my main interest in this was Rowoon as Jung Ji Woon but I was also glad to discover Choi Byung Chan and through him Victon! Nice!

My favorite thing was that for a big part of this drama, many of the characters actually really thought that Lee Hwi was a man. Jung Ji Woon when he fell in love with her among them. After some initial bi panic, he just went with it. Or Shin So Eun, when she realized that Ji Woon was in love with the king - there was no horror or disgust, she was just sad that he loved another. The overall reaction was mostly ""you love someone else, not me"" and not ""you love a man"" which honestly hit the right spot with me.

Also, poor Ji Woon's father, a killer that he was, mind you. The crisis that he went through, just imagine it. First, he finds out that his son is the king's beloved - a shock in itself - followed by the fact that his son is the king's beloved! What must've gone through his head... ""Either my son is into men... or I made a serious blunder 10 years ago!"" Ha!

Wonderful drama. It really, truly hit the right spot. Lovely...

King of Crossdressing Dramas
Finally, a crossdressing drama where the actress playing a man is actually believable as a man. I've seen quite the amount of crossdressing dramas and 99% of the time it's just a female in male style, but Park Eunbin is that 1%. From the stance, voice, expressions, down to the mannerisms, she perfectly embodies the role. At the same time, the drama doesn't pretend like she's a perfect male. They acknowledge that the prince is feminine. They showed the fl naturally developed manly gestures but she can't help but be feminine. It fits to the narrative that no matter how hard she tries, she can't hide her feminine qualities that would eventually lead to suspicions and finally to being discovered/revealed. And Park Eunbin understood the assignment. She effortlessly shifts between two different identities while depicting the fear, pain and grief that both characters hold. She did great portraying the prince and princess both physically and emotionally. I have nothing but praise for her.

As a historical drama, fl is strong, smart and the hero that drives the plot. Most fl's are not as privileged as they are usually just the love interest that every male character likes or a damsel in distress that everyone has to save. Here the fl has the higher status and is in a position to be involved in political matters as a crown prince turned king. And this is also one of the rare sageuk where the king's children aren't scheming, fighting or killing each other for the crown.

As a romance drama, Park Eunbin and Rowoon as the leads have good chemistry and the reverse cliché was very entertaining. The ml being good with books, medicine and gardening, while the fl being great at hunting, fighting and swimming. The leads work so well both in romantic scenes and comedic ones. So the romantic and comedic scenes are actually sweet and funny, not cringey. The fl being the hero and the ml as the love interest was refreshing.

Lastly, I love the things they kept from the webtoon and the things they changed for the drama. The death of the real crown prince, someone everyone wanted to protect being the one who ended up dead, was ironic. The highlight of the drama, the reveal of the secret was tastefully done. And the ending, it was proper and clearer than the webtoon. It wrapped up well.

Overall, despite my initial doubts because 5/6 of the mains are newbies, this turned out to be my favorite from kdramaland this year. Park Eunbin's acting alone makes this drama worth watching. Her 25 years of experience was evident. It was good to have her back in a historical drama, and Yeonmo was definitely worth the wait. Long live the King!

Love the women empowerment yet a little slow
If you're looking for a drama with historical background with a poetic touch, beautiful costumes, a fight to reform the old conservative mindset and a hint of action? This drama is perfect for you.
Its a little slow but it fits all the 20 episodes perfectly. What pulled my attention was the costume design and the details put into each were just so refreshing and totally seem as if a lot of thought was put into it. The drama is visually and aurally mesmerizing but the storyline isn't that impressive. There were a lot of situations where i could predict easily.

However what pulled me towards this to watch every was the amazing performance of Park Eun bin. Her character involved a lot of emotional burden and she executed it perfectly and definitely expressed that women are capable to do anything.
Yes I watched this because of Rowoon but the romantic plot didn't really catch my attention.
Okay but I fell in love with Choi Byung Chan though (He's one of the reasons that I dont regret watching this XD)

Hence I would say if you just want to pass time, feel some action and inspiration, maybe a little bit of comedy and a cultural history of korea you can give it a watch!

overall view of the drama
The theme of this drama is about love, so ideally it should run at 16 episodes with a saeguk genre. With two 20-ep saeguk drama this year, I don't know how KBS is going to present the year-end awards. Problem with the king’s affection, to me, is the production. If they change or add characters from the manhwa, they might as well modify the storyline. The first 2 episodes are excellent, and it started getting slow and repetitive in the middle. I’ve lost count on the number of repetitive lovey-dovey scenes(memories). If they doing a 20-ep drama, the production team could build up a plot on bringing down the evil grandfather which would be very interesting. They are lucky that they have Park Eun Bin to hold up the drama with her acting. Her chemistry with Rowoon is the main attraction that draws audience into the drama. If the viewers cry with them, then they are doing a good job in playing out their characters. I didn’t watch Rowoon’s works but I heard good reviews about him, and I am impressed as a new actor he acts very well with his eyes and his voice. Saeguk drama can be quite restrictive in expressing emotions and that can be a test for the actors/actresses. I remember years ago, kim soo hyun in embracing moon, he also acted very well with his voice. I do hope Rowoon will become a versatile actor as I see that he has a lot of potentials. At least, he doesn’t play safe and picks up the idol-style dramas! And, I am very looking forward to Park Eun Bin’s next drama playing an autistic lawyer!

The King's Affection?
I'm sure the title was something different in Korea. It's not as fitting to the show: The King's Secret, The King's Throne, The King. There are so many other titles, but I digress on the header. There are similar role-play surprises and innuendos regarding sex (male/female). The show is a plus for the gender-fluid community, for sure. It's not as funny as Mr. Queen and possibly more grey, but it's worth a shot watching.

I added Mr. Queen as a recommendation, but it was removed. Go figure.

WHY DID THE STORYLINE CHANGE AFTER EPISODE 4?
The drama is good, but since the drama started off so strong, and with a focus on politics in the monarch, I was expecting the storyline to move that way but it totally flipped around. WHY DID THE STORYLINE CHANGE AFTER EPISODE 4? =/

Before reaching episode 5 I wondered why the reviews for this drama was so low because the first 4 episodes are worthy of a rating of a 10. However, after episode 4, the storyline turns from political to romance. However, the romance was not as well crafted as it could have been. Don't get me wrong, it's good but just not great. It is full of common tropes, and slow motion side effects when the female and male lead just so happen to mistakenly find one another in each other arms. Note: After episode 6, it recovers and is back to being great again!

Btw, the female lead actress did a wonderful job acting. The second male lead (Mr. Dimples) is super cute!

Okay, I'm back with an update after watching episodes 7 and 8 and the political part of this drama is good but the romance scenes are horrible. I don't think the writers and director did a good job at trying to convince me that the romance in this drama could work; they should have stuck to a political historical drama without romance. I have to lower my rating from a 9.0 to a 7.5.

This is a great romantic historical drama where the leading couple has very good chemistry and well delivered romantic scenes. Although there are several other people leading into love triangles, it was great that not a single one of them turned out to be selfish and destructive toward the leading couple. The story is interesting with a good number of antagonists. Even that the storyline was about the affections of the King (Lee Hwi / Dam Yi), especially toward her beloved Jung Ji Woon, the King excelled in making righteous and calculated judgments toward those that lived their lives carrying out injustices for their personal gains, and Jung Ji Woo was equally ethical. The cast did a very good job delivering their characters but I must stressed that Park Eun Bin excelled on her portrayal of both the male and female characters that she played; also there is Yoon Je Moon, who marvelously portrayed the lead antagonist Han Ki Jae(Left State Councilor), the master conniver; and last but not least, Bae Soo Bin as Jung Seok Jo [Ji Woon's father], Han Ki Jae’s borrowed sword with a very conflicting personality that did all the wrong things in order to keep his family safe. . Overall, this drama is very entertaining, apart from a good storyline, it also has a beautiful and steadfast romance, good performances, beautiful costumes, good actions scenes, and great cinematography. Enjoy it!

Perfection!
Please don’t listen to the reviews saying it’s dragging and too slow-paced. I am very glad I didn’t look at any reviews before I started watching because I might’ve passed on a drama that is now one of my absolute favorites.

It wasn’t too slow or too long at all! I was glued to the screen for every second of these 20 episodes and binged the whole thing in two days, with only one break for a few hours of sleep.

I generally love the crossdressing trope but I think it is only done right, when the other characters don’t find out for a long time, which this drama did perfectly. I have seen a few shows where the love interest found out way too soon, which takes away the whole thrill of the trope. The King’s Affection does an amazing job at keeping up the thrill and only slowly revealing parts of the truth. The characters are all well-written and three-dimensional and make you care for them and worry about their fate, so no scene feels like a bore or filler. Even with the length of 20 episodes, it never felt like it dragged on for too long. It was exactly the right amount of time needed to tell this beautiful story.

Park Eun Bin did an exceptionally great job, portraying the Crown Prince. I love that the writers made Dami become a fierce, badass Prince instead of a damsel-in-distress trying to pose as a man. The way she acted and held herself made her the most believable man I’ve seen in a crossdressing drama or movie. I’ve seen some people say she looks way too feminine to pass as a man, which I find funny cause I could list at least 6 idols who could pass as a woman and fool everyone, so why is it so unbelievable that a man could have her features? Effeminate men exist.

I really fell in love with the whole cast, but especially Nam Yoon Su, who played Hyun - his fate was the one I was most anxious about because he was just so charming.
And of course, the child actors also did an amazing job, especially Choi Myung Bin in her double role.

There are quite a few parallels to Sungkyunkwan Scandal but it didn’t bother me. Both dramas are amazing.

Seriously, please give this a watch, it’s amazing.

""The King's Affection"" is a historical romance drama that managed to win my affection. I came to admire and adore the main-characters and the supporting characters. The first two episodes were really strong and the latter 10 episodes managed to keep my interest going but i had to put it on-hold after ep 14 because things were really dragging after that and the writing was nowhere superior to how it was in the earlier episodes. But i picked it up again after a few months and finished the last episodes on Netflix. It has all the tropes i love but didn`t manage to make a perfect story out of it but it was good anyway. Yeon Seon is a admirable heroine who was a victim in this whole story that get forced to take on her dead twin-brothers throne. I just adore her two servants who always stood by her side and protected her. Then we have the absolutely fearless but vulnerable hero Jung who stood for what is right. He couldn`t accept nor condone what his father had done and what he stands for. It really took a toll on him mentally while growing up but he still stayed strong in his beliefs and managed to grow up into such a great man- deserving of our beloved heroine Yeon Seon. I love how he dearly comes to love her while still thinking she is a Male Prince. He loved her when he was a boy and he falls in love with her again as a man. I rooted for Jung and Yeon Seon with all my heart, wishing their happy ever after.

Promising start but lack of storyline. Could be wrapped up within 12 episodes.
Started as a very different , high pitched plot but drops it's pace at the middle. Too many unnecessary hilarious moments given to the main lead.
At some point u could think it should have become a romantic comedy rather than a historical drama.
Growth of the 2nd male lead was very slow.
The queen could play a better role to help the disguised king to take the revenge .
Too much unrealistic conspiracy theory.

All the supporting roles were placed & played beautifully . That's the only thing I liked about the story.

It could be a drama as good as mr queen , but ended up disappointing me. It needed to end between 12-16 episode. Too much length made it more boring.

Things to like- the cast.
Among all The gender blending dramas, this one's female acting as male was very much convincing.

Ost was good .

Rowoon really caught my attention ❤️

Will i rewatch ?? Nope....

I actually love this drama! I've accepted long ago that Korean dramas will insert their love for draggy and boring political intrigues right in the second half of their drama series. Once I accepted that phenomenon, it's smooth sailing from there hahahaha.

As per usual in most dramas, the childhood arc is quite impressive, both in acting (except for the kid who played the ML) and pace.

Eun Bin is so so good in her role, she's like fairy when she's a girl and a very capable crown prince once she cross dresses. The moments where she's breaking down, and the ones where her princely training shines forth are all superb. A round of applause for her.

Rowoon is a fun ML, however I felt like there's a huge disconnect between the young Jung Ji Woon and the grown up Jung Ji Woon. I can't exactly pinpoint what it is. But for Rowoon's performance and character plot, I'm quite satisfied. I also appreciate that he fell for Crown Prince Lee Hwi first before he learned her secret.

I saw some disappointed comments on the ending. But personally, I believe they concluded their arcs cleanly. Sometimes just because you're good at something doesn't necessarily mean it will be the best choice for you nor does it certify your fulfillment. I like how it was all arranged in the end and our Main Leads finally got the normal happy life they've dreamed for so long.

Good ending to a well produced drama
This new drama had wonderful production which compelled me to finish the drama despite not fully buying into the FL transformation to a male.

The story line was good and the ending well paced. Lots of attention to detail on the costumes and the setting was very realistic. It had your usual love triangles, plotting and revenge but was tastefully done.

Although the acting was good, I did not find myself drawn to the ML and FL like I did for the previous drama I watched, ie Rookie Historian.

Watch this if you like palace dramas with intrigue.

Awesome Movie!
This this movie is the best movie that I have ever seen in a long long long time. The actors were fantastic, the cast and the crew. This movie really moved me. Rowoon and Park Eu Bin are great actors and they have really brought meaning and emotional feeling to this movie. I would love to see more of this kind of movie with those two actors they were great. With all of the episodes, it truly makes you not want to leave you Television set! Rowoon really stole my emotional heart! Keep up the good work!

Started out strong then it lost its momentum, but gave us a happily ever after at the end of it all.
This show started out strong and exciting. The moment the twin brother was killed and the girl became the Crown Prince, I was hooked and committed. Bring it on, I was really into it.

I liked the main plot. I am into hidden identities, cross dressing, forbidden love, politics and war. I lap those tropes up. I didn’t care much about the childhood sweethearts connection. It was great first 15 episodes.. then it sort of lost its way then fizzled out until the last episode.

The FL actually did a good job, but you can never ever convince me that she is male. But anyway, that’s neither here nor there. It was an okay portrayal, I just didn’t think she had much going on with the ML. Now, let’s talk about the ML. I think I am biased to say, that I wish he was not a scholar or physician but rather the bodyguard. I think in the manhua, the ML is the bodyguard or soldier. It was just an injustice to his character. He was always this useless, weak character that can’t do much for the King. It is quite annoying to watch. If he wasn’t her teacher then her secretary and rather some badass character, I think it could have been better… although I think another actor will be suitable for this…Then Roowon, I am sorry to say was rather bland in his portrayal. He has mastered the look of hopelessness.

I love the secondary characters, or what I think of as her “harem”. The cousin Prince Hyun and Eunsoo, the most beautiful bodyguard in the face of the Joseon era. Eunsoo, what another injustice, not much screen time and I just wished he got more parts into the story. To be honest, these two guys had more going on for them with the FL than the actual ML.

I was actually satisfied with the ending, not because the FL and ML got their happily ever after, but Prince Hyun becoming King. If there was one outcome I was hoping for this was it. Oh, and I need this hot bodyguard to have his own show.

All in all, it was a steady and okay watch.

Overly cheesy bits didn't fit
The cast and acting made this drama, more than a story that was intriguing, but peppered with scenes that made me sigh (not in a good way).
The child actors who set the stage in the early episodes, were excellent, especially Choi Myung-bin, who in effect had to play 3 different characters.
There are some very bloodthirsty scenes in amongst the saccharin and the speed with which that changes, results in the odd case of whiplash!
There are moving moments as well, two in particular, near the start, got me. I was actually shocked by some of it, especially when they go hand-in-hand with the aforementioned cheese.
The story in itself is good and pulled me in. It's hard to find a female actress who can convincingly play a young man, but I thought Park Eun-bin did well. She didn't try to be macho, instead playing it reserved, stoic and frosty. It wouldn't be impossible to believe, there are after all, effeminate men (and that does not equal gay). Back then few got close, so I chose to go with it.
What that character goes through is awful really. Dreadful royal family under the thumb of one particular member, who takes the prize for best human without a heart. Surrounding characters are a mixture of funny, scary, torn, mysterious, cowardly and barking.
What I disliked, however, were the awful slow-mo scenes of falling into arms, pulling into arms, meaningful stares and hand holds, backed with whooshing music. The terribly overdone squeezing of clothing and clenching of fists, is in there [often] too.
PEB's chemistry with Rowoon was ok, but wasn't electric.
I liked how he portrayed his character, although my 2 favourites were Nam Yoon-su as Prince Lee Hyun and Choi Byung-chan as the mysterious Kim Ga-on.
There was a lot of action, yet I didn't feel the threat that should have come across in more scenes, as there were few build-ups.
The ending fit where the story wanted to go, but I thought it a tad far fetched, even for this plot. It wasn't awful though. I did enjoy the final scenes of the last episode.
It's a mixed watch; not riveting, but by no means awful either.

Good, but slow
Production, acting and OST were mostly good.

In terms of acting, I must say Choi Myung Bin, the girl who plays young Lee Hwi and young Dam Yi, was amazing! I believe she has a bright future as an actress.
Also, actors Park Eun Bin, Bae Yoon Kyung, Jung Chae Yeon, Yoon Je Moon, Baek Hyun Joo, Kim Jae Chul, Bae Soo Bin, Kim Taek... They were all great!

I believe the story could be told in way less than 20 episodes, though. It is an interesting story, unpredictable and made me very curious. Romance and friendships were sweet and heart-warming for the most part. Family relationships were also interesting.

There were too many flashbacks, slow motion scenes (romance parts) and the fight scenes were very, very repetitive.

Overall, I enjoyed watching this show! It's not for everyone though, it really requires patience.

well-written story and great acting!
Ngl I went into this thinking it was gonna be boring asf and hard to follow but I liked this show way more than I had anticipated. I avoid historical dramas like the plague but I watched this because a friend recommended it and I thought my mom would like it and decided to watch along with her. And I gotta admit, I like the show WAY more than I anticipated and I would actually consider rewatching this in the future. The plot is undoubtedly the strongest element of this show. The first two episodes are easily the strongest ones. The child actors who played young Hwi and Dani were really good. They absolutely deserve a shout-out.

CHARACTERS - Park Eunbin undoubtedly had the hardest job out of the entire cast. She plays both the Crown Prince Hwi and Dami, but she does both personas well. I didn’t think she’d be able to play a man but she was believable enough. I think a part of it is because approaches the role with a regal aura which contributed to how well she portrayed her role. There were times when she clearly sounded feminine and was seen looking like a woman but if her secret identity was found out early there would be no story. Even so, I still think it was kinda dragged out, and as expected, there were multiple times where Dami's identity should've been revealed. PEB also portrayed the torture and anguish of being trapped in someone else's life so beautifully. Now unto Rowoon. He was better than I expected. Especially with the emotional scenes, even though he could still improve. For an idol actor, he actually did a decent job. Nam Yoon Su was also good. Not my favorite side character that he played but he was cute for sure. I like the support he portrayed towards Prince Hwi. I also absolutely love the guy who played the grandpa. He was a trip! But he was very entertaining to watch.

Overall this was a very satisfactory watch. It also may have some replay value for me. I’d definitely recommend this show if you love historical dramas or as a show to watch in between shows.

One thing this drama sets up to do is that it's story is quite simple, it never tries to fall into other drama's gimmicks, like amnesia, moving the plot forward by years, really complicated plots that go nowhere.

In that sense you won't get any BIG reveal, but you will get satisfaction of watching the story unfold.

The acting from all the character is pretty solid, and our main character gets really well treated, and she always delivers.

Apart from that, the story does suffer some twists and turns and it ends up being really confusing. But I applaud them for their simplicity.

Please watch this, I didn’t want it to end.
This was so addictive, I was clinging onto Netflix waiting for the next episode, then I knew once it was needed I had to wait a whole week till it was back. The music is so beautiful I am in the process of learning then in Korean, which is quite a feat as I am English. It stays in your memory long after it finished. I actually missed the actors.
It keeps you on the edge of your seat. An in the end well I was crying my eyes out because it had ended, and because of the story. It twist and turns till you have no idea how it’s going to end. At one point I think I forgot to breathe.
The costumes are stunning, whoever made them needed an award. Made me laugh, cry, smile and utterly sob, so much that I went on a zoom meeting when this episode aired and I couldn’t speak for crying, they thought something dreadful for real had happened.
Watch this drama you won’t be disappointed.

Should have been 16 episodes!?
I read some other reviews that said it gets dragged and I have to agree! It gets dragged to the point you want to drop it. I personally dropped it for almost a month and decided to finish it today because I had 5 episodes left. I managed to finish it because I put the speed on 1.5x otherwise I would have dropped it completely.

I'm actually dissapointed because I was excited about this drama from the 1st episode. The story is good but 20 episodes are too much, there are many fillers with some side characters, I personally wanted more romance between the main leads I would love more scenes of their ""forbiden love"". There are also many scenes that are in slow motion which gets annoying.
I really like Rowoon and Eunbin and their chemistry was good but I left with the feeling I didn't see much together. Eunbin's acting was excellent btw.

Overall only the first and last 3 episodes are the best but if you like historical dramas you might like all episodes, it's not a bad drama.

Had potential till it didn't
I loved it so much and then it just went for too long and became far too political. Disappointing.

Ost is great, got the good feels

ML is hot and just so good (loved him since Extraordinary You), he was adorable and so cuteeeee and sweet.. FL convincing as a male.. loved the reversed gender roles. I applaud them for writing this so either male or female works playing the roles!!

But why 20 EPs, you could have finished by 16 sigh...

I only finished because I really wanted to see the ML smile and be happy..

Interesting premise, no tension or momentum.

Many Joseon era dramas these days feel like they are just recycled over and over again. It's a shame as I enjoy the dramatic situations available to historical romances, and due to the premise I was willing to give this show a chance.

The scenario that the woman is in the 'high power position' compared to the man is refreshing. But, it doesn't result in more tension or difference in dynamic compared to your standard gender bending (changing clothes, bathing etc.). There's lots that could be done to truly flip your expectations, but so far not much has happened.

Six episodes in, we are still at the show synopsis stage. You could read the summary, pick up at episode six and know exactly what is going on. There's now been episode after episode of long looks, and speculative glances with no real character development or real dramatic tension.

This is a competent effort, but does not add anything new to the genre. At this stage I couldn't figure out a reason to continue watching.

Simply boring
Yes, I forced myself to watch till episode 19 but still gave up in the end and dropped the drama. This is another drama that honestly made me feel as though I just got cheated. The plot seemed interesting, the storyline has a lot of potential but for some reason, the execution just fail terribly.

They could go on for episodes, just achieving nothing. There is no excitement at all. The romance is boring, the lead characters are not at all interesting. They don't even stand out.

Definitely do not recommend this drama.

Great one and time worthy to watch
Seriously I don't like historical theme dramas but because of rowoon I watched 2 episodes and now I can't wait to see the next episodes they were really great also the OST was so soothing rowoon really did the great jon and also the casting of child actors representing the younger version were so on point that I kinda felt that these actors will definately be look alike of each other in near future. Time worthy please watch it. Also the storyline is great and kinda uniqoeyso Im hoping that it'll grew more interesting on future episodes so I'm really satisfied with the series and will follow it till the end

Had me so hooked!
I hate historical dramas and by hate, I mean I have never fully finished one but this show had me so hooked from the first episode. I have only watched 2 episodes so far but its so good. They did such a good job with the casting because the FL is so pretty and the ML is so fine. I will surely be watching all eps of this drama. Netflix is doing a really good job with the kdramas that they've been putting out lately. I really recommend that you give it a try. I really think I won't be disappointed with the show. Every aspect about it is so interesting & I also like how the side characters have a huge impact on the overall plot.

Characters have new story to tell that will spice your interest
Well, the actors are really interesting since they have new roles to portray far for previous acting. It's visual is admiring and chemistry even for young roles is indeed nice. The OST also complements and creates wholesome mood. The flow of the story is clear and logical which fascinates the viewer to watch more and look forward for next twist. I am a fan of SF9 Rowoon, so I will definitely support this since he is becoming good in acting with a great actress Park Eunbin. This story triggers my interest on how it will run and end.

This is still a maybe for me, but concerned
So I’m going to be honest and withhold judgment for the moment and give it a chance to grow on me. I will admit the kids are charming. I’m so early in the series, I haven’t even seen them morph into adults yet. But, I will say that even though I know it’s a “fantasy” set an unnamed but concrete Joseon time period, the modern anachronisms are so jarring that they pull you out of the story. You end up thinking, “that’s impossible, never would have happened,” instead of just enjoying the show. And it’s only the first episode
