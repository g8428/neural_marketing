       "\"The Most Formidable Bromance of  that will bring you to your knees\\r\\nWhere do I even begin? This is the best detective thriller drama I have ever watched. There, I said it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many of you have grown tired of watching crime shows that just don't feel exciting anymore?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many times, crime dramas get lost in the 'next big moment' and finding the thrill factor that they stop connecting with the watcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond Evil is a beautiful mix of emotion and supense. It's a blend of heartbreakingly slow, full of feeling moments and bone chilling darkness. It's not a super fast show. It takes its time as it unravels, develops and comes to fruition gorgeously- like a well simmered pot of stew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drama's biggest strength is its unforgettable characters and the mindblowing acting by the cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning it induces your trust issues in a gut punching manner by introducing its two seemingly morally grey and unreliable protagonists and then slowly but surely brings to light one of the best friendships the Korean cinema has ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the main leads are phenomenal, each holding their own and being a massive force to be reckoned with.\\r\\n\\r\\nShin Ha Kyun put out acting worthy of a Daesang. His reckless, passionate, wildly fearless and courageous detective with the biggest smile and eyes full of pain doesn't take long to cement his place in your heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeo Jin Goo, on the other hand, while young, owned his role phenomenally. His character Han Joo Won, a prickly, seemingly cold catlike man with heart of platinum and a strong sense of justice is extremely easy to fawn over.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, these two are a storm- infinitely badass with balls of steel; a dynamic team that you can't help but fall in love in with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the two, all the supporting characters bring their own flavour to the screen. While their little self-proclaimed 'Avengers' police team brings instant warmth to your heart, the antagonists are blood boiling-ly good in equal measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music is fantastic- sombre and dark at times; sometimes cheeky and playful and other times enough to wreck you. There are a lot of stunning shots and the drama is both extremely well written and directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character development is amazing and the bonds these characters form among each other is a powerful thing to witness. There's so much nuance in these relationships and it's hard not to catch feelings and let go of your heart when it comes to a show like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly, for me a good psychological thriller is hard to come by and this was by far one of the best. I was so invested in it that some of the scenes made me bawl my eyes out, while others made me laugh, giggle, swoon and shout HOLY FUCK at the top of my lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey nailed both the emotion and the 'whodunnit' aspect in a way that's very unique to the genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a wild, crazy, full of thrill and heart ride that I almost don't want to get off of.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely, a must-watch. Highly reccomended for fans of psychological thrillers who like their dramas with a little extra oomph!\\r\\nRead More\""
