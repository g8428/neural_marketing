       "[['Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably don\\'t need me to give you this warning. \"Squid Game\" is one of the most incredibly violent things you can watch and it\\'s NOT something you want to let your kids see. And, if your mother or Father O\\'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You\\'ll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you!In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie \"Battle Royale\" or the \"Hunger Games\" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in \"Squid Game\" know what they\\'re in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun\\'s life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He\\'s deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He\\'s ruined his, his wife\\'s and his daughter\\'s lives.When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they\\'ll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn\\'t realize is that by doing this, he\\'s agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn\\'t sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he\\'s with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they\\'re in for with these strangely clad \\'hosts\\'. They are told they\\'re playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it\\'s all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it\\'s a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they\\'d BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they\\'ll die...and die many of them do.After this \\'game\\', about 200 of them were killed. But here\\'s where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it\\'s my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the \"Fargo\" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from \"Hunger Games\" and \"Battle Royale\" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I\\'d only planned on seeing and episode or two.By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars.',\n",
       "  \"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.\",\n",
       "  \"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!\",\n",
       "  \"Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who's physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren't any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents.\",\n",
       "  'Even if you\\'ve seen \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Money Heist\", \"Squid Game\" (called \"Ojing-eo Geim\" in the original Korean) is still going to shock you. The sad thing is that so many people have no other choice but to risk everything like the characters here.Definitely see it. You\\'ll never look at any children\\'s game the same way again after seeing it.',\n",
       "  \"This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.\",\n",
       "  'Everybody has been talking about \"Squid Game.\" I\\'ve been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn\\'t feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don\\'t watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched \"Squid Game\" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it\\'s meh.To me it\\'s a Korean \"Hunger Games.\" I know that there are some big differences, but it\\'s still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we\\'re all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it\\'s a victim of its own hype, but I wasn\\'t that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn\\'t want to be in, but I will say that some of the \\'umph\\' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I\\'ve labeled this spoiler so I\\'ll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it\\'s a dead giveaway that they\\'re going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to \"Squid Game\" I say \"Meh.\" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn\\'t interest me enough. If \"Squid Game\" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would\\'ve been a lot better. That being said, I\\'m committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two.',\n",
       "  \"Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look. Whatever makes international audiences watch K dramas is good. This isn't a typical K drama and far from one of the best. But it's a swift watch.\",\n",
       "  \"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.\",\n",
       "  \"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON ONESeong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****\",\n",

       "  \"Squid Games (2021) is a series my wife and I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows people who choose to play child's games competitively for money that could change their life forever. Shortly after they arrive they discover the price for losing is rather expensive. This series was directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk (The Fortes and My Father) and stars Lee Jung-jae (New World), Park Hae-soo (Time to Hunt), Oh Yeong-su (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring) and Jung Hoyeon (100%: Beat). The storyline for this series is very unique and was a creative spin on similar films like Battle Royale, Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies. The concepts were well thought-out and paced and the characters are very well developed. The storyline and characters evolve well throughout the series. The games and settings are amazing and they used great colors and cinematography to present each scenario. The costumes and props were obviously outstanding as well. My one complaint was the main character who was painfully annoying throughout the series and completely ruined the end for me. The gore and kill scenes in this are unique and very well done. I'd score this series a 7.5/10 and would consider it an absolutely must see.\",\n",

       "  \"Squid Game is no show that hit me that much - I watched a couple of episodes and was rather bored, I would prefer to watch some real MMA fights - more excitement and action going on, and less drama. The first episode dragged on and on and on till the first real action. The second episode was a rather redundant detour of the story. The idea or concept is also nothing really new: Stephen King aka Richard Bachman, The Long Walk and The Running Man, or movies like Battle Royal, The Hunger Games, Death Race, Circle, Cube or 13 and many more precede Squid Game. So what's left? Some nice ideas (the games), some solid action and a sip of blood, but with too much uninteresting filler time. Summa summarum: Not that bad but rather just another hype, just my few cents of course.\",\n",
       "  'Korean Drama \"Squid Game\" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more \\'Korean Drama\\' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.',\n",

The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me.\",\n",

Lovely..\\nEp 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...\\nI finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried...

The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are \\'eliminated\\' is expertly done (episode 6, \"Gganbu\" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the \\'play grounds\\' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets \\'Squid Game\\' apart from similar \\'deadly games\\' series).

The idea of fierce contests with elimination has been utilised before, plus it is hard to maintain a thrill when there are leading performers from the beginning apparently not dying before the end...Underplots are not too elaborate and they tend to \"mince\" the main plot. Luckily, this anti-capitalist idea is not overhanging too much. The number of episodes could be less, but some good twists in the final one elevated the thrill that began to fade away in e.g. Episodes 7 and 8.However, the performances are interesting, so different for the Western ones, how they react and how they depict, with men more versatile though. Lee Jung-jae and O Yeong-su were most to my liking, the latter providing a nice twist towards the end as well...Season 2 might be underway - based on the ending scenes...

If they survive all six games over a six-day period, they\\'ll walk away with a whopping 45.6-billion won (roughly, a little over $38.5 million in U.

I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health.\",\n",

The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of \"actors\" playing the VIPs.

The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn't too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!Overall, it's a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow! The games are creative with their own dark & sinister twist to them! The Show does drag in areas, but is pretty entertaining all the way! Roll on Series 2!7/10.\",\n",
       "  'Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan\\'s Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the \"losers\" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers \"side-hustle\" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the \"real\" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed \"worthless\".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but \"manga\" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I\\'m giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.',\n",
       "  \"I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories.

       "  \"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time.\",\n",
       "  'Review By Kamal KDark portrayals of greed, low self value and distorted view of reality based on the twisted social standards that are rooted in the obsession over money that takes away all the joy of life - all wrapped in a completely unrealistic scenario sprinkled with dark comedy tone, that emphasizes the absurdity of the characters\\' choices and behaviors.The childlike locations and games present a drastic contract to the brutality of the scenarios the characters are facing. The game creators put themselves in the position of innocent keepers of the rules, and any tragic deaths are the fault of the participants for breaking them. No one is forced to participate - you signed your death certificate yourself.Survival in the game and survival in daily life serve as another good contrast - the physical brutality versus the emotional and existential dread. It\\'s more than survival games drama, the true horror is the reality of these people outside of the games and what they can do in the given situation to change it.Blood and murder are this show\\'s best friends, be aware of that before watching. Realistically speaking, this is not some new higher level of gruesome scenes, but they don\\'t shy away from showcasing deaths and accidents.The acting from all the adults was truly amazing. Like in any drama, some roles had more depth and were more demanding than others, but none of the characters felt like an empty placeholder to fill the scene.But then we had the group of foreign actors with such an exaggerated line delivery, I was thinking I\\'d rather mute the screen. Not one of them did a good job. All sounded like licence free sound bites.Any flaws or complaints?Depends on what you are looking for. Do not expect any elaborate death traps and clever tricks - it\\'s far more simple. It is pure survival with technically simple rules and games. You won\\'t wreck your brain trying to understand what is going on, since the plot is rather straightforward with no unexpected plot twists that turn the whole plot upside down.You might want to sit down and analyze the message of the show and what might be the meaning behind. Depending on the viewer it could be a decent kill count watch with a bit of excitement, or a depressing portrayal of collapsing morals and society, as the money sucks all the joy out of our lives.There has also been a random sex scene, and I don\\'t think we needed that \"final\" nail in the coffin - it was clear even without it that people would do anything for survival and money.Some details make exactly zero sense, and I truly mean zero. If you are lucky, you will not notice them at all, since they are less than minor. Squid Game is not exactly free from plot holes, but none of them have a big impact on the story. Some plot lines do hit the dead end though.Overall, it was a brutal drama, yet somehow I found myself laughing at quite a number of scenes. The dark comedy, calling out the hypocrisy - all that was truly amazing. 2/3 of the show was a solid 9.5, and I\\'m a bit frustrated with where the show went after that. Still, quite an enjoyable watch, with interesting set designs, well written characters and some solid thrills. They were able to get me attached to the characters and feel their desperation and pain.',\n",

The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs.

This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special.

Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some \\'Masterpiece\\'. Contrary to popular belief, it\\'s not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn\\'t be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I\\'m leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it.

The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings).\",\n",

       "  \"A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made.\",\n",
       "  \"So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character\\nLee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting Characters\\nThere is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story\\nThe story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script\\nThe script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.Style\\nThe show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.Overall\\nOverall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible.Rating - 9/10.\",\n",
       "  'A great story and sufficient background to get the series started with the pilot episode. But by the 4th eps it\\'s dragging quite a bit and they make a scene ensuring that all the games are of \"fair play\".Two games later they throw out this concept and it\\'s all based on luck instead of skill. Absolutely terrible games of chance.This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers. This needs work.I\\'m sure that there will be a season 2 for this, hopefully with some better talent can help this dude write a better script. Could have been a 9 star series but just got boring and predictable.',\n",

This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of \"we play fair games against each other, based on skill\" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn\\'t completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series.

That show didn't end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now.\",\n",

A double-edged sword.

Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting.

It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life.

       "  \"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out.\",\n",
       "  \"Utterly gripping, engrossing, and devastating, Squid Games hit's a level of tension few other series have. It's not perfect, a little consistent for a single episode, but it is so absorbing at every other moment it seems impossible to mark the series down.Characters are distinct, develop brilliant bonds and each have their own developmental arc. Certain characters show such morality and innocence that investment is put into their stories almost instantly. Backstories are a mixture of tragic and sinister, providing a footing for the audience to base their impressions, but these are twisted and warped so brilliantly throughout that a fully-fleshed out character is always the final product.Acting cannot be faulted, and as a newcomer to Korean TV, all impressions of the actors are fresh. Outbursts of emotion are very explosive, and should be seen and heard in Korean to fully appreciate them.The plot has maybe been played out in various ways in past media, but possibly without such a holistic approach. Down-on-their-luck participants playing life-or-death children's games seems simple, but the execution is perfect due to the building tension. Violence is graphic and intense, but the gore comes in relatively short bursts. The progression of each episode gives the violence such power.One episode in particular is crushing, once a connection has been formed between the audience and each character. The cruelty of each game is paramount, but the reactions within them are devastating.Unfortunately, the most devastating episode is followed by the most disappointing. The introduction of the VIPs is so below the standard of the rest of the characters/series, leaving them out completely and keeping some irritating mystery would have been a lot more satisfying than the lacklustre impact they make. Built on cliches and stuck with terrible dialogue not improved by the acting, it's the one episode that goes against the rest of the series.Having said that, it may have been a necessary evil. It matches with the storyline, but still felt like an addition no one wanted. It cannot detract from the entire series though, everything before is brilliant, everything after saves it again, producing a worthy ending.\",\n",
       "  \"This is the first Korean drama I've watched while I was absolutely blown away.

I can't wait to see what happens in the next series.\",\n",
       "  \"A little too much of an advertised series for my taste. I decided to give it a try anyway, there aren't a lot of episodes anyway. Overall, I have to admit that it is a very good series, the best part of it are some of the characters and how various circumstances and the environment affect them. I was mentally prepared for the violence and the blood so it didn't surprise me, I even thought the violence would be even more pronounced. Of these nine episodes, three were below level for me personally, including an ending I didn't like. There are also a few elements in the series that aren't original because we've seen them before, it's not a new concept of how people fight to the death to win a competition. It is somewhat predictable. That's why everything else in the series is at a very high level, the story, the characters, the mystery, I give it two thumbs up.\",\n",

From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However.

Someone said that is the point, okay, sure, but if so you direct them different and give them less to do and more to the point scenes so their extremely bad acting do not shine through.2) the production value - this is so low budget that I had a good cry at least half a dozen times each episode. Sets are literary falling apart and you can clearly see the bad construction. You can also hear the lousy music, see the bad clothing, the low quality film work etc. Etc. This is like high-school students having a laugh level of production value.3) Cliche and tiresome nonsense - we have seen all of this many, many times before. All done better, with better acting, better production value, better directing, better story and with a lot better social criticism. This is just a bored Korean mixing some of his favourite movies and tv shows together into nonsens while claiming he is doing the world a favour by exposing capitalism... yawn... Perhaps look a bit north you dirty wet sock of a man you.Put the above together with further critique of each episode and you have some boring nonsense no one should care about. Not sure why people do, but people running around with face masks injecting themselves and bending over for the global elite is surely to like anything you put in front of them.

The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral.

The characters all have differing personalities and ideas and motives, making each character likable in their own different ways. There\\'s no such thing as a \"perfect\" character in Squid Game; everybody is trying to win and they\\'ll give up their own morals to survive. This show focuses on the dark sides of humanity, and it doesn\\'t shy away of what people can do to each other, and that\\'s why this show is so refreshing, because we have realistic people doing realistic things.The overall concept of Squid Game isn\\'t really all that innovative, (a battle royal-ish game being spectated by privileged rich people), but everything around it is innovative. The set design is just fantastic. It\\'s colorful with a bright aesthetic which contrasts well with the dark themes. The directing and acting is also really solid all around, and the pacing is perfect. The only issue being a subplot that ends up leading to nothing.Squid Game is an overall masterpiece of a show.

       "  \"SummarySquid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.REVIEW:456 people with a desperate economic situation agree to risk their lives in a series of games that take place in a concentration environment to win a significant sum of money.I am a person who distrusts the massive successes, so I began to see the series with all the precautions of the case; however, it turned out to be an extremely interesting experience.The gamesThe participants become part of a regime that is concentration-oriented for more than one reason: because of seclusion, military surveillance, because of its violence, cruelty and sadism, and because of its disregard for the human condition and life. The games (based on children's games) are extremely different and generate different and changing dynamics between the participants and a variety of climates between the chapters, although they all display different types of violence. The fewer participants there are, the bigger the prize becomes.The playersThose who play these games constitute a heterogeneous group of desperate people, generally downfalls of the system and highly indebted, the latter situation that alludes to a widespread problem that afflicts South Korea. Their situation pushes them to put their lives at risk, to which they no longer find meaning, and to commit atrocious acts for economic salvation. Little by little the plot will focus on a group of characters, some of whom nevertheless retain traits of humanity in the midst of despair.The systemOne of the first questions that assail the viewer is who is behind the Squid Game, who is organizing it and for what purpose. Unveiling this unknown is essential for the credibility of the story. What's more, it is initially the most intriguing part of the series, as the games and the place where they take place exhibit an extremely sophisticated and expensive organization and infrastructure.Production design and stagingOne of the highlights of the series is its wonderful production design: colorful, creative, elegant and imposing. It exhibits a powerful iconography that allows you to create a world of your own. As in all Korean series, the staging is brilliant, from the intimate melodramatic scenes to the suspense or violence of the games or in combination. Knows how to use the sequence shot and the fixed shot.The gendersThe series can be defined as a thriller profusely watered with gore, crossed, as in any Korean production worth its salt, by the most resounding melodrama when it investigates the stories and motivations of its characters and their interactions during and outside of games. At a certain point, he even ventures into the western.The cinematographic backgroundSquid Game, due to its internal logic, recognizes several cinematographic antecedents; Among others, one can cite Cronenberg's Videodrome and the saga The Hunger Games, only that it takes place in a rigorous present. But there is another little-cited reference: the concentration regime and other elements refer to Pasolioni's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Other aspects are reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. Its powerful iconography and staging that create worlds of their own can also be assimilated to those of The Handmaid's Tale.Social, economic and political readingsAlthough I consider that these readings are somewhat overvalued or overanalyzed, it is clear that the dynamics of the games and their participants can be assimilated to that of neoliberal capitalism in its extreme forms (as was Nazism at the time), so much so that it concerns the participants as well as their organizers; it even raises up to a culmination of its predatory logic. A supposed and cynical framework of equal opportunities governs where, however, chance is decisive and despair and the promotion of extreme individualism permanently abort the collective organization. The series also shatters the meritocratic fantasy.The performancesThe performances are very good; They range from naturalism to a certain common buff emphasis on oriental gestures and dramaturgy. They generate empathy and mixed feelings based on the changing behaviors of their characters.The soundtrackSpecial mention for the remarkable soundtrack, which, as in the story, ranges from meditative piano solos to frenetic rhythmic sequences.\",\n",

On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they\\'ve hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I\\'m right or wrong. It\\'s a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don\\'t use a movie like a precise blueprint, that\\'s just plagiarism!

       "  'I feel like I can\\'t really write a critical review because the TV show is that popular. Everyone is raging about it and it will end up making a billion dollars even though they for some reason only sold it for like $20m to Netflix. The first 5 episodes is great cinema. It\\'s a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it\\'s always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It\\'s like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That\\'s pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone\\'s chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn\\'t kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn\\'t even know if he could dive or not. It\\'s also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.The main problem is of course the big reveal. It\\'s all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn\\'t work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It\\'s inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn\\'t speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying \"Well, you said the rules were such and such so that\\'s how I won the game\". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It\\'s not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it\\'s just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don\\'t even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it\\'s just a random twist. It\\'s not some info we were looking for.The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn\\'t spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It\\'s not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It\\'s not smart stuff.',\n",
       "  'Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).',\n",

       "  \"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!\",\n",
       "  \"Pros:\\n1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it's never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).Cons:\\n1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.2. It's baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You'd think that type of operation wouldn't make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn't seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There's a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn't go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt.\",\n",
       "  \"Takes the physiological killer game show idea from anime and manga and adapts into live action. After you get past the premise you actually find well written characters and doomed relationships which is very refreshing for an Anime plot. You find yourself liking people and cursing their inevitable death. I loved the extra side plot refreshing from some of the boring games they played. Don't watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.\",\n",
       "  'Great show. Korean drama that is perceivable for N. American Audience. Similar story attempts have been made in the past, but this one has a great blend of Drama with a little unpleasantries.',\n",
       "  'Yes, it\\'s like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note...etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary.Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons. The show basically ask will you be true to yourself? Do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person(deep down), believes in the goodness of humanity. Goodness of other people. (Just look at his smiley photo snapshot). Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the \"reasoning\" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of \"rosebud\" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.There are many threads to follow up on if there\\'s a 2nd season. The origin of this game. The cop that jumped off the cliff. The recruiter in the subway. And obviously will the main character go back to another game? And if so what will he do?I get there are bad acting segment with the VIP. But the they do serve the representation of crass upper class. Overall the length of the series is just right. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions (the marble episode comes to mind), tense (first game, voting, tug of war, formation of groups ) and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, color palette, bgm score, sets, character development, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you be true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old man. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn\\'t get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of people?',\n",

The simpler the game, the more thorough the exposure of the ugly side of human nature. The purity of children\\'s games and the life-to-life struggle between adults form a contrast, which is even more ironic. The character settings, personalities, and relationship portrayals are not bad. But the reversal of the ending is really a forced reversal, anticlimactic.',\n",
       "  \"A masterful series for its great script and interpretation of its actors. Lee Jung-jae has done a wonderful performance, but the best thing about this series is seeing human behavior and despair of not having money to live. We live in a world with money and without it you are nothing, and because of that money we are losing humanity itself, in a world that is increasingly populated and with less work to survive. The numbers don't add up, we'll see what the future holds for everyone due to lack of money.\",\n",
       "  'I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they\\'re giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (the works hold back neither in terms of the raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don\\'t necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it \"suspiciously popular\". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that\\'s clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be \"hip\", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven\\'t seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current \"cool\" thing to consume and didn\\'t grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don\\'t make sense about the setting, which, as per the show\\'s themes and social satire, aren\\'t supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don\\'t understand it and enjoy it \"in spite of some plot holes\").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it\\'s also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children\\'s games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It\\'s around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won\\'t reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn\\'t end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden \"Player 1\" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I\\'ve seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It\\'s not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it\\'s hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn\\'t the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show\\'s poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won\\'t be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it\\'s \"cool\" or not. Still, it\\'s hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show\\'s message.I\\'m told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it\\'s worth, the mainstream reaction could\\'ve been much worse. (My generation isn\\'t much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I\\'m truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go \"Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!\"',\n",
       "  'Well directed, pretty good writing, uneven acting (partly over the top theatrical, partly just as it should be), well produced and shot, keeps viewers\\' attention, slightly predictable at moments (and in general), masterfully edited and with an appropriate music score.

       "  \"This show was phenomenal. I didn't start watching it for a few weeks after it came out because it didn't seem super interesting. It didn't appeal to me. But then it stayed at #1 on Netflix for over a month, everyone was talking about, and it seemed like the only thing on social media at the time, so I decided to check it out. I speak English, but I wanted to have the true show experience, so I watched it in Korean. I wanted to hear the actors real voices, and it bothers me when the voice doesn't match up with the movement on the screen. Regardless, the Korean actors were great. I don't know how to judge actors when they are speaking Korean, but it seemed really well done. I was skeptical about watching the VIP episode because of what people said about their acting. To be honest, I couldn't figure out what was so bad about it. Sure it wasn't amazing, and they were weird at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. I've talked about the acting, now I will talk about the show. Hwang Dong-hyuk is a genius. The plot of this show was so unique and so cool to watch. Every game that played was very entertaining to watch, it is hard for me to pick a favorite. I also liked how the show wasn't just these people playing kids games, it actually explored some of the characters lives. I just thought it was cool. Lastly, I loved the characters. All of them were great, but my favorites had to be Gi-hun, Ali, and the Old Man. Their characters were just so likable. Those were just my favorites, there were so many more I liked.If you haven't already, I definitely recommend watching this to anyone, you won't regret it. My recommendation is to watch the snow in Korean, but if you are just looking to relax and not read the subtitles whenever someone talks, watch it in your main language. I really hope there is a season 2, it will be cool to see what they do after the ending.\",\n",
       "  \"Terrific show; a timely watch. While it certainly dabbles in issues regarding social status, I more so saw this show's narrative as a debate on society's morality and compassion. Mixing offbeat scenarios with unyielding brutality, Squid Game shows how desperate, callous and even savage humans can be when the conditions are met and that capitalism serves more as a byproduct of these behaviors. It asks the question: Does humanity still possess any decency in such an oppressed and unforgiving world? Highly recommend it. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone craving something unique. A gripping survival drama full of palpable suspense and sharp commentary.\",\n",
       "  'Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2.This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout. Only minus was very bad VIPs acting.',\n",
       "  \"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)\",\n",
       "  \"I'm usually not one to instantly check a show out when it's trending, but after seeing so many TikTok videos of people trying to cut perfect shapes out of the famous Dalgona snack cookies with small needles, and seeing how the stakes couldn't get much higher what with those who failed at said task would get killed (which was very jarring), I caved in and decided to see what I was missing. And after episode 9 ended, I want more. Because not only did the hype behind this show click, but it also may be even better than I thought it would already be. And me wanting more isn't me saying that the season was too short or anything, but considering how near flawlessly everything worked here, I've never been this interested in a show like this in a long time. One of the reasons for this are the characters. They're all so damn good and well written. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Ali, Il-Nam, Sae-byeok, Jun-ho, and pretty much everyone else are all effective and very likable, even those who took villainous paths (being vague to avoid spoilers). This is emphasized by the performances, as they are absolutely phenomenal, as everyone here kills it. I felt the fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and tiredness from everyone here, making this have some of the best casting I've seen in a show yet. The story, as well, is superb. To keep it somewhat brief, it's essentially how people who are in massive amounts of debt are taken to a secret island where they must play childhood-like games to win-except, if you lose one of them, you don't just lose the game. You lose your life. At first, that may seem somewhat simple. But the way this show handles it with its excellent pacing, characterization, and world building (all with lots of gore), it works very, very well. It's not only tense, but it's very emotional. And that goes for all 9 episodes here. I was constantly at the edge of my seat. This show is also an excellent parody of capitalism, as it loosely portrays how the top 1% looks down on everyone else, and that even though money is the driving factor for everyone else, it's not necessarily money that makes life better-because the top 1% rot their brains of greed and are actually worse. So much so, that the lives of fellow people who are poor don't matter as much. And I think this show nailed that wonderfully. Overall, the first season is masterfully written, directed, performed, and executed, and I'm very excited to see what the inevitable season 2 brings to the table, because so far, this is one of the best shows I've seen in the past decade, and I hope Hwang Dong-hyuk keeps up the pace, because he did one hell of a job, here.\",\n",

Fritz Lang, Flash Gordon and Tron. As against that, it gets a demerit for the appalling racial stereotype of the Pakistani character. You would never get away with that in an English-language show these days, and rightly so.\",\n",
       "  \"Man! This show!Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!Like some of it's contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way's and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this.\",\n",
       "  \"There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)\\nThere were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.\",\n",
       "  'As survival series go, \"Squid Game\" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a \"Hunger Games\", \"Saw\", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and \\'convenience zones\\'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung\\'s musical scoring more than \\'made it work\\' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another \\'tricky\\' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other \\'loopholes\\' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that\\'s where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That\\'s how I watched \"Squid Game\" on Netflix. The \\'feel\\' was so much different than when I \\'tested\\' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix\\'s \"Squid Game\" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a \\'dark\\' mark one won\\'t soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. \"Squid Game\" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our \\'better nature\\'.',\n",

This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.\",\n",
       "  \"IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.\",\n",
       "  \"And I'm hard to please!Being a massive fan of Korean cinema and horror I couldn't help sitting through the first three episodes happily identifying all the obvious influences which were by no means restricted to Korean cinema and horror.So the obvious comparisons with films like Old Boy and the Sympathy with Lady vengeance are there. The deshevilled under class of loan dependent opportunists of Parasite.But then there was the island of the Japanese classic, Battle Royale or the cult British 60's TV series, The Prisoner. Additionally there were the not too subtle pieces of political and social commentary which echoed recent Spanish films, Platform and Cadaver.However, it's no accident that the entire plot of Squid Game revolves around the visually striking staircase that for us art school students of the 90s instantly recognised as the post-modern Memphis style. For me this was a kind nod to the 80s post modernist architectural tradition of borrowing other people's ideas and incorporating it into something new and visually striking.And that's the point at which I stopped caring that Squid Game was in essence a neo-postmodern composite and started enjoying the ride.And what a ride.No spoilers here but suffice to say every episode had me experience the full range of emotions, from dread and anger, sympathy and blood list for revenge, Squid Game is brilliantly crafted.The horror genre nerds might try to dismiss some part of the plot as being derivative, but every one needs to remember that Korean cinema doesn't care about genre.Seriously, take a day off work, order take away food and strap yourself in and watch the whole thing in one day. You won't regret it.\",\n",

But no, we get stealing from his mom, failure at the track, encounter with bookies...After that we\\'re introduced a pointless \"game\". Who runs that and to what end? The contestants are unknown so wagering makes no sense. Randomly killing losers makes no sense. Some kind of government thing makes no sense. Gladiator stories like Hunger Games or the Maze series work because the heroes are chosen for their skills. These people were chosen for their lack of skill. Huh?The acting is amateur at best. There isn\\'t one likable character. The ending was shoehorned in to allow for an unexpected season 2.This is so far from watchable for me on so many levels I can only assume I\\'m not the intended audience.

       "  'Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn\\'t watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some \"Game\" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn\\'t exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you\\'re going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I\\'m looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn\\'t hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you\\'d expect from a \"Game\" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let\\'s just say some things get revealed and they are what you\\'d boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren\\'t good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn\\'t ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it\\'s heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you\\'re squeamish and can\\'t handle rough stuff, I\\'d highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I\\'ll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I\\'d give it an 8.5/10.',\n",
       "  'This show\\'s massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show\\'s multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that \"Squid Game\" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. \"Squid Game\" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like \"Pulp Fiction,\" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With \"Squid Game,\" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it.',\n",

Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind. Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it.

The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.',\n",

The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production. Also, I know it's pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn't it?\",\n",
       "  'While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don\\'t expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga \"Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji\", which has been running from 1996. It\\'s been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing \"Squid Game\".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this \"inspiration\".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. \"Squid Game\" definitely satisfies in this department, although it\\'s not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong\\'s \"Burning\" (2018) or the Oscar-winning \"Parasite\".

       "  \"The Good:I don't give 10s out lightly. Squid Game deserves this score because there is NOTHING else that came out in 2021 that became a cultural phenomenon like this one. No astroturfing, no manufactured hype. A genuine global phenomenon that emerged organically. How about that?Squid Game is television at its absolutely finest. I can't tell you the last time I was immediately transfixed by a show and captivated from beginning to end. Where do I even start with this?The incredible characters, who are more human and realistic than 99% of the people we ever see on screen? The incredible layered writing that gives each person such depth and complexity? The performances, which are so powerful and excellent, that the cast became overnight global celebrities? The pacing of the show which - save for episode 8 - is basically perfect? The twists and turns, shocking reveals and incredible easter eggs layered throughout? The tension generated from a brutal, misanthropic world that nevertheless has a twisted sense of morality and fairness? The iconic visuals? The set and costume design that keeps these images in your head long after you've seen the show?The exciting, diverse and incredible set pieces? How an episode about marbles - literally the least visually compelling game in the series - is universally declared one of the best episodes of television ever produced? Or how the first game grabs you and immediately sums up the ethos of the entire show?What about the heavy themes, which delve deep into explorations of human nature, greed, solidarity; that reflect contemporary anxieties about income inequality in South Korea (and increasingly, the world)? Hell, this and Parasite have solidified South Korea as a cultural superpower and honestly, if I were Korean, I would be extremely proud. The Korean Wave is going to be a tsunami.I can go on and on about what this show does well: how you can spend hours dissecting it, how it balances extremely dark and sadistic subject matter with humanity, tenderness and humour, how it subverts expectations the RIGHT WAY. It's a 10.The Bad: Perfection doesn't truly exist. And if I wanted to really pick out a flaw, it's Episodes 7 and 8. I'll touch on the VIPs after, but all-in-all, Episode 7 is still a great episode. It just adds some elements (like narration), that I didn't see as necessary. Episode 8 is an emotional wrecking ball, but it's weirdly short and kind of out of place.The Ugly: Okay, so the major criticism I've been seeing has been the performances and dialog of the VIPs. Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding fluent, non-Korean English speakers in South Korea, directing them (whilst not speaking the same language) and writing English dialog as a non-English speaker, the VIPs are highly intentional.Squid Game does not portray the wealthy upper class as an elite group of hyper sophisticated, intelligent people. This is probably a more realistic depiction: they're crude, callous, cringe inducing and save for their wealth, pathetic people. The casting of Gong Yoo and Lee Byung-Hun - who are basically Brad Pitt/Leo DiCaprio levels of famous in South Korea - was meant to imply that the wealthy retain these handsome, sophisticated men to project an elite status. But it doesn't exist. In reality, these are just douchebags.That the mind behind all of this is, well, the last person you'd expect, but in reality, would be the MOST LIKELY to do something like this, drives this point home even more.In summation. Either you've watched Squid Game or not at this point. It's a masterpiece. It's the best content I've seen all year. Just watch it and make up your own mind.\",\n",

The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?\",\n",

Such operation could not become unnoticed.I've noticed the cop's phone was about 60% charged at the beginning, so hiw did ge kept his battery until the end?The old man's identity was known to middle staff (soldiers), which didn't made much sense.In any case it's a good one and worth to check out.\",\n",

A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time.\",\n",

       "  \"Series are wonderful ones to watch because they sow curious elements into the mind of the audience when they finish the episodes one by one. There was something striking in each episode that urges the viewers to go for the next one. Squid Game is similar to that, it is like a typical Web/TV series that has that flavor in every episode. I'm an ardent fan of Korean movies because of the way of representation and the choosing of subjects they are portraying. Squid Game is the first Korean series I am watching that also provides that kind of Korean fragrance. It's about games not only one game but also the children's game popular among in Korea. The basic core of the movie is the need for money and the problems and struggles followed by the low-class section of the Korean community. The series gets more engaged when the contestants participate in the game. And the game is something like a survival one because those who failed in the game will be killed. It is a do-or-die action for them. Initially, there were 456 contestants and when the game progresses the number gets decreased and the amount in the piggy bank becomes increases. When the last man survives he gets an amount of 45.6 billion won as a reward. This might be the capsule plot behind Squid Game. There might arise a lot of questions regarding this capsule plot. Who conducts these survival games? What did they get while conducting these games? Is it legal or illegal? Like this, you'll have many more doubts and questions regarding Squid Game. If you watched the series you'll have that clear answer with you and if you are not watched it yet then go and watch this wonderful series. You'll surely get engaged.\",\n",
       "  \"This might be the first major injection of Battle Royale style stories into mass media ... I think what differentiates Squid Game from other similar shows is that characters are mostly poor people with massive debts, just like most of the world I guess, unlike school kids in Battle Royale or Student aged kids in Alice in Borderland or a gaming nerd in Btoom ... The show is properly high budget , the acting is decent and the script is good, what makes the show appeal to masses, just like Lost when it came out, not many realized it's a rehashed for masses Earth 2.\",\n",

In the first stage, 456 people are invited to the game. We focus on 8 of them. The remaining 448 people will die simply extras. 5 of these 8 people are doing tricks to win the money.Even if we accept the logic of the script itself, allowing people to kill each other when the game is not being played. Ignoring people even if they have illegal things on them. Freeing cheating. Employees being blunt and telling every secret, the nation's organ trade inside and not being caught in such a technological place, not smelling cigarettes, etc. Etc.The series continued with curiosity until the last episode. The last episode dropped the whole mode and evolved into a more ridiculous ending. What they thought they were supposedly hiding was evident in the 6th episode.

Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. \"Memories of the Alhambra\" and \"Sysiphus\" are much more intelligent in their script.',\n",

Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won't see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting. My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show. One of the best series I've watched in a long time.\",\n",

       "  'This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It\\'s a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You\\'ll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:\\nThis series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It\\'s very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:\\nThe idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of \"Hunger Games\" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids\\' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It\\'s not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It\\'s all great, it\\'s what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn\\'t do it for me).The Bad:\\nThe main character is kind of \"stale\" to me, it\\'s not really someone I\\'d care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It\\'s not about the actor, but the director didn\\'t really get so clever about managing his MC\\'s façade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there\\'s not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That\\'s what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn\\'t sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:\\nRemember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven\\'t seen him die but something about the entire side plot should\\'ve happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really cliché.VIPs: This is a grand \"kek\", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn\\'t buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that\\'s not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should\\'ve come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn\\'t help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it\\'s still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever.',\n",
       "  'This one isn\\'t popular because it\\'s groundbreaking or going where television hasn\\'t been before, but because of the story it\\'s telling. Korean television/cinema has had a big boom among Western audiences in the last few years and I\\'m glad to see it because they do create wonderful media and are excellent storytellers. Squid Game, however, isn\\'t any different from what the Japanese offered us through Battle Royale some decades prior but given the current socio/political climate we\\'re living in, this show was released at just the right time.Ultimately, it\\'s a critique on capitalism and how it dehumanizes people. We see how far a person will go just to have a fat wallet. I think the show does a good job at tackling this topic by showing the negative effects this greed has on people. We see how some working class people get lost in their pursuit of insane wealth to the point of financial ruin and how some of the wealthy elite have so much money than they know what to do with so they decide to bet on working class people like one would do on horses - a comparison that is made in the show.The characters we follow who join the games are all in financial ruin and desperately need money to pay off their debts. The first episode gives us the backstory of the main protagonist, Gi-Hun and the second one gives us glimpses into the lives of the other main characters whom the show will focus on as the games progress. The initial antagonist character among them, the gangster guy, is your stereotypical bad guy. Bullying everyone in the facility, cheating, beating a guy to death - he meets all the \"bad guy is bad\" stereotypes. Our protagonist isn\\'t perfect but he has a good heart and seems to be one of only a few who has a decent moral compass. The latter being debatable with the choice he makes at the end, but we\\'ll get there in a moment.The way each episode is written, you know that Gi-Hun is going to end up winning the game no matter what. Although this irritated me a bit because of how predictable it was, they do manage to hit with shocks and surprises despite the obvious outcome. Since there are various main characters we were following, you begin to root for several of them, most notably Sae-Byeok, Ali, and Player 001. So when these characters lose the game, it does have an emotional impact to those who get invested in the story which seems to be everyone, really. In that respect, the show succeeds at making people feel something and at times left in shock despite how predictable. An interesting balance to strike but Squid Game does it. I don\\'t think anything sets the viewer up for the big plot twist at the end, sadly I was expecting it because it got spoiled for me - it\\'s hard not to have this show spoiled with how popular it is on social media. However, it is quite a big twist that actually really brings the critique at the center of this story home.Now my issues with this show have to do with it\\'s B plot and the awful VIP\\'s that were introduced near the end of the games. The B plot is that of a detective that sneaks his way onto the boat when the players decide to return and continue playing the game. He makes it pretty far in his mission to investigate and expose these sadistic games but the climax for this plot is very underwhelming. I guess the game master or head henchman turns out to be the detective\\'s brother and this revelation is what makes the detective give up, so he lets himself be shot and killed. Maybe they were trying to accomplish something with this plot, this one did manage to keep me in suspense and the ending upset me - while the predictable main plot kept me in some suspense but really got me with its ending. I suppose I\\'ll be further unpacking that one. It might not be that deep though and just be speedy storytelling when it comes to the B plot.Now for the complaint that seems to be everyone else\\'s, the awful VIP\\'s. I wouldn\\'t have an issue with the appearance of these characters if it wasn\\'t for the horrid way they were acted out. The voices were too irritating to hear, every time they came out and spoke, I felt like the minutes dragged on. The dialogue for them was awful too. Now it\\'s possible it was written by someone who\\'s first language isn\\'t English, but the actors (who I assume are native English speakers) couldn\\'t pitch in and amend that ? Well what can you expect from them when the acting was atrocious. I read online that the actors were asked to perform this way but intentional as it may be, it was irritating and really dragged down the show in my opinion. They were a cheesy addition to the show. I get they\\'re necessary to the plot, but had they been performed differently, in a less \"1960\\'s cartoon villain\" way then they would\\'ve been on par with the rest of the show. I think speaking in normal voices and saying sentences that normal people say, would\\'ve made it much more sadistic. I mean that\\'s the theme throughout the show.All in all, I enjoyed the series. I wasn\\'t fond with the ending showing the character deciding to go back and expose the game, instead of going to see his kid - and he\\'s the hero we were supposed to root for ? Guess that\\'s to set us up for season 2, but I think this show works better if there\\'s new characters each season and if they must bring back the main character, he could come back after taking care of important things. Still, I will definitely be watching season 2 when it\\'s available. Believe it or not I\\'m actually happy this is as popular as it is, it means people are becoming more aware of the reality we\\'re living in.',\n",

I started watching the series after seeing the trailer thinking of it as a cool fun adventure thriller, instead, it turned out to be more of a hard-hitting human story. It has so much depth for a survival series genre which is mainly known for brutality and gore, which it has in plenty, but also adds to it with the writing having heart-wrangling social commentary.The writing and direction are class, the casting spot on, the music, set pieces as well as camera angle really add to the thrill.

       "  'One of the biggest sensations on Netflix right now is surprisingly a Korean show. I am all for Korean stuff as there is some amazing stuff from Korea that surpass western movies and shows. The premise is \"Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to compete in children\\'s games. Inside, a tempting prize awaits with deadly high stakes. A survival game that has a whopping 45.6 billion-won prize at stake\". So is Squid Game worth the hype or another forgettable show in Netflix large backlog?Firstly, I love the concept of the show and the themes they explore. Battle royales have been done before for example The Hunger Games. However, the way it is utilized here feels way more impactful. The deaths here feels more meaningful and messed up but never gratuitous. One thing that this series does differently is that the games they play are children games. It makes it amusing to watch grown adults play children games. Another different aspect is that the characters are here of their own will. They all have massive money debts so they choose to be in this competition of their own volition. This leads to the big theme explored in Squid Game with its social commentary about inequalities. We see how the people in debt are treated and how desperate they are to get out of it. The chosen games are also great to watch as it gives us some of the most tension-filled scenes in a movie or TV show ever. There is also some great twist in the story that genuinely surprise me with one near the end that completely changes how you view the series.I also really enjoyed the set design, costumes and music score for the show. The set has this weird trippy look to it that makes it seem like they have been transported to another place. It also feels closed in to make it feel claustrophobic and give the show an unsettling feeling. The contestants wear this green uniform that makes it feel like they are prisoners of the game. The wardens all wear this pink uniform and mask to make them seem inhuman. The music score is pretty well done as well with it illustrating the scene. A music score I particularly like that occurs before games, really captures the childlike essence of the games while feeling very creepy. There is also a cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" which is just used wonderfully. It is clear there was a lot of effort and thought put into all of these.Another reason Squid Game works well is due to the great characters. The main characters have distinct personalities and sympathetic backstories. Yet despite that, the characters being in debt is their fault which makes it clear from the get-go that these characters are flawed. This is evident in our main character, Gi Hun, who is a scummy guy who gambles using his mother\\'s card. Despite that, the show succeeds in making you want to root for these characters or even against them for some. There is some character death in this show that genuinely hurt to watch. This is also thanks to the amazing actors in Squid Game who all gave phenomenal performances in their roles.Unfortunately, the same can\\'t be said for the English actors they bring in near the end. They are just awful, cringy and unconvincing in their performance. The English dub for the series is also very bad which is baffling since English dubs have been great in many other media such as anime and video games. There is also a definite drop in quality by the last 3 episodes. The story becomes incredibly predictable and by the books. Our main character Gi Hun becomes a generic good guy protagonist which is a little odd despite the things he did. The last two games also don\\'t feel like children games even if it is. There is also a plotline with a police officer that amounts to a predictable reveal that does not affect the main plot whatsoever. The police story is just massive padding and takes screen time away from the interesting things in Squid Game.Overall, Squid Game is a great addition to this Battle Royale genre. It also makes me genuinely happy for a Korean show to be successful even in western countries. Hopefully, more people will give Korean shows and movies a watch as there are so many great gems from them. Squid Game is definitely worth the hype and it has made me curious about whether we will see more in this universe or not.',\n",
       "  \"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful.\",\n",
       "  'After finishing the show today (I braced myself not to watch it all in one sitting) and without reading spoilers (but recognising many of the hints), I think this show is liked and disliked for the wrong reasons by many.I don\\'t know what Koreans think of the show, but have quite a few Asian friends who liked it. It\\'s always been a bit funny to me, because most Asians I know NEVER seem interested in their continents movies or shows and prefer Hollywood.Personally, I think Hollywood is about as bad as it can be (at least I hope it can\\'t get even worse) and there\\'s almost nothing for me.Since the late 90s, Japan and Korea (also Brazil and Mexico) have done quite a few amazing movies.Korea with Brotherhood, OldBoy, the brilliant Shiri/Swiri, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and the very twisty \"The Wailing\" (Squid Game reminded me of that, although they are about different topics),\\nJapan with gems like Swallowtail Butterfly, Love Exposure, Confessions, to name only a few.Many of the mediocre or bad reviews complain about things that show that they never watched Asian movies and can\\'t seem to get into the culture.One example is the character of Min-Yeo.Sure, on the surface, she\\'s a manipulative lady, seemingly just cruel and selfish. But I was rather shocked to see how many people consider her to be just as bad as the gangster.The actress gave an interview and said she actually felt very bad for her character and that her character, though nasty and feisty is actually just very afraid and alone. We can see that in her own way, how she wants to \"belong\". Think how she learned to use her body or anything to \"entice\" men. Such behavior is usually learned from a traumatic childhood. I really would have loved to know her backstory and hope we will get to know more about her in season 2.I actually didn\\'t hate ANY of the characters. Many said they couldn\\'t sympathize or like any of the characters, but I didn\\'t feel that way. Good or bad, they all had their two sides. The only exceptions are probably Daek-Su and the VIPs, but they are that way for a reason. Heck, there were times in the beginning when I even felt a little bad for Daek-Su.I think Squid Game is trying to show us that we are all neither good or bad people by nature. It\\'s our actions that make us either good or bad.Comparisons to movies like the Hunger Games (yuk!) or Battle Royale don\\'t seem very fitting. One reviewer mentions Oldboy, but I don\\'t see that either. Oldboy and the trilogy around it is about revenge. Squid Game is NOT about revenge. It\\'s more about human nature and how chasing after money is not fulfilling and that money does NOT bring us happiness.Don\\'t you think most of these characters would gladly forfeit all that money if they could bring back the people they lost? Our hero sure doesn\\'t seem happy about his winnings.And Battle Royale... it\\'s similar in a sense that it pits everyone vs everyone, but it\\'s all about punishment. Squid Game isn\\'t about punishment either. Nobody is forced to participate. Heck, even before they cross the glass bridge or any other game, the players ALWAYS have the option to call it quits. It\\'s their greed or desperation that keeps them going. And in some cases, their lack of perspective.Although the big twists are not really a surprise if you watch out for some hints that give them away, I think this has been a very good show. I think the reason it\\'s been so successful is that although it is almost \"normal\" for Korean or Asian movies to \"not end happy\", Western audiences aren\\'t used to it. Surely had this been an American show, the hero wouldn\\'t have learned anything and just spent the money and have a sugary happy ending.The fact that it doesn\\'t end in such a \"perfect\" (and thus unnatural) way is why I like Asian storytelling more. It\\'s just more like actual life.',\n",
       "  \"A nice drama but with bad unrealistic endings in the last 2/9 episodes. The VIPs are rotten wasting stories!The starting is smooth nice to the middle but as it get long, it became average interesting only. If they did not conclude so so simply made endings, I will give 9/10. I can only give 8/10 which is considered good to watch. Furthermore, it's only 9 episodes so luckily not a long drama because the last 2 episodes were too awfully produced.\",\n",

However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.',\n",
       "  'If you\\'ve already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you\\'re gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....\\nThe plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the \"plot twists\"/reveals so typical...\\nI felt like I\\'ve wasted my time with this series....',\n",
       "  \"First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.\",\n",

       "  \"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.\",\n",
       "  '*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants\\' lives.Now, that\\'s all well and good. Who doesn\\'t love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would\\'ve made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn\\'t the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that\\'s it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don\\'t worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what\\'s his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn\\'t even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he\\'s only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN\\'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT\\'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder \"How bad are things in South Korea right now?\" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn\\'t actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn\\'t write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren\\'t bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I\\'m just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don\\'t understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn\\'t even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn\\'t you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it\\'s damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let\\'s do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun\\'s gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I\\'m getting tired at this point, so I\\'ll just leave it at that.If you don\\'t give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that\\'s something that interests you, watch an episode or two.',\n",
       "  'I think any review and ratings for movies is reflective of the theme of this series itself. Is this series worth 10? Clearly no. But many will give it 10 for 2 reasons.1) Gore addicts. 2) Go with the hype.In a clear objective analysis. This series started out extremely good, original, and with very deeply moving and captivating backstories. However by about mid point, like many other series, they ran out of ideas and became cliche, just another Hunger Game, Saw, etc... remake.That being said, for the first part at least, I would give it a 10. The 2nd 1/2, is clearly a 5 and a balance of 7 to 7.5. Rounding down because of certain plot holes and inconsistencies which I will address here.1) Most of the game staff\\'s reactions through the series were puzzling and inaccurate. Everyone signed a contract and death waiver, so technically speaking, everything they were doing was legal. So why were they afraid of the police? Why overly secret? The scene when the front man realized a police was in his office, he pulled out a gun to hunt him. Why? They technically did nothing wrong. If anything, pulling out a gun to threaten the police made them wrong.This was clearly demonstrated in episode 2 that they even allowed the players to vote out of playing. They had no fear of any legal repercussion, yet then why rest of the series they were so worried about it? It is an error in their fundamental logic of the script.2) A lot of Koreans preached about how this is a series addressing income inequality in South Korea, maybe the whole capitalist world. Yet, in the film, every single player was there for a reason and not because they were victims. The main protagonist himself gambled away his money, despite having bad luck in the employment. He may not have a luxurious life, but his massive debt came from gambling and borrowing money from loan sharks.His best friend was even worse, a white collar criminal that embezzled from his clients, created fraudulent documents, etc... from \"bad investments.\" Cough cough, you mean pyramid schemes? From his character throughout the series, he was not a moral man, and revealed to be a psychopath. So he was there despite the fact he was not from the lower part of the wealth range.3) The night time massacre scene was either one of the most brilliant writing in this series or the worst, depending on whether it was intentional by the writers. What am I talking about?Either the writers blundered and just wrote in this cliche plot line of how people will turn on each other for money, to survive, and what not. Or ... it was deliberate to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the game system.Throughout the game, the gamer staff dictated an \"equal\" environment of 2nd chance, not only so, but one heavily and meticulously kept accountable. When they found out 1 player was cheating with the staff, they were eliminated and made examples of. Not only so, they observed their 3 fundamental rules so tightly, they even allowed them to vote out the game in episode 2.So the riot scene was out of place, either as a writers\\' blunder again in the inconsistency of the script, or it was brilliantly put in to demonstrate the hypocrisy of their so called game. They claim to have strict equal rules, even a democratic process, but in the end, used monetary incentive, greed, and starvation to thin the herd when necessary and to turn the players against each other rather than against the game staff. Players were suppose to play the games and be eliminated through the games, not murdered in their sleep. There was no accountability when that 1st man was murdered and as such created hostile environment rather than the promise of fair play.All of the sudden, the chance to vote out as a majority disappeared as the players were no longer divided into 2 groups, yes and no, but into multiple self-interested groups. This is... the heart of socialism, which might all along be the author\\'s intent.If it is... it is brilliantly done. Why?Take a step back and look at all 9 episodes. This is what it means then.In the capitalist world, there are winners and losers, there is a wealth gap. What socialism does, is preach to those who failed in the capitalist world, by their own hands, and a promise of a \"2nd chance,\" a better system, under the pretense of equality, a democratic process, accountability, and social order.However, in reality, all of this was done at gun point and the people, though voluntarily there, were there without choice because their alternative is go back to their failed life in the capitalist system. The socialist system itself is a deception, instead of order, they actually created chaos and pits people against people through greed, starvation, and manipulation. The people, which originally had a choice to democratically end it, then becomes enemies towards each other, losing sight of the real enemy that put them there in the first place. In the end, even if you win in a socialist system, like the protagonist, you really lose. The only real winners? Are the socialist creators.This is socialism\\'s core, what happened in many countries throughout history such as North Korea, China, Venezuela, and what is happening now in many western worlds, including the USA.',\n",

Which is to say, If u can\\'t stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it\\'s not something original and groundbreaking.

Once I'd started this series I couldn't stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it.

The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it's a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn't really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn't notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.\",\n",

She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of.

       "  'I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10.',\n",

       "  \"Squid Game is an interesting and rather gruesome show about a group of financially troubled Korean adults who agree to play a sequestered group a children's games in order to compete for a large cash prize. Little do they know that there is a substantial price for losing, and they soon find themsevles in a sort of Korean style Hunger Games. The main characters engage in a protracted struggle for survival--once the players agree to play, they are not allowed to leave unless a majority of the players agree to end the game. Spurred on by greed (the prize is over 20 million US dollars) most agree to play on to the finish.This series is quite entertaining, but thematically owes much to other recent last-person-standing movies like Battle Royale and Hunger Games. This show is interesting because the characters are trapped not so much by their social class as in the Hunger Games, but rather by their bad decisions that result in their financial desperation. In that sense, the show seems to hold up a mirror to what society tends to do to people--set them in competition with each other and then severely punish the losers. The games are conceptually very ingenious and produce both suspense and interesting moral dilemmas. There's also a number of interesting subplots that I won't give away as spoilers.Squid Game is a pretty entertaining and addictive watch, but beware, it is really violent. There is plenty of suspense and some good characters, so much to enjoy if you are into this genre.\",\n",

That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial.

A great plot though, some great lines(as well as cheesy ones) and twists but still lacks something in between. Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood!

       "  'Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (\"would you rather\" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of \"red light, green light\" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they\\'re playing children\\'s games, and why it\\'s all happening, might offer some comfort, but it\\'s all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the \"equality\" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it\\'s so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they\\'re badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.',\n",

Good characters, good drama, thought provoking...all the makings of a stellar viewing experience.But in my whole life....the English dubbing on this is THE WORST and it totally takes away from the excellence of the overall story. I only speak English, and I'm finding myself taking mental notes of the million different better ways this could have been translated to make it more compelling. Seriously, the English in this series is like porn dialogue. Who at Netflix thought this translation mess was ok? Do better Netflix.\",\n",
       "  'The first five episodes are thoroughly entertaining, fast-paced, and establish each character in a sufficiently believable-if a bit hollow-way.From episode 6 onward, the characters become real human beings and the emotion hits HARD. The stakes become real and gripping. I loved it.There are several holes in the story that are never explained, but with this being a continuing series, there will be opportunity for them to fix that.This is far deeper than I was expecting.',\n",
       "  \"It wasn't until episode of the VIPs that I changed to have its original language and subtitles. This totally changed my view of the entire series and I may have to go back and rewatch it particularly because of the poor dubbing in English which the text wasn't bad, it was the inflection and tone that was obnoxious.The last episode is profound and leaves an open for a second series. There is still confusion in my mind over the detective/brother plot line.\",\n",
       "  \"Finally after so much hypes and promotions over Social media platforms I have binge watched this Squid Games season 1 during this weekend. First of all this movie shows us the perfect examples of Human behaviors that too in a very practical way. The character development of this show is top notch and the set design/locations was tremendously great. The screenplay was good but I think it was dragged a bit to showcase the Game scenes and players emotions during gameplay which was good actually.Actually we have already watched this kind of concepts earlier so nothing new in it except those +ve points mentioned in above paragraph. It's wholesome bloodsheds allover this show so it's better if you're 16+ then you can go for it. It have also a little sexual intercourse scene was there for around 40-45Sec so better to avoid watching with senior family members ; of course you can go with your brothers/sisters if they're comfortable with these little scenes.And Finally I will rate it 6 out of 10 Stars from my side, because for me it's just a One Time Watch kind of season. You can go for it... It's worth spending time if you wanna enjoy a show during your leisure time.\",\n",

       "  \"Even after that atrocious second episode I'd recovered some interest and intrigue in the various plot-lines. I rated it a steady 7/10 and then the penultimate episode dropped me to a 6/10 then the last episode was awful: dead mum, red hair, pointless and unsatisfying twist with the old man. I mean, come on! If he wanted some people to play these old games with why not organise a tournament where no-one dies and everyone has a fun, happy time competing for the money? And the red hair - wtf? And the money - the old dear who has this adopted son foisted on her is going to agonise over spending those billions because she thinks it's for Cho Sang-woo.I'm just gutted that the series played out the way it did becuase up to that point it was OK. Really though it never lived up to the tension of the set-up and the consequences of the first game.My conclusion to all this - Netflix have a brilliant marketing departmnet and they know how to dial the right dials even when the product isn't that great, or original.\",\n",
       "  'The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either. There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish.Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren\\'t in the main cast. There are some you will enjoy getting their \"come up\\'ins\" to a satisfying end. The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did.There isn\\'t much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you\\'ve finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard. The 6 games themselves, many across the world will know or may have even done; some you\\'ll be like \"really?\". All are brutal by design. This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn\\'t look or sound as bad as it could have.',\n",

It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so \"unique\". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode...',\n",

The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise.',\n",

       "  'The acting is absolutely atrocious throughout with the possible exception of the female lead who\\'s a South Korean model turned actress and one or two others. The main female antagonist is one of the worst actors I\\'ve ever seen...ever, she overacts to the point that I was waiting for her head to explode and I cheered when she finally bought it so I wouldn\\'t be subjected to any more of her \"acting\". And even allowing for the dubbing the dialogue is often worse than the acting, corny, cheesy, very dated. And I found the main character to be too much of a loser, to the point that while I knew I was supposed to, I felt no sympathy for him at all. Because all of his problems were completely self-inflicted and he continued to be a loser through the entire series...I just didn\\'t care about him.There are plot holes wide enough to drive a truck through. Like the police detective who manages to infiltrate the island and fool everyone even though there\\'s security everywhere and the guards are computer coded. And lets not even mention how he was able to follow the van from about 30 yards back and then move around on the ferry without anyone seeing him....and I guess I missed the reasoning behind the Front Man being his brother and killing him....And yet.... I couldn\\'t stop watching it....because the writing is incredible, especially compared to the absolute drek coming out of Hollywood these days. And while the acting leaves something to be desired the characters are refreshingly realistic in the way they react to what\\'s happening around them. There are no heroics, no women who can kick the ass of a guy twice their size, no men who end up figuring a way out of the mess they\\'re in. There are just real people dealing with a horrific situation the way actual real live people would, not the way what passes for real people in Hollywood do. The emotions are raw, the situations are brutal and the good guys don\\'t always win because at the end of the day there aren\\'t any good guys...just people trying to survive but not giving a thought to what it\\'s costing them to do it. Episode six was the absolute high point of the series, it felt like a gut punch while I was watching it, how often can you say that about a mainstream series or movie these days? That episode was some of the best drama, some of the best writing I\\'ve seen in many years and I think it will stay with me for some time.Sorry to say that they couldn\\'t really maintain it after that. The resolution of the cops story line was lame and I\\'m not even sure why he was there at all. I\\'m sure there\\'s something I missed about why his brother, the Front Man, killed him but.... I missed it. The rich spectators were lame; basically tired cliché\\'s.And the end just kind of fizzled. I know a lot of people think the main character evolved during the games and came out a different person but I have to disagree. He was a loser at the beginning and still one at the end. The old man had a very good point in the final episode, every player was there by choice, they all left and, already knowing what it entailed, made the decision to return. Yet the main character seems to want to blame everyone else for his trauma, the old man, the people running the game, everyone except himself because nothing is ever his fault. He hasn\\'t changed, he makes a half-assed attempt to do right by his promise to the female player by getting her brother and dropping him off with his friends mother but he apparently abandon\\'s the girls mother in the north and in the end fails his own daughter...yet again because he\\'d rather wallow in guilt and his own self-inflicted misery that try to move on. He\\'s still a loser....just a rich one.Squid Game is yet another version of a very old and well worn story, the difference is that it made the characters into real people who dealt with what was happening around them the way real people would. That\\'s what makes it better than other versions of the same story. And it makes it light years better than any of the drek being churned out by Hollywood these days. Even with it\\'s flaws I highly recommend it. Just be prepared to be emotionally beaten up by it!',\n",

It\\'s hard to connect with the story and the actors when they\\'re expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from \"actors\" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could\\'ve been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else.

I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend.\",\n",
       "  '68/100I finally decided to finishe this show after being on my list for months. I don\\'t have much to say other than to highlight the inconsistency of the script of its episodes, which became extremely annoying after a few chapters.For instance, episode 6 is easily the best episode of the entire series. Right after, you are introduced to one of the worst; it\\'s almost as if you have to reward those moments when Squid Game truly shows its innovation. That\\'s why the ending, although disappointing, I can\\'t be surprised at the fact that it was executed in such a way.Speaking of whether or not this series is truly innovative, it definitely has its own quirky streak, one that the series isn\\'t afraid to exploit almost 100%. Many times these moments may not work for me taking into account the contrasting contextualization that the program possesses but, one way or another, it\\'s still appreciated.Impressive performances by the cast but that can be affected once certain new characters enter.The only thing that really remained throughout the program was its technical aspects. It got to a point where I was blown away by some of the editing decisions the series would make. They would seem simple, but they are refreshing to see for a series with so many \"action\" scenes.Squid Game fully understood how to stand out, which is why it will become one of the most remembered shows in the coming years. However, popularity never meant quality, and this might be the best example of that saying yet.',\n",

Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it.\",\n",

Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion.\",\n",

I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?\",\n",

The key is in what the players weren\\'t told, not what they were: 456 competitors may enter, but only one will exit alive at the end. These Tattersalls denizens don\\'t compete, except to bet on the \"horses\" performances... & deaths.SG asks its viewers if they believe humans are good. Not quite, right?

A mentor is needed who will teach a #456 how work harder on oneself and add value to life. 456 picked up 001 as a gganbu trainer, evincing that, plainly, moral fortitude is no prerequisite.>218 is Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s \\'friend\\' who worked up from the \\'hood,\\' to being a whilte-collar hood. To a point, he mirrors 001. This loathsome in-runner surprisingly gave up the fight, but not before becoming a murderer. #218 is for manifesting one\\'s biggest & on the face, near impossible desires (💰) into reality. Business, duality, & serving humanity must coexist. 218 knows that 456 will serve his mother AND humanity w/ the 💰. 218 failed in his run to win that💰, but he found redemption in his last moments.>067 is Kang Sae-byeok, from NK, who strives to protect her family. No surprise: #067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, responsibility, sacrifice & service. Creating a solid foundation for the future, & protection of family & possessions is a #067\\'s priority.>001, the old man, is most positive when pacing for work. #001 is, recognition for 1st place; it represents independence, but can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su. A #101\\'s primary function is romance, w/ importance of relationships right behind. At first blush this doesn\\'t fit w/ the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic trist. Let\\'s flesh it out further.A #101 needs coexistence. Without it, a #101 is alone. People w/ that # can feel lonely & lost just thinking of being alone. 101 obviously grew up w/o basic needs & training, leaving him consumed w/ bitterness & ill-prepared for rigid competition. #101 also points to eternity & the journey that is about to begin w/all its uncertainties. It\\'s a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny, God is, so #101s should follow the course & learn before their time on this plane is over. It\\'s sad to think that 101 didn\\'t get emotional support or the care needed for success. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it\\'s sad, none the less. He parallels the VIP who was attracted to the cop. They both had the same expression of shock, disbelief, & the beginnings of acceptance, when facing death.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst upsets of the show. #199s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda. For Ali it\\'s providing for his family - independently. A #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict w/ humanity\\'s survival & long-term well-being. We see that Ali is good, albeit naive, & foolish to be so independent that he\\'d wager his life on a long shot to try & provide for his family.>212 is Han Mi-nyeo, the \\'crazy Mare\\' who brought down 101. #212s frequently chase curiosity & adventure, and ALL new, shiny objects, often on a whim. #212s can be good team member & their energy can be sensual. Jumping the fence may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, they can face harsh obstacles. An add\\'l similarity to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements w/in themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a forlornless about them, too.>111 is the doctor. A #111 won\\'t let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership. They haven\\'t been broken. If #111\\'s thoughts are negative, it could attract toxic situations & people.>240 is just released from prison for putting down her abusive \\'sire\\', \\'Philly\\' Ji-yeong. #240 is about nurture & mutual support w/ a high focus on security & the future, all provided without expectation of return. She went underfoot for 067, & thus negated the lie the VIP\\'s tell themselves about human nature. Having already sacrificed her freedom to deliver justice to her mother, 067 is the moral center of the show.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement can be phenomenal in a #244\\'s life. He must keep wrong at bay & not offend the inner energy installed by his maker.>The husband/wife duo is portrayed in #69, or two identical digits facing & complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we can make an 8, which, toppled, is the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is related to ying&yang. The energy of #69 is best when involved directly w/family or team as an equal. Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for traumatic phase. Whether ending good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change. Be prepared for it, b/c the the manner in which it\\'s dealt with will effect one\\'s future.Finally, upon the runners\\' return, in EP3, 187 players re-enter the stalls: The US police code for murder.Getting chills?Oh, these \"poor,\" rich, hacked-up GOONS.

These reprobates can\\'t seem to notice through all the haze of pride, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn\\'t get what he wanted by hosting SG, which was a panecea for loneliness & boredom. It seems he & the VIPs justify their actions by deluding themselves that they are conducting a social experiment - Reassuring themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as they, leads to pitting people against each other. This enables them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: \\'Just look at who they really are! It\\'s voluntary...

Craving the comraderie he\\'d had while growing up poor, he felt that kinship w/ 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. At the time, 456 even had a second chance. He could have done the all-or-nothing, but refused. That plot point of betrayal, while needed, was his worst moment. The old man was playing him all day to tempt him, but he meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.The kinship manifests itself when the old man wants to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there, bedside, when #1 dies. Where\\'s his wife? Where\\'s his kids?? Where\\'s his grandkids??? Can I get a mistress? Nope. Just 456 & an aid were there. Next, 001 saves 456\\'s \\'life\\' a second time, by jerking 456\\'s bit toward living, rather than merely existing.456 is who he is. He wins 3x\\'s in the show\\'s run, but even when he wins, he\\'s a pathetic loser that barely stumbles over the line. In winning, his soul was put-down. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he again, didn\\'t get what he wanted, as 001 died before 456 could kill him. It did wake 456 up. He no longer has to feel guilty about flashing a laser in the old man\\'s eyes during the race: His regret is not shipping 001 off to the dog food plant himself.The red hair broadcasts that he\\'s now either on fire, or starting to blaze his trail. Finally. This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet. #456 is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward.

       "  'SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable. If there\\'s no umpire, they will always run offsides. It is a display of the mutual annihilation pact we enter when it\\'s \"every man for himself.\"This eventing builds on \\'The Most Dangerous Game\\' with a twist. Here, bored, specialized multipliers of their own net worth, devise a game in which they entice impoverished souls who are in a asset-liability crisis to come out & play. We all know that money isn\\'t everything, but it sure fills in divets so the race of life will run smoothly.Instead of the fulsome, rebrobate 1%ers participating in the contest, they prefer to spectate from the comfort of their big screens, or private luxury box, while the \"horses\" perform... & die.Do YOU believe humans are good? Not quite, right?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at, well, the races. It not necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, many didn\\'t disern quickly enough how the \"game\" was metamorphosing into ruthless savagery. I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the word \"NO!\" Augh! The players do soon understand that the only rules that apply are the ones that they are explicitly given by the referees. The penalties for running out of the basepaths are, Umm... Severe.The first two episodes focus on the wild swings 456 experiences when his journey begins. We watch 456 enter a limo, awake to a surreal psychotropic trip in the lofty dorm of horse stalls (300ft high, maybe?) & finally exit into the calamitous onslaught of Game 1.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author stated his purpose: \"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life.\" He was building on his own experience of financial irons that kept his account in the red. The script is a metaphor for his own monetary gauntlet.For those of you who are new to Korean programming: Hey! We\\'ve been waiting for you;) Just relax, you should achieve your subtitle fitness almost immediately. The whole world is watching our entertainment deposits that way. If you can\\'t diversify, they win!K-dramas excel at withdrawing every possible wince & gasp out of the viewer. In general, the writing, directing, acting, & overall play are consistently supplying returns on investment due to the high quality of execution. So much so, that they\\'re in danger of their stats being overlooked. Korea\\'s got talent.SG is more of the same. It is superb dressage, or pagentry. This particularly applies to the horror genre, which is loaded with dumbed down characters& dialogue, lots more blood& guts, & an extraordinarily evil feel to the substandard works. A de-worming & thorough muck-out is in order. SG blows the whistle on those foul circulations. The violence is jolting, but not gratuitous or meaningless. There is a message for us.Yet, K-Dramas, like Simone Biles, can twist professionally, with beautiful strength. K-Dramas spiral the knife into the viewer\\'s psyche with disciplined follow-through. The absolute demented sickness of using the innocent color pink, with other pseudo-cheerful colors, (that also resemble many medicines, such as Pepto Bismal) plus the kiddie trappings (such as the giant doll) is all nauseating. It a dread multiplier.K-dramas also tend to drop players on the audience that are the most extremes of themselves in the beginning of the shoot. A multi-episode show allows ample time to invest in talent to improve performance & yield gains. Just remember that most of the people you see on the screen will either dramatically transform, or the audience\\'s appreciation of them will change, as the series matures. You may squander your currency backing a failing commodity, while another\\'s performance might lead your fantasy team to victory. 456 is pathetically & painfully a substandard performer of the worst sort: over 40, living with mom, swiping her money to go gambling on horses... Has he ever been bullish? Not likely. He\\'s thoroughly contemptible, & relegated to the penny stocks. I was aggravated at the thought of up to 9 innings/episodes monitoring his performance. It was doubtful he would gain any interest.Every competing \"horse\" has a number. If Korean screen writers assign numbers to jerseys, or saddlepads, it\\'s likely said numbers have a commodity backing their values in Numerology- This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to forensically decode what the writer is announcing in the stadium. Definitions in Numerology, like astrology, tend to be generalized. This broadens the applications, & provides a utitly player that can rebound into several positions. Having said that, Let\\'s see if any of the numbers the author assigned have any credit values...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, & signifies effort & patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life.Check. It\\'s applicable.>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456\\'s friend from the \\'hood.\\' The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one\\'s biggest & seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to wealth.>001, the old man\\'s # is at its most positive when in the realm of work. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>199 is Abdul Ali. 199\\'s are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali, is providing for his family on his own. #199\\'s goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival & well-being.Check, check, check, again. And on it goes.Getting chills? If not, you probably haven\\'t seen the show yet. Just wait until you do. The strategy trotted out is medal-winning. Just be woke about what the show is about. It is not about displaying incidental, cheap, & meaningless horror for the purposes of titillation. SG is a metaphor for the writer\\'s own hardships in a cruel, uber competitive & heartless society. The players all represent the downtrodden, like geldings in irons.Most of their backstories, if broadcasted on GoFundMe, would get scouted for assistance. I\\'d be tempted to contribute to several of them. Even the criminals are subtley shown to have been wedged into their life choices. Delving into one gangster\\'s number (101) exposes his basic needs that clearly weren\\'t met in his life. It played a role in his projected gains & losses.K-dramas are also wont to lob surprises, or deferred options the viewer didn\\'t account for, into the works. Expect that not everything is what it seems to be. Avoid being roped in by Ponzi Schemes.This is not over. We need a season two. The question has not been answered yet. 456\\'s number is sequential & shows progression, or moving forward. To the extent that he accomplishes anything, true to form, he would barely get a neck over the line. Heres my ante-post bet & hope: In season 2, he\\'ll be the stallion that tramples the game runners as a #789.Apologies for mixing monetary, equestrian, & sports metaphors over here. I\\'m not good with rules either.Quote:\\nGood rain knows when to fall. ~Du Fu~I also did a spoiler review.🎭8.5 🎬8.5 🤔8⚡8🎨7🔚9.',\n",
       "  'You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...\"Can money buy you happiness?\". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN\\'s exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There\\'s just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long).',\n",

       "  'Kids may not know it is basically a copy of the Japanese movie \"As the Gods Will\" - the first chapters are identical concepta add then bits of \"Escape Room\" \"The Cube\" and the ultraviolence of \"A clockwork Orange\" (btw the VIP lounge scene is obviously idea taken from the Clockwork Orange movie\\'s \"Milk Bar\" scene).Also the English subtitles are awful.The ending was so disappointing. And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming.',\n",
       "  'The show was decent, worth watching but not as great as some are saying. Took me a few nights to finish and the ending was disappointing. Get ready for season 2.',\n",
       "  \"I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers. I love the style and the type of writing the screenplay of almost every korean thriller and drama. Then I went to vacation and when I came back the hype about this series was incredible. I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do. Very nice, didn't disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist.\",\n",
       "  \"Must Must must watch it, I finished it in just one day, i was glued with my chair whole day to finish last episode get predictable But it don't ruin your enjoyment. I heard about it from one of my friend and watched it and won't regret.\",\n",
       "  \"Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be.\",\n",
       "  'As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to say\\nAnyways, it takes eight for all.',\n",
       "  'After \"Liar Game\" and \"Alice in Borderland\" we have \"Squid game\".Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it\\'s on Netflix and I could skip :).Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I\\'m not ashamed to admit it.Very happy to have binge watch it.PS. Gong Yoo from \"Train to Busan\" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas.',\n",
       "  \"Kind of the same thing as Alice in borderland except the motives, characters, and drama are done much better. I also like that most of the characters are adults with relatable issues. I'm tired of teen drama. Take note Netflix you got a winner here.\",\n",
       "  \"After a couple of episodes I thought I wouldn't last to the end of the series. But it became oddly compulsive, and by about half way you definitely want to know how it all ends.But it is not that great. There is a lot of repetitiveness in the story, and it is drawn out over rather too many episodes.Moderate acting, but the main character was good.If you are looking for something different, well worth a try - as long as you can tolerate extreme violence.\",\n",
       "  \"Yes this can be seen as a dystopian fiction. Like Maze Runner, Hunger games, you name it. But the fact that they put children's games into the mix was a concept that was pulled off very well and in a way that made you feel a major amout of tension. I can only hope that this gets renewed for Season 2. If not then it had a hell of a run.\",\n",
       "  \"You know, not that bad considering overhype. Ephemera, no more, but has a good picture, music and let's say not so banal development of events( of course it is quite banal if you are a smart viewer, but for most series and viewers), let's say that is is just no as bad as dog excrement (usually it is so). Strongest side of this series is an acting, it is really solid. I think, considering the attention drawn to this mess you have all the rights to rate this as 1.\",\n",
       "  \"It started slower than I had anticipated, but I understand it's because they want the viewers to get to know one of the main characters a bit more. The games themselves are fun, yet sometimes sad to watch.....you will know what I mean when you get to the marbles game......no spoilers here! The show gets better as the episodes go on and I found myself rooting for a few of the participants. It's a fun show to watch, but the cruelty of humankind is just insane. The lengths people will go to survive is real and sad. I watched with subtitles because dubbing is always terrible and takes away from the characters in my opinion. Overall, I would recommend this show as it's very different from anything out there and after episode 3, keeps you in your seat.\",\n",
       "  'The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a \"battle royale\" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn\\'t matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a \"good heart\" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don\\'t matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are \"forced\" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, \"we can win this with everyone still alive\". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a \"final boss\" enemy in the show.I won\\'t spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of \" saw that coming\" and \"give me a break\" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.',\n",
       "  \"Squid Game has to be the most unique show I've ever seen in my life. Everything from the music, cinematography and genius storytelling lead it to be my favorite show of 2021 and in my new Top 10 fav shows of all time...\",\n",

       "  \"I think the first 4 episodes were really excitement but gradually at the end of the serie the movie was really boring and predictable! Especially the last episode was really terrible and I hoped that I shouldn't follow this seire!\",\n",
       "  \"Started well. But mid way through, it gets tired and feels sluggish. The games are just not interesting and suddenly there is so much talk of morality etc. The ending was horrible and vague.It shows that losers will be losers even after winning. Just not relevant in today's world.\",\n",
       "  'Very similar to \"The Running Man\" (1987) in plot, although it plays more like \"Battle Royale\" (2000) and \"The Belko Experiment\" (2016).The whole story starts with a broken loser getting contacted by a guy that knows absolutely everything about him (in an almost supernatural way.) He invites him to play a game, which would reward a humongous amount of money to the winners (if there are more than one winner, the money is divided amongst them, inciting them to try to win alone.)When playing the first game, though, the players find out that losing means dying (or getting killed!) Obviously, people freak out and a lot of them die immediately. After that, people vote to go back home, without any prize.Episode 2 is dedicated to show the survivors that their lives are hell on earth, so many of them decide to go back into the game. That was at the same time the best episode of the whole series and the worst: a whole episode filled with fabricated drama, to built backgrounds for many characters, which prove to be absolutely meaningless later on, because the story simply ignores their psychological profiles and life baggage, making them act and react at the necessity of the plot.Key characters\\' personalities change \"sides\" just too many times along the series, at the will of the writer. For instance, the protagonist starts as a jerk, stealing money from his mother (for gambling, nonetheless,) then becomes a soft-hearted man, trying to connect with his daughter and save everybody, then becomes a jerk again, trying to save himself at the cost of others\\' lives, then soft again, then jerk, and so on. Especially in the last episode, his changes make absolutely no sense whatsoever.Before his last friend dies, she asks him to promise to go look for her brother, but he doesn\\'t promise (in a \"I won\\'t promise, because we are both getting out of here\" kind of moment, although not actually voiced that way.) When he\\'s out, he enters jerk mode, effectively not going after her brother for a whole year.Anyway, his girl friend is killed by his ex-best-friend-forever, so, obviously, the protagonist is forced into jerk mode and tries to kill his ex-friend-turned-arch-enemy... Until he has an opportunity to win the game and let him die... Making him go back into soft mode... Then his ex-best-friend, for absolutely no imaginable reason, kills himself (in a \"if I don\\'t die, we are both going to die, so I better kill myself, because you bozo won\\'t let me die\" moment...) Game over! The protagonist wins, time to go home, in jerk mode, of course, for reasons.Then, another plot twist, shamelessly copied from \"Saw\" (2004): one of the protagonist\\'s previously dead friends was not dead at all, he was the mastermind and game master! After a long and boring speech, which is basically a Korean translation of the final speech from \"Saw III\" (2006), the protagonist enters soft mode again and go after his dead girl friend\\'s brother (something that makes absolutely no sense, as she had never said who or where he was, because she was very secretive about her past, having escaped from North Korea - even her name was kept secret!)BUT (yes, a huge \"but\" there) he was in false soft mode! After getting the boy out of the orphanage he was kept in, he ditches him (and a case full of money) with the old mother of a dead friend and disappears! After that, he enters actual soft mode and gets a ticket to fly to meet his daughter, whom he supposedly loved so much that he decided to risk his life getting back into the Squid Game (to be fair, he also did it to save his mother\\'s life, whom he finds dead after he goes back home, but two wrongs don\\'t make one right, right?)BUT (oh no, another plot twist!), on his way to the airport, he meets the guy that recruited him to play the Squid Game...! And does nothing about it! He continues on his way to the airport, because he loves his daughter, right? Apparently, wrong! As he\\'s boarding the plane, he decides to pick the recruiter\\'s card and call: he wants revenge for what they did to him, and he\\'s mad, and he\\'s back in full throttle jerk mode...! What, again, makes absolutely no sense! The mastermind is dead, so whoever is the game master has absolutely nothing to do with him! Besides, he voluntarily decided to enter the game, so, if any one\\'s to be blamed for all that happened, it\\'s himself!Except for one game (tug-of-war), all others are amazingly lame and people die for nothing, just to advance the plot toward the scripted lame ending.The random changes of heart of the characters made me want to finish watching the series just to get over with it and never look back. Aside from the protagonist\\'s soft/jerk mode switching, what happened to his ex-best-friend-forever was probably the worst character development I have ever seen. In the beginning, we are made to believe he\\'s a nice guy with a truck-load of bad luck. Then, when he\\'s back into the game, he secretly tries to kill all of his friends, for absolutely no reason. To make it very clear that the first time was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he does it again and again and again till the final game.Because of all those completely random and irrational changes, I was simply unable to hate the ex-best-friend or sympathise with the protagonist! All I could see was a stupid writer forcing the characters to push the plot forward, against logic and common sense.And talking about logic and common sense, did I mention that the Squid Game is a secret organisation? Well, it is, kind of obviously. As mentioned before, the \"people\" behind it have an almost supernatural knowledge about everyone and nobody outside have any knowledge about it/them. Even so, the series introduces a subplot twist: there is a secret organisation operating inside the secret organisation, stealing and trafficking organs from the people that die in the games, without anyone in the Squid Game society noticing! Later, it\\'s revealed that the Squid Game society actually knew that there was an organ trafficking group working behind the scenes, what makes even less sense, because how could a secret society infiltrate inside an even more secret society, and why would that society let such a huge liability operate freely inside it?The best character in the whole series is a random police officer that collects the protagonist\\'s report about the Squid Game society when he gets out the first time. Despite not believing in his seemingly absurd story about a secret society playing deadly games, he tried to help him in all ways he could.I\\'ve heard that there will be a second season, but I don\\'t want to watch it, because the protagonist is a schizophrenic jerk, the Squid Game society is made of dumb jerks (making people outside necessarily even dumber, as they can\\'t figure them out) and the writer knows absolutely nothing about character development. Even if the producers would fix all those issues, what I absolutely doubt, the series would still be completely unwatchable, because either the protagonist stays the jerk anti-hero he\\'d been for most of the first season, or he\\'ll be the jerk superhero, that abandoned his daughter for revenge, who he seemed to have become in the last few seconds of the last episode, that is, either way, he\\'ll be a jerk.',\n",
       "  \"Finally finished this series. This is series is sticky, i mean it stick viewer toward, full of suspense, i really enjoy its game and i didn't expect that last game ends so easily in that's point i didn't satisfy.

Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn't ruin the entire series. I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode. Hoping for a season 2.\",\n",
       "  \"Didn't expect to see exactly that what the movie is, but that was just the pleasant surprise. I like the idea of the people target to play the game, how they refuse, yet reinvolve - there is a message already in the first two episodes. As for how the show goes - good acting with great selection of casual-looking people, it holds its Asian manners, which is also his charm - brings their specific craziness and cruelty even, yet at some moments it is funny just as they can do it, but it is not a comedy at all. The entire show intends to bring a message, even after the outcome, it is a nice thing after so much gore. And happily, we don't see another unnecessary and intrusive homo love story.The scenes are captive, great colors and screen format, all the details are perfectly touched, the music nicely fits the acts. No wonder Squid Game is so popular, it simply deserves it.\",\n",
       "  \"I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance. There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror.\",\n",
       "  \"It's a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2. The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks). The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game. It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do. So, one season is good enough for me.\",\n",
       "  'I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.',\n",
       "  \"Outstanding acting performance by ALL actors, so it looks realistic despite of the imaginary plot. People who hit rock bottom and have nothing to lose or that simply have no other choice take the very high risk of death hoping to win a kids game that will solve all their problems for good, or so they think. The only problem is that those who lose the game are killed immediately, so it's actually a game of life and death. Makes you think about the horrible life of the poor, who suffers with no future, while the wealthy enjoy.\",\n",
       "  \"Overall I love the show. Great story, of the games. Few things I don't like....the acting is sub par and feels scripted. And the main character, you wanna like the main character.

The tv series is great compared to Alice in Borderland. We can understand better where the characters are coming from, and what drives them as individuals. And the idea of deadly children\\'s games is unexpected and refreshing. With each death of the main characters, some do feel sadness and disappointment. However, the tv series is not perfect, with my ability to predict who will win, who will be betrayed, and who is behind it all.

It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one..

       "  'Squid Game is such a successful show that presented one-of-a-kind filmmaking elements that were never seen before. From its unique story to its visually stunning shots, the show deserved everything it got.The show really presented a powerful dramatic topic in the most beautiful way. You constantly be asking yourself who is right and who is wrong?. You get to see the different emotional decisions that characters have to go through to either sacrifice their lives or defend and protect themselves.Really loved how the show manifests the different characters and the diversity between them. It doesn\\'t focus on one character, it rather focuses on around 7 different characters. You get to see the old, the young, the poor, the rich, the female, the male, and even the husband and wife. This makes the story even 10x better as we get to see everything and everyone\\'s decision and how they react to these different games.I feel like the show was better when it was mysterious. As soon as things started to get revealed to us, the show lost itself and that mysteriousness vibe that it was offering. But, at the same time if things kept being mysterious, then the questions would\\'ve never been answered so the show would\\'ve been even worse. The show had plot holes and things that just didn\\'t make sense at all. Like stupid decisions made by characters, or stupid character developments, or cheezy lines like the ones in \"English\" (and not Korean). Like why not keep everything in Korean?! Why do you have to add English dialogues and characters?!. But on the other hand, the show offered us many elements that covered these bad plot holes and made us not think about them as much as we think about the good stuff. For instance, the visually stunning set design with its beautiful colors that are matching perfectly together and with each game that they were playing especially they are meant to be for children so the bright pinky colors explain all of that. The custom designs as well alongside the masks gave that scary, suspense, and thriller atmosphere.The acting is beyond amazing. Each actor presented the dramatic side and life of their character perfectly and their acting plays a huge part in how we were easily connecting with each character. The acting of the VIPs was one of the worst things that I have ever seen.The show\\'s 9 episodes are written very beautifully and carefully. This is why they turned to be great. The 2nd episode with its amazing title, \"Hell\" explains every back story. Although it was a boring episode, without it the show would\\'ve literally been nothing and the characters would\\'ve meant nothing. Really loved how the show presented a specific character that was quiet and didn\\'t have any lines in the whole show except for one specific episode and we were easily connected emotionally to that character. It took the writer only one episode to make us connect deeply with the character that was quiet in previous episodes. That is enough to explain how each thing about this whole TV show was written with deep thinking and creativity.Finally, the beautiful music score is composed by Jung Jaeil, the same composer of Parasite (2019). You can hear the similarities between the two. Especially that both of them discuss such a sensitive and realistic topic which is greed, the difference between the poor and rich, and what people are willing to do for \"money\". The music score played an important role, especially in emotional scenes. They made these scenes way more emotional than they should be and added a lot of meaning to them.My rating is 8.5/10.',\n",

Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point. There wasn't one here. I cared not a lick about those that remained. This was a terrible waste.\",\n",

       "  'My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i\\'d feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate \\'hunger games\\'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It\\'s just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head \"what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?\". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here\\'s the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn\\'t end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it\\'s a 9-episode long show, the \"sad ending\" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it\\'s either all or none case, sadly.

       "  \"Hwang Dong-hyuk's thrilling, hyper-violent, unique Korean TV series steaming now on Netflix is one of the most original and gripping shows ever produced for the medium. Taking place in South Korea, it concerns people who are in serious financial ruin that receive a mysterious invitation to compete in a series of children's game at a secret location that could earn the sole winner the ultimate prize of millions of dollars in cash, but the catch is you have a certain amount of time to succeed, and the losers are brutally executed on the spot. The series' lead protagonists are Seong, sensationally played by Lee Jung-Jae, a divorce gambling addict with a lovely young daughter who is in deep debt to some vicious loan sharks, his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo, superbly played by Park Hae-soo, who was the golden boy of the neighborhood that went to a prestigious business university, and now his wanted by the police for embezzling great sums of money from clients of the company he worked for, a beautiful young pickpocket named Kang Sae-byeok, impressively played by Jung Hoyeon, who needs the money for her baby brother who is in an orphanage, a Pakistani migrant worker, Ali Adul, terrifically played by Anupam Tripathi, who is on the run and is desperate for money to support his infant child and beloved wife, a sickly old man, Oh ll-nam, endearingly played by Oh Yeong-su, who has nothing to lose, and a murderous criminal, Jang Deok-su, memorably played by Heo Sung-tae, who is on the run from killer gangsters. Marvelously directed by Dong-hyuk, it has a truly engrossing screenplay by Hwang Dong-hyuk, stunning cinematography by Lee hyeong-Deok, and incredibles sets. This highly addictive show had me and my dear wife on the edge of our seats, the suspense is almost unbearable at times. We cannot want for season two to get here. Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "  \"As in the title says, this show is great. Already people made detailed comments and I won't have anything futher to add. But I'd like to point out two things.First one is complaints about predictability. I strongly disagree that view. Until the last second of the game, you'll be wondering who is going to be the winner. Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2. Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on.In short, don't miss it out and believe the hype. Definitely deserves to watch.\",\n",

I like the simplicity of it: people want money, they compete in deadly games to get it. There are opportunities to leave, but the need for all that money is greater than risking their life. The bases are pretty well covered. Visually it's like a demented Dr Seuss story. Loved the sets!The bad (or, the picky): the VIP's are stupid with horrible acting, everything the rest of the show isn't. The surprise ending is cool, but the explanation is pretty lacking for a show with tons of detail. I guess they can use season 2 for this. As a stand-alone you have to just accept that someone has the money and imagination to put together such an elaborate and secretive series of games for the benefit of a few bored rich people. And the workers? No explanation how the control is there at all.\",\n",

Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle.Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly.

Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end.

I always expected it to be a sort of highly intelligent game show kind of film but when I finally sat watching the first episode, I definitely know it is going to be another parasite.Again, I don't hate parasite, in the same way, I don't hate this series. Squid game had a good pace with it, not once I felt bored and I really admired the effort that these film makers have put in to the show but, BUT, the series, same as the film, was insanely dark, disturbing and hopeless.I mean, why do you have to create such series and pour in more negativity into this world? Don't you have enough? I think this is the problem with not only this but most of the Korean films/dramas, called to be 'thrillers' these days and the fact that these inhumane shows get widespread acclaim is horrifying and making me question the future of this world.Judgements aside, the series also had major flaws like crappy characters, predictable tale telling and confusing logic. At times, you cannot find motives for a character's action at all. Some characters had no back story, no arc, no depth, even though they were prioritized over other disposable characters.I mean, do these people ever think what will happen if they get killed? With what hope, they are entering the game show? What are the odds' of having multiple winners? Did they really choose to return even after watching a bloody massacre in front of their eyes? Did they really think that these people can be trusted after watching that?Coming to the male lead, Who leaves their sick mom for days/months to play a dangerous game in the hopes of winning money and returns hoping that she would be alive? What are the chances of winning the game (1 out of 456)? Did they really think they will have multiple winners? Which game has that?Do any of these characters live for themselves? If the characters are so sentimental towards their loved ones, why risk their own lives in the first place? Would the loved ones think that the money is better than the loss of their children/parents?Why did the female lead leave her only brother to play the game when she had no debts? She could have lead a good life here in South Korea making peace with her mind that she cannot see her mom again. Did she really think that her mom would be happy after coming to SK and to know that her only daughter is dead? What were the odds that after the escape, her mom would still be left alive in NK? Did she put her entire life in danger, trusting on some blind instincts?Now that I think of this series, there were so many things that didn't make sense or plainly were there to psychologically torture the characters. The series, as parasite did, left my heart with a hollow and I'm stressed out. Like life is not stressful enough.I'm alarmed at the ratings that this weak show has been given and seriously feel frightened of this sadist community, who I know will not dare to kill anyone if the dystopian future arrives. I'll rather take my own life than to play a people killing game like this.\",\n",
       "  \"I hate Netflix with all my soul, but was surprised by the superb concepts and style of Squid Game, with human, complex characters, and plot. I can honestly say I found the show brilliant at times, with honest, raw emotion present, intertwined with unflinching violence, and more than capable actors turning in poignant and nuanced performances. I loved it. Until the very last episode. The pacing was off, multiple twists that just didn't seem to fit, and just a tone and feel that felt way off after 8 episodes. I would have given this a 9 or maybe even a 10 if the final episode had been..more fitting. I still give it a solid 8/10. Great show.\",\n",

So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it.\",\n",

I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion.

And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.\",\n",

       "  'Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It\\'s basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It\\'s basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much \"micromanagement\" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it\\'s really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the \"micromanagement\" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.',\n",

One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator.

It\\'s definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.Cons\\nBut that\\'s all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.There\\'s some decent acting and character development as well, but it\\'s way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and \\'tantrums\\') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.In addition to this, there\\'s so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what \"3%\" does really well). But the dialogue doesn\\'t really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end.',\n",
       "  \"Absolutely amazing show. The plot is not predictable which I find very intriguing. Kudos to the creators because this show, it hits on key fundamental aspects that are overlooked in society. Not only does this show keep you hooked, but it has also made me sit back and ponder on societal interactions as a whole. With all of the negative feelings that circulate in our world today this show is most certainly worth the time and has been the most impactful one I've seen to date.

       "  \"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!\",\n",
       "  \"This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun.\",\n",

It\\'s a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer that\\'s equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing. In other words, there is something for everyone in this show. It\\'s emotional, dramatic, with enough blood scenes to satisfy suspense and thrill-seekers.In a nutshell, according to me, the current buzz surrounding Squid Game is well-deserved.

Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad.\",\n",

I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.\",\n",
       "  \"I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved.\",\n",

Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8.

The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun.

Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards).

I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films.\",\n",

Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....But seriously...WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn\\'t automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don\\'t know.I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their \"winnings\" from how they were acquired? And while the \"1 year later\" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they\\'re planning a second season, so maybe we\\'ll find out more, but I don\\'t think I really care .Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn\\'t be questioned by someone. And wouldn\\'t there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it. It\\'s a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky\\'s waltz from \"Serenade for Strings\", Strauss\\'s \"Blue Danube\" and \"Fly Me to the Moon\" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.But again, seriously......WTF!!!P.

Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there.

Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out.

Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting.Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets. The sceneries are beautifully well made. Interesting camera angles for a series as well.Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don't know). When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge. I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope. If putted the pieces together then shouldn't the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it's a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there.\",\n",

I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn\\'t grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55\" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn\\'t remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn\\'t feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don\\'t know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn\\'t take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it. You eyes may bleed; your mind may shatter - but you will never feel something as incredible as this piece of television.',\n",

Here I considered giving it 5 stars at most.* The ending during which the bad guy has a sudden change of heart, with no convincing explanation.* The English speaking people were over the top and somehow not very convincing. All except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* The importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? Nor did I understand the 1 winner only system. I don\\'t recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could\\'ve been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). I personally think it would\\'ve been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could\\'ve shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. First of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. But foremostly because I just don\\'t believe ANYONE except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. And they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. Really, if I handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* Melodrama on various occasions where less would\\'ve been more.* Like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should\\'ve been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* I thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. He should have just done what he should\\'ve done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* The character developement of the main character was poor. He\\'s a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. Doesn\\'t go see his daughter, doesn\\'t share some of the money he won with the really poor. And his sudden change of morality just didn\\'t ring true with me.BUT, having said all this, after seeing the similar series \"Alice in Borderland\", I have to say I thought this way better. It certainly had me hooked all the way through. So I\\'d still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. The cinematography was great.

For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone.

At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clichéd Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).In short, \"The Squid Game\" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10.',\n",

It is a commentary about the nature of human competition, the endless class war, the illusion of wealth.

As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a \"popocão\" to marathon. I was wrong.The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you\\'re tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.Overall, it\\'s guaranteed fun. The show\\'s aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don\\'t. Skip the details and have fun.Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won\\'t give it a higher rating, but it\\'s a very good series.Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.Rating: 4/5 - Very good series.',\n",

That didn't mean it was a bad episode because still, some stuff happens which was nicely executed.

A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun's decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it's clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There's really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn't make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out.

It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion.

But so many people told me to watch. So I watched.I try to make it simple and I don\\'t make it up.I knew the guy in the black mask was the brother of the police guy from the 3rd episode on. Why would the black masked guy be the only one with a weird voice.I knew right away that the old guy has something to do with the whole thing. It came to my mind instantly. He was the only old guy and kind of wise and all and also in the marble game episode he was the only character not being shown being shot.Yes it was thrilling here and there, yes the performances were good and yes I wanted to keep watching. But to me it was pretty predictable.Every character did exactly what I expected in almost every situation. The bad guy with the snake tattoo just kept being an idiot. The crazy woman he slept with yep being annoying and loud. And so on.And this goes along with every thing in the show.Examples:Marble game again. There is this husband guy who kind of killed his wife who wants to hang himself. He hangs himself. Success. It would\\'ve been funnier if it didn\\'t work and he had to keep playing. Even though I know he wasn\\'t an important character.The glass bridge game. The broker guy who also fooled Ali pushes one person into death right in front of the last step to safety. He pushes the guy, the guy falls down and dies. He jumps and wins. I would\\'ve loved that at one point maybe two of the glass surfaces were to be the weaker ones. That would\\'ve been unexpected. He pushes the guy and thinks he\\'s safe, jumps, but the other one breaks too. WOW. Didn\\'t happen.Police guy trying to escape all the sudden. Why so ever. He looked for his brother, couldn\\'t find him and then leaves. They look after him in the weird tunnel in the cupboard. They follow him. They see that one oxygen divers tank is missing so they assume he went diving. And what did he do ? He went diving. I would\\'ve like that he had maybe hidden one tank somewhere to fool them. Didn\\'t happen.The whole show is just based on its whole premise. Violence and shock. And bright classic music in weird situations. And that just repeats.To me it really went difficult when the \\'VIPs\\' showed up. They were super cringeworthy. I couldn\\'t barely watch and listen to their generic lines. And why would they come to almost the last game ? So they watched people running over a bridge and two guys fighting on a rainy playground. Wow. They should\\'ve been introduced earlier. They weren\\'t even needed at all. If you\\'d take them out it wouldn\\'t have changed anything and it would\\'ve even be more mysterious in my opinion. I doesn\\'t match with what the old guy says in the end and it is also not further explained.And then the show ends with a father not going to see his daughter. Instead coloring his hair red and apparently wants to play again. Instead of going to see his daughter and make it up again. Right.. Who cares about children. She can wait another year. Stoopid kid.I also had a problem with the portrayal of the Arab character. He was portrayed as super stupid, almost retarded. He didn\\'t even know what even and odd numbers are. And his name was Ali Abdul. It\\'s like having a French character and calling him \\'Guy Frenchman\\'.However it was still a lot better than 80% of Netflix stuff.

Around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. The premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.And throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. And eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.When the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to 'the most dangerous game' and 'The Cabin in the Woods'. And without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. And soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an American company (Netflix) to produce such anti-American series. I just wish they stocked with this idea.Unfortunately, and maybe I am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. And everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. Don't get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn't add up like The Cabin in The woods ended. The anti American propaganda is completely thrown out, and that is a huge dissapointment.Pros: the games, the violence, references to inequality\\nCons: plot twist, predictability, ending.\",\n",

The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets.',\n",

       "  'The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like \"Squid Game\" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don\\'t want to spoil the series, I think it\\'s more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it\\'s unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that\\'s where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, \"Squid Game\" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take \"The Platform\" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. \"The Platform\" doesn\\'t dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn\\'t matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our\\'s and the movie\\'s reality. Then how does \"The Platform\" differ from \"Squid Game\"? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in \"Squid Game\". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters\\' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn\\'t go the authors\\' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn\\'t know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.As a metaphor, \"Squid Game\" could\\'ve worked not unlike the aforementioned \"The Platform\", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as \"Alice in Borderland\". The realism wouldn\\'t matter then and the mystery would be stronger.As a realistic show we would have something like \"Saló or 120 days of Sodom\". And it should\\'ve felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn\\'t seem the point \"Squid Game\" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, \"Squid Game\" doesn\\'t confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with \"Funny Games\". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don\\'t worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question.',\n",

A writer with a vision and actual talent, ordered by some meathead producer to make the whole thing as vile and watchable as, say, the first instalment of Saw, and the writer (whom in this case, also got to direct it) did it so his or her family could eat. Or at least that's the take I can live with. But anyway: don't even get me started on the way Netflix treats their talent. I imagine their top execs are just like those revolting VIPs, more than capable of watching people die for fun.Such a shame that this Netflix fodder will be remembered as the Korean finest, while the real good - not Netflix - stuff, like Kingdom and Train to Busan, will most likely get buried under a relentless pile of total squid.\",\n",

I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children's games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me.\",\n",

       "  \"First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):\\nWhat are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)\\n3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:\\nThe plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).\",\n",

What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,\",\n",

Meanwhile, among the rich, the struggle of the poor becomes entertainment for those who are tired of a life that is always fulfilled. This reality is sad, but this is what actually happened.In the end, when the 456th player has won the first prize and the billions of prizes, he does not find happiness because he has sacrificed the lives of his friends.

Squid game provides a heart-wrenching reality that humans who are in huge debt are willing to do anything, including selling their lives for a deadly game. As for the conglomerate people who are tired of having got everything they want in life, they see the hardships of the poor as entertainment. In the end, the winner of this game realizes that winning money by killing others is not something fun, so the 456 billion is meaningless.

It's hard to put your finger on exactly why because at face value it's a really bloody gore fest. I have a very low tolerance for violence and gore but somehow this isn't about that. It's a study of human nature; a tale of haves and have nots, oppression, luck, desperation, love, friendship, greed and hope. Korean film is so rich in story telling it's simply refreshing. This is an exceptional work of art. I loved so many things about it but the main character and the old man and the successful pride of the neighborhood are spectacular in every nuanced scene. I think what makes Squid Game so great is that we recognize these people either in ourselves or in those around us. We cheer for them, hate them, understand them. Don't miss this film.

The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch.\",\n",
       "  'First of all, this review will contain heavy spoilers from the get go so stop reading if you haven\\'t watched the show.Let\\'s begin wtih a simple question. Can it all be justified? I am not trying to defend psychotic violence and sadism as well depravity of a satanist-looking cult full of rich boys billionaires but...As the old man finally said the obvious: They did it all on their own volition. They knowingly signed the rules. THEY chose to abide by it.. Further they could put an end to it anytime they wanted with majority voting.Also let us isolate one incident. The pancake game. If we set aside the GI Joe soldiers who - mind you- were always cordial, polite and abided by the rules such as to eliminate those who reveal face or take out the literal trash who chose to break the rules in their little hooligan clique of organ harvest... It remains to a fine testament that a self-declared \\'dimwit\\' loser who lives with his Mother can achieve the impossible - ie solving the umbrella puzzle with a literal gun pointed to his head. It\\'s almost Campbellesque hero\\'s epic and akin to a rite-of-passage transformation of handling a hot iron rod.So despite the psychotic riot mayhem and meaningless killing from day 1, this shows that conditions were more than fair. Afterall no one can take that confidence and self-efficacy he learned under the crucible. In fact, the conditions were \"MORE\" fair than real world.If we buy this lock, stock and barrel.. then it answers as to WHY this senseless violence can be justified. Whereas the cruel outside world kicks people to the curb, here is a perfection opportunity of harmony in anarchy with soldiers in consort with managers acting as the great equalizers.The final window scene was the ultimate culminating point and great capstone to this otherwise bitter critique of capitalism. Yes, many people read the obvious scathing attack on it, and even a Washington Post article highlighted the irony of the fact that they are basking on the same pile of money enabled by the very system they criticized.. But but I don\\'t think it that black and white.If anything, that scene (as well as the previous powerful scene of \\'brother\\' sparing \\'brothers\\' life...) serves as a striking footnote and glaring closure to the triumph of humanity and compassion.Yes, life is cruel. Yes, capitalism enables the powerful and rich to exploit the ones lower at the bottom if not ask for fellatio whilst people are dying like race horses in a bloodsport. Yes, it is a dog-eat-dog world outside....But at the same time like the ever-cliche rose climbing out of stone, so is the power and magic of humanity, hope and love.(And that brings the point even closer to me. I felt I could relate with the protagonist having found myself in a similar situation although priveleged to live in SoCal. But despite living the simple life, I am also aware that eventhough it may seem to be a cruel world out there, it is also a serene one. What would really happen if entire Earth was reduced to a prison as a social experiment? Sans minor glimpses of riots and ever-concurrent wars... human in general are peaceful and righteous. Even though our planet sustains of globalist capitalist economy, look outside the window... Do you see people devolving to their base and depraved instincts? No...Because despite all our flaws, humanity still has the spirit of God within.)Thus in a way, it manages to do the opposite - instead of dissecting the capitalistic eschatology to shards, it drives home the point and highlight that even if human were put in a situation where you are pitted against another for a huge pile-uh-cash, you would still choose compassion over violence. Even if a homeless person is dying on the street, there is still a kind and gentle soul watching over you like guardian. Even if you earn money through a slipknot of violence, you still preserve your humanity and look after those childhood gradnma-aunt who took care of you and took you under their wing like their own son. These.. these values can never be traded no matter how corrupt and diseased our moral compass may seem to reveal otherwise on the exterior. Albeit all it takes a flake of wainscot to break the tipping point and start riots and anarchy as seen from real life and the movie Joker, but under all the seeming inhumanity and cruelty resides a powerful, calm Shiva.On a separate note, this movie also exploded our blinkers as to what Korean lifestyle, culture and movies are about after year after year and movie after movie of kung-fu tropes and what not. It shattered mine at least.. and I never bought the hype mistaking it for being cringy as BTS. Haha...What does blinkers mean anyway...',\n",

People compete with lethal consequences in quite random and easy games for an enormous money prize. This is how liberals view capitalism and material success - pure luck based on random, worthless skills for the sick enjoyment of the immoral rich.It\\'s somewhat ironic that in Korea\\'s case we have an easy option to see what would happen to it under the \"other ideology\" by looking at the North. Yes, it\\'s easy to imagine a world without competition and money, but I\\'m afraid you need to populate it with either angels or robots.Other than that, as is the case with many Asian films, there are annoying characters that employ overacting as a method to show their emotions, and who at the end you wish to kill with your own bare hands.On a plus side, it\\'s swift action and the level of violence is what you would expect from a Korean show with a cult following in the West.

For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances.

They're so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn't ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you're looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn't your show, because you'll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes.\",\n",

It makes you question morals & the dark side of humanity.Please don't watch this show if you're already depressed or going through a sad period in your life, as this show might negatively affect your mental health.

They had a chance to actually use an original approach to this 'desperate failure' needs quick cash, but nope, this series isn't up to it. Then you have to buy into a lot of completely unbelievable situations and places. I found myself fast forwarding through the 'vote off the island' scene.

Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.\",\n",
       "  \"The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.\",\n",

Squid game popped up mid September, and I thought... maybe!But nope.Now I have to review it because, for whatever reason, it got popular recently.The visuals were great.Therein lies the positives.Now for the negatives.First off, stop calling it a Korean drama. It\\'s not. (Of course, neither is Sweet Home.) It\\'s a drama/thriller made in Korea for Americans. Korean dramas are a completely different genre.It starts with the same premise we\\'ve read a billion times. The 13 tzametti, Truth or dare, question of \"how far would you go for money?\" Likewise answered with the basic premise inspired by The Most Dangerous Game.From this non original start... it actually devolves. It devolves into a shallow Battle Royale, with false (and woefully unoriginal) social commentary delivered with a lack of subtlety that would make Andrew Ridker jealous. Then ends with a disappointing attempt at an altruism message. We saw, I swear, more depth in the Hunger Games series. Take that as you will.I know, seeing the success of the MCU, that people like their literary themes shoved in their faces these days, rather than delivered in a real story, and on that account, I can say Squid Game did superb work.I rarely ask for true originality, because I know there is nothing new under the sun, but if you make me a PB&J, and make a spectacle out of it, like you invented it, I hate you.If you want good Korean television with real (albeit, at times, also not so subtle) social commentary, just wait for season 2 of Sweet Home with me.Last notes: Acting is distractingly inconsistent, the characters aren\\'t real people (I mean, the caricatures,) and the \"twist\" may be effective if you\\'ve never read a book or seen a movie.',\n",

One of the best shows of the year for sure, there is so much to pick apart of why I love this show. From a show that dives into narratives like classism, and society . How far will you to get out of a horrible place, what are you willing to sacrifice, and int he end will it really be worth it. Squid Game asks these questions through some great characters, some great visual imagery and a unnerving sound and audio you make you feel uneasy and of course great storytelling to get to that point.The idea about a battle royale format is nothing new, but it takes something like Squid Game to make it something special.Over time the series really makes you get into all the characters and their backstory and why they have come to this point. So when something happens to them you feel it emotionally. And the characters are complex, they are not one note, they all feel like they need to be there and you get why. And a show doing that in this type of format is rarely done well these days. The key to this show is its characters, and the actors that portray them put in all the effort to make it work, I wasnt disappointed by anyone.Only complaint I really have is the ending, I wasnt a massive fan of the reveal but it didn't take away too much. The journey to this point had been amazing so I was still left satisfied regardless.I rarely dabble in Korean cinema but every time I have I get a surprise like this.

There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What\\'s usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It\\'s the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows \"aliens\" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That\\'s not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that\\'s really not that relevant to the show.

The plot is super predictable and sometimes completely lacks logic (like with the policeman).

These movies were made 20 years ago and, even though they are not good imo, they are far better than Squid game.4. The whole game is pointless and hard to understand.

Rich people paying to see killings to pass the time.. and the need for people to help one another.The problem :\\nbeing what it preaches against.Showing killings in such great detail and magnitude as a TV Series, moves this from being educational to actually profitting off of what it (in premise) is speaking out against.There is a difference between a film making a point with a graphic moment, versus a TV series using that same point over, and over, spending most episodes embellishing slow, atrocious, selfish deaths -- making money off of what it is saying is wrong with the world.If it\\'s so wrong, why are you showing it in such repetitive, graphic detail and making money off of it for the run of your series?This writer/ director has a wonderfully adept hand at directing, cinematography and storytelling as shown in the real world moments of this TV series. So he should certainly know how to show a piece of the atrocities, rather than making the viewers \"VIP\\'s\" themselves. Thankfully I have fast forward so I got through the gruesome, repetative oppressive bloodshed and strangenesses... to enjoy the really earthy, complex storyline and acting inbetween.',\n",
       "  'In recent months I have become a big fan of the South Korean Dramas, and when this one was recommended to me by one of my students, as the most popular show in Russia right now, with school kids, i thought it would be worth a watch.Disappointed. I can only assume it was not made for the SK market, but was rather produced for and with the influence of the US one, as the whole thing lacks what makes the SK dramas so enjoyable. Primarily, there is little to no humour in it, which even the darkest of their serials have, and secondly, it is so predictable, whereas every other one I have seen has major twists in the stories they keep you engaged from start to finish. In fact, it is a pale imitation of the Netflix Japanese series \"Alice in Boarderland\"\\nAdd to that, the cast lacked the intrinsic beauty of the SK actors, and it just bears not a jot of similarity to what makes their shows so good.The final evidence that this is not what it claims is apparent in the blades. What am I talking about? Well, but SK censorship law, blades of any kind must not be shown on camera; if you watch any of the other serials you will see that any knife, sword, axe, hatchet etc is blurred out, like the face of a witness in a real-life crime show.I watched the whole series and feel that this is an insult to what might be called a genre. If you.want to see a really good SK series, the best I have seen so far is Move to Heaven.',\n",

Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soAsk yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn't there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don't people should know that elimination means being killed? It's only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played. The colors the dresser the clean act except of course by VIPs.I enjoyed the series but I am sorry, the meaning of Korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think.\",\n",

When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds.

There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers.\",\n",

The bad guys are total Nazis, the good guys are banal, similar too much to others as in the Hunger Games.This is a show engineered to make us excited, and like the players looking at the huge piggy bank we swallow it eagerly.',\n",
       "  \"Boring, predictable, a bad copy of hunger games, also a stinker, and Saw...kinda liked the first one... I think.The acting is appalling, especially Gi-hun or whatever his name is whose only quality is to overcome his own stupidity when one already thinks that's impossible ... I would never tire of hammering his face.It's easily in the top 5 of the worst series I've ever seen. Lost 9 hours of my life to this rubbish, just to understand why people like it...even failed at that\\nI prefer to sit in in a park and watch the grass grow ... much more satisfying and entertaining.\",\n",
       "  \"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.\",\n",

       "  \"That is the best way I can describe this. Once you get the concept early on, it is clear where everything is headed, but not in a way that ruins anything.There are characters you really like and some you really hate. I was good with this throughout until the last episode or two. That's when both engines seem to lose power and the yellow masks drop down.I don't know if they are trying to make room for a season two, but what sent this into a spiral was that some characters are so stupid they don't even realize how stupid they are, even when someone tells them very clearly that they are stupid. On top of stupidity, there is this self-righteousness that is unbearable. It is amazing how oblivious people can be to their own hypocrisy.So, in summary, fun to watch but you just need a shower when it is over. One strong point is how well it nails the depths of man's selfishness and human behavior in general.\",\n",
       "  'First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It\\'s been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That\\'s where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn\\'t offended by it, I just felt it didn\\'t serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don\\'t actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he\\'s behind it. That\\'s a fine \"twist\", but my God, his \"explanation\" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn\\'t killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It\\'s the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn\\'t as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn\\'t feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you\\'re a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn\\'t that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I\\'m going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to \"escape\" on. I guess that\\'s another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the \"rules\" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn\\'t a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.',\n",

It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks.

Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really).

That seemed quite a pointless chase.Half the games were quite boring to be honest.As enough people have mentioned here, the VIPs were a shocker.

Its basically just a gore fest with the excuse that its an anti capitalist message... yawn, done before and far better in many other productions. I really dont get what others are seeing that is original about it.This inevitably leads to there being something else needed to pull through and that typically means great characters or great effects. Sadly this really fails on the latter and doesnt really deliver on the former either,I have no issues with anti heros but if you have a full cast of them, then you've really gotta work saving graces in. There were ok, a couple of characters that werent completely abhorrent.I didnt find the acting particularly convincing from any of them, completely overdramatized interactions were the norm. That however could be as much the direction as the actor/actress.Also dont get me started on the sexism etc in this. I get annoyed at Holywood for the long term fad of trying to remove any masculinity from all things to the point of absurdity but that doesn't excuse things in the other direction, the chauvinism not just expressed by characters (which would be ok to a certain degree) but then underpinned by events in the show is just unacceptable and cost this show 2 stars in and if itself.Overall, I watched it through just to see where it went and it just remained pretty poor.

There are assholes and villains, and there are good people, and people in between. Regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. There\\'s no bigotry outside of that, which U. S.

Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.',\n",
       "  'Just read a review from a Korean speaker who says the translation of the dialogue is poor to say the least. That was one of biggest problems with this show. The English dialogue is awful. Painful.The acting is ok but there does tend to be a lot of stage, exaggerated acting in front of the camera. It is over the top. In particular from one of the central, female characters. The \"baddie\" just does stereotypical baddie.Central story is fine. Interesting at times. Sets are very good. Didn\\'t like the ending. Don\\'t why the writer thought that would be a better ending than just the winner\\'s game comes to an end and then he witnesses the beginning of the next one.An alright show in my opinion but don\\'t understand the hype.',\n",
       "  'This TV series is so good I think mainly because it is relatable. I believe anyone who watches this will unconsciously put themselves in the situation of the players in the game. One of the reason it is also relatable is because the personalities of each character is different, consequently their approach to the game. Apart from that, mostly the emotions from watching this series will make you engage at every moment making you hooked at it.',\n",
       "  \"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend.\",\n",
       "  'Whatever the many other virtues of this series, the violence and dwelling on blood and gore undermine it. I find it odd that squeamishness about showing physical love and nakedness can sit alongside a celebration of physical conflict, pain and injury.',\n",
       "  \"This show is very well done, the set design is absolutely stunning, the actors (main ones) are pretty good, the character development is great as well. Some great emotional moments throughout. Awesome practical effects as well. The only gripe I have with it is the addition of other certain characters (episode 7) that are just awfully done. Awful acting (can barely read their lines right), and some cringy dialogue from those characters. They also tried to make them comedic, which was totally out of the blue and weird. They reuse the same song over and over for most of the series. And for the love of god, stop making Korean actors speak English. It's extremely hard to act in your second language, and you can tell some of the actors have never said a word in English. It really takes you out of the immersion. Overall, it's a really good show and worth a watch 100%.\",\n",
       "  'Although there were logic errors and nonsense, the series was very gripping and did not lose its grip by making it interesting until the end. It was a quality production in general, but the ending was so unnecessary and ridiculous. Despite its shortcomings, it is an impressive series with its characters, drama and reaction. Especially the first game, \"red light, green light\", terrified the audience beautifully and reflected the traumaticity and drama, which is the theme of the series. Also, the series has been the voice of people suffering from economic difficulties. The things I love about the show are the characters, the good portrayal of emotions in the scenes, and the beautiful creative plot. So i love this show in general, i can give from 7,5/10 to 8/10. By the way, those VIP guys acting were sucks dude, i felt so cringe when they talk.. but in general, they all were good actors and actresses i think.',\n",
       "  \"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading.\",\n",

I was happy to rewatch it with my partner who was late to the party. Minus 1 star for the horrible acting from the VIPs. But it's ok, they're hardly in it and so thankful for that. The rest of the actors were great! The old man/ player #1 was my favourite and his character brought so much to the story. Great character development and story in general.\",\n",
       "  'The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn\\'t suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn\\'t written well enough and haven\\'t got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he\\'s on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode \"Gganbu\" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you\\'re okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that\\'s not really any kind of masterpiece.',\n",
       "  'A great narrative/concept which thrills the life out of any audience member. Despite Gi Sung being the primary protagonist there was always doubt in him due to the incompetence he had previously displayed. I genuinely thought Sang Woo would win as he showcased what a \\'normal\\' person would do to live yet still related to us early on. In the games you would want to be Sang Woo, he is the most intelligent and is physically capable of passing the games and so you try to defend his choices until they devour you, similarly seen before with Walter White.However i do have a few issues with Squid Game.1. So the old man was behind it but wanted to get the thrill of playing. I jokingly guessed this as it seemed quite ridiculous. In the tug of war game he was inches away from dying but in the marble game where he actually lost, he lived anyway so the \"thrill\" he was talking about mustve been pretty pointless if he still had control.2. The detective sub plot is intriguing but the reveal is obvious and well... we don\\'t exactly get closure as hes shot in the shoulder, oh... and he fell in water. He\\'ll be perfectly fine for season 2 then.3. Gi Sung goes back to the games, abandoning his daughter and his character arc completion because he wants to know whos behind it? I thought we had concluded that it were just rich sociopaths who had no faith in humanity. I dont see how Gi Sung can gain anything from going back other than a 2nd season.I could praise the show for a while as the positives largely outweigh the negatives, i just thought i\\'d support the devil\\'s advocate by asking questions that were being overlooked.8/10 Superb acting (the VIP\\'s excluded), plot not as deep as you think.',\n",

First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP's (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won't go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.PS: sorry for the bad english, I'm dutch so you know.....\",\n",

Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments.

       "  'Squid Game: it\\'s everywhere. It is almost inescapable at this point. There are countless memes on social media and hilarious news articles. I was hesitant to check this out when people told me to watch it. Many times the most popular pieces of art pander to the lowest common denominator. And, to be honest, Squid Game does this frequently but it is a hell of a ride and there are thick layers of food for thought hidden underneath.This is by no means a perfect show or a masterpiece so let\\'s begin by getting my complaints out of the way. Firstly, this show spells so much out for the audience to an insulting point but I understand why. Squid Game is a Netflix original and is by no means a foreign gem, such as the likes of Harikari or Departures. This was clearly written and directed in a way so that even the most simple minded audience can enjoy the story. Surprisingly, it\\'s not that big of a deal. It works in a similar way to Disneyworld: there are the joyrides, concessions, and Mickey Mouse for the kiddies and while adults love that stuff too, they also have a bar for the adults.One example of the aforementioned pandering are the God awful flashbacks. When Gi-hun learns that his daughter is moving to the United States with her stepfather and mother, we are given a flashback to the dinner sequence where this fact was pretty obviously hinted at that happened only a few moments prior. I mean come on. How stupid do they think their audience is (a rhetorical question of course)? We also have the front man\\'s reveal, which could have easily been left a mystery. I mean, I guessed that even before the cop found out his brother had been a contestant but I\\'m sure that Star Wars-Luke, I am your father-reveal worked for the general audience. But let\\'s not lie to ourselves, that was hilariously corny. I laughed my ass of during that scene.Which leads to my second complaint: the predictability but, again, it doesn\\'t detract much from the plot. Aside from the reveal that the old man was the master at the end, most of the M. Night Shyamalan \"twists\" can be seen coming a mile away.With that said, there\\'s really not a lot to complain about here. Squid Game is addicting. I watched the show by myself in two sittings (it would have been one if I did not have to wake up early to register my car) and then I watched a good chunk of the show again with my mom, and I already want to watch the show again. Why? Two reasons: It is addictingly thrilling and there are actually some well hidden hints and Easter eggs scattered throughout.So while it does pander, it left me with a lot to think about. The games as a whole are somewhat of a representation of capitalism, which is not some pretentious high school theory, the director has said the show represents the class inequality in Korea. Think about it, here we have 455 disenfranchised individuals who are willing to risk their lives and kill others for money, many without a second thought. They even offer the players the chance to leave if the majority vote in favor of such a decision. This is a genius mechanism that I will get back to in a second. So the players are caged animals here. Behind the scenes, we have psychopathic aristocrats laughing there ass off and placing bets. Don\\'t you think some rich asshole funded this movie? The premise of this movie is not that different from life in these so called \"democratic\" nations. We slave away at jobs that pay next to nothing and if at any moment we, let\\'s say, need a surgery, we will be in debt for a good portion of the rest of our lives. We are basically the contestants in this show and the higher ups at the corporations we work at are the VIPS.This brings me back to the voting system. The players cannot stop playing the game but they can leave if the majority vote in favor of quitting. We can\\'t stop working or we will become homeless and die. But we can vote to tax the rich or increase the minimum wage, yet most of us are so enslaved to capitalism that we would write that off as communism because we aspire to become the next Elon Musk (think about how many college aged white dudes love Elon Musk. They worship a man who has enough to feed his entire country).Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I got political. It\\'s a touchy subject but it\\'s true and Squid Game is unafraid to speak out on it in a pretty haunting way.Anyway, I don\\'t really need to recommend this show to anyone. You\\'re most likely going to get sick of hearing about it and watch it like I did. Many of the obvious aspects of the show have already been talked about so I wanted to take a few moments to discuss some things the average viewer probably did not consider. It\\'s obviously a great show and you will probably see it.',\n",

How they would rather see everyone die at the chance of only one person surviving with all that money. Though the chance of them ending with the money was very slim. They did a such a great job at showing the intensity, the suspense, the plot twists. I loved the plot twist of the old man being behind it of it all. It was unpredictable, a lot of shows now a days can be very predictable but this show was just so incredible. The actors did a such a great job at expressing what their characters were feeling. There was so much expression on their faces at every scene to the point where the audience could feel their pain. I have to admit it made me tear up. This show was very gory, but anyone could learn a lot from it psychologically. It was truly, a great refreshing idea. Unlike any other show I've seen, I cannot wait for season 4!\",\n",
