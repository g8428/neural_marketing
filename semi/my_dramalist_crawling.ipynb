Watching this is like doing an unwanted chore. Such a waste of opportunity!\\n\\nAfter saving it in my to-watch list the first day I saw the trailer on Netflix, I cleared my Friday night schedule to binge all the episodes, prepared my popcorn, (and beer) popped the first episode and I'm hooked! The first episode was compelling and was such a gorefest, I thought it is exactly how I want my horror show. The very first attack by the school nurse was heartstopping and showed a lot of promise. Sadly, after the 3rd episode, I am snoozing like a baby, drools and all.\\n\\nMy expectations are low when it comes to horror. I come to be entertained and have a good time, and the more gruesome and the more bloody the better. Having said that, I have set my bar even lower for this series because I know it's teen-centric and I just want to enjoy and not nitpick details. This show, however, exceeded in delivering mind-numbing foolishness, and it's so easy to hate almost all characters that you can't stop wishing all of them would just be bitten.\\n\\nThe story is simple enough but could have been a goldmine of ideas and exciting scenarios. Instead, they dropped stupid and repetitive scenarios one after another. The character's eyes keep popping like a light bulb every time they think (or they think they thought of) of brilliant ideas to outsmart the zombies. You just can't help but cheer the zombies to finally have a go at it and just kill the characters:\\n1. One of the most frustrating is the way they handled Ohn Jo's father, they were building the story for him to be the big rescuer, and that he will do everything to save his daughter only to die minutes after reuniting with her. We were shouting at the screen when that happened cause they all clearly have a path to get away from the zombies, especially right after when he threw the first flare because it seems they can all go safely, Then, he unnecessarily threw the second and third flares. Very anti-climatic for his arc just to create the drama.\\n2. Seems like they were intent on just unnecessarily killing all the adults alive in the school to keep the narrative that the teens are on their own.\\n3. The vlogger was just a nuisance. I don't understand his importance to the story cause he did nothing at all.\\n4. Do I need to mention Chiong San's mom? What about his dad who mysteriously disappeared?\\n5, The police force. My goodness! I love Lee Kyu Hyung and even if his character here was almost the same as in Happiness, he is still also one of the few bright spots of the series. However, the whole Hyosan police force was just a dimwit bunch. Did you see how easy it was for the zombies to overrun the friggin police headquarters? The guys at the school put up a much better fight than these weakling cops. They got the main culprit -the brain behind the virus and they know the virus is spreading and you interrogate him like it's a normal crime? Has no one there thought of coordinating with the other agencies, and telling them that they have the crazy scientist, turn him over and make him do the antidote or something. No, they all panicked when the zombies attacked the police station, no one even thought of maybe finding some weapons because just maybe there are some because THEY ARE IN THE FRIGGIN POLICE STATION!\\n6. What about the assemblywoman? What's her actual contribution to the whole story?\\n7. Did you see how the teen mom tied her hands with that ribbon, to keep her from eating the baby? She's a zombie, not a gift box, that ribbon looks so thin that when she became a zombie she could have snapped it easily. Oh but that ribbon is made of steel and it held her overnight. And that baby? It must have superhuman powers to survive that long without milk.\\n8. The bullied girl in the rooftop. I was thinking they'd give her a recovery arc, but no, she is just as self-centered as her bullies. She was so happy to announce that she SET THE SCHOOL ON FIRE, but girl has to check that statement cause all she did was burn the papers in the office, nothing more. Hasn't she seen the fire sprinklers working? A fight between her and GwiNam could have been epic.\\n9. And OMG that bullied guy. I kinda understand why he did what he did on the rooftop, but then he was at the camp, met this girl, and he tells him I want to eat you, and then he just let her. That scenario alone could have opened a lot of possible chaotic scenarios inside the camp. I was kinda expecting the zombies to spread there, but no, nothing of that sort. It's like the guy's existence is just to make the abandonment of the kids in the rooftop climatic, which by the way is not.\\n10. I would like to mention the countless stupid ways to escape a zombie apocalypse but this is already way too long.\\n\\nThey even spent almost an episode literally talking about shit. They complained about thirst and hunger but didn't bother to find food and water and yet they spent quite some time teaching us how to do the number 2 during an apocalypse.\\n\\nWhat makes it sadder, is that I find not a single character to latch on to - not the drama queen, not her puppy best friend, not the pretend goody goody jock, not even the smartass who could have been their gifted savior. What they delivered instead was a puke-invoking bunch of whiny pimpled teenage characters who can't stop talking about their silly crushes and quite a few useless adult characters who makes selfish and terrible decisions.\\n\\nThere are only two characters I didn't hate- Gwi Nam is a scary psycho and the funny delinquent Mi-Jin. Had they shifted the focus to these two, they could have created a witty frightening gore. I just have to add that my favorite part was when they were on the rooftop and singing cause that felt sincere.\\n\\nI can't help but wonder why this show got a 12-episode order as opposed to Kingdom which has 6 per season and Sweet Home which has 10. The show could have used a lot of editing and maybe it will feel better if it was just 8 or even 10.\\n\\nI recommend having a go at it using your mobile device, that way you can change the playback speed, otherwise, if you're watching on your smart tv just have the remote ready and just feel free to skip the boring parts. I promise you, you won't miss anything. Hard to rewatch, unfortunately.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n8.0\\nStory\\n8.5\\nActing/Cast\\n8.5\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n8.0\\nDying is easy, surviving is hard\\nAll of Us Are Dead is adapted from the serialized Naver digital webtoon entitled Now at Our School, which was written by Joo Dong Geun and published from 2009 to 2011. I haven’t read the webtoon but it reportedly consists of only nine chapters. Therefore it would probably stand to reason that the live-action adaptation has expanded on its lore, especially when Netflix is involved where the potential exists for a series to be renewed for a second season, depending on the success of the first season.\\n\\nThe drama is co-directed by Lee Jae Gyoo, who won a Baeksang for Damo and directing honours for Beethoven Virus, and Kim Nam Soo. It is based on the screenplay adaptation written by Cheon Seong Il, the screenwriter for Chuno and The Pirates. Principal photography took place from June 2020 to February 2021, which was prolonged due to the Covid-19 outbreak during filming.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, the story revolves around a group of highschool students who are trapped at their school, the ground zero for the onset of a zombie virus outbreak. The drama depicts them fighting to survive both the zombies and virus infection while waiting to be rescued. The rating classification for this production is R-18 and aside from the expected zombie action and gore, certain trigger warnings are present in the form of bullying violence that even borders on sexual assault.\\n\\nIn a recent interview with director Lee Jae Gyoo via the online presentation of the production in South Korea on 26th January, he had intimated that this drama would be uniquely distinct within the K-drama zombie genre that has become commonplace in recent years. According to him, All of Us Are Dead features thought-provoking themes that add a different meaning to a zombie apocalypse, where the focus is on the choices young students make at the boundary between life and death. In addition, the story also provides a satirical take on South Korea's educational system and school space.\\n\\nWhat I Liked\\n\\nI love the K-drama zombie genre and anything closely or even remotely associated in the form of mutants, monsters and the like, complete with the horror, action, adventure tags whether in contemporary, sageuk or fantasy settings. As much as I’ve enjoyed the recently aired Happiness, my preference for zombies leans towards the more feral variety with hordes of them rampaging through the populace annihilating anything and everything in their path, in the mould of Train to Busan (which gets a shoutout in this drama), Kingdom and Rampant. Call me sadistic but I’m all for epic levels of productions with economies of scale in delivering the exhilaration of the action, thrills and suspense, along with all the emotive aspects of human drama as well. Based on what I’ve seen of the depiction of zombies in this drama, it manages to convey all of the above, and has successfully fulfilled most, if not all, of my expectations.\\n\\nA co-production between JTBC Studios’ Film Monster and Kim Jong Hak Production for Netflix, the quality of the technical execution is beyond doubt. No effort or budget was spared as even a huge four-storey set was constructed as the setting of the fictional Hyosan High School. The money was very well spent indeed as the production design looks top notch with all the nitty gritty details providing an intriguing backdrop to the zombie outbreak. The zombies themselves are deftly manifested in terms of the makeup, special and sound effects, as well as the blood, gore and contortions which complement the extensive range of expertly choreographed sequences.\\n\\nThe cinematography is deserving of praise with the crucial aspect for productions of this nature being the calibre of the camerawork, which for the most part does not let me down (or induce nausea). The well rendered scene transitions are testament to the standard of editing as well, where it’s worth mentioning that the chaotic scenes at the cafeteria and library involving 200 or so extras are reportedly the result of a single-take shooting.\\n\\nAs far as the narrative is concerned, the premise of a school-based zombie outbreak is refreshingly new to me. Some viewers may associate elements of Dark Hole to be of similar vein but personally it really isn’t despite the comparable vibes. While I wouldn’t consider the overall plot trajectory as particularly inventive or groundbreaking, what distinguishes this drama from most others that I’ve seen is the storytelling approach.\\n\\nIn addition to the multiple POV perspectives of the main characters, the screenplay takes its time to explore the origins of the zombie outbreak and motivations behind the actions resulting in the said virus being unleashed on humanity. The depiction of characters dealing with the tragic circumstances in the aftermath certainly elicits an emotional response as well.\\n\\nTrue to the director's word, this drama tackles both existing and hypothetical societal concerns which provide added dimensions to the storytelling. Among the thought provoking themes incorporated into the storytelling - unchecked and unmitigated school violence, the ingrained hierarchical social order within a society segmented by wealth and power, the deeply polarised mindsets of the local government and communities in the event of an apocalypse or the aftermath of a mass casualty event. The role that technology plays in binding all these themes together is tackled as well in the form of the ever increasing reliance on and abuse of social media as an outlet that fuels the dissemination of actual and fake news.\\n\\nThe infusion of a number of side stories, character arcs and a narrative that steadily evolves as the drama progresses helped to allay my initial concerns of the story sustaining its momentum over 12 episodes. The dynamic between characters giving rise to various forms of conflicts, teen angst, and even hints of romance contribute towards preserving an atmosphere filled with tension and suspense. That said, I do think the drama could have been slightly shortened without adversely impacting the storytelling.\\n\\nThe main cast is made up of young actors, some of whom were prolific child actors and even critically acclaimed talent as well. Park Ji Hoo, Yoon Chan Young, Jo Yi Hyun, Park Solomon and Yoo In Soo portray the highschool students who are caught up in the ensuing chaos. Featuring roles of varying capacities, these youngsters provide a decent account of themselves through characterizations that are adequately written, for the most part. Lee Yoo Mi is particularly impressive here following her brief appearance in Squid Game, given her experience of being the oldest actress portraying a student and for her captivating portrayal of the antagonistic Lee Na Yeon that actually steals the scenes from the protagonists at times. Meanwhile, I would consider Park Solomon’s affable Lee Soo Hyuk, Jo Yi Hyun’s stoic Choi Nam Ra and Ha Seung Ri’s heroic archer Jang Ha Ri as my favourite characters amongst the students.\\n\\nThe supporting cast come across as being more familiar, where we get to observe Kim Byung Chul (Sisyphus, Doctor Prisoner), Lee Kyu Hyung (Happiness, Voice 4), Lee Yo Mi (Squid Game), Uhm Hyo Sub (King of Tears, War of the Son) , Bae Hae Seon (Happiness, Inspector Koo, HomeCha), Jeon Bae Soo (Stranger, Lawless Lawyer), Kim Jong Tae (The Veil, Sisyphus), and Yoon Byung Hee (Hot Stove League). The more nuanced acting in the drama is provided by these mostly experienced veterans, especially Kim Byung Chul as science teacher Lee Byeong Chan. Utterly intense, sinister, and convincing, unsurprisingly the best performance in the entire drama comes from this award-winning actor. Jeon Bae Soo gets to play the hero this time in a memorable performance as firefighter Nam So Ju.\\n\\nWhat I Didn’t Appreciate\\n\\nWhen it comes to K-dramas and school students, bullying and violence are par for the course - they’re never far away and will probably remain as a staple trope. It’s infuriating and disturbing to watch at times and seems to be escalating in brutality these days. The scale of the savagery seems to be higher than the actual zombie action itself but it’s something that all viewers of K-content will need to accept and get used to, unfortunately.\\n\\nThe main villain of the story is featured through the gangster wannabe and low-life bully Yoon Gwi Nam, played almost too well by Yoo In Soo. This despicable human thrash has the typical clichéd story arc that stretches far too long, in my opinion, before eventually fizzling out as a mere afterthought.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, I think the storytelling would have been better presented if it were slightly shorter, perhaps with 8 or so episodes.Despite the multiple POVs, too much time is allocated to the teen drama at school than is perhaps necessary. I would have liked to have seen Kim Byung Chul’s character more fleshed out in real time rather than merely as a series of flashbacks. The same goes for Jeon Bae Soo’s firefighter who is desperately trying to get to his daughter.\\n\\nThere are numerous annoying characters in this drama, some of whom supposedly supplying the usual ill-fitting comic relief that appears very much jarring to the senses.The tough girl wannabe and her whingeing companion, the cowardly police sergeant, and the bickering couples, to name a few. I think generally the boys are better written than the girls who come across as petty and physically abusive towards their male counterparts, as far as the youngsters are concerned.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\nAll things considered and despite its flaws as well as the overly dramatic ending that has the potential for expansion either as a sequel or a side story, I had a great time mainly because of my love for horror and zombies. We honestly do need more zombie stories because there is too much romance, rom-coms and melodrama in dramaland already and simply not enough of the macabre flesh-eating, blood-sucking undead. All of Us Are Dead is not the best in the genre, where Kingdom still reigns supreme, but as a one-time weekend watch it definitely fulfils my insatiable hunger for such content, albeit temporarily.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n4.0\\nActing/Cast\\n8.5\\nMusic\\n9.0\\nRewatch Value\\n3.0\\nZZZZZombies\\nI've been waiting for this drama to air for an obscenely long time, I cleared my schedule today to fully binge this and I’ve got to say, I’m disappointed. There's a lot to be said and I’m sure some people enjoy it, but there's just very little to redeem the story and its ridiculous rabbit holes.\\n\\nSTORY\\nThere's really nothing special about this story despite the fact the very idea of a zombie outbreak at a school gives a lot to work with. The writers stuff so many different plot points and social issues into the script and they're never fully elaborated on. But the worst thing is the fact the writers don't have something to say. Instead of the perceived problem of the message becoming too preachy, in a way common to the genre, there just seems to be no message at all. They touch on bullying, teen pregnancy, harassment, etc but there's nothing to be gained from it, you leave the viewing experience underwhelmed and slightly annoyed (especially because of the ending). There could've been many explorations in this story, a dive into pure human nature, an interesting perspective on strength, a deep look at grief. Instead, there are plot twists that make no sense, random characters and stories that have zero effect on the story, death without meaning, and repetitive plot points that leave you bored and exhausted. Some characters are interesting while others are one-note, with most characters having disappointing wrap-ups to their arcs/lives. Every aspect of the story is a complete letdown. It feels like the story writers missed an English class in 5th grade and forgot that every story needs to have a theme, subject, and message... My frustration really cannot be expressed properly, it is genuinely a shame.\\n\\nACTING\\nI'm going to link this acting and these characters together because in all honesty most of these characters are completely flat, we follow them for over 10 hours yet somehow know nothing about them or their motivations. But the cast! These kids are all wonderful, some of the side characters are uninteresting but even then their bonds with the mains and each other seem real and interesting, The main cast, especially Yoon Chanyoung, Yoo Insoo, and Jo Yihyun, are truly amazing, often showing up their older counterparts with the depth they managed to bring their characters. The true strength of this show is based entirely on how the actors managed to bounce off each other and deliver spectacularly when the camera decided to point at them. The show would be much worse off without this cast.\\n\\nMUSIC/OTHER\\nI'm not an ost person so music has never had much of a deciding factor, the instrumentals were good if forgettable. I'd actually like to talk about the choreography of the fight scenes and visual effects. They were INCREDIBLE!! There were fight scenes in every episode and every one made use of beautiful staging techniques and were a delight to watch. The zombies ere really terrifying to see and the ever present threat was only heightened by the lovely special effects. The dance choreographers and VFX designers really delivered.\\n\\nREWATCH VALUE\\nLike I said, there's really nothing of merit in the story and I feel like rewatching would make that even more pronounced.\\n\\nOVERALL\\nTo be honest I really wanted to love this drama. with everything in me I really did, but the plot and its meanderings are just really hard to bear... I really hope it does well though because this cast has some really special talent and id hate to see it go to waste.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n8.5\\nStory\\n8.0\\nActing/Cast\\n8.5\\nMusic\\n4.0\\nRewatch Value\\n7.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nPromising Outbreak but Questionable Ending\\nThe premise of \"All of Us Are Dead\" like the korean title \"지금 우리 학교는\" or \"Our School Now\" is centered on students who tried their best to stay alive from being trapped in their school through zombie apocalypse. All of Us Are Dead has 12 episodes with 1 hour long duration. Some viewer might find the story dragging, but I didn\\'t at all. How and why I find this drama fun and engaging? Mostly because I got to watch the story from several different perspective, desperate teen survivor, detective and his framed science teacher, also military and political government.\\n\\n[ Promising Outbreak ]\\nUnlike most of zombie series that started with main character\\'s everyday life and the sudden zombie outbreak, All of Us Are Dead began with the background story of the virus itself. The starting plot is around a student who get bullied and how this character developed the virus from his science teacher father who helped his own son from death. It is then unfold from his laboratory room and how the infected bring their zombie virus from inside and outside the school. I appreciated how the writer put the issue of school violence into the root of the zombie virus. The emotional story from the parents of surviving student was also my favorite. I always love how South Korean included \\'heartwarming\\' family plot onto their series and ended it harshly for tearjerking scenes.\\n\\nThe story is shifted from time to time but it is all still connected into one because the school background setting is labeled ground zero for the outbreak. They blend the detective, military, and the political side into the story pretty well. We got to see the view on characters who truly wanted to help surviving people, who just wanted to save the non infected citizen, and who wanted to save their own ass on status seat even in harsh condition. Back to the main characters and their zombie battle at school. The main characters here are the surviving Hyosan Students, that funnily were all in the same class. What is the possibility of you and your classmates to survive together in zombie outbreak? This drama writer be like, \"Hell yeah, 99%. It is fiction so of course there would be impossible events, what would you expect?\"\\n\\n[ Questionable Ending ]\\nIt wasn\\'t an ideal one but I didn\\'t know a better way to end this drama. The drama has an open ending like our real life Covid-19 situation, there is no light to see the end. I must mention i noticed there is some reference on \"Sewol Ferry\" accident in episode 12 where the survivors are being interrogated. If you don\\'t know about it, try google search. It was heartbreaking real life tragedy of high school students who was abandoned by the official staff and government by leaving them drowning on sinking ferry. The student victims trusted the adults too much that they had to die in the end. So the dialogue \"Why did you abandon us?\" and \"I won\\'t ask adults ever again, don\\'t ask us to cooperate.\" hit me in the feels. Not a perfect ending of course, afterall especially in our pandemic situation, which government have done a perfect job on taking care difficult problem? None.\\n\\nBut, how about the fantasy side from the virus and zombie? Yeah like when Nam Ra jumped from high school building, they once again left us with cliff hangers. I didn\\'t get bothered by it, but I just wished to see more depth into their characters before the ending. What I find disappointing was how they started the \\'virus making\\' well but they unfortunately leave the \\'mutant making\\' with full of hanging reasons. There was definitely a chance for them to show more of background stories from Half Zombie characters \"The Bully Guy\", \"The Sexy Girl\", and \"The Students Pres\". Unfortunately we didn\\'t get them until the end and we only could imagine and assume by ourselves.\\n\\n[ Characters... Are Dead ]\\nI personally really hate the romance between main characters. It is as if they tell us, we have to crush on someone to be the main characters. Will it be okay without it? of course. If only their focus is more about friendship than love story, I think it will be more moving and affecting in a good way. Like my favorite scenes from the farewell between Cheong San and Gyeong Su, On Jo and Yi Sak throwback, and also Na Yeon character development story. I also find the supporting roles are more interesting, the two archery ladies, crybaby Na Yeon, chicken part timer wannabe Gyeong Sang, the realistic Ji Min, 2nd rank student ( i forgot his name ), the brother in law guy, and more! In comparison, the four main characters are more bland than the supporting characters to me.\\n\\nIs their acting good enough? At first, both female lead actress looks awkward in my eyes, but they get better each episodes when they are mourning deaths and countering difficult situation. Male leads chemistry are the best, I like their bromance and I wish to see them in other projects. All of the supporting casts and the minor roles have amazing acting and they delivered their emotion admirably. I must mention the zombie stunt are perfect, plus point on cracking bones acting.\\n\\n[ Zombies... Are Alive ]\\nInstead of creepy or dark atmosphere, All of Us Are Dead zombies are more gory full of blood ripped flesh and average people would find it disturbing. Most of them are executed on VFX and negative side we can actually notice it because the overall bright cinematography. There would be some plot hole in their action scenes and some people could get bothered by it. Like how the heck those zombie didn\\'t get killed from third-floor fall but immediately died from a single arrow, but I personally didn\\'t mind it because it was all for \"plot armour\" and just passed it by. I myself hardly get scared with zombie genre and I find most of the zombies here are hilarious. Believe me, I laughed a lot on suitcase, traffic cone, scissors, and kindergarten zombies. I repeated their scenes for comedic relief.\\n\\n[ Music... Are Splashed Everywhere ]\\nI don\\'t know what to say here. I don\\'t remember any single background music in All of Us Are Dead and I just remember all the special sound effect of tearing flesh, splashing blood, and purking. But that is what made me focus on their action and dialogue between characters.\\n\\n[ Overall... Watch it When You Are Alive ]\\nOne you can expect from south korean zombie series is their focus on survival. I like this show from episode 1 to 12. It is a fun experience to see all perspective of students victim of harsh accident trying to get into safety in school area. There are a lot of cool extraordinary action scenes when they tried avoiding the zombies. The thrilling moments and in between relief of breath are exciting for me. The overall cinematography are also excellent, they have this green color grading perfect for image\\'s depth, contrast, and contour to support the story\\'s atmosphere. The behind production team is top notch. I didn\\'t read this drama webtoon because I didn\\'t want to get disappointed like I did with Sweet Home. That was my choice and I think that was the best decision for me. Because in the end, I mostly enjoyed All of Us Are Dead from the beginning until the end.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n9.0\\nStory\\n8.0\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n9.0\\nRewatch Value\\n9.0\\nIs it more than your regular Zombie drama?\\nZombie dramas have its own fan-base. You either like such gore dramas or hate them. Of-course it is the story that matters at the end of the drama. I feel that the suddenness of a zombie popping out of places you least expect from and the survivors instinct of the dramas cast makes it thrilling for the viewers.\\nComing back to the 'All of us are dead' drama. I was waiting for this drama for a long time and I binged watched the entire drama as soon as it came in my country. Even though the drama had its fair share of plot holes and a not so likeable Main FL the drama was a one hell of a thrilling ride. And what I loved is its long list of good actors in it. At points the decision made by the student may seem immature but we have to keep in mind that they were only high school students. It is thrilling to watch them trying to stay alive between a horde of zombies. The drama started as your regular high school bullying drama but it quickly changed gears. The story was pretty fast moving too and it never felt dull at a long interval. I feel that the first half of the drama was far better than the second half pf the drama.\\nBetween all blood and death also there were some nice characters to watch. Namely Lee Cheong San, Song Jae Ik [Detective], Jang Ha Ri and a few more characters. I personally didn't liked the FL. Even though she was a good actor.\\nAt the end I would like to say is that it is quite a nice watch for the Zombie lovers out there. I am giving it an 9 rather than a 10 is because I think something that makes the drama wow is missing from this drama and I personally didn't liked the end that much. Hopefully we get answers about it in the future.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n6.0\\nStory\\n6.0\\nActing/Cast\\n7.0\\nMusic\\n6.0\\nRewatch Value\\n4.5\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nFrustrating Female Lead and Unlimited Plot holes\\nAll of us are dead can be said as a high budget series with beautiful shots and gory details and props, but for me that was the only good thing about the series. Well, I can also add that most of the actors are really good too especially the veterans than we mostly recognized immediately in episode 1. It is enjoyable to watch in the sense that we can see that the production team did spend a lot of money for this series, the camera angles, the blood and the realistic entrails was fascinating to watch but that was all for me. The actors acting was wasted by the story line, all of the lead actors did tried their best to deliver their characters well and this is the problem, the female lead become frustratingly useless and stupid and all throughout the series I was exclaiming to my sister that she needs to get her priorities straight. I mean how stupid can you get if she keeps on whining about her crush instead of prioritizing her own life to survive and then telling your oldest friend that everyone that you hold dear in your life is either a zombie or missing ( girl best friend and crush) so she didn’t want to live anymore. She needed to be reminded about her father who might be worried and doing all that he can do to save her before she realize that she still has someone waiting for her to live. Aside from that she was useless and weak compare to her other classmates and there are so many side story that in the end wasn’t particularly necessary to have.\\n\\nThere is also a lot of plot holes that was so funny to watch that my sister and I keep asking each other if we have miss something because that wasn’t possible to happen. One of those is that magic towel that seems to materialized in the roof top, where could have they gotten that one when they have nothing on them when they were running towards the roof top and the inconsistencies of the “Hambies” power. The difference between Gwi nam, Eun Ji and Nam ra’s abilities were so unfair and I know they are zombies but Gwi nam keeps on reviving everytime when everyone else just die after a major blow to their bodies. There is also the fact that it wasn’t establish what sets them apart from the other zombies, I refused to believe that the will of the father and mother of the male lead and female lead isn’t as strong as the will of Gwi nam to get revenge on Cheong san. Overall, if you just want a good ol’ gory horror film with a lot of meaningless deaths and stupid decision this can be a good series to watch if you have nothing to watch.\\n\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n10\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n9.0\\nRewatch Value\\n10\\nI can't explain but this series has my whole heart\\nAhhh.. this is so fascinating especially the fact that they have actual choreographers for the zombie movements! i thought that was very unique!! i hope all their hardwork pays off, because i can already tell this is going to be truly phenomenal!

Indeed, Netflix’s latest venture into the world of zombies, ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’, enjoyed making several ironic and passing popular-culture references to the heavily influential zombie flick . Nevertheless director Lee Jae Gyo and screenwriter Chun Sung II’s zombie survival series , ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ , delivered a grisly and somewhat niche insight into the world of zombies, teen-angst and everything in-between…\\n\\nBased upon Joo Dong Geun’s popular and original webcomic ‘ Now At Our School’, the twelve-episode Netflix series begins on a rainy rooftop in the fictional South-Korean province named Hyosan. A group of high school bullies ( “ iljins”) are shown to be relentlessly tormenting their fellow classmate, Jin-Su. Yet as their punches and beatings become notably more savage and violent , Jin-Su’s reactions to the conflict gradually change also. The gentle pleas of the meek teen suddenly turn into savage and animalistic snarls as Jin-Su’s gentle attitude soon begins to mimic an untamed and feral beast.\\n\\nAfter the aftermath of the violent fight scene, viewers are left shocked but aware of the gradual domino effect as revelations and further mysteries are soon brought to light.\\n\\nA time-skip forwards to the beginning of a new school day at Hyosan High School, brings forward the viewers’ attention towards Kim Hyeon-ju (Jung Yi-seo), an inquisitive high-school student , who unknowingly becomes patient zero to the mysterious zombie virus. Unsurprisingly, it is only a matter of time before there is a sudden snowball effect of rising infections throughout the school.\\n\\nCaught up in the maelstrom of pandemonium and hysteria, the remaining survivors, including Chung-san (Yoon Chan-young), On-jo (Park Ji-hoo), Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun), Lee Soo-hyuk (Park Solomon), Yoo Gwi-nam (Yoo In-soo) and Lee Na-yeon (Lee Yoo-mi) , are left to grapple with unimaginable horrors, sacrifices and truths along the way…\\n\\n‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ isn’t a series for the lighthearted. Bloodthirsty and brutal from beginning to end, Chung Sung II’s screenplay was gratuitously gory, disturbing and not afraid to delve into some darker subject areas either. However, whilst gore and bloodshed is to be expected in a storyline revolving around the flesh-eating undead, ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ often felt somewhat distracted by its own investment into grotesque and shock-value carnage also. As a consequence, this notably presented limited opportunities into enforcing pathos and sentimental value for viewers towards its wide ensemble of main characters.\\n\\nThe acting range of ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ was a slight mixed-bag. The main cast, specifically Cho Yi-hyeon, Lee Yoo-Mi and Yoon Chan Young, were undeniably dynamic and brilliant onscreen. On the other hand, certain performances from particular costars could feel somewhat inconsistent due to a mixed range of line deliverances and acting abilities also.\\n\\nNevertheless despite some arguably questionable moments of implicit violence, ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ did surprisingly offer some crisper moments of respite also. Heartfelt interactions and teen-angst allowed golden-opportunities to exploit the unspoken realities of teenage shenanigans- bullying, social hierarchies, blackmail, peer pressure and sexual assault were notably addressed and touched upon within the drama’s social commentary. However despite certain commendation being deserved towards Chun Sung II and director Lee Jae Gyo‘s tackled subject areas , the attempt to tackle copious amounts of different topics take on against a dystopian zombie apocalypse backdrop, often led to a somewhat ham-fisted approach towards potentially impactful and prominent messages and critiques. In particular by the finale of the series, the overindulgence of subject areas began to slowly slip through the cracks and gave way to the sheer pandemonium of gritty teen-angst.\\n\\nAs for the delivered pace of narrative, Chung Sung II’s screenplay was notably fast-paced and adrenal-infused during initial episodes. However after the fanatic chaos of initial episodes, screenwriter Chung Sung II began to notably downplay chase scenes and conflict in order to draw further attention towards the setups, dilemmas and scenarios of the plot instead. However, this screenwriting decision did present a double-edged sword for the narrative; insightful moments focusing on the storyline did allow opportunities to explore the scope of characters and subplots, whilst also being heavily burdened by a repetitive pattern of storyline events in later episodes.\\n\\nIn particular this became noticeable the following setup; the ragtag team of teens would become wary of one another and drift apart, an external conflict would force them to band together again as a team, a member of the team would decide to embrace their inner-messiah and self-sacrifice themselves, before a teary and angst-ridden resolution would turn the mood somber as the characters remembered their fallen classmate, and then repeat.\\n\\nNevertheless, director Jae Gyu’s eye for detail was admittedly fairly commendable within the chosen filming techniques under his directing reign. Whilst the single-camera setup was admittedly a minimalistic approach to filming, Jae Gyu’s usage of changing gradients, darkening tones, angles and key and unobtrusive focus upon the characters and scenarios will truly immerse viewers into the events of the series. The usage of an OST was notably comprised mainly of instrumentals- hoping to draw attention in particular to a synchronic usage of music and imagery, rather than lyrics alone.\\n\\n‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ offered viewers with a bloodthirsty and angst-ridden zombie drama which whilst certainly delivering an impactful bite into social themes, brutality, imagery and tension, the series often felt as though it but off more than it could chew at times within a lacking scope of character development, writing opportunities and divergence. The ending of the series was notably an unexpected twist which highly delved into a notably more somber tone. Whilst the finale may differ for viewers dependent on expectations, the conclusion certainly did leave some intriguing food for thought also. Overall ‘ All Of Us Are Dead’ is a pacy binge-watch; notably without its questionable flaws, repetitiveness and tropes, but tense enough to keep viewers hooked upon shock-value and adrenaline also.\\nRead More', 'Overall\\n7.5\\nStory\\n7.5\\nActing/Cast\\n8.0\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n7.0\\nHow far will you go in order to survive?\\n\"All of us are dead\" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn\\'t fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.\\n\\nAs the drama consists a very high number of brutal and gore scenes, in addition with bulling and sexual harassment, it\\'s not for the lighthearted. The drama\\'s extreme violence made the drama at times really disturb and difficult to watch. If you know you can\\'t bear it, then avoid it.\\n\\nAs for the drama\\'s pace, the first episode is slow but the drama in general is very fast paced because it contains many action scenes. As the drama is very suspenseful and stressful to offset seriousness, and make the drama easier to watch, at times it has some comic reliefs. Thus, every episode is good watching experience. As it\\'s a 12-episode drama though, it\\'s difficult to binge-watch it right away.\\n\\n\\nThe Story\\n\\n\"All of us are dead\" is based on a webtoon by the same name, written by Joo Dong-Geun. The original run of the webtoon was from May, 13th 2009 to November, 9th 2011. The story mainly revolves around the struggle for survival of the students who were trapped in the ground zero for the zombie virus, the school.\\n\\nWebtoon comparison\\n\\nThe drama adaptation has many differences with the original story that gave it some advantages and disadvantages. I will analyze some of these changes below.\\n\\n1. The beginning\\nUnlike the original story, which starts straight away, the drama invests some time to set the characters background. The advantage of this change was that the viewers had the time to get to know the characters so it was easier later to understand their motives and empathize with them. The disadvantage of this change was that the first episode was slow and it may be boring for some of the viewers.\\n\\n2. The center of the story\\nIn both stories the center of the drama was the school, but in the drama, we see a lot of subplots outside the school that originally didn\\'t exist, or they weren\\'t fully developed. That way, we see a more global picture of the events that took place under the zombie apocalypse. For example, the overall government\\'s response was more carefully written and seemed more logical and comprehensive in drama.\\n\\nThe disadvantage of this change was that some of the extra subplots were completely unnecessary (and illogical) and that could easily put off some viewers (which in my case happened).\\n\\n3. Characters & relations\\nAs the drama consists of many extra scenes and subplots, some of the characters are extra too. Apart from this, some of the original characters have different storylines, deaths and relationships from the original story. As for the storyline, the actions of a lot of characters changed but their personalities remained the same. As far as the dead are concerned, the only thing that changed was the cause or the timing of their death. This change was neutral for me as the results were the same as the webtoon.\\n\\n4. Action\\nThe drama is filled with a huge amount of action scenes and almost all of them aren\\'t part of the original story. On the one hand, the action made the drama a thrilling watching experience as some of them were pretty amazing. On the other hand, as far as the story\\'s events are concerned, due to the action \"overdose\" the story got draggy. This affected the characters also because, even though they had better and more complete background and relations than the webtoon, the necessary time for them to develop through the episodes, wasn\\'t given.\\n\\n5. The virus\\' origin\\nThe virus origin that causes the zombie apocalypse is different in the drama. I can\\'t analyze this in detail because I don\\'t want to spoil it. What can I say is that in the drama they tried to make a full background of the virus and support it with sci-fi biology elements which was pretty convincing for someone who doesn\\'t know about biology. Again, this was an advantage for the drama.\\n\\n6. The ending\\nBoth endings have many similarities but the webtoon ends while the drama may require a second season. As the webtoon has ended, the second season of the drama will be completely unrelated with the original story. The writers don\\'t have elements to base a second season on, so it\\'s unsure if a second season will be released or if it will end up being a good sequence of the story. This change may be a big disadvantage for someone who doesn\\'t like incomplete stories but at least the story has a closure so maybe it\\'s less frustrating.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe drama and the webtoon have countless differences which have both negative and positive effects on the story. We can say that the drama\\'s story is loose based on the webtoon as it just kept the story skeleton and created a new one. In general, I think the adaptation can be considered as a good one.\\n\\nMy overall impression of the drama’s story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.\\n\\nThe production & Acting\\n\\nThe greatest thing about this drama, it\\'s its production and directing, they were just amazing. Maybe \"All of us are dead\" has one of the best productions a Netflix original kdrama has. From the VFX to the zombie’s make-up, to the choreographed action scenes, to the scene’s shots and transitions, everything was perfectly and meticulously made. The music on the other hand was the weakest part of the production as it wasn\\'t so memorable to me and it felt a little off from time to time.\\n\\nThe acting in general was okay. As I\\'ve said before, the drama mainly had action scenes so the actors didn\\'t have enough to work with and create multi-dimensional characters with complex emotions. Some actors, though, manage to shine and catch my attention as a viewer. These were Yoo Chan Young, Jo Yi Hyun and Park Solomon.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\n\"All of us are dead\" was a drama with a mediocre typical story about zombies. It doesn\\'t have the touching story of \"Train to Busan”, the mysterious aura of \"Kingdom\", the uniqueness of \"Sweet Home\" or \"Happiness\" but it has one of the best productions of zombie action scenes which makes it a very decent and solid zombie drama. So, if you\\'re looking for a drama for zombies with impressive action elements, watch it for sure. You won\\'t be disappointed.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n7.5\\nStory\\n7.5\\nActing/Cast\\n7.5\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n7.5\\nNamhyeok supremacy\\nI have to start this off with my favorite part of — Suhyeok and Namra, who totally stole the show, both individually and together. I just loved Namra's character arc in particular, and though romance is by no means a main focus of this show, their scenes are the ones I keep going back to rewatch.\\n\\nWith that being said, I think it was really good that romance wasn't a main focus, and yet it was there in certain light-hearted moments, reminding us that these characters are still kids who deal with crushes and first kisses and butterflies. I think both of the main relationships were done absolutely beautiful and we got just the right amount for them.\\n\\nI think my main criticism with this is just the massive amount of unnecessary characters there are. I liked the two main groups for sure (although I admit some of those characters felt extra — it was as if they were to die in case someone needed to be killed off) and some of the peripheral characters like parents, and I anxiously awaited moments where their paths would cross. But other than that, there were a lot of other character groups and arcs that took up time and got incomplete arcs like the politician, the livestreamer, or the pregnant girl; I either didn't care for those or were downright annoyed with them. Even some of the characters that were more relevant kind of had their character development swerving off-kilter in a non-sensical way.\\n\\nI also felt like the last episode was really rushed; I felt like taking out some of those unnecessary characters and spending more time with the main group could have given the changes in the last episode more screentime — I also wouldn't have been opposed to having this be a full 16-episodes so we could see more about the aftermath and maybe get an ending that was more satisfying. It currently stands a bit bittersweet and I have mixed feelings on that.\\n\\nIn conclusion - watch for Suhyeok and Namra.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n8.5\\nStory\\n8.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n8.5\\nHighschool of the Dead ?\\nAre you dead in this zombie year? ?\\nIF Not, I think every zombie lover and no lover should watch this mainly because of its top-notch VFX.\\nThough I find some of the acts are little sloppy but the overall story is well executed.

The action scenes were tense and nicely done. It was entertaining enough that I don't regret watching this.\\n\\nDislikes:\\n- There were no real likeable characters. No one stood out. And because the characters weren't fleshed out enough, I didn't feel a connection with any of them so I wasn't really rooting for anyone that strongly. Nobody really left an impression.\\n- I especially didn't like the character of Ohn Jo. She was so dull (as with most of the female characters for most of the drama) Having one of the main characters be so dull was a wrong move.\\n-Lack of clear leads. I wasn't sure half the time who were supposed to be the main leads. Is it Cheong San/Ohn Jo? Or is it Nam ra/Soo Hyuk? I think if the drama had focused on the Nam ra/ Soo Hyuk arc , fleshed that out a bit more and also the hybrid changes that Nam ra was going through, the drama would have been more interesting.\\n-Lack of depth in the story arcs. Like what was the purpose of the detective, his partner, the baby, and little girl? They added no value to the story. And the whole arc of Ohn Jo and her father was kind of a let down. And the purpose of introducing the arrow shooting nuna so late in the game?\\n-Draggy moments. Not gonna lie. I did FF a little in the draggy parts.\\n\\nOverall disappointing? Yes, but I was still entertained enough mainly due to my love for the zombie chase. Would I watch this again? No. Would I watch another season?

Every month they brought something really worth for time. All of us are dead probably one of the best zombie thriller i have had watched in recent time. The concept of zombie is now become a cliché, even though this whole drama was a different experience.\\n\\nThis is a webtoon adaptation with same name, the episodes numbers were increased which was unusual for a Netflix Orginal drama also some episode length were little bit high. Some people may feel little dragging in the middle and its understandable because they slowly making this whole atmosphere more and more intense. The making was one of the key factor. Its just unbelievable every time when you watching a zombie thriller. The performance of all those zombie looks scary, here also it's insane.\\n\\nI didn't felt much of a dragging in the screenplay as i already mentioned they slowly developing the seriousness of the situation. May be we can predict almost every scene that coming next but still some breathtaking moments were there, which gives you a different experience for sure. The performance of the leads was good especially some stories like this, there is always have one or two annoying character who gets all attention, that feels super cliché. But eventually you get annoyed and that's what the makers want.\\n\\nThe emotional scenes, Friendship, little bit of romance also little bit of love triangle, everything was good and perfect fit.

Then this isn\\'t it.\\nI was very excited about this one. In the pictures, it looked so good. The trailer was well-made and was hype material. And it\\'s gotten quite popular as well. I couldn\\'t wait to binge this since I have seen Kingdom, Train to Busan, Sweet Home (Not exactly zombies but monsters/survival type) and thought maybe they\\'re good with these themes. But I was mistaken.\\n\\nThe problem with All of Us Are Dead is how stereotypical it is. The main character is the childhood friend of the female main character and they also have two other friends with them. There is the \"Hot Oppa\" type of character who is very righteous and very strong. There is the quiet class president who\\'s the topper of the class and is very smart but no one likes her because they all assume that she doesn\\'t like them as well. There is also this annoying girl who\\'s literally annoying for no reason at all. I can go on and on. These characters feel like I\\'ve seen them before in so many different media. And a major problem is how they act so stiff. It doesn\\'t feel like they are real characters making real decisions. It\\'s almost like the series itself wants these characters to stay between a set of tropes and never do something different.\\n\\nThere is this one character (who I will not specify for spoiler reasons) who stays true to their stereotype in almost all of the episodes. And almost an entire episode was dedicated to their character, we get to see how they are finally starting to change as a character, and right after that moment, the character dies. My question is, why? What was the point of wasting that much time over that character if they were gonna die with zero development? Unfortunately, this series pulls this so many times that it majorly affected my viewing experience.\\n\\nIf that wasn\\'t enough, the plot is just so predictable. When you can literally tell what event is gonna take place in the next few minutes, the series is not doing a good job in the storytelling department. There were some moments I could automatically tell who\\'s gonna die next. And no, this isn\\'t something that\\'s common for horror-thriller or zombie-survival types of movies, because to my memory, good series like Kingdom or movies like Train to Busan was never like that. You couldn\\'t automatically tell what\\'s gonna happen next because the story is being told in a perfect way and the events felt sudden like it was supposed to.\\n\\nCharacters often make decisions that are so stupid that I actually don\\'t know if they are even a human. For example, one of the characters died while trying to push a zombie away with their fist. You are in a zombie apocalypse and instead of protecting the place where you could be bitten easily, you choose to push a zombie away with your hand right next to their mouth when you literally have other objects you can use to push them away. That isn\\'t the only instance of dumb decisions. The choices these characters make in the entirety of this series are so bad. Sometimes, I couldn\\'t help but wish all of them had just gotten bitten already.\\nI was more entertained watching the detective\\'s perspective and that one Seoul University guy (Not Sang-Woo) and that one stupid vlogged. Then it would turn into a zombie comedy but at least it would be entertaining compared to whatever this is.\\n\\nThe series spends more time explaining how to make an emergency toilet than explaining how the zombie mechanics work and why some people turn into half-zombies and some people don\\'t.\\n\\nThey also had to include so many characters, some of them end up having zero developments and are left uninteresting. Later on, the series just kills them off in true Korean drama fashion.\\n\\nSound and production are not impressive enough to write home about. The cast is overwhelmingly big and some characters are terribly written. The main female character, On-Jo\\'s acting was so stiff sometimes. She has only one expression throughout the entire series.\\n\\nIf you think you should still watch this and see for yourself, go ahead. Just a warning, it\\'s 12 episodes long and each episode\\'s duration is almost an hour. So when you round it up, it\\'s a 12 hour-long series.\\n\\nIf you think that this series isn\\'t worth your time, and if you are okay with some spoilers explaining how ridiculous some moments were in the whole series that just ruin your experience, refer to this comment of mine:\\nhttps://mydramalist.com/59449-our-school-now#comment-8593081\\n\\nWell, that\\'s the gist of it. You are still free to be adventurous and watch this series, as we all perceive media in a different way depending on the person, you might enjoy it. But I won\\'t recommend this to anyone. Not only is it very long, it just wastes time with useless moments that don\\'t contribute to the story later on.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n1.0\\nStory\\n3.5\\nActing/Cast\\n3.5\\nMusic\\n6.0\\nRewatch Value\\n1.0\\nThis ain't no Train to Busan!!

Netflix’s latest hit K-drama, All of Us Are Dead, attempts to give us a solid answer to this question, as Hyosan High School turns into a fast-sinking ship when a science experiment gone terribly wrong results in a virus-induced zombie outbreak.\\n\\nFor a few years now, South Korean entertainment has been pushing the narrative boundaries of the zombie genre. They have deftly used it as a vehicle to explore not just present-day political and social issues (#Alive, 2020), but have also inserted the undead in their period dramas (Kingdom, 2019).\\n\\nHowever, what makes All of Us Are Dead stand out amidst this growing list of K-Zombie content are the central protagonists in the series. The motley crew of survivors are not your gun-slinging, machete-wielding, adept zombie-killing protagonists, these are teenagers who quite literally have to grab the object nearest to them and hastily fashion a weapon out of it.\\n\\nThis is also where the show finds its sparingly lighter moments. Friends dole out advice on dealing with high school crushes as bloody zombies snarl in the background (!) But beyond these interactions, the series takes a massive departure from the traditional route of keeping a zombie apocalypse setting somewhat comically chaotic. Instead, directors Lee JQ and Kim Nam-su choose not to shy away from tackling the emotional weight of death and mayhem.\\n\\nThe best example of this is seen when the show deals with the zombification or “turning” of humans. A shot usually reserved to fulfil the horror quota is turned on its head to play out poignantly heartbreaking scenes. In place of a hastened transformation, we get a drawn-out process, in which the horror stems from the now-undead zombie reconciling with the loss of their humanity, often right in front of their classmates.\\n\\nThe directors do not whiplash the audience back into zombie-infested reality; instead we sit with the students in numbing grief as they lose their friends, classmates and teachers, over and over again. The heavy storyline doesn’t feel misplaced, as writer Chun Sung-il richly fleshes out these teen characters to carry forward the complex tale.\\n\\nNam On-jo (Park Ji-hu) serves as a narrative protagonist who bands together with her childhood friend Lee Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young), her crush Lee Su-hyeok (Park Solomon), and the aloof overachieving class President Choi Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun) among other classmates to fight zombies and school bullies alike.\\n\\nDirector Lee JQ’s choice to cast actors “unfamiliar to the audience” pays off masterfully.\\n\\nThe makers also ensure that the layered storytelling does not come at the cost of high-adrenaline action scenes, jump scares and well-executed VFX gore. Mirroring the title sequence, the directors slowly descend the audience into a zombie-filled reality, and the series conveys the same visually. What starts off as a brightly-lit, vividly colourful school, eventually transforms into a nauseatingly dull place with the colour saturation dialed back, as the virus spreads.\\n\\nWhen required, the filmmakers also immerse us into the zombie experience. The cinematography during the zombie-human confrontation scenes moves fast, never quite fixating on a single character, which makes for quite unsettling viewing. It is havoc heightened for the students, as well as the audience watching, as we learn along with them, who survived and who didn’t.\\n\\nAnother unconventional directorial choice comes in the form of how the show is paced out. With 12 episodes, each almost an hour long, the story stretches out the events of each day over multiple episodes. The material to fill this time comes from the pockets of survivors it creates throughout the city.\\n\\nThough the storyline follows a core group of students trapped in high school, we are also given glimpses of a politician scrambling to escape her office; a social media influencer trying to farm the crisis for viral content; and two police officers, mismatched in their levels of courage, racing to retrieve the antidote.\\n\\nThese different dynamics are crafted for the series to also address multiple systemic issues. With the origin of the zombie virus itself rooted in a history of bullying, the school becomes ground zero for the show to explore social class hierarchies.\\n\\nAdditionally, for the senior students of Hyosan High, the zombie apocalypse does not even figure as a priority stressor. With the university entrance exams looming over, Park Mi-jin, a student, laments, “It’s impossible for me to get into college even if I live,” while practicing her zombie killing techniques.\\n\\nThe dynamic between how the State handles this crisis and its effect on students also serves as a microcosm for how authorities react to apocalyptic situations. Unfortunately, this is also where the plot wavers a bit. The series often attempts to pack in too much, as it stretches two separate storylines involving teenage pregnancy and sexual assault across multiple episodes. Not enough time is spent on either narrative to create meaningful conclusions or provide these characters with a kinder, more humane ending.\\n\\nUltimately, in a genre teeming with Hollywood’s undying need to provide the perfect post-apocalyptic male-hero zombie killer tale, South Korea has bravely put forth a story of survival. Oscillating between the alive and the undead, the show makes an impact by centering the fact that endurance doesn’t always mean strength, sometimes it is born out of repeated acts of kindness.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n6.0\\nStory\\n2.0\\nActing/Cast\\n6.0\\nMusic\\n6.0\\nRewatch Value\\n1.5\\nNot good enough\\nI understand they are young actors, lets put that acting aside.

It’s not a totally new storyline or concept for sure, may NOT be everyone’s type if they’re not looking for some bloody, gory and great action scenes but I’m very satisfied with what we got.\\n\\nPerformances were weak by good amount of the cast, but the characters were likeable and took realistic decisions at times. Not every ‘evil’ character is given an unnecessary redeemable story as well, which I do like while some who faced tough situations broke down understandably. Through some of the characters could have been provided a better background. There was overall a good depiction of humanity as well.\\n\\nYou do have to drop logic when you watch shows like this but if you don’t have to face unnecessary romantic moments (they were definitely there but again, these are High School students so some of the behavior makes sense *shrugs*) or don’t continue watching just because there are some pretty people you want to look at throughout. Not to mention they didn't overuse a concept you'll get to see at the middle of the series which other dramas definitely would.\\n\\nThe drama also takes bold decisions to keep us engaged, though, some deaths felt unworthy. There is no unnecessary music or soundtrack throughout, the background music is fun and doesn’t overlap any of the scenes either, which I really liked. The scale of the show was clearly big, considering they made good use of the sets and the streets and it didn’t feel monotonous or boring in terms of the setting. They brought back so many actors to perform as zombies even in the last few episodes, meaning the whole team was really dedicated to it, not something we’ll see usually.\\n\\nOverall, solid 9/10. If you wonder why the overall rating is good while I haven’t rated other aspect on MDL that well, it’s because the CGI, Sets, Action/Choreography were very good especially when you consider it’s a K-drama, so the overall rating does shoot up.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n10\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n10\\nRewatch Value\\n10\\nThis is how you write and direct a zombie TV series\\nThis is way far better than all The Walking Dead seasons combined.

In order to explain this conundrum, I will go into HEAVY SPOILERS. Avert your eyes unless you watched all 12 episodes or, like myself, are spoiler junkies.\\n\\nSPOILERS in T minus 5...4...3...2...1...LETS GO!\\n\\nHalf plot armor, half cop out...but worse than either\\n\\nLike any genre, zombie genre has cliches and that\\'s perfectly fine. They exist in storytelling to move the story forward cause stories aren\\'t real life. So once in a while, a character will have to do something stupid to change the status quo. Also, all stories that put characters in peril will bestow plot armor on those whom the story needs to hang on a bit longer. These characters will survive the unsurviveable situations, while the ones without the plot armor won\\'t, even though everyone should have been dead by that point. This is fine too unless it\\'s used to an excess, which this drama does.\\n\\nThat leads me to the concept of \"halfbie\". This is a portmanteau for half zombie but it really means half plot armor half copout. It basically breaks the universe - a bitten character doesn\\'t become a mindless zombie but keeps human appearance and intelligence, gets super powers (abnormal strength, enhanced hearing and smell, fast healing, basically hard to kill) and, if Mary Sue or Gary Stu, is able to reign in hunger for human flesh. You can see from the very description why this sucks and doesn\\'t fit in the universe where there are living and the walking dead. It\\'s a cliche created to spare writer\\'s pet (in this case Nam Ra) and make existing villain more intimidating (in this case Gwi Nam). However, the effect is opposite. Gwi Nam, aka the Evil Plot Armorie/Cop Outie, became an unintentional comic relief. You could get really sloshed if played a drinking game every time he survived a fall from the rooftop, snapped his bones back and muttered \"f***er\". Nam ra, aka the good Plot Armorie/Cop Outie, mostly stood on the sidelines gazing into nothing unless her love interest was attacked by the Mullet\\'d Cockroach of a villain (since he kept coming back like a roach) and occasionally would hear zombie footsteps about 30 seconds before the herd swarmed the safe place. But in numerous instances when the gang hit the hard-to-break locked door (another drinking game that would get you hammered in no time!) , she would forget she was abnormally strong. And given that zombies cannot distinguish between themselves and halfbies, she could have safely run errands, which would have saved lives, but never did. Basically, the whole point of her \"evolved\" status was for romantic purposes. Her love interest defied his friends because he trusted she wouldn\\'t harm anyone, while she repeatedly saved him from Mullet\\'d Cockroach. That\\'s really all there is to this plot device. Romance enhancer. No real consequence for the plot. Just something for shippers to drool over. Ooooh, he tied them together with the red string of fate! Oooooh, she was about to bite him but he said \"do it cause then I will be like you!\" and she kissed him instead! SWOON! :insertvomitemoji:\\n\\nSpread the butter so thin til there\\'s no butter\\n\\nAnother problem with this drama is really a typical K drama problem - too much filler, too many sideplots and characters that don\\'t add up to the whole. Two cops and the baby and a little girl added up to nothing. It was a bathroom break. Ditto Youtuber subplot. Ditto Assembly Member subplot. Even On Jo\\'s father\\'s quest to reach his daughter could have been scrapped. 12 episodes spread the story too thin. It worked when it was focused on the highschool survival. It came to a screeching halt when it was about outside world and characters. It could have made the point across in half the running time.\\n\\nBromance and womance >>>>>> romance\\n\\nAs is always the case in dramas, romance is the inferior relationship. This drama has a love quadrangle in its center that is just there but doesn\\'t actually impact the plot. Cheong San is motivated to protect On Jo, who doesn\\'t reciprocate his feelings, but he also protects all his friends so you could have the same story without unrequited love. In the end, he would have sacrificed himself for everyone because he\\'s that kind of a character. Love interest or not.\\n\\nOn Jo is in love with Soo Hyuk (who is in love with Nam Ra and vice versa) and that\\'s it. Again, it adds up to nothing. She is stoically tolerant of Soo Hyuk/Nam Ra romance right before her eyes, is supportive of both, so that she is in love with him is just a throwback reference. Kind of like, this character has no real personality we might as well give her an unrequited love to stand out.\\n\\nSoo Hyuk and Nam Ra romance fares a little better cause they at least had the enemies to lovers thing going when she became a halfbie. But since they are side characters to leads Cheong San and On Jo, there was no real impact there. And, weirdly, the ending forgot about it, so when the gang reunited with Nam Ra, she and Soo Hyuk didn\\'t have a moment together. Instead, she had a moment with On Jo. :facepalm:\\n\\nBut on the bright side, bromance (Woojin and his \"brother in law\", Cheong San and Soo Hyuk - get a room you two! , and any combo of boys) and womance (Mijin and Ha ri) were excellent. I also enjoyed Jae Ik and Seoul Student banter even though they were in a bathroom break filler.\\n\\nA Star Is Born\\n\\nPark Solomon aka Lomon aka Soo Hyuk lit up the screen every time he was in and it wasn\\'t even close. He bursts with genuine charisma and charm on top of amazing visuals. And he has range. I found acting to be a mixed bag but he was consistently strong.\\n\\nThat Ep 3 twist - Aigoo!\\n\\nReally have to commend the drama for how Geong Su got infected. My jaw dropped on the floor and I still didn\\'t pick it up. Wow!\\n\\nSome really well directed set pieces\\n\\nThe library fight and escape from zombies with falling book shelves was OTT but so memorable.\\n\\nHit me in the feels\\n\\nDeaths packed the punch as did reunions between the living and the dead (Cheong San and his zombie mom, nuff said). As is always the case with survival dramas, the choice of who died is controversial. Did Woojin have to die? No. His death added nothing so he should have stayed alive. Did Cheong San have to die? If I had my way, I would give him the halfbie arc instead of Nam Ra. He was the lead and his unrequited love would count for something if On Jo realized she loved him but they couldn\\'t be together because he was a halfbie. Oh well.\\n\\nNamra Sue Spin-off or Will there be Season 2?\\n\\nIf you read I Am Legend and/or Girl With All the Gifts, than you know that halfbies (any human-zombie or human-vampire hybrid) cannot be trusted. In the end, they choose their kind over humans and go as far as to exterminate humans so that they wouldn\\'t be hunted by them. Even if one of them likes a human or two. So whatever the gang saw when they look down to where Nam ra jumped, disturbed them. It cannot be good. Genre rules prevent coexistence.\\n\\nThat said, the ending felt too much like a set up for Namra Sue spin-off which I have no interest in. The appeal of the drama was in ordinary teens trying to survive extraordinary circumstances, not in zombie X Men fighting each other.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nPlot armor cannot protect from simple pleasures of this drama. You\\'ll be engaged, emotionally wrecked, you\\'ll laugh and cry with characters and feel many deaths. Warts won\\'t go away but they aren\\'t all that is there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n10\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n10\\nRewatch Value\\n9.0\\nCan justice be served in a unconventional way?\\nThis is my first 10 since joining MDL december last year and that says a lot. I so loveee these types of series, gritty, dark, and suspenseful but school, youth, and coming of age. *chef's kiss*\\n\\nThis review took longer than usual because I wanted to savour every episode and try to understand every nuance without rushing. Don't get me wrong this show isn't perfect it has minor errors such as annoying characters and plot armor but not making a section for it because it's forgivable.\\n\\nI've seen a lot of reviews here and other sites how the pacing is terrible, but I disagree. Even though promoted as a school drama, the minor things happening in Hyosan was necessary and compelling for the development and plot of the show.\\n\\nThese are the things I've liked about All of Us Are Dead\\n\\nSocial Issues\\nEven as a zombie series there are lot's of lessons we can think about as a society. Such as how bullying is a serious problem especially in korea or the school system and it's wrong priorities. Honestly many more as you decide to watch.\\n\\nPlot/Story\\nThe story was phenomenal for various reasons and can be interpreted depending on who's lens is watching. Personally, I was heavily in favor of the origin of the virus but not at the expense of other people's lives. As we progress, seeing the one's that are left behind I changed my mind. And honestly that's the beauty of it, but for spoiler reasons I'll just leave it at that.\\n\\nPremise\\nAOUAD is trying to tell us that life is short and we shouldn't take it for granted. Furthermore we should tell the one's we love how much we love them because tomorrow or even later is such an uncertainty.\\n\\nActions\\nProps to every single cast performing the stunts of the series, especially the male leads. They performed it with such intensity that levels up the series.\\n\\nTechnical\\nThe sound effects we're amazing. Saw Behind the scenes of how the zombie sounds were created, and I must say that I the dedication and effort was mindblowing. The set design such as the cinematography was amazing as well, it perfectly shows us the gore scenes which is good for viewing experience but bad for my stomach.\\n\\nScreenplay\\nThis is what kept me engaged outside the action and thrill, therefore props to the writer. The dialogues are so realistic like they are actually high school students because that's exactly how me and my friends act minus fighting zombies.\\n\\nActing/Characters\\nThis also goes hand in hand with the screenplay, having good screenplay bad acting and vice versa really isn't ideal, but here we get both. The way the actors and actresses speak and their mannerism waaaaaas perfect like seriously perfect. I've seen Solomon in sweet revenge but thought his acting was lacking copared to Hyanggi but he redeemed himself here. Chan Young is someone I've never seen before but thought he was also amazing here, performed the actions scenes so well that even I am tired for him. My girl Jihoo deserves this break, saw her in the film house of hummingbird and in the drama beautiful world beforehand. She's the maknae of the cast but honestly the performed the best, Onjo had soo much emotional scenes and she perfectly nailed them all. Lastly the cuteeeest and my wife CHO YI HYUN. WOW she just made a 360 turn from her 2 recent drama's. From the cute and clumsy Jiwon to the mysterious and quiet class president Namra, versatility indeed. I loveeeeed the love and friendship of all characters in the show and how it doesn't solely focus on the apocalypse but also human connections and the one's left behind. The antagonists we're as good they successfully played their role and add thrill to the already thrilling series. Also successfully made my blood boil.\\n\\nParallels\\nThis is a small detail but I had to include it. In our main group the male characters are always the one's protecting and leading the others. In comparison to our secondish group our two females are the one's leading, planning, etc. Smqll detail but sooo loved it because it removes the cliché that woman cannot survive an apocalypse.\\n\\n****************************************************************************************************\\nOverall\\nTo anyone that loves zombie and thriller movies, I surely do recommend these. For people saying that they are sick of zombies, I'd still give this a try. Because it gave new substances to the Zombie genre whilst remaining the gore we normally see in them. If you have any questions about it please do let me know and I'll try to answer as best as I can.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n5.5\\nStory\\n6.0\\nActing/Cast\\n8.0\\nMusic\\n5.0\\nRewatch Value\\n3.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nbittersweet ending\\nI had a lot of expectations and have been waiting for this drama since the teaser came out esp when I saw the cast because I was so excited that they finally have their main roles but when I watched it, I didn't absolutely love it still, I enjoyed it. there are a lot of familiar faces in the show and the cast did a really great job in portraying their roles.\\n\\nbut honestly wished that they cut this into like 10 episodes only, I feel like there are a lot of unnecessary scenes, and do I need to mention the frustrating and annoying characters.\\n\\nI really don't get why they included Cheong san's mom scene of her going to school to save his son but when she got there she immediately became a zombie sklsjjd there are a lot of wasted characters!! ++ the half zombies esp. gwinam and eunji, I wanted to see eunji fighting w/ gwinam like she should've taken revenge on him. they built eunji's character like she's gonna take revenge but didn't instead they made her break phones and ride a bike. also, namra's character has big potential in the story but I feel like her character as a half-zombie hasn't been given much attention.

They have produced quality ones over the recent years so there’s a certain expectation from them in this subgenre.\\n\\nI binge watched All of Us Are Dead upon its release. To put it simply, it’s about a group of students striving to survive in a zombie apocalypse. Sadly, half way through the series I already got bored. I wished they shorten it. There are so many scenes that don’t add much value. One thing to describe this show is ambitious. It wants to tackle several issues and cover everything resulting it to fall flat.\\n\\nPRO:\\nI want to commend the camera work esp when all hell breaks loose. I like the continuous take in cafeteria scene. They showed the chaos from all sides, didn’t follow just handful of people. I also like the scene when the two policemen were running through town.\\n\\nCONS:\\nI have no problem with characters even main leads dying. But meaningless deaths are irking. It came across as trying so hard to make an an impactful emotional scene. The build up is weak. It also has repetitive unnecessary sacrifices. It’s basically showing dumb ways to kill a character.\\n\\nI’m bothered by some fight scenes because the locations of stunt wires are obvious.

They weren't that high and I wasn't expecting another Sweet Home out of a traditional zombie apocalypse story, but I was anticipating a fun, off-the-walls zombie flick that would keep me entertained for a few hours. And it did! At first. Let me explain.\\n\\nThe drama starts off great with some well-shot, high-action scenes and a lot of unabashed gore and really gets you into it. You don't really know much about the characters other than a few facts thrown at you, but hey, it's zombies, most of them won't survive anyway. So I got really into it at first. The mystery surrounding the source of the virus wasn't all that interesting and immediately felt like a half-baked origin story, but it was good enough for the B-horror I was expecting.\\n\\nProblems stemmed when time started to pass. The initial mayhem was brilliant but after a certain point, when the characters start talking about being hungry and thirsty, issues arose. The characters explicitly explain to one another what would happen if they didn't eat or find water soon. Then, well. They don't find any. What would normally be an important plot point in other zombie shows becomes a moot point here. They drink some rainwater at some point, each takes a bite out of a candy bar and that's about it. They talk about being hungry but show no signs of getting weaker or being malnourished, and their only goal throughout the series is to get rescued, never to find food or water.\\n\\nThe show has a LOT of B-plots and side characters that never have any satisfying conclusions. They introduce a bunch of characters that you think will be fleshed out or explained later but never are. And there are a LOT of plot holes. For instance:\\n1. The pregnant student is shown heavily in the first episodes. Her identity isn't explained and we know nothing about her aside from her giving birth and tying herself up with ribbon (just ribbon, yet somehow she doesn't break free) to keep from hurting her baby after she turns. That's it. She was there to add drama and tension but she wasn't added with a plot or reason. Shock value, at most.\\n2. On Jo's father is keyed up to be the man who will save the day. In early episodes, On Jo talks about how her father promised to be there for her if anything happened to her, that he would save her, and throughout most of the series, he does everything in his power to see that through. Most of the scenes we get of his character are him making his way to her school, so naturally, we expect the reunion to be a big, key point in the series, right? They've built it up that way. But no. He dies about 7 minutes after reuniting with her. In fact, their reunion is used as the big cliffhanger for one of the episodes, only for him to be turned into a zombie at the very beginning of the next. It was one of the biggest letdowns of the series and leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you realize that his entire purpose was just to build up tension. To add insult to injury, his 'noble sacrifice' was unnecessary. After he threw the first flare, the zombies ran to it and cleared a path for everyone to escape safely. Throwing more and not escaping was pointless.\\n3. The bullied girl had no character arc. She is one of the few intelligent zombies we get throughout the drama and so I expected something big to happen with her, but she just wandered around on her bike after trying and failing miserably to burn down the school. Then when I saw she reached the quarantined zone, especially after she bit her schoolmate, I expected all hell to break loose there. Nope. She was subdued. The whole point of her was to show the military that asymptomatic infections were a thing so that they would abandon the main cast at the school. Great storytelling.\\n4. Cheong San's mother. They had her do a little rescue mission only for her to fail at every obstacle. Her entire role was to leave a vehicle for the policemen to use (they could have just had one there from someone else, there was no reason to use a character for that) and to get to the school so that her son could be sad that she was a zombie. That's it.\\n5. Gwi Nam as the main antagonist of the series worked for a little while, but he got old pretty quickly as he never did much of anything. He'd show up, attack, they would 'kill' him and he'd come back after healing only to find they'd moved. Not that big of a threat, really.\\n6. The police officers, especially Song Jae Ik, were a great addition to the cast. I thought. Jae Ik was there from the start, saw Byeong Chan, and had the task of finding the laptop, so I naturally thought he'd be one of the few adults in this that would actually help the kids. Nope. Not what happened. He saves the baby and another random little girl, sure, but the moment the military saves them, he just dips out of the story. You see his face once or twice after that and that's it. He had fewer scenes and yet a better role in Happiness.\\n7. There was literally no point to the streamer. At all. Why was he in the story? He did absolutely nothing. Not one thing. And then he disappeared with the police officers.\\n8. The girl (I don't remember her name) who used her handkerchief to infect another student. She escaped, hid away in a storage room, was having a change of heart and was going to bring supplies to the others (and hey, that would have helped with that one plothole, wouldn't it?) and then she's killed off randomly. I didn't like her and don't care that she died, but if they were going to do that, they could have just had her die right away in the halls.\\n9. When Gwi Nam bit Nam Ra, she became an intelligent zombie. Everyone else he bit became regular zombies. How does that make sense? The strain that's passed on should be the one that he has, so logically, everyone he bites should become an intelligent zombie. What, is the virus prejudiced?\\n10. When Byeon Chan turned, he didn't look like a normal zombie. It looked like he became an intelligent zombie. This is never addressed, and we never find out either way. Maybe they just did it that way for dramatic effect? Not a good move.\\n11. What was the point of the assemblywoman? Why was she in the story at all?\\n12. In the end we see Nam Ra seemingly well-adjusted after being out on her own for a few months. How? How is that possible? When we last saw her, her hunger was so bad that she tried to bite On Jo and left because she could no longer hold herself back. So how is it that she's perfectly fine around them now, and that her eye has healed? It doesn't explain anything about that. It just leaves it off trying to make us think she's a cool badass zombie-fighter now, but I'm just left with questions.\\n\\nI know I'm missing some, but you get my point.\\n\\nMost of the plot was jumping from one closed-off room with no resources to another. A few ideas they actually do have are foiled by what's going on in the outside world, like phone lines and the internet being cut off. It was fine at first, but the kids never got any smarter and never adjusted to the zombies, so that's all we ever got. To the very end, they had absolutely no control over the situation, which isn't what you want to see in a zombie series.\\n\\nI have a lot of gripes with this drama, to the point that it negatively impacted my viewing experience. But like I said, it was fun at first. I do recommend at least watching the first half because some of it is a lot of fun, but don't expect anything more than a few good scenes and some light comedy in the first few episodes. After that, decide for yourself if you want to suffer through the mess that is the second half.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n6.0\\nActing/Cast\\n6.5\\nMusic\\n6.5\\nRewatch Value\\n3.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nA struggle to watch\\nAll of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into their increasing array of zombie productions. The hype surrounding this drama since its teasers and trailers was real, further proven by the amount of enthusiasm shown by worldwide viewers as the drama was finally released on Netflix. I, myself, was among those who were excited for this drama's release, but after watching the entirety of its episodes, I found it disappointing to say the least.\\n\\nThe main problem I had with this drama is its writing. It has major issues— full of plotholes, repetitiveness, inconsistencies and wasted potential. I was most disappointed with how they didn't utilize Nam Ra's abilities as a half-zombie well enough. Instead of letting the group face the same pattern of finding a safe place to hide, having them argue with one another and moving to another safe place over and over again which eventually got really tiring to watch, they could've made room for a more dynamic plot by having Nam Ra use her abilities to help them escape the school earlier. This would've allowed some extra time that can be used to further develop the characterizations which fell shallow for some of the characters. Until the end, I wasn't able to sympathize with a lot of these characters despite having went though 12 whole episodes full of tragedy and loss alongside them. I had a big problem rooting for the female lead in particular due to her general blandness. Her character wasn't interesting nor engaging enough even compared to several of the supporting characters, such as Jang Ha Ri and Park Mi Jin.\\n\\nThere was also a lot of pointless plotlines throughout the drama. To name a few, Gwi Nam's revenge against Cheong San (did he seriously think the police were still going to sit behind their desks processing reports when the entire city has gone to hell ?), the assemblywoman who served absolutely no purpose whatsoever, the hunt for Lee Byeong Chan's laptop because he claimed it contained the key to finding a cure when it turned out to only be a recording of him saying there was no cure, and even On Jo's father's dramatic yet HIGHLY PREVENTABLE death.\\n\\nThe drama also tries to address real life issues such as bullying, sexual harassment, academic and social pressure in attempt to create a woke statement of some sort but it doesn’t add to much. It’s just there to be there. I think having Eun Ji epically stand off against the bully, both as half zombies, would have helped in this aspect, as little as it might.\\n\\nIt wasn't all that bad, though. I enjoyed the action sequences. It's obvious they spent a lot of effort and budget into creating those scenes. The props, makeup, and choreography for the zombies were amazing. Though having some noticeable mistakes and inconsistencies, the action was gripping and suspenseful enough to push you to continue watching. Characters such as Nam Ra, Su Hyeok, Cheong San, Ha Ri, Mi Jin, detective Jae Ik, his partner, and even Na Yeon at times helped made this drama more lively.\\n\\nThe acting range of this drama was mixed. As expected, it was a total delight watching Lee Kyu Hyung's onscreen performance. Several of the younger actors did a great job as well, namely Jo Yi Hyun (Nam Ra), Yoon Chan Young (Cheong San) Yoo In Soo (Gwi Nam) and Lee Yoo Mi (Na Yeon). The rest were either okay or lacking.\\n\\nThe finale sort of picked up the drama a bit. It's because they finally utilized Nam Ra's character properly, having her fight in the frontlines instead of standing around in the back.\\n\\nAll in all, All of Us Are Dead is quite mediocre. It was a fun watch to kill time, but nothing more.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n6.0\\nActing/Cast\\n7.0\\nMusic\\n4.5\\nRewatch Value\\n3.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nZombie genre overdone: Long and Boring\\nAfter watching trailer, I thought it was going to be an entertaining and different as it involves school but it had the same troops like other zombie movies.\\nGood points:\\n1. The production value is great. The scene where the students burst out of the windows while the girl was trying to commit suicide was highlight shot . Even during bomb blast thing, the zombies gathering was amazing.\\n2. The acting of all the actors were quite on point specially antagonist did a great job.\\n\\nBad points:\\n1. Why was it 12 episodes? It just dragged the whole show with unnecessary things added. The editing is to be blamed.\\n2. How can students turn into superman while fighting and even old firefighter father can do that kind flips? Moreover, the small baby survived without milk for that many days. Even the students had that much of energy without eating or drinking for days. That's so unrealistic.\\n3. There are countless number of stupid decisions that restricted from building up any emotion towards any of the character.\\n4. The emotion of friendship between teenagers looked so force from the beginning like On-Jo didn't even called out or searched for her best friend at the very beginning of zombie attack at cafeteria even after they got out of the vulnerable situation but she suddenly feels bad for her at the time when she was converting into zombie. Don't get that thing??\\n5. The sound track other than the theme song, is so bad. How can you play comic sound track in those intense scenes? And want us to feel the pain of the characters while being chased by zombies.\\n\\nDisappointing!!\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n8.5\\nStory\\n8.5\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n8.5\\nRewatch Value\\n8.5\\nDam .... I Cant believe I watched this\\nOkay to say the show was extremely different is saying the least, after squid game I really didn't think I could do a another freaky show, but I was proven wrong.\\n\\nSo this drama I am at a lost for words, because even though It was good in the sense the acting and cinematography was really excellent, and the visual effects were out of this world, I did find that by the time I reached ep 7 I started to get a little bored, mainly because it just felt that the drama was going nowhere, we got to see how the zombies were created and the reason behind them being created, but the whole running away and hiding the fighting between the remaining survivors started to over lap each other. he first episode was compelling and was such a gorefest, I thought it is exactly how I want my horror show. The very first attack by the school nurse was heart stopping and showed a lot of promise.\\n\\nThe story is simple enough but could have been a goldmine of ideas and exciting scenarios. Instead, they dropped stupid and repetitive scenarios one after another. Some of the plots and characters were what seemed to be wasted time space, like the assembly woman what was her reason for being there and the people around her, the vlog guy, he didn't seem to vlog much and was caught on the roof, the police guy that rescued the baby and the child but only to see them get caught and separated. Then out of no where you got a mutation of the some of the characters that just seemed to endless.\\n\\nThis felt like the drama could have been in done 6 episodes instead of the full 12, cuz in the end the military bombed the town up, for me also, I could not get my head around why the commander shot himself after dropping the bomb, there was literally no other way to stop the zombies from entering the main towns, and causing a major chaos, there was no cure or vaccine so why did he feel like he need to end his life?\\n\\nOverall: The ending has left us all questioning is there a season 2 coming? If zombies and gruesome is your thing then yes watch it, for me this is not something I will watch again, but i did find enjoyable on a 50/50 scale.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n5.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n6.0\\nRewatch Value\\n4.5\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nHad a Promising Start\\nThis series started in such an exciting, groundbreaking way. If you ever ask me about my favorite episodes in a drama ever, the first few episodes of this show would probably be a runner up. At the start, the concepts were promising, the characters were interesting, and the cinematography was amazing. The cafeteria scene was freaking epic. Now, THIS is a freaking zombie show! I thought to myself. I can\\'t wait to see more thrilling scenes with zombies and action and tension! Well sadly. The show was exciting until it wasn\\'t.\\n\\nCharacters: 3/5\\nAs the series went on I could not bring myself to root for anyone, especially the main leads. They were just very stale. Even Su-hyeok, who I found very charming at the start, eventually became boring to watch too. I think Gwi-nam was the most memorable character. He may not have been one of the, \\'good guys\\' but he was DEFINITELY interesting to watch. All these characters, who we know nothing about like their motivations or fears , a guy with seemingly no desire other than to kill WAS fun to watch. Dae-soo, the archery girl, and the delinquent were likeable, but also lack depth like the others. The detective showed some promise, but he eventually fades into the background. Characters are also introduced despite changing nothing about the story. Like why was the vlogger even there...\\n\\nStory: 1/5\\nNow, my main complaint, the story. It was puzzling, that in a show centered around HIGHSCHOOLERS in a ZOMBIE virus the emotional intensity that was portrayed cannot be felt at all. Even if the characters cried, argued, or fought, I felt so detached as a viewer that I just didn\\'t care. Deaths were also very anticlimactic and had no impact. Some were even stupid. Clearly the dad did NOT need to fire a second light for the zombies to go away!! They set up this whole epic rescue mission of the dad just for him to die by locking himself in a court with zombies. Like why!! Anyways, the big chunk of teenage melodrama should also be discussed. I\\'m not the type to hate those types of stories, but if you don\\'t care about the people involved, it becomes tasking to watch. Arguably the most boring part of the show.\\n\\nLike alot of things, it\\'s not all bad. I did still enjoy some parts of the story. Nam-ra\\'s arc was nice and I liked how she developed. The scene of their campfire at the rooftop with Dae-soo singing was heartwarming. There were fun parts but the excitement eventually dies down a lot, and any tension that might have been previously felt in the story was eventually gone and depleting in the last few episodes. I have no energy to talk about the ending.\\n\\nActing: 5/5\\nI don\\'t have much to say about the acting. Everyone did great! I\\'m not familiar with the main cast, but I think that the actors did really well with the script they were given. The zombie extras did great in being zombies. Notably, I liked Yoo In Soo\\'s performance. I\\'m looking out for his future roles soon!\\n\\nCinematography: 5/5\\nAgain, nothing much to say. As I expected from Netflix, this show definitely looks amazing. I like how the camera angles were shot, especially in the cafeteria scene (yes, i really like that scene) and also the library scene. Generally I just think the cinematography is great. Sidenote, I love how they shot this in a 16:9 ratio too. It fits the theme well.\\n\\nSo, the cinematography is great, the cast did amazingly, but the biggest downside is the writing was not well done at all. Anyways, I don\\'t despise this show, and deep inside I really wish it still succeeds. The actors and the crew clearly put a lot of hardwork into this series, and I\\'d hate for it to go to waste.\\n\\nOverall, \"All of Us Are Dead\" is a show that could have been something much, much bigger. I feel more sad than disappointed, because this COULD have been a great show. I\\'m left pondering with a lot of what-ifs. What if this happened, what if they did this instead of that and a lot of other useless thoughts. I really wish this was a show I could have enjoyed.\\n\\nRewatch value is also probably a 2/5, because I\\'d definitely still watch the first 3 episodes again (only).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n7.5\\nStory\\n7.0\\nActing/Cast\\n8.0\\nMusic\\n7.0\\nRewatch Value\\n7.0\\nEnjoyable but a lot of things are questionable\\nOverall it’s worth watching if you enjoy grotesque zombie scenes but there are questionable scenes from time to time.

Anyway, I thought this drama was entertaining enough, but not particularly interesting. Like it is interesting enough to entertain?\\n\\nAbout the plot:\\n? Interesting at the start, I think the main point of this drama is just the action and gore so I\\'m not sure how I should rate this. I have to say the drama was very interesting in the beginning but lost traction slowly. Many many plot armours, like how do the main characters survive from the most ridiculous things? There\\'s not much plot honestly, there\\'s barely any progression throughout the series. It\\'s just filled with action, gore and thrill. Oh yes, and the occasional (irrelevant) romance? I mean it\\'s a school drama after all, so maybe it was added to lighten the mood a little. I do love the childhood friends stuff going on but ... Onjo randomly bringing in romance and boys like... THERE ARE ZOMBIES EVERYWHERE AND YOU JUST WANT TO TALK/THINK ABOUT YOUR STUPID ROMANCE?? There\\'s a time and place for everything and the majority of the romantic scenes are useless af. Overall, I think this drama wasn\\'t even meant to have much of a plot? (or at least I hope so, if not it\\'s pretty much a bigass failure of a plot) If you just compile the parts of the drama with a plot, this wouldn\\'t be a 12-episode series, it would be halved or something.\\n\\nAbout the acting/cast:\\nThe main casts are obviously school-aged kids but the others.. there are \"kids\" who are obviously adults like, no questions asked (even among the main casts\\' friend group). They look way too old to look the part o.o I\\'m sorry but On-jo is so freaking expressionless, I cannot fathom how she even got the part? There are side characters who are much better at acting.\\n\\nAbout the music/OST:\\nAppropriate for the scenes.\\n\\nRewatch value:\\nAs mentioned, I don\\'t usually watch zombie stuff.

I love how they also didn't focus on a specific group of people for the whole series and basically, you get to see how everybody is dealing with the zombie outbreak.\\n\\nThis series is a series where you are on the edge of your seat, you'll cry or feel sad, or you will be angry by the outcome or people in the series, other scenes you will feel relieved. The way the actors portrayed the characters was honestly insane (in a good way), they really make you feel like you are watching them in an actual zombie outbreak.

After feeling let down by Netflix last few darker K-dramas, my expectations for this were rather low, but looking back on it, I am actually surprisingly pleased with this series.\\n\\nAll Of Us Are Dead is an eye-catching show in many ways. For starters it definitely didn’t hold back when it came to gore and edge. Which I greatly appreciate actually. I wasn’t familiar with the source material but when I originally read the summary, I was under the impression that a highschool setting meant, that the target audience of All Of Us Are Dead were supposed to be teenagers and that the violence would be accordingly mild. Let me tell you, it is everything but. I can’t remember the last time I saw so many heads rolling and guts spilling out. Truly a sight to behold.\\nAside from that, I think this series has pretty solid cinematography. The shot composition was visually stimulating most of the time. I think the simplistic single-camera really shined here. The action- and fight scenes were choreographed surprisingly well. Honestly the shows look is at its best, when all hell breaks loose. Suspension was high. I was on the edge of my seat throughout numerous scenes.\\nI really enjoyed the performance of our female protagonist Ohn-jo. She was my favorite character by far but I feel like I am in the minority here, as I have read countless complaints about her being annoying. I actually can’t relate to that sentiment at all, I found it very easy to root for the female lead. I haven’t watched any of the actress previous work but considering that she is rather young and seemingly inexperienced, I thought she did a pretty convincing job.\\nI also appreciated the rare moments of comedy (well, most of them, not sure what to make of the two cops to be honest). They didn’t feel out of place to me, instead they were much needed to take off some edge from this dark dark drama.\\nIn the series’ more humane moments, feel like I got to connect with most of the cast and got an idea of their dynamic with each other. In a very weird way, I was reminded of The Breakfast Club, the way our group of widely different angsty teens were forced to work and bond together. Just, you know, with more people dying. A lot more. While you have characters getting killed off left and right, most deaths felt impactful, which is difficult to pull off when your body-count is this high. This for me signifies that All Of Us Dead did a solid job with setting up its characters and making me care for them, even if their screentime was comparably short.\\n\\nBut this show sadly also has its dull moments. I am not going to list every single plothole, for the sake of avoiding spoilers and also because this isn’t Cinema Sins. Also, unpopular opinion, I don’t care that much about stuff like that. This is a zombie series; my disbelief is already suspended. The only real crime you can commit as a story about the flesh-eating undead, is bore me, which this show definitely did not. Still, you have to accept some level of idiocrasy going into this. If logic is terribly important to you, I imagine that you will be frustrated a lot here. Everyone behaves rather irrational but I mean, they’re teenagers. That’s what they do. Still, I can understand where the outcry is coming from, multiple moments don’t make a whole lot of sense if you really think about them for longer than a second.\\nI appreciated All Of Us Are Dead's attempt of social commentary but I don’t know if it was always warranted here. I don’t think zombie films have to be dumb, if you have something important to say, by all means go ahead. But I think this show tried to say so much, that it ended up conveying very little. Maybe pick a message and stick to that one to avoid feeling like an After School Special. At its best, All Of Us Are Dead’s societal critique felt a bit preachy and on the nose. At its worst it felt entirely out of place and took me out of the story.\\nThe pacing started off great. The plot was developing fast and I was fully immersed in the experience. And then somewhere along the way All Of Us Are Dead got kind of lost with segments that took up way too much time. The last few episodes felt a bit draggy as a result. I don’t mind the typically ambiguous Netflix ending but since we started off so strong and plot-dense it seems like we got a lot of set-up with comparably little pay-off.\\nI struggle a bit when it comes to evaluating acting- I can vaguely tell what makes a story good or bad. Or what makes a cinematography less or more interesting. I don’t possess the same talent when it comes to performances, it’s even more difficult to me when it’s in a foreign language. But for once I can point at one specific performance and go “Wow that was not exactly great”. That critique goes to the actress of Nam-ra. I am so used to Korean actors doing too much, honestly, overacting is part of the charm when it comes to Asian dramas. Well for the first time ever I witnessed a K-drama actress doing too little, it was honestly kind of puzzling to me. I understand that being stoic is part of the character but Nam-ra’s actress just gave me nothing, absolutely nothing at all. Maybe it’s because most of the time she did not have anything interesting to do, besides saying pseudo poignant things at the entirely wrong time. Her chemistry with her love-interest (who is also a rather bland character) was also close to non-existent, by the end I honestly shipped her more with our female protagonist.\\nSpeaking of romance, it also belongs to the show’s weaker qualities. I didn’t mind Cheong-sans and Ohn-jo’s developing relationship that much, but maybe this is due to my weakness for the Friends-to-lovers-trope. The love triangle???square??? though, felt entirely unnecessary and took up way too much time. It’s incredible that everyone had time for this petty drama while they had all these zombies to deal with.\\n\\nI sometimes curse the day Train To Busan premiered. It seems like the existence of the movie alone has made it impossible for people to critique any piece of Korean media with zombies in it, without somehow comparing it to Sang-Ho Yeons masterpiece. Even in universe the title has to be somehow referenced, apparently, it’s just unavoidable.\\nListen, is this the next Train To Busan? No, absolutely not. But I don’t think it has or tried to be. I think there is an important dissonance between entertaining and objectively great. At its best, All Of Us Are Dead was both but even at its worst I was still having fun, and at the end of the day, isn’t that what really counts?\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n7.0\\nStory\\n7.5\\nActing/Cast\\n7.0\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n4.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nDO WE HAVE A PROBLEM ⁉️\\nSummary: Happiness > All of us are dead\\n\\nI wished they got better main leads, i liked the supporting characters better (Especially the 2nd group of survivors , hari, mijin and the 2 guys) better than the boring main cast.

I personally think what is really attracting people to watch this drama, more than the story, is the charming new actors and actresses. Particularly Park Solomon, whom I admit is a find and probably the next big thing. I can see a little of Go Soo in him and that should tell you everything you need to know. Lee Eun-saem and Ha Seung-ri are another two really strong performances. But the most impactful presence is Lee Yoo Mi who demonstrates the meaning of the word range.\\n\\nThe zombie action is top notch, no surprise coming from a korean production. It is gory and blood thirsty. Their origin story, however, it’s one of the things that just don’t sit well with me.\\n\\nThe school violence, bullying and sexual abuse display in this drama is far more disturbing than the actual zombies. I am sure this was the intention, so we as an audience can understand and empathize with the logic behind the creation of the zombies. The adult solution to the problem is anarchy and destruction. From this situation, a group of kids is left to figure out what’s morally correct, ethical behavior, justice, the importance of kindness, and so on. Lord of the Flies: Zombie Edition.\\n\\nThis is the point where I am left wondering if this is what of All Of Us Are Dead is actually about. Is this a gore fest showing me the worst a human can do? People so detached to what others feel, so already dead inside, that everything they do is worse than what a zombie does? Is this a brutal bullying survivor story? But then why none of the main characters were part of the bullied? Or someone who stood up to the bullies before the zombie apocalypse? Or part of the bullying storyline at all?\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I found the conclusion of this series lukewarm, up in the air, as I am sure it was the intention since Netflix or the powers at the studio who produced this drama are probably wishing for a second season. Or more.\\n\\nOverall, if you like zombies stories, you might as well give it chance.\\nRead More', 'Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n10\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n7.0\\nRewatch Value\\n8.5\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nA Thrilling Modern-Day Apocalyptic Drama with Emotional Compelling Scenes\\nThis is a drama centering not simply around humans vs. zombies, but themes of team work, love and friendship as well in the face of a modern-day zombie-like virus outbreak that spreads across a high school in the city of Hyosan. It follows a group of high school students as they attempt to communicate with outside rescue authorities and fight for survival. What would you do if you wound up trapped inside your high school rife with flesh-eating monsters roaming the halls, classrooms, gym, cafeteria and field left and right? Among them are your homeroom teacher, that kid who sat next to you in math, and even your best friend of ten years, looking bloody and repulsive, driven by a primal desire to eat you and your human friends up for dinner, making the person you once knew no longer recognizable. A team of courageous and smart teens joined forces. Together they stave off and combat these zombies, along with a number of emotional challenges tied to loss, betrayal, sacrifice and longing. And in the midst of it all, they must put up a fight because the only way out is through.\\n\\nThe gameplan? First, find a temporary base safe and isolated from the hordes of zombies. Next, plan and strategize by considering all accessible and useful tools in the vicinity. Employ logic to skillfully weigh the risks of every move. Finally, at the right moment, execute, and pray for the best, doing all their bodies could withstand to adapt to the unforeseen obstacles standing in the way that could rock the boat.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed the thoughtful communication style and interactions of the characters. I fully immersed myself in both their playful banter as well as vulnerable heart-to-hearts. Showed that it’s in times of crises such as these that a solid support system and boosts of morale serve as providers of hope. A meaningful reminder that bad moments are plenty but life must go on, so never lose hope. My favorite character absolutely has to be Nam-ra, the class president. Beneath her quiet and standoffish demeanor is a warm and affectionate girl with a level-headedness and quick thinking skills that truly came in clutch and saved the team multiple times in critical, sticky situations.\\n\\nIf you’re one to catch plot holes like a hawk, it’s been made known to me, judging by other reviews I’ve read, that you might as well not start watching since all you’re going to feel is frustration as you attempt to wrap your head around certain scenarios. I, for one, felt like none of the characters had acted out-of-character or anything at any point during the series. I found myself easily able to empathize and shed tears of joy and sorrow with every character. They’re so young, yet strong. If you are like me and are just looking for good, exciting entertainment to get your cardiovascular game on on a calm evening, this is the show for you! Have a snack in hand to indulge in because this drama will keep your eyes glued to the screen for a while. Although a lot of the show does picture grotesque, gorey zombies digging into human insides and (surprisingly well-shot) action scenes, it was certainly not without its share of heart-fluttering sweet romantic moments between the leads, comedic reliefs, and genuine, raw emotions.\\n\\nI encourage all to give this a shot. It is captivating and binge-worthy.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n9.0\\nStory\\n8.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.5\\nMusic\\n3.5\\nRewatch Value\\n1.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nmy thought\\nthis review may or may not contain spoilers .\\n\\nthis show started very boringly to be honest it didn't give any moves till episode .5 it gradually changed and became better with the storyline ,what surprised me the most is their acting i did really enjoy it good actors and actresses .\\n\\nit is so far my favorite zombie action after (train to busan ) , but the whole gap that it makes is the camera work and music this show lacks music in general that it what made it boring in the start.\\n\\ni would not rewatch any shows if i dont miss it , and with zombies i dont think i would lol so rewatch value is zero with this one .\\n\\n\\noverall it could be better but this is good and i love it as simple as that.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n8.5\\nStory\\n8.5\\nActing/Cast\\n9.5\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n9.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nA sombre apocalypse\\nCalling this an enjoyable watch feels wrong given I was holding in my stomach for most of it, either at the nail-biting tension or the exploding moments of gore and blood. But it was an excellent show. It built up the sense of crisis, the hopelessness and through it, the characters. The relationships that were formed were organically done and realistic, and thus made you root for characters sometimes simply because of what they meant to everyone else. This show did really well in highlighting the importance of family and social rootedness because people are stronger when compassion is plentiful. I've always found Korean shows to be thoughtful in the social analysis of these things and this show hinted well at that.\\n\\nThe other thing they did well with was the issue of survivors' guilt. Living on felt very difficult for characters but giving up was a betrayal of the memory and sacrifice of those who died for them to live. I thought the show was beautifully written in that way. The casting was good and there was an innocent charm to a lot of these characters, who ultimately, were just teenagers having a very rotten school week.\\n\\nThe standout character was Nam-ra and her ending was beautiful and deserved. Her struggle for clinging onto her humanity manifesting in that feral shriek of despair at the end really underlined the sheer goodness of her character, her overwhelming desire to hold onto the essence of who she is and not give in. I give the show 5 stars for how it wrote her, she quickly grew into the most interesting character.\\n\\nThe show had some excellent sections. Moments when they were trapped in one place for too long only to escape and get trapped elsewhere within the school and then during the second half of the show when their movement was more fluid and constant simply because staying in one place, they realised, was just delaying the impending doom. The final two episodes of the show blew me away because many things I did not expect to happen took place. Even though the ending was a little foreshadowed, it was a deserved one but everything else during those final episodes left me stunned. In a zombie apocalypse, there are no main characters with plot armour.\\n\\nThere were things I didn't like. Far too many characters had heroic deaths to the point where it sort of lost value. It was more gripping when people are trying to escape but the zombies take them. I think the hero complex was a real problem with Cheong-San. I liked him a lot but I was tired by his need to always elect himself as the sacrificial lamb for the group. I also thought how his death came about was foolish. They were all just standing there while he was slowly getting attacked. it didn't make sense especially given Nam-ra's superhuman feats that she just stood there.\\n\\nThen there is Nayeon's character. I cannot accept that she purposefully infected someone just to be proven right. Her death was sad in that the group didn't realise she had only died due to her desire for redemption. I was a little annoyed at first before I realised it worked out better like this. It would have been too neat for her to reconnect with them.\\n\\nMy main issue perhaps, is the idea that this virus began because someone's dad got fed up with school bullying and decided humanity was irredeemable and evil. You're telling me that's how everyone got infected? I lost all sympathy with him when he was talking about how the system failed his son because of what he then transpired to do. There were also some payoffs I was waiting for, such as the girl who got videotaped getting her revenge during the apocalypse but the show didn't even hint towards that.\\n\\nThose were my only real complaints, because otherwise it was an entirely excellent show.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n4.0\\nStory\\n4.0\\nActing/Cast\\n4.0\\nMusic\\n2.0\\nRewatch Value\\n1.0\\nDisastrous show\\nWhat to say about this train wreck of a show… I disliked every single aspect of it. I’m a huge fan of korean zombie shows and movies but this drama is just an embarrassment. I don’t understand how it became popular in the first place, as it has 0 redeeming qualities to it.\\n\\nI’m truly infuriated and disgusted with myself for having even watched it until the end. I guess I was hoping for the plot to deliver what it promised but it was full of clichés, repetitions, stupid useless scenes and characters, anti-climatic outcomes and everything bad a story can have. I’ll forgive the acting (the older actors were good though) because most of these people are pretty new in the game and they’re young, but the acting was pretty bad too. The characters were useless, unlikeable, unrealistic, their actions made no sense and their worries (crushes????like wtf????) were meaningless most of the time. And the inconsistencies with the way the infected acted (how long it took them to turn etcetc) just pissed me off. The way the story was told as a whole isn’t coherent or interesting.\\n\\nTo be fair, it could have been really good if they had wasted less time with irrelevant storylines, if had organized the way it’s presented in a more thrilling way, if they had made the characters and their reactions more realistic and logical… I could go on for a whole hour. But maybe it would have been a decent drama had it been released in 2014 or something.

The original niche for the drama includes target audience that expect rom-com in any drama they watch and its delivered in a very deliberate manner. It was unnecessary. I mean they are in a virus aka zombie apocalypse which they call it as. The plot is very poor and its quite clear whats going to happen. To continue the story, they are forcibly moving to other places and doing stuff thats not needed or demanding. I just cant write more coz the entire drama is a mess. Sorry to say, but thats the truth. The origin or the concept of patient zero is not at all touched apart from harnessing concepts like teen pregnancy, abuse, social barriers, etc superficially. Instead of focussing on key issues, they just targeted so many random issues all at once with no depth in acting by the novices. The villian is like undefeatable and wasnt promising at all. The other characters didnt have any development. If I had to watch it through my perspective, there should have been much investment on development of story, how the virus originated, at least should have made it understandable. These observations accounts to only 1 or 2% of the experienced mess. The movie goes nowhere expect for the niche expecting a second season.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n6.0\\nStory\\n3.5\\nActing/Cast\\n8.5\\nMusic\\n8.5\\nRewatch Value\\n2.5\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nSo much wasted potential...\\nI've never written a review before, but this is the most frustrating kdramas I've ever watched. If it wasn't for sunk cost fallacy, I would've stopped watching it at ep 6, but I pushed on only to be rewarded with disappointment after disappointment.\\n\\nMy main issue is with the writing. So before I jump into that, I'll say that the drama LOOKED really good. It definitely had that Netflix budget. Some of the acting was top tier. The zombies themselves were convincingly terrifying. Love a surprise Lee Kyu Hyung appearance. A lot of their survival instincts and plans had believable merit.\\n\\nUnfortunately, these details could not save the show's biggest flaw: the writing.\\n\\nI think the reason I ended this show feeling so pissed off was because it had so much wasted potential. All the plot threads for a smart, compelling, satisfying drama were there, but they were mostly left hanging. At points, I felt like the writers were actually trolling us by purposely setting up an interesting character arc only to let it fizzle without a purpose. I'll detail the most egregious ones below:\\n\\n‧ So Ju (On Jo's father) - Set up from the beginning as one of the main story lines, we saw So Ju fight against all odds to prove that a father's love could overcome anything. He was trapped, attacked multiple times, put under lockdown, shot (don't even get me started on how multiple trained soldiers couldn't shoot one man running without cover), gut-punched by a tree and yet he still made his way to the school. Just in time, he manages to randomly (the guy has been through so much, i'll overlook this incredibly unlikely luck) discover On Jo and her friends in a gym detached from the main school building. He somehow breaks a thick metal chain to free them and unites with his daughter. It's touching, it's a relief, it's satisfying. But not 10 minutes later, despite flares working to distract the zombies, he's sacrificing himself for no apparent reason and sending his daughter and crew off to face more unknown dangers on their own again. And that was that. A fleeting payoff followed by a nonsensical self-sacrifice that probably resulted in more characters dying than would've if he'd been there to guide them further.\\n\\n‧ Gwi Nam (and the bullying storyline) - Yoo In Soo's acting as a villain was really well done. He was appropriately terrifying and fully psychotic. At some point it turned and became comical how many times he popped back up to be a threat, but I still think he was a good villain in theory. However, his hyper-fixation on Chung San and the forced conflict between them was frustrating when the obvious and much better story arc of Eun Ji getting her revenge was RIGHT THERE. Instead, the sympathy that was built up for the bullied duo was dashed by showing them both to be awful people at their core which sent a really weird message. Also, what was the point of Eun Ji going back to light the school on fire? My expectation was that our main group would find themselves trapped on the roof as the fire spread and needing to make an escape, but instead we got a few lit up pieces of paper and then... nothing. Let's also not forget that there's implication that Soo Hyeok used to run with Gwi Nam's crowd meaning he was probably a pretty awful bully himself up until recently and yet we're supposed to see him as one of the most likable and righteous members of the main group.\\n\\n‧ The wasted potential of so many fleeting characters and pointless introductions - What was the point of the pregnant high school student? What did that story beat add to the drama? What was the significance? Just to eventually give the cops something to do? Same with the youtuber. He could've been used as a plot vehicle to show the outside world what was really going on but instead he existed just to take up screen time. Now, don't get me wrong. One of my favorite parts of the show was the cop duo. They had great chemistry and Lee Kyu Hyung just brings his A game to every supporting character he plays. Unfortunately, as soon as they left the police station, their purpose in the story disappeared. Better drama?: Following the two cops as they went around saving people. Better plot thread?: Letting them be the ones who retrieved the laptop. The writing robbed them of their one useful job in the story halfway through the drama. What about the assemblywoman? What was her purpose aside from delaying So Ju from saving his daughter? It was mentioned that she had kids so the least they could've done was reveal that one of the main students was her child. It would've made her a hundred times more compelling and it would've given her a deeper connection with So Ju. Wouldn't have been awesome if her child was Nam Ra? Or Na Yeon?! It was all right there and just never capitalized on. I'll just briefly mention the wasted potential of the caring teacher, the brother/sister connection (Woo Jin was given so little development/to do as a character that I didn't even realize he existed until the group was thinned out by zombies), the military commander...\\n\\n‧ Na Yeon. Sigh. We were absolutely baited by the potential of a well rounded character arc. Like many of the characters, she was just a bad, cruel person for no real discernible reason. Lots of high school students are catty or dramatic or brats, but they don't have it in them to just murder fellow classmates in a survival situation because they feel left out and ignored. But in directly and purposely sending Gyeong Soo to his death isn't the worst thing about her character - it's what happens after that. We see her hiding in the closet, stocked up with food and drinks (let me say here that the lack of attention to the fact that the students haven't had food/real water in days is odd), and she seems truly and emotionally remorseful. Surely, she's going to provide them with sustenance and win a little of their forgiveness, right? No. She hears them talking bad about her and stays put. Fine. Surely they're just upping the drama to make her revealing herself more impactful, right? No. We finally see her snapping out of her pathetic pity party and packing things up to meet them. We get an odd flashback to the teacher (another person who dies unnecessarily because of Na Yeon's selfishness and stupidity) begging her to make amends and do something helpful for the group to redeem herself. If you squint, there's even a potentially possibility that maybe she WASN'T the one who infected Gyeong Soo after all. The set up is there. She'll save them by providing food and water and apologize. She'll explain her motivations further. Wrong. She dies. Maybe. We don't really see her turn for sure so maybe she's alive or turned into one of those hybrids. Okay, writers. Surely, SURELY this means we're going to see her pop up in the future, somehow saving the group or sacrificing herself to give her story some kind of satisfying closure? Wrong again. We get a pan shot of the zombies in a future episode and there she is. So. That's that then.\\n\\n‧ The On Ju/Cheong San relationship - We know from the very beginning that he's into her. We assume that she's also hiding the fact that she's into him. But that doesn't ever really happen. She seems fully focused on her crush on Soo Hyeok up until Cheong San confesses to her. She responds with anger saying she's now lost him as a friend (which isn't necessarily unjustified) and doesn't reciprocate his feelings. After Cheong San gets bit we see a tiny spark of what maybe could've been, but does she actually have romantic feelings for him or is it just guilt? We never really see any indication that she loves him in any way other than just a best friend. She never learns what 'left' meant. It's all just kind of awkward and underdeveloped when a few small changes could've made it a much more interesting and emotional relationship dynamic.\\n\\nThis drama would've benefited from dropping about 10 characters, developing the ones left over better and pulling in the plot tighter. The potential was all there (which is what made the viewing experience so frustrating). The side plots were so much more interesting and compelling than the main group's most of the time (I've already praised the cop duo but I also thought the group headed by Ha Ri and Mi Jin was so much more interesting and defined and I wish we'd followed them instead). The pacing was off (how could things drag but also feel so glossed over? how much time exactly had even passed since the outbreak started?) and so much time was wasted on things that served no purpose to the story. And then, just when I'm finally on the last ten minutes of this struggle of a show, they introduce a new plot that is actually interesting and fresh (a congregation of a new breed of zombie hybrids with superhuman abilities! lead by the most likable character with the most significant growth and development!) and that's where it ends.\\n\\nAnd this is where my review will also end. Because I could go on, but I've covered more than enough. I've never felt compelled to write a review like this and there's definitely been some terrible shows I've watched. But the thing that sets this one apart is that it had so many ingredients to be a GREAT show. It could've really been an amazing, fresh twist on the zombie genre but it just dropped the ball over and over again. One or two pointless plots or underdeveloped characters would've been forgivable, but we were given the bones of a zombie drama without any meat.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n9.0\\nStory\\n9.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n9.0\\nRewatch Value\\n8.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nReally good but really unrealistic\\nI mean what did I expect watching a movie about zombies, of course it will be unrealistic!\\n\\nI found it weird how well the teenagers fought, no teenager is that good at fighting in real life.\\nAnyways, besides that it was a great show!

This is my first ever review so please bear with me if it goes here and there at times. I have finished this drama within 2 days of its' release. Honestly, enjoyed watching it so much. There are a few obvious plot holes (come on writers ain't super humas to not have any) but while we watch the series they go unnoticed. I absolutely loved the emotions carried by the cast. The series had me sitting on the edge. The series COULD have been concluded in lesser episodes, at times it kinda feels dragged or maybe slowed down. But again, while watching it won't feel tiring at all.\\n\\nSo, the main question as why I would re-watch it? The BG score was so subtle, at times you just get into the scene and the score won't feel like an extra addition that was forced. This kind of stands out. I watched the trailer after finishing the series and then noticed how well they have composed it. Especially the whistle version of Auld Lang Syne which was by Cheong-San in the series was nicely put towards the outro of the trailer making it extra heavy. That song means farewell indeed. The series had my most favourite characters dying from episode to episode, and I really have complaints against it. My heart sank so much I would re watch it just to see those characters live and laugh on screen once more.\\n\\nWith zombies coming from everywhere right from the first minute, this series kept me hanging on to it even after 5 days of finishing it. I would definitely recommend you to watch it, at least to appreciate the production.\\n\\nI understand I just had too many thoughts and no proper structure in my review.

A lot of of them were either boring, dumb, unnecessary, annoying or whatever. There were just too many and some of them only existed to make the story longer such as the assembly woman, the blogger, the pregnant teen etc. A lot of the story arcs were also poorly done. I thought Eunji was gonna have some sort of hero arc or at least fight off Gwi Nam to redeem herself since they\\'re both half zombies but NOPE. They also made Nayeon seem remorseful for what she did for 5 minutes and then proceed to kill her like WHY???\\n\\nOne of my complaints is with the FL. On Ju is an incredibly boring, dull and uninteresting character. She\\'s also extremely stupid at times. When the zombies were coming at her in the canteen, what does she do you ask? SHE FREAKING SAT THERE AND WAITED FOR CHEONG SAN TO SAVE HER. When she found out her best friend and crush died, what does she say to her Cheong San aka her childhood friend? THAT EVERYONE SHE LIKES DIED. She also almost cause Cheong San to die in the same scene. If it weren\\'t for him saving her, she would have died. BE MORE GRATEFUL FOR GODS SAKE. No to mention her constantly beating and kicking Cheong San in the first couple of episodes. I really don\\'t know what Cheong San see in her.\\n\\nThe romance between Su Hyeok and Nam Ra was super unnecessary and boring if you ask me. Nam Ra also makes some stupid decisions even though she\\'s suppose to be the smart one. She saw Nayeon wanting to murder Gyeong Su and what does she do? SHE FREAKING WAITS UNTIL NAYEON DID IT TO ONLY EXPOSE HER. Why couldn\\'t you have done it sooner and prevent 3 death??? Also, when she heard there was zombies coming why did she have to count how many there were ??? How is that in any way shape or form helpful?? JUST RUN ALREADY.\\n\\nCheong San\\'s mom who was literally dumb as hell, not to mention his dad who just magically disappeared??? The police force my goodness, y\\'all let a bunch of high schoolers beat you ass at survival. The science teacher, who told the police to retrieve the his computer from the school science lab to find a cure but only...THERE WAS NO CURE IN THE FIRST PLACE. Eunji who \"set the school on fire\" when she just sat a bunch of papers IN ONE ROOM ON FIRE.\\n\\nOn Jo\\'s dad also had an unnecessary sacrifice, he could have escaped safely with the group but no, they had to kill him. They also didn\\'t bother to explain how hybrids seem to work, how and why 3 of them are different which left me confuse. After almost 3 days without food except for a piece of chocolate bar, you\\'d think they\\'d be tired and exhausted but NOPE they still seem perfectly intact.\\n\\nThe female characters in the classroom group were all so useless. When they encountered zombies, the male characters literally ripped out doors and windows from the classroom to attack and defend. And what do the female characters do? THEY LITERALLY STOOD THERE DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. They didn\\'t build up I-Sak and On Ju\\'s friendship except for a couple of flashbacks so I felt nothing when she died.\\n\\nThe times taken for each character to turn into zombies also didn\\'t make sense. It took the science teacher\\'s son a couple of weeks (?) to turn into zombies. Then when the school got infected, it was 5 seconds. When I-Sak was infected, it was 20 minutes. And when Gyeong Su is infected, it took him like what? A couple hours??\\n\\nThe things I liked :\\n\\nThe bromance between Su Hyeok and Cheong San were amazing. The scene where they were hanging off each other on the window was so cute, really wished there was more moments like that. The cinematography and camerawork was great, the canteen scene when students started getting infected was the most notable one. How they escaped from one room after another was quite interesting as well even though it got a little repetitive, I still liked it for the most part.\\n\\nMINJI, her existence just makes me happy.\\n\\nThe acting was quite impressive, even though they were given quite shitty characters, they actors and actresses still did a pretty good job portraying them. My favourite portrayal would be Lee Yoo Mi who played Nayeon and Yoo In Soo who played Gwi Nam.\\n\\nWould I rewatch it? Most definitely as I love to rewatch shows after a while. It was overall okay, I did enjoy it at some part. Not as good as Kingdom or Train to Busan but still not the worst thing in the world.\\nRead More', 'Overall\\n4.0\\nStory\\n4.5\\nActing/Cast\\n7.0\\nMusic\\n3.0\\nRewatch Value\\n1.5\\nNetflix Sensationalism With Poor Substance\\nTo quote a great poet \"I expected nothing and I\\'m still let down\".\\n\\nI checked All of Us Are Dead out of curiosity: labelled as a Netflix show but with a kdrama more usual format (12 episodes of roughly 1h). I think this is the first time I wished this drama had been shorter like the other Netflix productions.\\n\\nThe Story\\n\\nIt drags on. The main plot of the students can be summarized in one sentence : a dozen students try to survive a zombie epidemic, moving from safe spots to safe spots while having encounters with zombies and see their group thin out. That\\'s....... basically all there is to that main storyline. As the epidemic spreads, we follow for a while other storylines, notably two : that of Captain Song Jae Ik (Lee Kyu Hyung) and firefighter Nam So Ju (one of the female leads\\' father). While the first brought a well-needed comic relief and some adorable moments of Lee Kyu Hyung adopting kids left and right (and being his usual great self), the other managed to catch my attention more, balanced action scenes with calmer ones better than the school storyline. Maybe I was more receptive to these two particular part of the story because I like the actors involved or it moved quicker than the students\\' and gave more information to the stakes of the storyline. But, in my opinion, the part outside of the school were just..... better. Which is quite sad considering the main point of focus of the drama is youth in the midst of a zombie epidemic and the emotional impact such epidemic has on them.\\n\\nIn addition, I was really uncomfortable by the scene of sexual assault at the start of the drama which........ Served no purpose and was never really resolved unless punishing and blaming the victim even further was the point.\\n\\nAnd generally speaking I\\'m just very tired of bullying plotlines. This is an important topic that should be addressed but lately it seems it\\'s in every drama I watch and there is only so much I can take.\\n\\nThe drama could have easily been just 10 episodes or even less, but instead we got long boring scenes of the students talking and talking and talking and being suspicious and fighting (plus some plotholes) not to mention two \"love\" storylines that were quite honestly kinda cute but unnecessary imo.\\n\\n\\nThe Characters\\n\\nGoing in pairs with my boredom to the students storyline, I did not really get attach to any of the students. I liked them, the actors did a good job portraying them but they were..... Just there. I did not particularly care what would happen to them and even if some scenes were sad I barely felt anything. It just did not click for me. HOWEVER, once again, Lee Kyu Hyung portraying a police captain trying to grapple with the last shred of hope he can find and Jeon Bae Soo in a desperate father role were two highlights and I was disappointed when their arcs were done (especially Lee Kyu Hyung\\'s which was cut way to short for my taste).\\n\\nVisuals\\n\\nThe zombies make-up and their choreography was really well done (one of the few positives in this drama for me). They truly looked the part and were chilling at times.\\n\\nAs for the rest... I know this is a horror drama and that gory scenes are likely to happen. But this drama really had me think that some gore scenes were simply there just because Netflix can have them - in a \"in-your-face\" kind of way. Just like with most of their dramas, it seems to me they massively take the route of violent, gritty dramas and just go and escalate what they show each time. I\\'m not sure why. Is it provocation? Is it cheap shock-value? Is it just to \"buzz\" on social medias and thus receive extra publicity? I\\'m not sure, but this Netflix Sensationalism is not IT. And it\\'s frustrating because Netflix knows just how to make shows with violence and still have it be a natural part of the story (Kingdom comes to mind particularly) and not...... the whole personnality of the drama.\\n\\nThe cinematography was subpar at best, not that I was expecting anything in that regard.\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion\\n\\nIf you like zombies and have seen several dramas and movies on the subject, you will probably get bored though you might still want to check it out. If this is one of your first dramas, please check out other dramas. If it\\'s zombies you\\'re interested about, Kingdom is right there waiting for you. If it\\'s simply dramas in general, Netflix and many other platforms like Viki, Viu and others have many titles to offer with better stories, better development, better crafting all around.\\nRead More', 'Overall\\n8.5\\nStory\\n8.0\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n5.5\\nRewatch Value\\n9.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nZombie Zombie.\\nI am usually not a fan of Zombie movie but I got curious how they will manage to follow Train to Busan and Peninsula. I thought overall it was a nice drama. The story lack some point or could have been better developped. As for the bully girl, she is here to show that bullied can become bully. I would have loved to see her in a massive fight with Gyu Nam but I can understand the writer point of view. In this drama, the adult are completely useless and it shows that the teenager do not need help. I was sure that not all of the kids will make it as it is korean and no... Not everyone will survive a zombie apocalypse. I am really confused as why Nam Ra is still alive and didn\\'t decided to sacrifice herself in order to protect the other but I guess we might have an answer in the 2nd season. The adult are quite famois actor for people who do know kdrama. As for the kids it depends but I was so happy to see Park Solomon and Yoon Chan Young on a lead role for netflix and I hope it.will bring them more opportunities. Overall, as we were going forward the drama... I had that weird feeling and it somehow got confirm at the end of ep 12. \"You abandoned us\" \" I won\\'t ever trust an adult\". It was a shout out to all the adult that gave up on the teenagers stuck in the sewol ferry that the adult didn\\'t try to save. After watching Birthday with Yoon Chan Young a few years back... I never thought they will reuse similar scene as an interrogation of the survivor like it was their fault. I feel like I wouldhave to watch it again to catch all the secondary point but I will be really excited to see the season 2\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n9.5\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n10\\nRewatch Value\\n10\\nA Unique Show With A Zombie Origin\\nI loved that this show has the zombie origin and has lots of twists that are new to zombie shows.

All of Us are Dead builds on and extrapolates the zombie playing field of Train of Busan, from a 2h movie to a 12h drama series, and from within a train to a sprawling high school campus.\\n\\nAs i am still pretty new to kdramas and not familiar with the k actors/actresses, It was confusing for me with the introduction of many different students all dressed in the same school uniforms in the first episode, albeit the occasional different coloured sweaters for some students. After 4 episodes, i started to wonder how the series can continue meaningfully for another 8 episodes, other than students trying to escape alive from the zombie-flooded school.\\n\\nThe series surprisingly engages as it starts to develop the key characters, connecting viewers to them, and exploring humanity, love, sacrifices and teamwork between peers, teacher-students, dad-family, amidst the relentless attacks by the endless swarms of zombies. See comment for link to life lessons and spoilers. It drags at midpoint, as with most dramas. The introduction of half zombies thereafter beefed up the plot for a 12h series.\\n\\nOverall, it is an enjoyable and enriching zombie series to watch.

The thing to keep in mind as you're watching is, primarily, All Of Us Are Dead is focusing on a group of TEENAGERS trying to survive a zombie apocalypse with no help. Those of us that are adults, think back to when you were a teenager? Did you make intelligent, rational decisions? I was considered an intelligent kid and I know I didn't. And that's not with the added stress of a real life-or-death scenario. So I think a little grace needs to be used when nitpicking the decisions that led to undesirable results for these kids.\\n\\nThat said, I will agree that while I commend what they were TRYING to do story-wise (commentary about school bullying, the toxicity of politics, etc), there was definitely too much going on that didn't need the screen time and sort of took away focus from what should have been the main theme. I understand wanting to show the end of innocence and childhood through the loss of a parent too soon but the pregnant student and the subsequent baby left without its mother part seemed redundant, especially when there was so much emphasis put on a couple of the students witnessing the death of a parent or at least knowing for sure that their parents were dead.\\n\\nThe focus on the assembly member after On-jo's father had left the group to find his daughter didn't really seem needed to me at all. And killing him off within minutes after they were reunited seemed like just a cheap way to keep the kids on their own with no adult help whatsoever and made all the screen time focused on him being a badass and trying to get to the school and all his setbacks completely worthless.\\n\\nPersonally, I felt like not enough time was spent on fleshing out the characters and their relationships to each other to make the deaths more meaningful and devastating. Don't get me wrong, it's sad and a couple of them made me shed a tear even (I'm pretty emotional though and tend to cry when I see others crying.) but it never lasted very long.\\n\\nThe only other thing about it that irks me is that the score was completely forgettable. To the point where I don't remember any of it minus the intro music. I feel like with the use of a better score, I would have felt a lot more connected to the story and characters like I did after the rooftop singing scene.\\n\\nDespite all that, I still found it incredibly entertaining and I'm interested in what they might be planning for a possible second season.\\n\\nTLDR; Not the best drama ever written, but not the worst either. In my eyes, worth a watch if you're into zombies and horror.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n9.5\\nStory\\n8.5\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n7.5\\nRewatch Value\\n10\\nWatch it right now\\nMy first time writing a review, and you gotta watch this drama if you are hesitating to watch it.

But I recommend this for everyone\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n10\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n10\\nRewatch Value\\n10\\nTo save the majority, just how heartless do you think you need to be?\\nOut of all the zombie movies/series I have watched, this has the most substance. It is way more than just the thrill. The messages conveyed in this movie can touch you in ways, you never expected. That's exactly the case for me. And I really love this series.\\n\\nI have mentioned on most of my reviews on titles related to zombie that I am not really a fan of zombie stuff because most of the time, you know what's the most possible ending, everyone will die. So I am always looking for something that will catch my interest and sustain my attention until the end. All Of Us Are Dead did just that. Having the Ground Zero set at a school is something I haven't seen before. The reason/motivation on how it started is also unique than most vague movies wherein it just started somehow without definite explanation. Every deaths on this movie made me feel various emotions from being melancholic to feeling 'he/she deserve it.' It was more than just becoming zombies. I love how the story focuses on the characters who wanted to survive, how they lost their love ones, how they lost each other, how they rely on each other, how the situation made them grow. The pain, the sadness, the happiness. It delivers a spectrum of emotions I never imagined on a zombie show. There were also parts that are actually light and fun that somehow lightens the mood of the whole series.\\n\\nGreat selection of casts really. The way they deliver their individual characters made the story much more believable and colorful. Most of the times shows that has a lot of characters ended up just blending in together however on this one, all the characters was able to make themselves shine in their own ways. It really felt like a group of students who are friends that has common and also individual identity that separates them from the others.\\n\\nHonestly, although it left me with a lot of questions and imaginations, I love that the ending was open-ended. It kind of makes me hope that Season 2 is possible. If another season is given for this show, I'll definitely re-watch it. I have enjoyed every single scene of the show and would definitely love to re-live the moments with the casts again.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n8.0\\nStory\\n8.5\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n5.5\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nI'm always saying that I can't watch horror\\nbut I keep finding more and more stuff that\\nfit that genre. ?

Yeah it’s not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn’t any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn’t bother with the Webtoon…\\nRead More', 'Overall\\n9.0\\nStory\\n7.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n8.0\\nRewatch Value\\n7.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nNot your basic GORE FEST\\nOverall, this drama is amazing! After Train to Busan, the zombie-gore genre has been hyped in the south Korean entertainment. Reaching the benchmark of amazingly produced TTB, \\'ALL OF US DEAD\\' was an even better in terms of cinematography and production value. The makeup and graphics were on point. At some point, the intensity of the graphics were so high that i covered my eyes even if I am a huge fan of gore.\\n\\nBut is it just the gore? No!!\\nThe strong message of humanity was what touched me. Bullying and torment in such extreme level does actually prevails and it shows how it affects an individual. Parenthood is depicted in a beautiful way as well.\\n\"No parent would want their child to die right?\"\\nOn-jo\\'s dad sacrificed himself to save his daughter, Cheongsan\\'s mom came running for her son and the school girl who just delivered her baby, tied herself up to keep her baby safe. It shows that the professor who created the virus was lead by his love for his child.\\n\\nIt also shows how every character is not-so-humane and depicts the character flaw. But, the horryfying thing is it didn\\'t had any likeable character at all. The plot has its focus on each character so we can see only part of each. My favorite character has to be the teacher and the detective!\\n\\nOverall, great experience. Completed in one sitting and not boring at all!

The plot progression was good and the musical score helped to improve the intense moments in each episode. There was some well-timed humour that was unexpected but helped cut some of the seriousness of the scenes.\\n\\nHowever, the characters quickly became overbearing. The constant theme of \"sacrifice\" showed how immature the characters were. The slow reaction to life-threatening situations was frustrating and the fact that no zombies reached them in the time they were there wasting standing around was unrealistic.

It was long overdue and I just believe korea makes the best zombie content like there's no argument there. I liked that the shows backdrop was bullying like highlighting such an serious issue with zombies somehow worked. It also showed even though there are main actors, there's no bias between each character you never know what's going to happen next and that kept me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\nThe visual effects, makeup and acting in terms of being zombies was outstanding. I feel like the actors especially Yoon Chan Young also did a great job in displaying emotion and pain, it had me crying many times. But like people are saying some characters were just not developed enough and i agree. I wish we got more backstory than just them fighting zombies. I also liked that they showed us how the virus was resolved, otherwises most zombies shows or sci fi shows end on the main leads still fighting zombies and trying to survive. Also appreciate that they got young actors to play high school students, you can tell and it does make an difference.\\n\\nThat being said I know the show is getting a of cristimism in terms of its rabbit holes, but I think they still just an great job in creating an decent show within 12 episodes, could there be changes yes for sure, but i think they mainly wanted to make it an zombie show than a show filled with story and in terms of that boy did they deliver or what.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n9.5\\nStory\\n9.5\\nActing/Cast\\n10\\nMusic\\n10\\nRewatch Value\\n9.5\\nWatched it all in less than 24 hours.\\nNowadays it takes a lot for me to get into a show.

By actually making us care both for the humans and zombies. It also gave them a human soul despite them being more dead than alive. I also love the twist between humans and zombies.

It has an interesting origins for the zombie virus, and they show you how it starts and how it affects the city throughout each episode. There are different characters, and you see their story and their reasons for doing what they do. There are some characters will you root for. Characters with strong survival skills and logical thinking, and they are similar to Daryl and Michonne from The Walking Dead if you\\'ve ever seen it. That\\'s the good I have to say about the show.\\n\\nAs for the bad, this show becomes increasingly frustrating to watch. You\\'re going to wonder why certain characters do idiotic things or wait for bad things to happen. Some characters you expect to fulfill their roles later on. One student is big and strong, he carries a door and uses it to hold off some zombies. In a later episode, I expected him to help bust down a door, but instead they had some of the weaker students try to do it. Logically, it makes no sense. Its very irritating to watch.\\n\\nSpeaking of irritating, one of the main antagonists will not go down. There are plenty of chances for him to die, yet because of the virus (aka \"plot armor\") he just constantly gets back up and gets to do whatever he wants. I get that he\\'s a villain, but as someone who loves well written villains, he needs more. Most characters get flashbacks and a backstory, this one guy does not. If the writers had made him a more relatable, maybe he wouldn\\'t be so annoying. But he\\'s just evil for the sake of being evil.\\n\\nI understand these are just teenagers, so that may give reasoning for their dumb decision making. However, they make several references to zombie films and are aware of what zombies are. I would think that if they know about zombies, they would know more about how zombies are and how to kill them. But you\\'re not gonna see that for a while, until way later in the series.\\n\\nAll of us are Dead did hook me with the first few episodes, but then it started testing my patience. I really wish they didn\\'t make it so obnoxious to watch in later episodes, and I don\\'t plan on re-watching it again.\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n8.0\\nStory\\n7.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n8.5\\nRewatch Value\\n7.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nall of us are dead :x\\nas an avid zombie/apocalyptic series watcher, i shall give an objective review on this series..\\n\\nSTORY\\ni think the story as much potential, tho i wont say it has been fully optimized or put to good development in this series? also not comparing to the webtoon since i had not read it. the typical circle for apocalyptic series are simple: outbreak, seeing the human nature (some are selfess, some evil), definitely some exceptions where they have immunity/ half-mutant and of course sacrifices... The story did touch on these, but i felt it could have been done maybe a little more in depth.\\n\\nso my opinions is:\\n1. ground zero: i like that in this show, they did explain the source of ground zero. in many series, we do not actually have a reason or clue why there's an outbreak (e.g sweet home, train to busan) . they key was of course a genius scientist, whom in a desperate attempt to save his suicidal kid, developed some sort of drug? that makes you half dead, half alive, hence zombies. so this is what i like because it's quite a wholesome explanation\\n2. human nature: and of course, in every zombie/apocalyptic series, there's gonna be selfless people and also ppl who annoy the hell out of you. so of course, the star players will be the main troop: cheongsan & suhyeok + i would say mijin & hari because i love that girl crush duo. annoying ones of course: gwi nam, nayeon and jimin?? sorry it was also borderline onjo for me tho her character was okay because she did provided survival guidance as a fireman's daughter?? just felt that she waskinda harsh to cheongsan at times ...\\n3: mutants: seriously this was the part i felt that most imagination or development can be put to use? main 3 mutants : eunji, gwi nam & namra.\\n- first, i get that they are highlighting the bullying culture in SK, hence eunji's character? but other than that , she was kinda useless for me tho? and to me kinda unneccessay since she never met up with the main squad at all? it could have been better if she had used her new found life to help the squad and also revenge on gwi nam? i mean that was the direction i had in mind the moment i realize she was mutant? but the writer didnt made her do that so i dont really know the point of her character?\\n- gwinam, of course there's gonna be a villian out there and it's safe to say gwinam is one of the main villian? like he is so dead bound on killing cheongsan just because he witness him murdering the principal? to me that quite illogical...? and right it might be cheongsan's character but idk why he had to keep provoking gwinam when really his life and death is at stake?? and for me, him having evidence of gwinam killing the principal? but so what? was it really that important when you dont even know you can survive tomorrow? i mean it's a good arc to have to introduce a villian, but i did not find the reason convincing enough .........\\n- namra, the only mutant in the squad but wasted potential? like it's obvious she has half human half zombies senses, and was of course helpful towards the crew, but she has more potential of course out of her character? but it did not happen? i mean with her abilities, she could have been better used to help the members, or even attract others of her kinds and eventually be a subject for clinicals to develop a cure at the later stage?? but i realize there were mnay scenes where she really just stood and watch ... so it felt like a waste to me though i really like her character?\\n4. sacrifices: too much in this series, but acceptable for a survival series. main sacrifices: joonyeong, cheongsan. the rest which i felt was unneccessay was : onjo's dad, woojin\\n- like joonyeong really selfless outthere protecting mijin when minutes ago he was just quarrelling with her? but he did not hesitate to save her and got himself infected in the end. he then ultimately sacrifices himself to draw the zombies away from his friends for their escape...\\n- same goes for cheongsan like he kinda like the main hero in the series :( honestly felt his death (??) was not neccessary if they had more useful development for some characters out there :( i am not sure how the webtoon ended but i hope he manages to escape as a half mutant like namra (though unlikely given the explosion, and gwi nam injuring his eyes like wtf). if only there was eunji revenge arc/ namra putting his abilities to better use/ introduction of new mutants to the squad in between...\\n-onjo's dad: honestly i was expecting more from his escapee, or at least hoping he has an encounter with jaeik and the lackey ?? to form a better crackdown team because the militants have their own dilema in saving those kids i get it. and his sacrifice...wasn't really needed i feel...they should have included him in the squad for a longer time frame :(\\n- woojin; really love it out there when he saved the other girl, and in the end hari ...it was touching but i actually hoped he had survived..\\n\\nregarding the loveline: it felt like namra and suhyeok was the main, although it might have been onjo and cheongsan. i wish they hadn't included it at all because it wasnt clearly explained or developed enough? like cheongsan and onjo's loveline was clear, because they grew up together.. but namra and suhyeok suddenly? idk... and also suhyeok didnt make it clear to onjo at the end as well too since she confessed to him? and at the back it seems like onjo likes cheongsan? it's kinda messy for me. basically could have be simple, like cheongsan likes onjo, onjo likes suhyeok (not sure why tho, should have had some flashbacks) but later realizes she likes cheongsan. Suhyeok making his feelings clear to both onjo & cheongsan, and also show some flashback how did him and namra ended up liking e/o?) hmmm..\\n\\nACTING:\\noverall, most of the actors and actresses were new faces to me. but i didnt feel any awkward acting so far... probably some characters were not written well enough? but i personally really loved badass characters like hari & mijin? and also namra tho she could have been written for better use i feel... and of course, cheongsan and suhyeok was great there!!\\n\\nMUSIC/REWATCH\\nnot much music but since i wasn't distracted by any music, i think it was well directed? hmm probably wont rewatch, but i do hope they sign for a S2/3 because the ending doesnt seem simple? because namra is basically alive, mutated with the rest that is like them? and we of course need a key personnel to put them into good use, developing a vaccine or antibodies (like in happiness) so they can return to human form ? and i hope cheongsan is alive somehow... :|\\n\\noverall, i think it was a good watch tho i felt the series shouild have been an 8 - 10 episodes long if they removed unnecessary characters or plots that did not contribute to the flow of the show... i will just wait for some news if there's a new seaon, like Sweet Home :D\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n9.0\\nStory\\n9.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.5\\nMusic\\n5.0\\nRewatch Value\\n9.0\\nSecond leads carry the entire plot\\nI said that Kingdom and Happiness are the best zombie drama.

Choi Namra is a hard carry in this drama! <3\\n- Production team forgot to explain the details of how to kill the zombies like killing titans in Attack on Titan where everyone must slice the titans\\' neck. In this drama, sometimes, the zombies die by getting stabbed on the body, getting sliced on their neck, getting shot on their head, etc randomly. The explanation I remember is that they will die when the \"host\" body is destroyed. But, their \"host\" body isn\\'t destroyed until the near end of the drama. So, those high schoolers actually didn\\'t kill the zombies and just stunned them?\\n- Unnecessary sexual violence scene (a naked girl that has been bullied).\\n- There is no epic music :(\\n- Shibal, there is too much cursing. It\\'s much better if you don\\'t understand Korean lang.\\n- We need to wait for the next season to see how the plot ends.\\n- The writer is obviously forcing them to get trapped in the school lmao.\\n\\nExtra:\\nWhy majority of watchers love Namra more than On Jo? I think it\\'s because Namra\\'s role is the key to their survival while On Jo is always crying all the time and seems cannot live without people around her.

The storyline is everywhere, following lesser characters instead of fleshing out the leads and giving the viewers time to get to know and care for the main leads. People disappear and reappear making the storyline choppy and frustrating. In 12 episodes this series could have been wrapped up tightly and neatly. Instead we got a lot of jerk kids whom we barely knew and didn't much care about.\\n\\nThe main thread of this show is the consequences of bullying. Everything that happens subsequently is the result of the students' bullying of one another. That bullying leads to revenge, which leads to disaster. It was a depressing show with little lighter moments. The stars here really are the zombies. The most frustrating part of this show is the lack of continuity. Storylines begin and then are abandoned to give other characters more air time. Those abandoned characters aren't heard from for several episodes before they come back only to disappear for longer stretches again. It was entertaining, but not well written or gripping as Train to Busan. For all the comparison that the show itself makes to the movie, this is NO Train to Busan. This series is gorier, slower, and not as well written. It leaves you feeling run down, disappointed, and sad in the end.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n4.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.5\\nMusic\\n7.0\\nRewatch Value\\n4.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nsome of us are dead\\ni wanted to say, that i liked the more slow paced story at the start. it introduced us to so many different characters and plotlines. some of them were even likeable. however... it got repeating. i liked how they werent scared to kill of characters (like i-sak) even tho they were really close to MC, but when you keep killing characters, it just gets repetitive . some of the deaths were actually super unnecessary (looks at on jo's dad). this had such potential. but i think the main problem was so many plotlines AND SO MANY plotholes.\\ni also think this wouldve been so much better as a choice-based game, like detroit become human.\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n8.5\\nStory\\n8.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.5\\nMusic\\n7.0\\nRewatch Value\\n5.5\\njauh lebih oke kalau dibandingkan dengan drama serupa sebelumnya (happiness), alurnya lambat tapi detailnya lumayan oke (dan menurut w ini syarat pembuatan cerita nyeremin kaya gini). emosinya campur aduk banget; greget, kesel, ngeri, sedih, sampe cheesy juga ada. sayangnya terlalu banyak karakter ngga penting yang kehadirannya ngga jelas dan sebenernya ngga begitu dibutuhin; salah satunya ya itu si anak perempuan yang hamil itu. di luar itu memang agak sulit untuk bikin 'pembaruan' dalam pembuatan cerita zombie karna pasti bakal mirip-mirip sama yang udah ada sebelumnya, tapi overall ini oke banget si, enjoyable!\\n\\ncheongsanie t____t\\nRead More\", \"Overall\\n10\\nStory\\n10\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n9.0\\nRewatch Value\\n10\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nFavorite zombie series ever, ignore negative reviews!\\nI am sorry but I'm baffled by some of the negative reviews.

Must Watch\\nThis drama is by far one of the most entertaining \\'zombie\\' dramas which I have come across. I loved \"Train To Busan\" which aired in 2016 and no other Zombie movie or drama has come close, until now.\\n\\nAll Of Us Are Dead gives us a refreshing perspective of how Zombies are dealt with by teenage students from a Korean High School. One would think that it will be kid stuff. As I entered it\\'s first episode, I found that nothing about the show is \\'kiddish\\'. This is one drama that had me on the edge of my seat right until the last episode. The speed of which human transformed into Zombies was mind boggling and to see the students having to think on their feet and coping with disagreements, friendship, love, sacrifice and even putting their studies to good use, enthralled me, as they kept moving forward to save themselves in throes of un-certainty.\\n\\nAll the teenagers in this drama deserve compliments for their acting especially Yoon Chang Young (Chung San) and Park Soloman (Soo Hyuk). There were nine of them who carried most of the episodes, and their friendship was comfortable to watch. They truly had each others\\' back.\\n\\nRegardless of which genre of dramas you belong to, this drama is worth the day and time for you to sit back and make time to watch. The show is well directed, acting met the mark, the scenes well captured and most important, the Zombies performed in perfection. I watched a \\'behind the scene\\' for this show and all the actors took many hours to rehearse their Zombie movement. Such dedication was well reflected and brought much authenticity to the drama.\\n\\nI look forward to the continuation of \"All Of Us Are Dead\". The show left us in anticipation of what could have happened to some of the transformed students and all other possibilities. I look forward to watching all the savvy, kick ass students coming together in their continued journey to survive amongst Zombies ..... or not?\\n\\nThis series is highly recommended for you to watch. Do not carry a high expectation, in case you get disappointed.

The characters assume this, because both Gwinam and Namra, who was bitten by him, are Hambies.

Kind of like a vaccine?\\n- Did all her friends forget that On Jo got bitten by that first girl who got bitten by the hamster? Shouldn\\'t she have turned into either a Hambie or a Zombie, or be immune to everything?

I found his character and acting in \"All of us are dead\", as Lee Su-hyeok, refreshing, and probably most enjoyed the \\'bromance\\' he had with Yoon Chan-young\\'s character (Lee Cheong-san). Though I have to admit it wasn\\'t a standout \"WOW\" performance, his character was probably the only reason i watched to the end and his acting was consistent.\\n\\nAs for the drama overall, my major criticisms are these:\\n-The writing was unfortunately really flat. There wasn\\'t much of a plot to begin with. The only parts i found really enjoyable was the characters drop kicking zombies, and the minor internal distresses the group had.\\n-There were too many female damsels in distress who were intentionally written to be dumb, the main FL being a prime example.\\n-There\\'s nothing to really focus on or hope for with this drama. Even one of the main conflicts with Gwi nam doesnt actually make much sense.\\n-The acting messed me up, more on that below.\\n\\nTHE ACTING:\\n-The acting of the main female lead, Park Ji-hu (On-jo), was completely unbearable. Everything about her acting was completely flat: her voice sounded the same whether she was happy, distressed, scared, \"brave\", supportive etc. Her facial expressions were worse-- in her sad scenes I could only tell she was sad by the single tear drop strategically placed on her cheek. Otherwise she almost always appeared as though she was either bored or irritated. To give the actress a tiny break, the character of On-jo herself really sucked. She was supposed to be resourceful, being a firefighter\\'s daughter but instead she was completely useless and only saved by plot armor whenever she actually came in contact with zombies. I skipped a bunch of this character\\'s \"most impactful scenes\" because the acting annoyed me so much. Literally skipped her reaction to her father\\'s death, Cheong-san\\'s death and parting with Nam Ra because i felt her acting literally made the scene worse. I don\\'t know what went wrong and i dont know if i disliked the character of On-jo or the actress\\'s portrayal of her but the outcome is the same-- i would have totally excluded this character if i could, and if she wasn\\'t present i might actually rate this drama\\'s acting much higher at maybe 7/10 or 6.5/10 rather than 3/10.\\n-What was worse for me was that the side characters did too much of a better job than this main FL, which in my opinion should never be the case. Even the actress for the archer girl Ha-Ri and actress for Mi-jin did a better job and we didn\\'t see much of them at all.\\n-As a second female lead Cho Yi-hyun as Nam-Ra also did a better job as well.\\n-The cast\\'s relationship with each other was really fun. If i could separate scores for acting and cast i\\'d give cast a 6/10 and acting a 3/10.\\n-I actually enjoyed Im Jae-hyuk\\'s (Dae-su) character and felt he made some otherwise dull scenes slightly more enjoyable.\\n-I also felt Yoon Chan-young\\'s (Lee Cheong-san) acting and character were decent as well but I might be biased because he was a primary zombie drop-kicker so I don\\'t know that i cared that much about the emotional weight of his character. I still felt his portrayal of the emotional range of his character was decent.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Good:\\n-The best part of this drama for me was drop-kicking zombies\\n-The connection of the cast with each other\\n-The bromance of the two male leads\\n-The suspense of them getting out of some situations earlier on in the series\\n-Letting one person in their inner group become a halfie zombie was interesting as a concept but not executed in the best way\\n-The camera work was largely pretty good at capturing the action in ways that feel you\\'re right there with the characters\\n\\nThe Bad (just about everything else):\\n-The acting of the main FL was really stiff for me (i just cant get over this)\\n-The writing seemed to only care about tying all 1000 extra characters in with the main group of students. It wasn\\'t tight writing.\\n-Why do they have 1000 extra characters? They should have focused on the main side characters.\\n-They really didn\\'t need to insert romance into resting moments of the characters, it felt forced\\n-They wrote the female lead to not use her brain and be useless while pretending she\\'s brave. She was a decent emotional support nearing the end but that wasn\\'t enough to redeem this character for me.\\n-Killing off characters is only impactful when you know they had to die and their deaths were meaningful. Most of the character deaths were completely uncalled for (ex On-Ju\\'s father, the archer dude, Cheong-san\\'s mother ,the female teacher Na-yeon and many more)\\n-Childish sense of morality \"you did bad--now you die\" was repeated literally for every character-- even ones not turned into zombies, like that Chief of Defense who (SPOILER) bombed the city then took his own life. Why did they do that to his character?\\n-The whole Gwi nam hunting for Cheong-san thing actually made no sense, yet it was supposed to be a central part of the plot and climax, why?\\n-The music was trash. I literally muted some moments to escape the soundtrack at times.\\n\\n\\nSummary:\\n\"All of Us Are Dead\" was for the most part good for mindless entertainment--you could be a zombie watching it and still get the jist of it. It doesn\\'t strive to be smart (and it isn\\'t), it doesn\\'t strive to be philosophical or deep (and it isn\\'t). It\\'s just a slightly better than mediocre bit of fun and though it wasn\\'t high quality at all, I still moderately enjoyed it for the reason i watched it--mindless fun. Despite my moderate enjoyment I don\\'t actually recommend it. There aren\\'t enough redeeming points to give it above a 2 for me; still if i ever feel like I particularly don\\'t want to use my brain while watching something I might give this a partial rewatch.\\n\\ntotal critical rating: 2/10\\nmindless entertainment rating: 6/10\\nRead More', 'Overall\\n9.0\\nStory\\n9.0\\nActing/Cast\\n9.0\\nMusic\\n7.0\\nRewatch Value\\n9.0\\nFun ride...\\nI was initially a skeptic when I saw that this would be a series instead of a movie.

I don’t craze for horror but I enjoy gore which there is a difference. Seeing how creative one can get with zombie gore is what I was looking forward to. In this case I felt “creativity” went out the window. Zombies were just the same as any other and it was unclear the whole time how to kill them, for some it seemed like an arrow or knife to the neck was enough but other times it didn’t work, no consistency whatsoever. The storyline felt like they wanted to tell a little bit of every characters story but none of there personalities got fully fleshed out. Quite frankly, by the end I didn’t even remember some of their names… that is what little impact they had on me. So many missed opportunities in this show too, for example there are a few characters like the girl who was in the room with the food who I felt could have had a really rich development arc and the bullied girl as well, so much potential! Made me wish I was with the script writers and push them harder because really that was what was lacking-editing the story. The way it ended felt more like this could have just been better off as a movie. It really didn’t need to be that long, I could have lived without the false hope of some of the characters outcomes.

And also they wasted the SML. There wasn’t even a need for his role other than defending his love and kicking zombies. The ML was really good. Both FL and SFL were great too but it would’ve been so much better if they just kept SFL alone because the FL didn’t really have any part to play other than lose her loved ones. The other characters are all likeable too. This is definitely worth a rematch but I hope they will bring back the main lead again because the ending literally hinted it(kinda).

The story itself feels pretty standard, with the expected tropes, yet still unique. The zombies are well done and realistically creepy, but something about this series disappoints and it was hard to put a finger on why while watching. Now that I\\'ve finished I think I understand what stopped me from loving this drama, the convoluted back story, and too many main characters that I didn\\'t like or care about. It\\'s hard to get invested in a zombie story if you don\\'t care if they get eaten or not. Don\\'t get me wrong, I loved the concept behind how the zombies were created, but that part didn\\'t get enough focus, and I loved the school setting, but too many moments in this show seemed to drag out with too many characters that fell flat or were too stereotypical. The main one being Park Ji Hoo as Nam On Jo. Yes, she was a realistic teen, but her salty attitude throughout was more annoying than empathetic. Seeing zombies chase students gets super repetitive when you don\\'t care enough about the people being chased.\\n\\nNam On Jo is just one of the main group of students we follow through this fast escalating zombie crisis. There\\'s Lomon as Soo Hyeok the strong and crushworthy, Jo Yi Hyun as antisocial class President Nam Ra, and Yoon Chan Young as Chung San, my favorite character, the classic sympathetic hero. The rest of the classmates are a mix of bullies, clowns, snobs, BFFs, and assorted personalities you\\'re likely to find in your average basic teen drama, but because things escalate so quickly some characters felt too generic to make me sympathize enough. In the middle of the chaos, we are faced with who likes who and who resents who, cliques, classism, bullying, bonding, selfishness, and insane revenge but because I didn\\'t care enough about most of their relationships or feelings, I was left waiting for the next \"event\" to happen to them. I will admit that there was always an epic event on the horizon, often a pretty shocking one that kept me wanting to watch the next episode, but the time in between those events got pretty boring. Maybe I was looking for more chemistry between characters, or a stronger origin story since visually the show does an amazing job. Nothing about the acting is bad, it\\'s just not as emotionally exciting as it was visually exciting. The story itself is definitely heavy on emotional \"moments\" but they left me dry-eyed when they normally wouldn\\'t so I must partially blame the cast. Unforgettable scenes filled with mostly forgettable characters are the result. There is an extremely memorable extreme bully (with a mullet) but the rest of the cast is pretty generic. Lee Yoo Mi as Na Yeon is one of the few characters with a clear story arc, likable or not. Don\\'t even get me started on the baby, or the little girl... too many wasted and unexplored storylines to count.\\n\\nWould I watch this again, Oddly yes. I think knowing the story and characters better may make earlier scenes better too. It\\'s a shorter series, 12 episodes, which is also a decent binge length. I also probably missed some important key things in some episodes while distracted by the shock of the zombies. This seems like the kind of drama that may make more sense with a second viewing. I would definitely be tempted to skip many scenes, especially the bio teacher\\'s video diaries, but I know there are probably details I missed while bored. I was also satisfied with the ending, although a little disappointed that the zombie mess had no clear resolution and felt rushed to an end.\\n\\nIf you are a zombie fan, then this is worth watching. At least for some good and terrible zombie survival strategies. If you hate gore and violence but love a good drama, you honestly may want to skip this one. This drama is gory and dark and explores survival instincts, trust, loyalty, and is pretty high on lost faith in humanity points, but without a major throughline besides basic survival, the story is the weakest part of this drama. It is suspenseful, but the suspense is based on who will survive and who won\\'t. There\\'s really great \\'WTH did I just watch\\' end of episode suspense to keep viewers hooked, but the zombie lore was pretty messy with plot holes I would have noticed more if I cared more. Some of the social commentary is pretty heavy-handed and doesn\\'t go deep enough to feel relevant, which I think is this drama\\'s overall issue. The Drama \"Happiness\" did a better job of telling a zombie survival genre and social commentary story without being too preachy... shout out for Bae Hae Sun for having to go through Zombies again! lol! Although this time her character seemed more like a glorified cameo.\\n\\nOverall, \"All of Us are Dead\" is another Zombie drama for our times. Since this pandemic has many people questioning how we deal with a sudden crisis, and Zombie movies are a great way to explore Human Nature and Instincts, the timing of this series is perfect. What I didn\\'t expect was a story filled with high adrenaline-inducing zombies to feel so tedious and I certainly didn\\'t expect to have so many \\'rooting for the zombies to eat someone\\' moments. Arguing, running, fighting, arguing, more running, and more fighting... the fight and zombie choreography is pretty epic, but I wish this drama\\'s emotional moments matched the action. I can definitely see this being left somewhat open-ended for the possibility of a season 2, which I would watch, but not with super high expectations. Not quite overrated, but not as good as it could have been. I just know if zombies come I\\'m avoiding all teens. lol!\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n6.0\\nActing/Cast\\n7.5\\nMusic\\n8.5\\nRewatch Value\\n6.0\\nThis review may contain spoilers\\nThis got 8.5 and Hell bound got 7.4 ratings !!!!!\\nwhat the fuck is wrong with drama show viewers a show like this with the most annoying characters and nothing makes sense got\\n8.5 Ratings while a show Hellbound got 7.4 which had a very good story and great characters the scores should have been flipped.

I can't remember the last time I've seen something with so little logic and so many characters who are overly emotional but at the same time selfish, dumb and inconsistent with their actions.\\nI also don't know why they wasted the characters who were actually interesting and played by good actors (unlike the main characters). I could literally think of a thousand better ways to develop or even kill these characters. I really don't understand this to the point that I'm wondering if someone actually watched this drama before putting it up on Netflix.\\nRead More\", 'Overall\\n6.5\\nStory\\n6.5\\nActing/Cast\\n8.0\\nMusic\\n8.5\\nRewatch Value\\n3.0\\nI finished Ep 4 BUT STILL NO PROGRESS\\nIm giving this a chance to watch bec its my time to watch a Zombie epidemic themed ASIAN DRAMA so i still dont get why this drama is so OVERHYPED just like squid game yeah i get the Zombie themes are getting trendy and mainstream but this drama is VERY VERY SLOW AND DRAGGY from ep 1-4 i was expecting many actions scenes but nahhh they are just there waiting for nothing inside a classroom what the zombie outbreak spread everywhere its like the scenes of zombies have more airtime than the main characters lmao and this drama is trying hard to be train to busan 2.0 never watched the movie but the drama is WORSE and DISSAPOINTING the onlike is the CGI and the sound effects to make it more eerie suspense and scary af lol but as the story progress nothing special os happening and the way they put a slight romance is not helping me its cringey af ngl oh well i wait for few more episodes for my final verdict as of now is still a mid for me i hope the plot gets better from ep 5 and onwards tskkk...

Its amazing that it has an emotional rollercoaster. It can get you angry, sad, laughing, being curious, hatred towards a character, the intense feeling and all possible emotions you could think of - its like you are one of the students who is surviving and going through all this stuff.\\n\\nThe casts are amazing - the acting level is beyond. Music gets your tenses worked up or leaves you crying the hell out of you.\\n\\nLast but not least, THE CAMERA SHOTS!!! The camera shots are amazingly well-done. Why? Yes, it keeps you worked up but what is amazing is that - they provide the first person\\'s point of view. Like I said before, it makes you feel like you\\'re one of the characters but it also makes you think that \"this is actually what it looks and feels like if the apocalypse did occur\". And someone like me would add \"I can guarantee that I will be the first to die if that happens\".\\n\\nGo check out the webtoon too if you haven\\'t already!\\n\\nAnyways I will end here but my last review note is to say \"Don\\'t do prank calls\"...\\nRead More', \"Overall\\n4.0\\nStory\\n5.0\\nActing/Cast\\n3.0\\nMusic\\n7.0\\nRewatch Value\\n1.0\\nDisappointed To Say The Least\\nSo I've been wanting to watch this from the day they announced it was being made. With that being said I am so sad that it didn't live up to the hype. As someone who is VERY easy to please I just about never dislike a movie or show especially a zombie one at that.\\n\\nThere are 3 things that ruined this drama for me: 1.) The main ML and Fl characters 2.) The FL actress's acting 3.) the storyline felt predictable and at moments too slow/boring and details added that were not needed.\\n\\nThe side characters are more intriguing and better at acting which makes it painful for me to constantly watch the ML and FL. Plus I HATE the whole childhood friend love plot they included. If they changed the lead actors and didn't include unnecessary scenes I probably would have loved this drama.\\nRead More\"]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["all_of_us_df =
