0,Hospital Playlist,""" Hospital Playlist "" is one of the hyped dramas of 2020 and you are going to like it if you loved dramas like Reply 1988. However, even though there are not many reviews that are not praising this drama, Hospital Playlist is not for everyone.The drama keeps a slow tempo, with the story being spread throughout the drama, probably so it can serve the next two seasons coming up next. Maybe that's when the drama picks up. And yes, this is a slice of life, but, at times, it felt like there was nothing to look forward to in the next episode. Also, there were moments when the drama got boring too.That said, they did handle the romance masterfully, as to not overshadow the friendship and so that it didn't become the main focus of the drama. They did a good job with the blend of music and story too, as well as with the flashbacks of their old days.Finally, when it comes to performances, the drama of course had excellent ones, as the cast was consisted by the best of the best.So, overall, six and a half out of ten, because there were some nice moments to the drama, but it felt like there was no story to it."
1,Hospital Playlist,"Brilliant and beautiful; sweet and wonderful. Strongly recommended, and cannot wait for the next seasons with this fabulous cast, director, and writer. What a treat."
2,Hospital Playlist,"IMDB has incorrectly combined two seasons into 24 eps when they are very different seasons. Season was is excellent, and I gave a 10. Season two is often silly and tedious and forced me to lower the score since IMDB combined them."
3,Hospital Playlist,"At the time of writing this review the U.K. is hopefully coming out of the total coved 19 lockdown, in which for the last 3 months once a week we have applauded our essential workers like doctors and nurses. This series although a romanticised version of events in a hospital reminds us of the life and death situations health professionals are met with daily. The show is well acted and the stars really sound like actual doctors with their varying bedside manners. Season one has a few romances blossoming with others about to bloom or die. The main protagonists are all musically adept and meet up once a week to jam which leaves each episode with a catchy song at the end. Would recommend watching for a feel good factor and if I could I would give it 8.5"
4,Hospital Playlist,"There have been a number of ""hospital shows"" over the years. And yet, with so many, Hospital Playlist is unique. Why? Because it sticks with its strengths: chemistry between the five leads and staying away from the typical hospital politics.Instead, Hospital Playlist is about people. It's about how we, as people, can endeavor to treat others just a little bit better; to put ourselves in the other person's shoes rather than resort to snap judgments. If you remember Patch Adams, you'll find that--for these five doctors at Yuji Medical Center--the people matter more than the disease or injury. In other words, it no longer pays to be indifferent and to block out natural emotions.Hospital Playlist is actually a fairly light show. Yes, it has some tense moments, but overall, it never gets bogged down in melodrama. Instead, it relies upon the unique chemistry of the five doctors who've known each other since medical school. And once a month, they get together and sing a song. Hence, the Hospital Playlist.Each doctor specializes in a certain field. First we have Ik-Jun, who is a general surgeon but specializes in the liver and liver transplants. He's the lead singer of the group, and in many ways, he's the glue of the group. He's the first to crack a joke or do something humorous to lighten the tension. And Jung-Suk Jo is masterful at this! He's got as much talent for comedy as he does for singing. He never takes things too seriously. His job is important, but treating his staff and his patients with respect is always of utmost importance to him.Next we have. Song Hwa who is a neurosurgeon. She's kind, dedicated, and a bit of a workaholic. HIlariously enough, she's someone who THINKS she can sing, but she can't. Actress Jeon Mi Do is actually a professional singer, so to see her purposely sing out of tune is impressive.Seok Hung is the somewhat aloof but dedicated gynecologist in obstetrics. He's every bit as caring about his patients and staff even though it's not always obvious.Jun Wan is the brilliant cardiologist who can appear cold but to characterize him this way would be a disservice. Underneath the tough exterior is a man with a heart who believes that hard work and dedication is a key to success.Last, but certainly not least, we have Jeon Wong Ahn, the professor of pediatrics. Nurses and parents alike adore him for his unique way of handling children. He relates with them. He talks with them, and he never sees them as just another patient.There are many touching and heartfelt moments throughout the series as we journey along with them through the days, weeks, months, and even years. Don't be surprised if you find yourself shedding a few tears one moment and then roaring out loud with laughter in the next. That's the Hospital Playlist. In the end, it provides comfort. It provides hope that people can still treat each other with respect, with compassion, and with empathy.If you're a music lover, you'll find a cache of great songs, all sung and performed by the characters. At the end of each episode of Hospital Playlist, we are reminded not to take life so seriously. We're reminded that life is supposed to be joyous and fun.At some point, I will definitely want to re-watch this great series. So, if you're looking for something that is light, with many feel-good moments, as well as many hilarious ones, I'm sure you love Hospital Playlist!"
5,Hospital Playlist,"The most I can give is 8/10 but the reality is only 7.5/10. The very early episodes have no band play singing wasting time, later episodes became too much. Their music instrument skills are so fake and lousy except the lead male is still average. In Season 2, some episodes showed their lousy and fake music skills again.It is all about hospital doctors' lives, mostly only revealing the good ones and little about the real-life bad ones. Actually, this is not really reality but only showed the 2-4% type of doctors' lives. Overall, they dare not reveal the truth of doctors' lives and no doctors will willing to do so.Season 1 end of episodes did not have any conclusion ending at all so It is kind of bad directorship and production. The rest time between Season 1 and 2 is very apart. However the ending is in Season 2 so why they named it Season 2 and not still in Season 1? Why the time frame apart?Overall this drama is not exciting and not really like those Medical dramas. This is like more suitable and the likes of adult ladies dramas which is smooth, draggy, home-like,....
I think the high ratings are due to these grandma and house-wives likings."
6,Hospital Playlist,"Grey's Anatomy, Take Your Scalpel & Go Home, Now. K-Band-Aid is In The HOWSE-pitalI put off watching this highly rated show for a while because I found the name unappealing. Well, what's in a name?This series follows 5 friends from college that eventually end up working at the same hospital in Seoul. Now that they are all back in Seoul, they resurrect their college band by working on 1 song a month, to ensure they take time to be together. Whether the above pre-screening sounds like a solid basis for a hospital drama or not, it's merely the setting. What matters is the relationships, particularly as embodied in the writer/director/actors. In any case, HP has stitched together an outstanding fellowship of talent.Believe the hype: Watch it. HP is 🎧AWE🎤SOME🎉.HP is about friendship first, but also caring+respect for others, love, parents & children, music, and lots and lots of #food. The hospital scenes, including staff dynamics and operating room procedures, feel realistic. The characters are a delight.Here's a shout-out to Jo Jung-Suk. He delivers another slam dunk with his performance as Dr. Lee Ik-jun. Every one does a great job.This just pertains to season 1. I haven't started season 2 yet.(((((((()))))))))With season 2 now watched, the diagnosis is that their practice in season 1 rendered season 2 even #more affective. It continues with the uplifting treatment of the subjects, and it's a resounding hit. Picking up right where it left off, there's a seamless connection to season 1.Early in season 2 there's a Ping-Pong tourney. Cardio-Thoracic Sx was looking good - until they had to concede in order to respond to an emergency. At least half of the matches seemed to be decided that way. Instead of mic drops, we see paddle drops. We get to hear other docs gossip about the great Lee Ik-jun: 'I heard Dr Lee was in the Ping-Pong Club in college. In fact, I heard he was in EVERY club in college. He was even in the magic club.' Comfortably confident, Ik-jun tells Song-hwa: ""I'll return victorious before this tea gets cold."" (Nope. Nuclear Medicine runs the tables). His defeat is commemorated with these words: ""Tasting Defeat and savoring victory: These are the things that allow us to grow.""Let's take a moment to review the primary protagonists.In season 2, Lee Ik-jun continues to play Dr Cupid. While Ju-wan (the cardiologist) is worried about Ik-jun discovering whom he's dating. We must wonder: Why worry? How could Ik-jun deny anybody love? Watch to see. He has time to play cupid, and also cover for the lunch lady because he's so brilliant that everything is easy for him. Besides, he's friends with the lunch lady on social media, and her son had a parole hearing. The only thing that takes Ik-jun more time than other docs, is walking thru the hospital. That's because the highly loquacious Ik-jun is friends with everybody - security guards, aids, custodians, scattered guardians ... Just everybody.Ah, the unparalleled and misnamed SONG-hwa. She can do everything: neurosurgery, research, office visits, lectures,,, one of her biggest timetakers is her mentoring of any and all residents in their educational, professional, and even personal lives. She can do everything but sing. She sings anyway, with masses of verve. She gets pleasure out of little things, like rain. She dances at church and eats like a Sumo wrestler. Utterly delightful, she's the heartbeat of the gang, excepting the band.Seok-hyung lost a little weight and he looks great in season 2. He declined to take over his father's business and continues to rise to near celebrity populatiy as an Ob/Gyn, despite his modest and somewhat shy persona. Patients respond to his gentle and caring manner. One office visit depicts amazing ultrasound footage of a 10 week old fetus wiggling its arms and legs. The couple's reaction is precious. Still focused on Seok-hyung, his mother remains unable to resist attempts to try to control him. She wants grandchildren. Now. She tells him: I don't care who it is. Just get married.Dr. Chu continues to try and insert herself into Seok-hyung's life. In season 2 he's neither encouraging nor rejecting her efforts. Dr. Chu is not easily daunted. In fact, she's downright inspirational. Openly perusing Seok-hyung, she often makes him laugh. Dr. Chu runs into Seok-hyung's mother - literally. Mom was so offended that she even told Rosa she doesn't care whom Seok-hyung marries, as long as it isn't #HER!, speaking of Dr. Chu.Ju-wan is unchanged in season 2, and his relationship with Dr. Do, whom he is training, continues to improve. We get to meet Dr. Do's wife in season 2.The pediatrician, Dr. Ahn (Andrea/Jeong-won) treads the course set in season 1. There's not a lot to say w/o spoiling some surprises. He complains that his siblings are worried about mom, but as they can't help ""right now"", they bombard him with calls. In rich irony he laments: ""Why did they enter the church, really?""We see the return of almost all the side characters: Parents, siblings, other doctors, residents, as well as new first years. They all continue to round out the show well.Uju wants to go camping, so Ik-jun finally leaves his beloved city life for a weekend, because his son is his world. Hmmm. Who else loves camping?Gy-eol is looking relaxed and even pretty, especially with her hair down. We learn more about her in season 2.As a side note, there's a realistic basis for the show. The positive connection between surgeons and music has actually been studied. The participants currently playing a musical instrument, at the time of the study, performed the laparoscopic tasks significantly faster than those who did not. They determined that visuo-spatial abilities used in laparoscopic performance clearly may be enhanced for individuals playing a musical instrument. It seems obvious that finger strength and dexterity should also be positively affected.Even though HP is a top-ten show
in all of Korea's history, there are currently no plans for a season 3. The writer has completed the originally scripted storyline. That is the current status, but there's actually numerous ways to continue the drama. For now, it's a wrap. If you are one that dreads waiting for another season as it it's a multistage invasive treatment plan, it's safe to go forward with the HP procedure now, and hope for a reoccurance in the future.IMHO...
🎬9 🤔8 🎭9 ⚡4 💓8 🦋5 🎵 9 🎨6🔚9.Suggested Age 12& up, with a caveat: One unmarried couple is shown in bed together with enough skin showing to infer what's unmistakably been going on. Any parents who object to that, be advised. The counter-balance is the realistic medical setting, along with reinforcement of good character."
7,Hospital Playlist,"I loved all the characters so much I finished this drama in about 2 days lmaoo. The storyline itself isn't too heavy, but at the same time covers so many different emotions. I'm so excited how season 2 will turn out!"
8,Hospital Playlist,"I hate medical shows that focus too much on showing gore in surgeries; you see a bit but nothing terrible or too much in this. It's a show that focuses on friendship at work and its absurdities, and has a fairly good soundtrack as well. It's worth a watch!The only thing that really bugs me, and it's a personal bug, is U-Ju's totally coconut haircut. I get helmet hair is a thing, but why do that really harsh cut for a little kid? ^sigh^"
9,Hospital Playlist,"As a medical student myself truly enjoyed this drama!
The cast did a really great job specially memorizing all the medical terminology haha that's not an easy job !Love the songs.. love everything !!"
10,Hospital Playlist,"What a wonderful drama this was. It was a whole journey, watching this drama from Season 1 to 2. Staying with these characters who felt like my own friends. I was happy when they were happy and sad when they were sad. Not that they showed it. These characters were so strong, impactful, and genuinely good people.The drama felt great overall. Especially the Season 1, which I think was close to perfect. The two stars were removed for Season 2.The stories are light but makes you look at the doctors in a more humane ways. They too have lives. While most are paid well, the effort and sacrifices they make for patients are usually gone unnoticed in daily lives. Here in this drama it focuses on especially that. So, instead of diagnosing the sickness and giving treatment, the drama focus on what happens before and after that. How the journey of a medical student is when he become an intern, to a resident to a professor.How doctors react when they lose patients, how they react when they can save lives, how to break news to patients family, how to balance work and life... its all heart warming and real.The season 2 was a bit draggy and focused unnecessarily on a single couple that got together in season 1. They hardly had any story and any screen time with them together was very boring and felt like fan service.Because of them the other stories that could have been more interesting were pushed into latter episodes and were done hurriedly. So, the finale was very lackluster.That is my only complain for the drama. However, season 1 was perfect!So, I will always recommend watching this!"
11,Hospital Playlist,"Its complicqated. I I were to take some aspects of thge series, I'h have t0o go to a 5. But as I am not a Korean, I will stick with my 8. So many things werong, but most or the best humor in decades that just had me screaming. There was a lot of the, deep intelligent humpour you nevber see in British humour. Hardly ever in American/Canadian. But they made me scream sometiumes- So thank you. Don't tale yourself to seriously and just let it rip. Don't just do dumb unbintelligent people doing unintelligent think. Be real intelligent intriguingly funny. Hard to see these days hehehe.Struggling a bit with the Korean English translation. I'm sure that could have been better.And finally. The Korean hysteric, screaming, panic, crying... please. It just makes Koreans seen dumb, unintelligent. But hats off. They do it well. I just couldn't stand it. I hate people making anb ass of them self. You are not North Koreans are you?"
12,Hospital Playlist,"I think it's 7.5 for the first season, and 9 for the second one! I wish they would tell more about each main character, but since this is about hospital life so no wonder they also try to explore different story for the supporting characters including the patients. As a ""non-medical"" person, it's a bit confusing to understand all the jargons. I binged watching the first season, and surprisingly I found it a bit boring because of the slow pace and too many medical jargons which I wasn't interested at all. But in the second season, I think I've fallen in love with the main characters. I love the friendship between all the characters, and the way how they support and be there for each other. Well, to me, the most interesting part is about the background and life lesson behind each story, it's just very very heartwarming. The romance between the characters is just enough but not too much. And for the last part, I love the soundtrack from the first season more. Oh I just love it!"
13,Hospital Playlist,"This is one of the few TV shows I can wholeheartedly give a 10 rating. I love this series, watched twice the first season and going on the second season.The friendship depicted in this series is so heartwarming, not just for the 5 main casts but also their interaction and kindness towards their interns, fellows & nurses. Even the long lasting friendship between Rosa and the Director of the medical centre is just so warm - a friendship spans for 65 years and still going strong!The characters' development is another success, we grew to love all the cast (even the supporting roles) bits by bits through their actions, interaction with each other/other characters. Each episode provides us a good life lessons focusing on human behavior and emotions, the happiness when love one is healed, sadness when love one passed and the pain in between waiting for miracles to happen. It really pulled my heartstring. It motivated me to become a better person, be kind and more attentive to my family, friends and be more compassionate/empathy to strangers who are in need.I love all the actors and actresses; they all give very good performance. The child actor is so cute and the music is simply superb. One lovely thing about this series is the romance is not cheesy, because we all know Korean shows tend to get OTT cheesy when it comes to romance, and we do not have any super ""bad"" people, we see people of different characters/behavior, all with their own flaws but aren't we all have flaws?Overall, I highly recommend this series to anyone."
14,Hospital Playlist,"Friendship. Love. Life. Death. Music.Not your usual medical drama. I laughed, cried, sang, and danced. Superb screenplay! Fell in love in Ik-Jun (Jo Jung Suk) Felt like I was cheating on Hyun Bin.😂My Thursdays won't be the same anymore. I truly loved this drama. Cheers to all the cast and crew. See you next year for Season 2.It's 10/10 for me. Highly recommended. 💖#HospitalPlaylist"
15,Hospital Playlist,"A few of the reviewers seem to be turned off by the fact that there is no ""central "" storyline but i would argue that there is no central dramatic storyline is the very thing that appeals to me about the show. It is a story about an enduring friendship and the everyday lives of those in a hospital told with humor and compassion. There is beauty and love and tears and laughter and triumphs and failures to be found in all of our daily lives. What is wrong with trying to capture that in a drama? I really enjoy the ensemble acting and the mini-stories in each episode. I hope to be treated with as much compassion as these doctors show if I ever find myself in a hospital needing surgery."
16,Hospital Playlist,"The characters on this show are easy to like and the story keeps moving along. Action, murder mystery and zombie shows can be entertaining and this show is great for when a bit lighter.fare is desired. If you like buddy shows and hospital shows this might be for you."
17,Hospital Playlist,"THE SERIES IS SIMPLY WARMING MY SOUL, THE MEANING OF FRIENDSHIP IS BEAUTIFULLY PORTRAYED. JUST NOT READY TO SAY GOODBYE YET. ONE WORD, MASTERPIECE."
18,Hospital Playlist,"Like Reply 1988, Hospital Playlist is also too tiring to watch. It has many episodes and spends over an hour of our time on each episode. But this is good if we make it as weekly series than daily series especially for binge-watch. I think the effort of this series is so big. Even before it's produced, the scriptwriter needs much time for research."
19,Hospital Playlist,"The drama is well thought and elaborated. It takes time to watch, but you'll have the chance to watch so many people's life and their attitudesn. So enjoyable and so inspiring. And it's even beyond this because through the process you'll be able to revisit many issues like dilemma between friendship and romance, ideals versus actual daily challenges. If you are still not so sure about many things, this is the opportunity to think about it. For those who dig in tiny details of character building, settings, meanings whatever, the drama is especially for you."
20,Hospital Playlist,"It took me a couple of episodes to get into this series but well worth staying the course. Hospital shows are always hard to follow when they go into the different ailments and procedures, but always turns out to be educational. This has you with tears in your eyes one moment and laughing the next. Excellent cast. Also enjoying the musical number in each episode, very talented musicians as well."
21,Hospital Playlist,"I saw the Good Doctor and then Doctor Stranger ad a series of hospital shows. To me Dr Stranger and then the Good Doctor had a lot to give..playlist is a slow, rambling of life in a hospital and more the human element."
22,Hospital Playlist,I didn't expect to be so attached to this kdrama. It made me feel all kinds of genuine emotions. I love how all the characters have their stories. Looking forward to the next episode!
23,Hospital Playlist,"I love how this series doesn't exactly have like a 'main conflict'. the storyline revolves around the everyday life of the main cast and i love how it just flows. it is also heartwarming and funny. the chemistry between the main cast is also amazing. i think this series is for those who are looking for light and fun dramas, without too many cliches or conflicts."
24,Hospital Playlist,"This is a very classy Korean drama. That much is evident in the cast and the writing. It's a skillful weave combining the mundane in a medic's life with the challenges. We see strong, invincible characters save a life but then something else in their narrative has them dying on the inside.None of the characters are successfully married. Either their relationships didn't work out, never matured, or were never realised but the details of such are incidental to the storyline rather the principal angst. This adds to the perception, perhaps, that not much occurs and yet each episode has a distinct dilemma. The doctor who yearns to be a priest, the romeo who may have found a true love too late, the doting single father who knows the unattainable one that would make his family complete.Personally, as a middle-aged London viewer I don't care for the 'Patridge Family' musical element which is pretty cheesy and surprising given that the drama works hard NOT to be cheesy, but I appreciate this is maybe something to tide over the k-pop teen viewers.Overall, I'd give an 8 but at times for writing and performances it really does hit a ten."
25,Hospital Playlist,"Hospital playlist has moved to my top 5 medical series. Love the enduring friendship of the 5 main doctors. Like the main cast, each one perfect for their roles. Like the band and their music choices. Like the main supporting cast, and the patients and families living healthy issues, pregnancies, and traumas feel true to life. Really enjoyed every episode! All I can say is Season 3...Season 3...Season 3!!"
26,Hospital Playlist,"Life's definition is very different for every one. In this drama we get to meet 5 characters who have been friends since medical school. Unlike the other medical drama which usually go for dramatic, suspenseful and depressing tone, this drama went for a light, musical feel. It's a success. This show hits all the right notes with its ensemble cast of musical actors, best direction and great script. So what if the series has no specific theme to it? How will it be different from other kdramas then? The series derives its distinct identity in this only.. It tells several mini stories through the eyes of these 5 characters. Loved their musical jamming. I felt envious that I never got to make such a gang of friends. Can't wait to see season 2. Shin won ho has done it again. Exceeded all expectations.. After all he has given us the Reply series, and Prison Playbook. Aloha... 😘😍"
27,Hospital Playlist,"I must admit this drama has everything!
It is not any typical ""hospital Kdrama"", this drama is surely different. There are many scenes where I could feel the scenes! For example, the doctor-patient relationship, the father-son relationship! These things happen in reality, not like other 'hospital stories' we get to see in hospital story based dramas! And those real emotions literally touched my heart!!!
Hats off to the all of the actors! Moreover, the songs, refreshing scenes.. Honestly, I cannot finish saying all of the sides for which everyone must watch this drama.
I just want to say: ""I am genuinely glad that this drama has been made & I feel happy for the fact that I did not ignore the drama rather I have watched this beautiful unique drama!""
Whoever is watching my review, please do watch this drama. I can bet you will tell yourself, your time was worth of watching this drama!!"
28,Hospital Playlist,"Another masterpiece by director of Reply 1988. It will take a couple of episodes to get full grasp of this wonderful series. Life-saving doctors, attractive residents, budding romance, old romance, FOOD. It has all in it."
29,Hospital Playlist,"Hospital Playlist has been written by the same writer who wrote ""Reply 1988"", Lee Woo-jung. The producer is also the same, Shin Won-ho. The work that this combination creates is absolutely fantastic. Hospital Playlist shares a lot of the same vibe of ""Reply 1988"".Hospital Playlist does not have a central storyline. Instead, we see the storylines of the 5 main characters, who are all medical doctors in the same hospital, friends, and also musical band mates. There are plenty of smaller subplots that stretch out over multiple episodes, be sure not to miss those. And do not miss the easter eggs or cameos that the creators added that refer to ""Reply 1988"". This TV drama requires some attention span in the beginning, but once you are suck in their worlds, you will share their heartwarming joy and heartbreaking tears.Like Reply 1988, we have a group of 5 friends: 4 guys, 1 girl. We get a look in their lives. It is very realistic and funny. All the cast is sublime and excellent. They bring their characters to life in such a wonderful way. Each episode you get a very welcome musical intermezzo near the end when the 5 friends come together to play a song live as a band. The songs they play are older Korean power ballads with strong lyrics that capture perfectly the main feeling of each episode. And there is a running gag of the female neurosurgeon Chae Song-hwa, played wonderfully by Jeon Mi-do, who is tone deaf and does not have a feeling of rhythm, but still wants to be a vocalist. It makes you smile from ear to ear.I absolutely enjoyed Hospital Playlist, season 1. It is such a wonderful TV drama that is heartwarming and heartbreaking. You get to laugh and to cry. Definitely recommended, get started and watch it!"
30,Hospital Playlist,"Typical medical soap drama in form of the Korean culture. Typical heavy sponsors thru out the series with the likes of Mercedes, McDonald's, some egg sandwich brand... And typical state of the art Samsungs.It's a pity though this was filmed during the Covid-19 pandemic that they did not bother to incorporate it to the series - instead it's all sunshine and rainbows where the main cast of the 5 doctors are hailed as gods who can solve any medical provlems throughout the series.Watch if - you're a fan of typical k drama with all the cutsie saranghae and all the bubbly women and handsome men.Don't bother if - you're not a fan typical k drama nor medical drama. Refreshing is definitely not the word to use for this series."
31,Hospital Playlist,This show is so heartwarming that it just makes you feel happy after every episode. I've finished watching season 1 a long time ago but i find myself re-watching some clips at times when i feel down. The OST is great as well!Highly recommended!
32,Hospital Playlist,"Well....after Reply 1988,Prison Playbook....they did it again!!! Another fantastic drama about friendship,love,relations and most importantly, story of lives. Kudos to the writer,director,Actors and the whole team!!!The thing i loved the most about this drama is,they didn't show the doctors as superhuman. Doctors are human too,they have their limitations, they have personal lives,struggles,emotions. They can't cure the patients with magic. They also fail sometimes. Its just reality. This thing is portrayed to well in this drama.Another thing i loved the most,a hospital is not only about doctors and patients. There are so many layers of characters and emotions attached with a hospital. There are fellow doctors, interns,nurses,stuffs,patients family,doctors family..... Everyone has their own story,own struggle. I loved how they at least tried to show some layers of it...and they did it beautifully!Actors did their job really well. I specially wanna appreciate Mi Do aka Song Hwan for playing the role of a tone deaf singer while being a musical actress in real life...a real tough job i must say!!I would really love if there was a season 3...but right now I'm really happy with two seasons...its like a warm hug you really need at this crucial time we are going through."
33,Hospital Playlist,"Another excellent drama from PD Shim and Writer Lee! High quality drama, perfect cast, good acting, and of course the value of humanity. This drama really warm your heart, entertaining with all of the jokes and comedies.
You have to watch this especially if you're a big fan of Reply series and Prison Playbook.
Oh and another one....I love how PD Shim amd Writer Lee always put the riddle and mystery inside the drama, It's just make you so curious and connect to the character and story. Plus the twist! I love the twists.
Can't wait for season 2 next year!! 😆😆"
34,Hospital Playlist,"This is probably one of my favorites. You can't help but get wrapped up in the lives of these characters. It has just about everything in it. I laughed, cried, and enjoyed the singing at the end of each episode."
35,Hospital Playlist,"This drama deserves the attention and love from the viewers. It's full of lessons about friendship, family, humanity, and love. No dramatic twist, no political treachery and no characters to be hated. Simply, it showcased empathy rather than an individual's story. It made you smile, laugh, cries, and surely will miss your friends especially these pandemic situations.For the first episode, you might be confused about the characters and faces because there are so many casts; Doctors, Nurses, Interns, and others. But as the story progresses you can identify them and you'll be impressed how well the story lined up from the hospital to playlist. This drama gives you a warm touch with morals and lessons that are taught throughout the 12 episodes.Bravo to the main cast because they lived their characters impressively. Each portrayal has its own unique factors and differences. I love their music, their band, and bonding. I love this medical drama, and I can't wait for season 2 hopefully by next year."
36,Hospital Playlist,Heartwarming and cute with great dramatic medical weekly stories and on-going storylines to keep you tuning in. I loved the friendships and relationships. So sad it's only 12 episodes but so happy a new season is coming. It's going to be tough to wait so long!
37,Hospital Playlist,"What a fantastic series. A brilliant, very highly talented cast of my favourites. I love the band! I love, love this Drama because every episode make me laugh and Cry😍🎶
Every Soundtrack in this drama give something valuable thing to Community..."
38,Hospital Playlist,"I am only halfway through the second season but I decided to do this review early
Firstly the main characters all eat like pigs They seem total glutons and are unmannered clods
That said they are also the weidest dynamic as a group of people ever encountered . Though not related they appear to be the most incestuous group imaginable. In over fifty years in the work force I have never come across a mob like these.Given that there are some interesting storylines in this series it is a shame you don't know what time slot you are as it continuously weaves back and forth in time
What happened to continuity.It almost seems as though the writer/director got the whole script in a loose leaf pile then threw it out of a moving train."
39,Hospital Playlist,"The first episode was kind of exciting considering how interesting their friendship is. But the way the writers kept the story on slow ""tempo"" just bored me so much. Some scenes are just not that interesting that I sometimes wonder what this movie is really about; the friendship or the medical cases.A doctor once said on his vlog that this show is a bit more accurate than other medical series, I still dont find it so exciting. I mean I dont watch tv shows to learn medical things lol. I guess if that so, then this show isn't for everybody."
40,Hospital Playlist,"What an incredible show. This is probably my 4th Korean tv show I've watched and the acting is so good. The cast is sooo great and I love watching their interaction with each other, family and other people. Can't say enough about this show. And Uju is sooo cute and funny. Powerful stories and life lessons."
41,Hospital Playlist,"What a heartwarming tv drama! All five main characters are wonderful and what makes them even better is their friendship and how much they love each other.The hospital stories they show are both wonderful and heartbreaking. Extremely realistic.If you're thinking of starting this, do it without even blinking.I look forward to the new season!!"
42,Hospital Playlist,"Great medical drama, with well relatable characters, good focus on the medical challenges, draws you in with relationship drama and just the right flavour of comic relief. It gets better as the season goes on. Watching episode 10 and thrilled."
43,Hospital Playlist,"I enjoyed the drama. Not getting bored
Its like a real activity as a doctor no fiction line."
44,Hospital Playlist,"There is no drama like this. A beautiful, positive and humane drama.This is a story of 5 doctor friends, who respect the limitations and privacy of each other. A good amalgamation of their professional and private lives.You have not captured a friendship like this before.You have not seen a bonding like this before.You have not felt goodness like this before.You have not seen sacrifice like this before.You have not heard music like this before.A beautiful well crafted screenplay, best casting, especially Jeon Mi do, who is beautiful, talented, charismatic, and egoistic. Jo Jung suk is superb, full of witt and the main singer. Jung kyon is introvert yet passionate. Kim Deon is lonely, loving and a pioniist. Yoo Yeon is polite, caring and a drummer. The other female leads fight for their love, no give ups.Above all, U ju - what a kid. He has his own love story.A must see drama- needs a third
season."
45,Hospital Playlist,"The most easy to view because of the wonderful chemistry seen between the characters. It makes me love each one! And look up for other shows of each actor.
I love the show. I'm waiting with enthusiasm another season. It was a long time before I see every episode twice. Please, start season 2 soon!
Thanks for that drama show."
46,Hospital Playlist,"Hospital Playlist was a very well-written drama with a refreshing storyline. The drama didn't not only center on the medical knowledge and practices but it also shown daily life of the medical officers on the other side of their profession. It's full of heartwarming and lighthearted scenes that touched to the very core of your heart. How they found loves, their inner struggles and dilemma were delicately shown throughout the drama. It might be slow pace to some of us but it's definitely worth to watch."
47,Hospital Playlist,"Only revolves around hospital, patients and eating food. Totally waste of time. Please reconsider before watching. Over 90% of scenes are of hospital and surgery surgery surgery. Story is good but same plot each episode with little bit of difference which creates curiosity to watch next one."
48,Hospital Playlist,"I have watched more than a hundred K-Drama. And this is one of the best kdrama ever! Super duper love it!! <3if you expect a conflict in a drama, you would'nt really like this drama. I love Hospital Playlist cause it's a light, lovely, and all heart warming drama you ever wished for. No bad character involved, so you have no other choice than think positive for every character that appears.PS: I love all kdrama that is written by Lee Woo-Jung and directed by Shin Won-Ho, like Reply series and Hospital Playlist!!"
49,Hospital Playlist,"If ur looking for drama and plot twists, its totally not for you. The movie weave simple narratives about daily life into each ep. Felling like all characters are main, they got their own signature that set a special impression. The academic content makes it so real and professional. I had to replay some scenes cuz its super cute, funny, lovely, etc. Truly love it. Production team please do till ss 10 and more."
50,Hospital Playlist,One of the best dramas I've ever seen. It is so heartwarming. I love it so much.
51,Hospital Playlist,This is the best drama I've ever watched and will be my most favorite drama. The plot itself is amazingly and the chemistry of the casts make it more special. This is a drama which can make your heart warm. Best of the bests ever.
52,Hospital Playlist,Watch it. korea TV shows has better understanding of the real life then the hollywood does.
53,Hospital Playlist,"It is not your typical kdrama. Its very realistic and straight to the point. It is kinda slow pacing at the start but starting at ep3, i guess, it starts to build up and become exciting. Many doctors also comment that this drama is closer to accuracy with real medical than other med dramas.The music is also perfect especially they themselves played it. They learned to play instruments prior to shooting."
54,Hospital Playlist,"I'm giving this 2/10 as the cast is good but that's pretty much it. I've watched 4 episodes only but that's because that's all netflix has released at this stage. I tried watching and thinking it'll get better in the next episode. Never did. Nothing happens. Like another reviewer said, ""there isn't a main story line"" or something like that and they are right. The medical story lines have been recycled a million times over. If you've watched any hospital drama in the past you've seen this one. The only difference is is that there isn't actually a point to their stories. If you want to see 5 friends hang out, play music, and talk about nothing and the storyline not have any drive or hook then go ahead and watch this. There might be mini stories within the episode but nothing gripping. I honestly can say it's just about 5 friends who all happen to be great doctors in their chosen fields and who all happen to work in the same hospital and that's about it."
55,Hospital Playlist,"When we see Yoo Yeon-Seok in this series, one would think of Dr. Romantic. But the similarity stops there. Anyone who's expecting an exaggerated, overly-dramatic plot like Dr. Romantic will be disappointed watching this. Yet, I love this drama - simply for its ability to weave simple narratives into beautiful episodes every week.It goes against any stereotype of love, hospital melodrama, and friendships - and gives you a strong vision of what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like in any aspect. As there are 5 main characters instead of 1, it really is trying to tell us 'we are not the center of attention' - everyone is their own main character. The dramatic events may happen in another room, but the characters themselves are enriching enough that they can hold their own story.It also reflects very healthy and strong friendships. Not every gal and guy that come together must have a romance - platonic friendships can develop and last. Not everything must have an underlying meaning.Finally, I like that there is no 'THE' bad guy. That's the thing about this drama - there are no stereotypes, no bad vs good. It's about living out our lives to the fullest, and enjoying the community around us.Sounds lame? Well, that might say more of ourselves than about the show - how we thrive for excitement in dramatic things but miss out on the beauty and humour in everyday life."
56,Hospital Playlist,"This medical drama is so encouraging and heartwarming,to people like us who are already in this field. I love this drama. I learn so many things. For me, this drama is worked as a mentor.I'm still first year medical student who don't know about so much things of this field,this drama help so much to understand the things of medical life.This drama also help me to understand the job of doctor and sacrifices and devotion they made.
By the way I'm waiting for the next season curiously.But at the end I'm happy to see that Ahn Jung-won and Jang Gyeo-wool is finally become lovely couple.
This is my most favourite drama from now on.
Netflix please release next season very soon ."
57,Hospital Playlist,Each episode has its own story with different patients but it doesn't spend enough time to dive into each doctors' personal life. I wanted to see ik Jun's son appear more often and I wanted to see a bit more romance. All of them are really great actors and I finished it because of their chemistry. Hopefully season 2 will have a more distinct plot or at least focus more on ik jun and song hwa
58,Hospital Playlist,"I'm not really a fan of splice-of-life genre because most of the time there's no focus point in the storyline but this drama is different. I'm glad that I didn't stop at the first episode, as the second episodes onwards is loveeelyyy! Plus, everyone gets an appropriate screen time.I love how they show the uncertainty of life, friendships & a little bit of workplace romance.
Truth to be told, I miss my friends so bad after watching the entire series."
59,Hospital Playlist,"To those who enjoy korean medical dramas, I bet you would love hospital playlist. Let's distance ourselves for now from power-struggle between doctors, melodramatic backgrounds of the characters, and love triangle within the squad. I tell you this is Dr. Romantic in the lightest and funniest vibe. Why? How?MASTER KIM EVERYWHERE.
Yes, Master Kim is present here in the faces of Lee Ikjun of GS, Kim Junwan of CS, Chae Songhwa of NS, Ahn Jeongwon of Pedia, and Yang Seok-hyeong of OG. They will remind you that doing your best in your work should always be the top of mind. Lessons, lessons, lessons. Yes, plenty of that here.SOLID SQUAD.
SLOW BURN ROMANCES
HEARTWARMING FAMILY LESSONS
TALENTED CASTING
UNFORGETTABLE SOUNDTRACKI JUST LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH!"
60,Hospital Playlist,"The story of this drama so basic but it makes us feel relax, feel wholesome."
61,Hospital Playlist,Best drama I've ever see!!!! So heartwarming. Always waiting their fighting scenes 🤣🤣🤣
62,Hospital Playlist,I love how the small details play an essential role throughout the series. I can't help but to commend the ost per episode.
63,Hospital Playlist,This drama has it all especially if it's about friendships. These are friendship goals that you want to have with the people around you. Love lines are available as well and it's not typical straight forward you know this will be their ending but you will be kept suspended till even Season 2 currently. You will want to watch this. Don't miss it.
64,Hospital Playlist,"Korea is a beautiful island. Not only kimchi but also barbecue on copper grill pan are famous in Korea. The drama take a photograph of the hospital. They spent much time to built the scenes. There are five characters in the drama. They are best friends and they have band in the free time. Through the doctor's view to understand the doctor how to treat the patient, and daily life."
65,Hospital Playlist,"Hospital playlist is a Korean series it's about 5 doctors they were a
friend in the same university. Maybe it must be a destiny because they
have to be a doctor in the same hospital. And someone in the group of
friends he's hospital, he is owner in this hospital his name Ahn Jeong
Won. And then He want to include the doctor for opening new special
department (VIP treatment room) that why he is invite all his friend to
join this project. It has all specialized medical with these friend as
Cardiac surgeon, Neonatologist, Obstetrician, Neurologist, Gastroenterologist. Everyone wants to join this work but someone want to
create a band music thus they decide to open the band and department
The main story of this series are responsibility of doctor and friend.Group of friends find the time to practice music band in every week.Because they have a condition for music band when they decide to sign
in the contract for opening new department (VIP treatment room)
Lee Ik Joon(Guitar), Ahn Jeong-Won(Drum), Kim Jun-Wan(Guitar
solo), Yang Seok-Hyeong(Electronic keyboard), Chae Song-Hwa(Bass)
You will see the doctor relax from hard and pressure work.It's like a real life that you met many things obstacle but you can find a
way to enjoy and do the thing for your love.I can recognize in the actor expression in every emotion that's really
impressed for me so much. I can't forecast how long I can find excellent
series like this. This series is going to warm your heart and make you
overwhelmed by love.You will see the cute and good things about attitude, perspective, and
knowledge of medical. The interesting that you can't miss it, it is best
relationship with friend. You will miss your moment with your friends in
the past. Every part will show why you love this series."
66,Hospital Playlist,"It's amazing the amount of effort to make this drama come alive, from the medical language to the musical performances. If you pay attention, and listen with an open mind, it's easy to get incapsulated with the story. While there are cultural understandings needed to be had to understand jokes and nuances, still one of the best dramas to come out of S Korea. The actors having to remember the medical terms, the language and phrases, their own jokes and what not, along with playing an instrument equates to an epic performance."
67,Hospital Playlist,Warm drama everr! This drama teach you about life. Can't wait for season 2
68,Hospital Playlist,Worth the watch.. very well written and acted waiting for the season 2..
69,Hospital Playlist,"Highly recommended!!! ❤
This is probably my heart warming medical k-drama I watched. I just could connect with every characters so well. Friendship, Colleagues, Work Environment, Music, Food, Humanity, Doctor's empathy, Relation with parents, Connection with every patient everything was top notch! Every episode just warmed up my heart, made me feel so better. Waiting for the next season, can't wait."
70,Hospital Playlist,"Don't expect a classic dorama focused on a lovestory. It's a perfect combination of great actors, production/edition and a modern story with real and funny characters that aboard difficulties that we can face in our life. My favorite part is their friendship, they are so different, but they get along as a family. And I was happy to watch them showing the work of good doctors that take care of a person and not only a disease."
71,Hospital Playlist,"Great series, great cast and storyline, this just gets you hooked up right from the beginning. Don't miss out on this wonderful series."
72,Hospital Playlist,"At first it might be difficult to understand some parts of the plot, but the thing is you really have to pay a lot of attention to the details! At some moments I got tired mentally because I was analizing what was happening, but definitely it's worth watching.Such a delightful tv show, I laughed and cried so much. The cast is amazing and everybody did a great work."

148,The Light in Your Eyes,"Negatives: Tended to drag on & on (four long DVDs). Confusing at times w/flashbacks. Difficult to follow who's who while also watching subtitling. Then there's going back in time - not possible at all, sorry, future yes. Although a watch as time travel tool is an easily understandable visual it just makes zero sense - but who cares.
Positives: Good acting. Very philosophical about relations & aging. Death is quite real & personable."
149,The Light in Your Eyes,"The light in your eyes is an odd, surprising drama. It is not what is seemed to be. The story started as a comedy, then it turned into a fantasy drama, and, eventually, it all made sense. The dramatic, melodrama element was really good and the family dynamics touching and strong. The comedy element, however, could have been a bit less, as the story was very dark and sometimes it didn't blend well with it. I also enjoyed the slice of life concept. But the highlight of the drama was the performances that were really good by everyone in the cast, though the younger version of the leading lady kind of didn't match with her older version. Finally, the twist in the ending was probably one of the best twists I've ever watched. So, 8 out of 10."
150,The Light in Your Eyes,"I am a fan, so I was looking forward to this K-Drama when I read the description. But the actual series is not as described. That would be okay if the twist worked fully, but for me it does not. The series does have its moments, but I see too many plot holes, including the way a major character (her son) is treated that is reprehensible and never really atoned for except in hindsight. He ended up living the same life as his beautiful dad, and it's too late for him; no snow sweeping can make up for that. It was naive of the writer to suggest it could. For me, if a narrative surprise doesn't fully account for everything the story raises, then it is undercut. On the other hand, I do appreciate the respect for seniors and the gentle depiction of Alzheimer's. And I love the performances of talented Nam Joo Hyuk and the beautiful Kim Hye Ja who gives an acting class in every scene. She is breathtaking."
151,The Light in Your Eyes,"The Light in Your Eyes was an odd show that had some really triumphant and amazing episodes and moments, but it failed in a lot of other episodes - it honestly felt like 3 different shows mashed up into one. As another reviewer accurately pointed out, it was a fantasy, a comedy, and a melodrama. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that these three elements were blended seamlessly, but rather it felt like 3 shows, or even 3 plot arcs that turned out to be rather disconnected. The ending episode where the viewer finally knows what is really going on had the best of the 3 plots, and I feel that this element would have worked well as a movie instead of a show. Once you know the ending, most of the show feels rather pointless. The twist at the end definitely had an impact, but I feel like that was more because the prefacing episodes didn't really make that much sense, rather than because of carefully laid plot points.Overall I thought this was well acted, the soundtrack is enjoyable and beautiful, but ultimately I was left a bit disappointed. I don't think I would recommend this show."
152,The Light in Your Eyes,"I think it is too philosophical a drama for the intended audience and slow in the process but nothing is what it seems in at least the first 10 chapters, it has a plot twist from another world and it is not radiant, it is nostalgic but wonderful."
153,The Light in Your Eyes,"The drama tried to catch emotion but only resulted average performance compared to many good dramas. The characters scene and story of the noodle shop lady with the brother were disasters and total failure nonsenses that wasted viewers precious time and wasted film. What on earth did the writer and the fool director were thinking?The first episode was a good pickup but as you watch further, every episode deteriorated further. Episodes 10/12 and 11/12 were the worse that totally wasted viewers time. They tried to major catch sentiments in the last episode but still only average, nothing big deal. The last episode ahs some minor nonsenses but still able to swallow but episodes 10 and 11 were unable to swallow at all.Overall this drama can be watched if no other dramas to watch because 12 episodes is a fast drama to finish. If this drama was above 20 episodes, I will not watch it."
154,The Light in Your Eyes,"I found this drama surprising and it was worth watching just for the amazing performances that the entire cast delivered. Truly exquisite. I could not score it 10/10 because I think it's not flawless plot wise but it's most certainly worth the 12 plus hours I spent watching it. Some really beautiful moments that will remain with me, and performances I won't forget. Beautiful."
155,The Light in Your Eyes,"The curfews and police brutality were real. The fashions and hairstyles were real. It was almost shocking to see the gender roles so accurately portrayed - not according to today's stereotype but how they were in reality, back then.I think I just marked myself as a bit older than the average KDrama viewer.That puts me in a position to confirm the depicted ageism and snide comments as real and ongoing. The need for elders to be seen as still valuable and wanted. The callousness of grown children who, for decades, nurse their grievances and stubbornly refuse to see their parents as people, not just as their mommies and daddies - all of it, so true.From a technical perspective, this was spot-on. The writing, the acting - OMG! The acting!, the camera angles and cinematography: all excellent.The story: mind blowing. Stunning. Jaw-dropping. A must-see.P. S.: bring lots of tissues."
156,The Light in Your Eyes,"Do not watch this series if you are looking for a typical romance/fantasy kdrama for light entertainment. Coming into the show I knew there would be something unexpected and unconventional but it still took me by surprise.I agree with another reviewer who said the comedy and much heavier and darker portions do not always blend well. Following the plot and time jumps is also not easy, resulting in frequent confusion in the storyline. However, the one constant throughout the entire show is the amazingly lovable character of the old lady and the fantastic performance of the actress Kim Hye-ja. If it were not for her, I probably would have dropped the show in the middle. I hanged on through the disappointments and sadness because I believe there must be light at the end of the tunnel and I desperately wanted to see her happy.Without spoiling anything, the 'big twist' comes towards the last few episodes but not at the very end, so it has plenty of time to properly develop its storyline till the ending. In this sense, after going through all the misfortune of our heroine and her family, and having many questions with the plot line unanswered, everything suddenly came together in a natural and believable way. Not bad for a fantasy drama!I'll conclude by saying it is not easy to rate this show. It is not light entertainment by any means so your level of enjoyment will greatly depend on your ability to appreciate a good story told in a very unconventional way, despite its flaws."
157,The Light in Your Eyes,"One of best TV series I've ever watched... truly an emotional rollercoaster of how life can be surprising. I'm not going give any synopsis of this series and ruin the surprise your truly inn for.If you're a Drama lover, this is the show for you. It takes you through the series of life's ups and downs. It's heartbreaking, you might bleed in tears but it sort of makes you realise many things about your loved ones done for you. And life is so fragile and passing so fast, we don't even realise it.So take it easy, live your everyday to the fullest. Tomorrow can wait, past is gone, live your present completely devoted to happiness and things that matter"
158,The Light in Your Eyes,"I've actually become a huge fan of K-dramas, and have watched maybe 25-30 over the last year or so. So far, this is the only one that I have given below a 8/10 rating. Now, even though many of the stories can vary greatly, they usually share similar basic plot points; however this one is something completely different than usual, or than you're lead to expect. I won't give any spoilers, but I freely admit that overall, this wasn't my cup of tea, I'm sure many will enjoy the different approach and time jumps back & forth, and the plot twists as well. What you will find here is some touching & realistic portrayals of some of the difficulties & hardships around aging, family issues, as well as some abusive situations. The acting throughout is very good, and the chemistry between the two main leads is good, and actually made me want to see them together in a more conventional romantic drama. So, let me conclude with this; if you are drawn to this movie because of an expectation of a romantic film about time travel involving the two leads, you may be disappointed. If you want to see a movie about aging, family relations, regrets, & insights into perceptions of the elderly about how they view their past, present and future, this might be for you."
159,The Light in Your Eyes,"Beautiful, must watch drama!!! Its one of the best that I have watched till date.
Amazing storyline, loved the twist and the actors stayed true to their role.To all the viewers who want to watch this, make sure to not skip anything of this series from ep 1-10. The end of episode 10 will blow your mind. The 11th and 12th episodes shows the life of Hye-ja.--SPOILERS---""It feels like I woke up from a long dream, but I'm not sure if it was the younger me dreaming of when I was old, or the older me dreaming of when I was young""This line at the end of episode 10 blew up my mind and finally all the broken pieces fit perfectly. I thought this might be a typical time travel story and was curious on how a time travel watch would resolve the situation that Hye-Ja was in.
But turns out it's not needed. There was no time travel to begin with. It was a situation entirely made up by old Hye-Ja who is suffering from Alzheimer. This twist made the whole drama very interesting. The finale was heart wrenching were her son was finally able to understand his mother. I could not think any better ending in the finale."
160,The Light in Your Eyes,"If you want typical romantic kdramas or that kind of fantasy ones, this drama is not for you.
It has such a deep meanings and wonderful acting. The surprising ending is the best and you feel that the whole experience has been changed for awhile. I just love it. Watch it if you feel that something doesn't make sense, wait for the end."
161,The Light in Your Eyes,"Acting was excellent, emotional drama with tiny touches of wits and laughs.I didnt like the story overall. It was confusing and was hoping for a more interesting story since it started with something like that. Each episode along the way started going down and boring. I was hoping the last 3 episodes would make more sense but I was wrong and the real story got more depressing. This is not a happy story at all. Watch it if you feel like being sad. Rated 6 because I continued watching (some fast forwards) until the end."
162,The Light in Your Eyes,"A very good show with wonderful story. Acting of all 3 lead actors is amazing. It tells u about life and old age. It should be a highly watched show as its truly lovely
Ps U will cry in last 2 episodes"
163,The Light in Your Eyes,"I have been watching dramas for many years and I haven't been that moved since...I don't even recall. At the beginning it just looks like your typical funny/romantic/fantasy drama but, and this is a ""BUT"", it has so much more to offer. The topics that are covered are deeper than thought and anyone can relate to them, in the sense that it is a society issue. The outcome is just ""dazzling"", and could leave anyone speechless.
To finish, the 3 main actors are also great and especially Kim Hye Ja, she completely deserved her award.
Recommended 100%"
164,The Light in Your Eyes,I literally cried with it. it was really beautiful and heartwarming
165,The Light in Your Eyes,"This drama series is not a typical romance / fantasy series... it's one that explores our lives and deeper experiences we take from them. One of the reviews mentioned that the comedy was 'odd', but I believe that these lighthearted moments were meant to be there... Despite challenges, the comedic aspects helped highlight that the lives of these characters wasn't all pain, but that they also had their moments of fun. In my opinion, the drama showed us how we wish it was either all dark or all comedy, but it isn't..because that's reality. In fact, it's what makes life so meaningful, so beautiful, and worth holding onto. It shows just how easy it is to dismiss our brighter moments. Beautifully written. I saw it a second time, knowing what to expect, which made me appreciate all the little scenes that was included in the drama. You can not call this drama 'slow', especially when it is only 12 episodes...it was all exquisitely made."

184,My Mister,"My mister is an odd drama with an interesting, unique plot. The first two episodes were so confusing, that I had to put it off and actually concidere dropping it. Fortunatelly, I didn't. The plot grows thick and everything falls in place after episode three, when we get to see the characters, their struggles and their real personalities and figure out what everyone seeks for. Ji Ahn was a nice character. She was poor, and she had given up on escaping her situation any time soon. Her mister, the boss of her department where she works part time, seems a simple guy with family issues but eventually, everyone around him plot for his fall. All the characters of the drama were unique and interesting, though that actress was kind of annoying at some point. I also enjoyed the fact that the story didn't follow any romantic twist, but stayed true to its dark, slice of life focus. So, great performances, great story and great characters."
185,My Mister,"I love the opening song of this drama - it sounds like tinkling cheerfulness. The animation is so pretty with the characters walking and Korean characters. There are at least two songs I like in this drama - one with female voice and one with male voice.Dong-hoon is the ideal man - he is trustworthy, reliable, honest. He has this maturity and a very deep voice. I like the maturity in older men and can understand why Ji-an fell for him. He wears a suit and tie with a shoulder bag.His wife cheats on him with his boss. One of the worst cheating scenarios out there. They show lots of passionate kissing between them and intimacy. It made me sad that him and his wife did not even kiss at all in the drama. There is no intimate scenes between them, only viewers can imagine.Ji-an is a compassionate person who does the right thing while working with bad people. She is so cute looking and pretty. IU was 25 years old and she plays a woman born in 1998 (20 years old). The casual outfits she wears are cute and suit her. I love the Converse, skinny jeans and button-down looks she tends to wear.The personal issues in Dong-hoon's and Ji-an's lives seem difficult to resolve. They come from different walks of life, have different incomes and each have their own problems that correspond with their stage in life. Dong-hoon is in his forties while Ji-an is in her twenties.One person could change your life. This drama reinforces the message to be kind. Every relationship is fascinating and precious. Be happy to pay back.I was really sad as I was secretly rooting for our main characters to become a couple although I knew in the back of my mind that it was unlikely. They look so good together and personalities suit each other. I love their restaurant and bar scenes where they are comfortable in each other's presence. It is a break from all the troubles in their lives.I love the neighbourhood gang and their compassion. We see the older adults taking Ji-an under their wing and giving eye smiles radiating with compassion for her.Ji-an's state in poverty has reminded me to be frugal and work hard. Save for a rainy day. Spend time doing the things that really matter. See grandma as much as possible. The connections in your life are more valuable than anything else."
186,My Mister,"Advantages: Summary is realistic, full of feelings, vivid characters.
Disadvantages: love accounts for too much, plot connotation declines too much, frustration reverses. After a while, and then savor, suddenly feel that the whole film's three views have some wonderful flowers, why the face of betrayal and suffering, uncle is also arranged to be tolerant, passive acceptance?"
187,My Mister,"Advantages: Summary is realistic, full of feelings, vivid characters.
1. The whole play is very close to the world. Most people in their 40s and 50s may live a funeral life. Working every day is like going to the slaughterhouse. It's neither interesting nor courageous to leave.
2. The feelings of the three brothers who lost their honour. Perhaps the 8090 and 90s generations lack the friendship of brothers and sisters. They really envy the friendship of brothers who lost three brothers in the play.
3. The tenacity of the hostess. The first half of the rendering is that kind of experience from childhood, warm and cold world, but with the image of grandma strong living. Let people can not help but feel pity.
4. There are also all kinds of people in the same plot in the play. Although most of them are frustrated, there is always a passion of their neighbors.
Disadvantage: The plot connotation declined too much, frustrated and retrograde.
1. The plot of the upper and lower parts is very different. The first few episodes of intensive workplace struggle, a few climaxes passed, the rhythm of the whole story line fell apart immediately, and the whole story line was completely destroyed.
2. Although the voice propaganda said that it was not a love film, the more the love between the man and woman in the back of the play, the bigger the role, watching is really depressing and sleepy.
3. There are too many blanks in the end, and almost everyone is bad ending. The woman appeared to be out of the shadows but returned to Seoul without looking for a man. The eldest son was repeatedly told that his nominal marriage continued to be single but did not dare to retrieve the person who understood him. The eldest three broke up and rewrote the script against the plot. The monk and the bartender were absolutely different from each other."
188,My Mister,"A slice of life with a great sound track. A story of a girl with a painful past planning the downfall of her older manager who she develops feelings for. This is an excellent story superbly acted which touches on how people are affected by interactions with others. There are many side characters who are all just searching for happiness. It starts slow but this is a story about people, friendship and love and this pace helps you connect with the individuals. Stick with it as the ride is very rewarding."
189,My Mister,"Big fan of IU and most of the cast but the story just didnt go where i hoped it would, am i wrong or is Lee Sun-kyun just an average popular actor, loved him in Pasta but now I'm thinking i only liked that character."
190,My Mister,"This drama is absolutely amazing, like unpredictably good. I liked the office politics story at first but it rolls to the entanglement of the characters and the extent of their relationship making it an emotional one. The cast were supberb, IU and Lee Sun-Kyun carry the length of the drama with their acting and they portray the weigh of their character flawlessly making you sympathise with them and their struggles in life."
191,My Mister,This drama opened slowly but each episode has each meaning. Instead of going fast-speed with not meaningful story or cheap romance-relationship this drama shows us that even South Korean could make fact-story with comprehensive meaningful of life serial.Like the synopsis tell the 21-year-old girl with dark background who prepared herself to do anything for money met a kind-hearted manager 40-year-old guy who was being disliked at work by the ceo. This girl felt this guy was pity since his wife cheating at him with his boss and the boss schemed to getting rid of him from his job since the boss was his junior in college. However this girl who had faces the hardness of life since she was born was being helped by the manager hence changed her mind to scheme him she instead chose to help him in silent never expect anything in return even though she gradually loves him. The manager also felt for her but he couldn't accept her because of his age and his surroundings doesn't allow that kind of relationship between much older guy with a young girl.The drama wrapped in a good but cliffhanger ending. The soundtracks are enjoyable and the editing for each scene is perfect. The story showing us the real-life story condition in today's life which is good.The director and the script writer are really good collaborating together creating this wonderful drama series. Never expect kdrama to have this good drama (no fantasy).
192,My Mister,"A real tear jerker of a series: it could've been a turn off if they pitched the relationship between the lead characters wrongly, ie a young woman and a middle aged man, but it turned out very effectively done; so emotional and beautiful at the same time. The plight of the characters really affected me deeply, it's such a brilliant story."
193,My Mister,"MY MISTER (Naui Ahjusshi) was a k-drama that defied my expectations and left my predictions hanging out to dry. It is deep, layered, and so full of heart. At times it was tragic and heartbreaking, while others it was laugh-out-loud hilarious. It was always quirky and fresh. I can't begin to express how touching this was. There is something just so beautiful and deep about it. Wonderful acting, brilliant writing, gorgeous music, quirky realistic characters, down to earth vibes, heartfelt plots and themes...everything was so great. This show has so much heart and soul.The acting was fantastic. The entire cast gave stellar performances and all left lasting impressions. Lee Ji-eun (as Lee Ji-An) and Lee Sun-kyun (as Park Dong-hoon) were both so great and relatable. You truly feel for both of them, as people, and their trials and tragedies impact the viewer deeply. I loved Lee Ji-An's relationship with her grandmother. I also really loved Park Dong-Hoon's deep bond with his family and friends, but particularly with his brothers. The trio were so relatable and lovable. The entire side cast was fantastic as well.This drama is close to real life. It is such a beautifully complex show and all the characters are so well-rounded and realistically portrayed. There are layers of emotion and subtext between the every day lives and events of these characters. There was so much going on that kept me watching, even though the overall pacing was fairly slow and it had an almost dreamy, melancholy vibes going for it.Some viewers might not like the lack of typical romcom themes (over-the-top-silliness, unrealistic stories and excessive coincidences, mushy-gushy love at first sights, overly perfect looking cast, HEA endings for everyone, where everything is neatly tied up in a bow and everyone unrealistically gets their own sparkly magical happily ever after.) Nah. This drama brings home the feels. It brings home a meaningful story.There were so many sensitive issues and life lessons learned in this short series, such as seeing the beauty in life and in the little things, the importance of family and friends, empathy for others when we don't understand their secrets and sorrows, supporting one another through thick and thin. Overall, this was a great series, especially for mature viewers.STORY: 10/10

OVERALL RATING: 10"
194,My Mister,I now understand why this drama is so well rated. I just finished it and I'm literally speechless. I don't even know what to say...One thing I know though. It fully deserves every star I gave it. I'd give it even more if it were possible.
195,My Mister,"It is a series about how difficult life always seems to be, and the struggles to deal with what life throws at you. The main actor (Park Dong Hoon) is very kind man that is struggling emotionally despite having a very good job, more so than his two brothers who have it worse having failed in good positions and are now running a cleaning business. And how the main actor and his wife messed up, mostly by not communicating. The main actress (Park Dong Hoon) plays the part of a young girl that is struggling under her debt to a loan shark that physically abuses her who is also the son of the man she murdered in self-defense. She also has been left to take care of her grandmother who cannot move and is deaf and mute. She starts a new job where she takes advantage of her new position to make money by bringing Park Dong Hoon and his boss by wiretapping his phone. There is a lot more complexity with all the other characters as we see them also struggling with life. Such a great script with so many actors/actresses that do such a great job with their characters.Think almost every one of the main supporting characters should have gotten awards, and this series should have gotten a lot more recognition. With how sad this movie is I was very surprised to see how well people rated it. That should say a lot about the series because it is so hard to watch. For me it cut to the heart."
196,My Mister,"This series is in my top 3! It's a perfect 10. The script, the direction, the casting and beautiful performances. The soundtrack! Each episode is just beautiful. It was meaningful, sad but incredibly uplifting and just gorgeous to the last frame. I even loved the final credit roll. Pretty perfect production! Highly recommended."
197,My Mister,A truly heartbreaking and touchy drama with great OST and awesome characters. The main actress (IU) is a gem in her role. Unique with so good acting skills as every single actor in this drama.
198,My Mister,"Amazing story! This was truly an outstanding, emotionally compelling drama about everyday life: extremely touching and heartbreaking. (You only come across one of these gems once in a blue moon.) The entire narrative and writing were purely brilliant! IU and Lee Sun Gyun were exceptional in their performance together. Their characters Ji An and Dong Hoon coupled with their acting made my heart bleed throughout each and every episode (many tear-jerking moments)! Similarly, the story would not have been as powerful if it were not for the entire cast: they were all amazing! Bravo to this fabulous production! Loved it!"
199,My Mister,"Ahhh, i have waited and wanted so much they would have relationship in someway till the end.... didn't expect and lil bit reluctant on ending. But i felt already missing feeling the main characters just after finished and when watchin behind scenes. I remember the 13th episode. The show shows how strong the man even he is cheated. Love both main actor and actress. The actor is one of my fav korean actor while i didn't watch anything of IU before it but after this show, i like her cuz she acts very well."
200,My Mister,"I have no words... The best Korean drama of all time. Period. This brings me to tears every time I watch an episode, yes it is emotional but not only that, it's the writing, the acting, it feels like you are in the big screen. It's a simple show but so big. It's like an ant crying 5,000 times it's weight. The lead acting is phenomenal...this tv show is a classic. I have watched 5 straight episodes in one day. I'm almost to the end but my goodness, this is incredible. This is near perfect, wow. Shout out to the people who left reviews. I turned a blind eye because of the title and it didn't look appealing. I mostly like fantasy, dynasty, Joseon type drama. Trust me I watch Live, stranger, etc. but oh my... this to show is a must watch. It gets better after a few episodes when the characters develop. Thanks for making this Tv show and big shout out to Netflix for a bigger Audience."
201,My Mister,"Other than this series, the only other Korean tv show I had watched was Kingdom which was also a great show (though obviously very different). So, I wonder if my newness to Korean television colored my point of view, though I loved this show. I don't rate things 10/10 often and I did here. The show follows a 20 something year old and a middle aged man working at company in Korea together, both of them seemingly depressed and dejected. They begin to be drawn to each other likely as a result of their similarities and face a number of intense challenges together. The show is engaging, moving, and brilliantly told. A pleasure to see the lives of these characters play out and to get some glimpse of the Korean culture. I was surprised with degree of humor interspersed in the show as well. Several laugh out loud moments for me, with some very funny characters. Would recommend this show to all."
202,My Mister,"Well cast
An insight into Korean life in its normalcy.
Goes beyond the gloss of normal KTV and shows the gritty reality of Korean life and perhaps why young Koreans call Korea He'll on Earth"
203,My Mister,"One of the best dramas I've watched in my life so far (and I've watched a LOT). Also one of the few kdramas that didn't decline in quality as it progressed in the latter episodes. Very close to perfection, but I've watched dramas with better image quality, better acting and so on. That being said, it's great in every aspect, but not perfect, at least for me.Also I have to add at this point that I rarely rate with more than 9 stars, so don't let my rating of 8 stars discourage you. ""My mister"" is only the 13th drama on the list of my favourite series and as I've written above, I've watched A LOT."
204,My Mister,"Each and every episode is fulfilling but still you will be hungry for more.In every emotional scene you'll cry and by emotional scene I am not saying sad scenes only...by the time you finish this drama you'll become over sensitive, because it's so heartwarming that it's painful.This is a drama that shows two people at rock bottom in their lives who find comfort and healing after meeting each other.This drama has lots of stories around loss, the aftermath and how different characters cope with loss. All of the characters felt relatable in their own ways.To be human anyway is not easy to understand, this drama will somewhat help you to understand it through different kinds of emotions. It really does epitomise the most purest form of love. Love without definition. Love which is unconditional, where each person has given everything they could to keep their loved ones safe, while expecting nothing in return.I am a person who believe that ""a person who is only in love with his/her feelings are never to be trusted.""
For this reason, this drama moved me more.Actors- Each and every actor, no matter how big or small their role is, they all had their moments where they moved me.IU-Though her character doesn't speak a ton of lines, but when she does, it's blunt, cold, and of few words, but you can feel every emotion portrayed by her words and actions. She showed that living itself is a brave act and she is braver than anyone.Lee Sun Gyun- His voice! His super soothing manly voice can easily make you sleep from a long tiring day.He really is a ""talent"" the way he has showed his depression and broken heart is out of this world. Those long walks, deep breaths...you can feel him, you will cry with him.Jang Ki-yong- He made a similarly deep impression on me, somehow making me care even for such a violent man.The chemistry- The chemistry between the leads was also amazing. Their actions, expressions and their eyes when they look at each other were enough to tell me how they feel for each other. No words were needed. Now, this is what I call amazing acting skills!It might not suit everyone's tastes. But I will still say that do yourself a favor and watch this drama with an open mind and heart, thinking about your life and the value of the things and people to you. You won't regret it!OST: 1. Adult by Sondia- its depressing but healing at the same time.2. There's a rainbow by Vincent Blue
3. Far away- its not an OST but ML sang it in a karaoke, it's worth listening."
205,My Mister,"I was fooled by the poster of this series with the goofy-looking characters having a good time, thinking it is a feel-good comedy. How wrong I was. Without giving away the storyline, the male and female leads are ordinary people who live their miserable lives one day after another. What is not ordinary is their humanity as they cross paths with each other, the decisions they make and the actions they take that impact the other, for better or for worse.The tone of the show is dark and at the same time we are intermittently sprinkled with rays of hope and joy till the very end. How much can you love another person, be that person your brother, son, spouse, childhood friend or... someone who was a perfect stranger until recently? How strong is your love or friendship without asking anything in return? Characters we would uncharitably reject as losers at first gradually but unequivocally become endearing to us as their life stories unfold. We feel their pain deeply. We want them to prevail and have a happier life. At the same time we understand how difficult it must be for them to break free from their past or simply from the constraints that society or the characters impose upon themselves. Despite their character flaws and their burden, none of our beloved characters demand our pity. Instead they want us to see them for who they are, to recognize their integrity and be proud of the love and friendship that binds them to each other in their neighborhood community.And what a fabulous ending that is totally in character, even if I usually dislike ambiguous endings and I do long for more between our hero and heroine. It's several days after I finished the show and yet I still wonder how they relationship will develop in their next meeting...If you rate a show based on your enjoyment after it ended and the lingering questions and thoughts it continues to provoke in you, this will have a perfect 10/10. In that respect, this is the best character-driven kdrama I have seen so far. As a matter of fact, it is among the very best shows I have seen, simply. Kudos to the directer, writer and fabulous actors."
206,My Mister,"This is a philosophical drama.A story about trauma and healing.I've never seen the characters like this, till meet the movie 'Nomad land'."
207,My Mister,"This is an adult, well-written, meticulously well-acted, dramatic series, with light humorous moments sprinkled in. It is a story of perseveramce amidst adversity.The first episode, which contains so much story, in, and of, itself, draws you into what will be an eventful, deep, character-driven roller coaster ride, mostly heading downhill for much of the series. It is certainly dark, mostly serious, but where it leads is worth waiting and watching for.It depicts life, in many of its worst moments, but it will not make you want to look away. I watched this for 5 days straight, because I cared so much and was anxious to see what would happen next.This show is now in my top 3. This series is so well-written and conceived--from the story, to the acting, to how beautifully, and fully-formed, the characters are, make this a precious jewel. It has everything a person could want in a great series! Believe me-DO NOT MISS THIS ONE."
208,My Mister,"Have been watching 14 korean drama. And so far My mister is the best. The actors and actresses are amazing. Love lee sun kyun and IU so much. Lee sun kyun such an amazing actor that can always emerge to any character. The story line is strong, interesting and convincing that everyone can relate to it.
Bravo to the director and team for making such a great drama."
209,My Mister,"This show is a rare one. I just finished it and i have to say im happy i watched it (binged it since its so good) but im sad too. The story for the two main characters is anti climatic in a sense the show builds an amazing relationship between them even has the wife cheating on the husband and still he doesnt end up with her. Im not sure why they didn't end up together. I know most people if either spouse cheats would most likely get a divorce especially since the scandal was in such a serious manner. He literally had this amazing woman, with yes a large age gap, right in front of him and he does nothing to further that relationship.I understand the meaning of the show. That relationships you make in life can help you overcome difficult times in your life but I still felt they built up their relationship and it just crash landed. Also the youngest brothers relationship was weird as well with the actress. There could have been a finality to the relationship as well where we see him starting to want to direct again but no closure on their relationship.I just felt like this show was simply amazing but it missed some beats it should have easily hit. Anyways if you like kdramas this is an absolute MUST watch! Enjoy!"
210,My Mister,IU is fantastic. Very good writing. So much to love here. Great performances. All the characters have so much balance to them save one. Loved every minute of it.
211,My Mister,"This is one of the best KDramas.
Can find no flaws.
If you haven't watched it yet, you don't know what your missing.
Maybe better off without this life experience... ignorance is bliss"
212,My Mister,"Oh I have no words to express my uncontrollable and overwhelming amazement at this story, the actors and the concept. This is so real, crisp, dark and warm at the same time. It Is so different and yet it hits home like almost nothing else. Omg. Just sit down an watch this absolutely fantastic series! It's in my top three of all series of all times and from all over the world. My heart and soul is yours My Mister!"
213,My Mister,"My Mister is a precious gem in K-dramas. A masterpiece! The series may seem depressing (the first episodes) but each episode is worth watching with keen eyes, listening to the dialogues with open ears (to those who understand Korean) or reading closely every word in the text. It tells the reality of life, the struggles of ordinary people: the kind-hearted and unselfish man, Dong-hoon who tries to fight silently his depression; the devotion and loyalty of a young woman, Ji-an to the man she loves from a distance (so near yet so far); the bond of the three brothers despite their differences and problems; the kindness of the neighbours/real friends/colleagues; the mom's sacrifices and real loving care to her sons; the pure and everlasting love between grandchild and grandmother... the sincerity and pain shown by the movie actress Yoo-ra and by the cafe owner Jung -hee; the wisdom and serenity from the monk, Gyum-duk; the turmoil of married couples and the consequences of being unfaithful to the other half. Lastly, but not the least, it conveys the audience that kindness and honesty win over greed and evil actions. The whole cast has done all these beautifully, exceptionally, and perfectly with their fantastic performances! Lee Sun-kyun and LeeJi-eun (IU) are excellent!!! Hats off of course to the director, the screenwriter, the cinematographer and the whole film crew! My heartful thanks for giving me one of the most memorable TV-dramas I have ever watched!"
214,My Mister,"Watched 16 episodes in 2 days. The plot twists, the play between the characters, the sounds (I could hear the catch in his breath when he felt like crying). The writing and acting showed us how everyone regardless of their past, present, future can feel broken and how one or maybe four ""acts of kindness"" can help. It is a pay attention choice so don't think you can snooze off and catch up or skip through some parts; pay attention. The acting was great!!! Loved the main characters, the family, the co-workers and the bad guys were oh so bad. I was glad to see there was some redemption for one of them. I definitely recommend this series."
215,My Mister,"This show depicts people coming to terms with the ruthless world around them, but in surprising ways. A gem of acting, dialog, suspense, and cultural exploration."
216,My Mister,"I am left absolutely speechless at this masterpiece. Everything is so perfect - the lead actors, supporting staff, OST, dialogues etc. My heart broke into a million pieces many many times whilst watching this. You feel bad for the protagonists as well as for the antagonist. The first two episodes might be a bit dragging but just get through them and the story picks up quite well. Just ensure you have enough tissues handy because you will be crying your eyes out."
217,My Mister,Granted my only exposure to K-Drama is whatever is available on Netflix. With that said My Mister and Misaeng are the only two of the handful of shows I've seen so far I would recommend without hesitation. Just absolutely solid writing and acting for both these shows.
218,My Mister,"A brother sister who live on crime. A CEO who can be easily blackmailed to do what a temporary employee asks him to. A hero drawn to this negative character like a firefly. She steals, she taps phones, is allover the place breaking the law . Too clever making her role unbelievable. If that is a cocktail to love , well.....
What worked for me was the hero. I saw him in Pasta, an arrogant bully who mellows down. What an actor. In My Mister the naive, over burdened ordinary soul. Amazing actor. And then in Ep15 he falls. And what a fall. Everything is okey because she suffered- blackmailing, phone tapping and murder and all crimes good by me. What a fall for a man who battled desire and conscience. If the lawyer wife had a physical extra marital affair, his was a mental extra marital affair .And all other characters great acting. The bond formed in their 20s, their miseries not spoken aloud but empathetic being with each other, their shared joys and some great moments and dialogues.The heroine fab acting. Ruthless with a ten million figure stuck in her head and doing anything to just stay alive. Just too unbelievable for me., Her omnipresence, her 24/7 taping, listening to him ,come on get real. So all suffering kids can do what she did and justify crime...damn.They found peace by accepting crime incld the lawyer. Eh?"
219,My Mister,"If you are looking for lovey-dovey K-drama, this is NOT for you.The drama shows even if life is a hell for you, there is always someone or something which can make it better.I was not expecting an emotional and captivating drama. In fact, during this pandemic lock down, this helped me in re-evaluating my own life's meaning and purpose. This drama gives me hope...Love from Pakistan."
220,My Mister,"Where to start?The synopsis is really not explaining or doing this justice. On the other hand, what do you really need to know? There is a reason every one is leaving high marks for this: it is probably the most brutally honest take on a certain subset of humans and life, there is no sugar coating. Go in blind, but take some tissues... it's going to give your heart a good kick around, but leave you better off. If you're not hooked by the end of the first episode then you've missed something.In the main, it centres around Park Dong Hoon (brilliantly portrayed by Sun-kyun Lee), a stoic, family oriented man, under pressure from many angles, carrying the weight of his past on his shoulders (I suspect that's what is meant by weight of life in synopsis). The story intertwines what makes up his modern family, from his immediate family his wife, brothers, and mothers, to his friends, and colleagues. The story winds out from here from the everyday, the political dealings at work, the various forms of love, and the stages of grief various cast members are going under.The writer has singularly observed human nature and the class system, which if you're British you will heavily relate. Park Dong Hoon is a Gen X Middle Class, from a Working Class background; his parents taught him and his brothers to study hard and move up the class system. He has unfortunately not learnt any of the politics that the chattering middle and upper classes play, and he's not interested in them - being a decent human being he wants to do his job, he wants stability.Then there are the working class, those who will do anything - scrabbling to survive. The main thing this show does is humanise every one, from the lowly to the upper - showing each has their own pressures, their own reasons for reacting like they do; each is explained.Park Dong Hoon IS the modern hero, altruistic because it is simply the right thing to do, unentitled because as a human you are entitled to nothing; and even when surrounded by friends who look up to you because you achieved, because he's a good person he's still a very lonely man. Hmmm...And that's just the main thread about the writing, add in all the side threads of the extended family, so you find out about what binds this family.Then add the brilliant casting, direction, Sondia's heartbreaking song... singularly good. Thank you."
221,My Mister,"So far, ""My Mister"" is the best k-drama I have watched. Nothing could top that, and I have seen a lot of them. All of my favourites k-dramas are period ones (""Empress Ki"". ""Queen for Seven days"", ""Scarlet Heart Ryeo""), but this show is just untouchable, in my opinion. Very, very, very impressed by it.Full of emotional moments, I was never bored. Phenomenal acting."
222,My Mister,"What did I see ? When I start feeling alone, disenchanted, I come across snippets, profound writings that helps me live. This was beautiful, it has answers if you are looking. It will make you want to live and live with kindness , even if you are different and uncommon, it will erase your confusions, that's how good it was .Kudos to all actors , they are impressions that we will or already have met in this life,this artwork didn't made me lonely , contrary it's okay to be not okay."
223,My Mister,"I've never seen a drama TV-Serie like that before. ""My Mister"" has a great story with marvelous casting. I was very impressed about the story. I've started to watch K-Drama Serien after I watched ""Strange Forest"".My Mister tells us the story of three middle-aged brothers, who are enduring the weight of their lives, and a strong, cold young woman, who has been living a hard life of her own, as they come together in healing each other's past scars."
224,My Mister,"Started watching this drama with no expectation, thinking it is just another slice of life drama. I have to say at the beginning like at least 5 episodes it did somehow feel as such, a drama that totally people in general able to relate to and even a bit slow, boring with the many conversations in between characters and with the focus on office politics. However if you stay on and immerse yourself into any of these characters as they move along with the story plot, I guarantee you will feel rewarded on the experience of what relationships between humans really are and how we are all just surviving and thriving (or failing) in the act of being in relationships with one another. This drama stays true to its theme on exploring and unfolding human relationships - love (also self love and care), belongingness, betrayal, forgiveness, acceptance, letting go, and I can go on and on because I'm amazed by the writer nim's ability to pack so many things in 16 episodes and yet it all fits accordingly and not overwhelming the story plot at all!The existence of the male MC, Park Dong Hoon in this story and the way it is being written really carried all the other characters so well throughout the plot - he is really just an ordinary genuine ahjussi, at some point in your life, you wish you get to meet in real life or perhaps you have even met such a person before. He has his own shares of life frustration but always chose to do things that would determine the outcome of what already happened (staying in control) and not wallow in what already happened (e.g., blame or accept his 'destiny'). His attitude of if you see it as nothing then it will become nothing and life goes on, is really a good learning point in life. Try putting yourself in the shoes of the female MC, Lee Ji An, and experience the tough life she had to go through (someone who accepted her 'destiny') and understanding her reactions and actions as well as what made her blurred the line between gratitude and romance because in the end how do we, as human beings express of our love to someone whom we see as angel sent to us and telling us life is what we made of, instead of destiny. This drama not only developed strongly anchoring on these two characters but also the entire characters in the neighborhood detailed in the drama. I see it as every single characters revealed in this drama are as equally important to showcase how we all influence one another when we gather together in our lives. From relationships among family members (siblings, mother-sons, grandparent-grandchild) to brotherhoods who stay in same neighborhood (the extended society family) to the 'family' at work and to the point that even a monk character speak volume in this drama - all depicting the sense of belongingness in human beings that is so reflective of reality world. Their interactions in this drama are gems, teaching you the many perspectives of life.I am just so grateful and satisfied with this drama that lived up to its title and for the writer nim who preserve the beauty of the relationship between the two MCs without tainting it with the usual reciprocating romance theme. The most memorable thing from this drama for me, apart from the awesome casts' performances, is to slowly decipher and digest the meaningful conversations between the MCs especially with the constant illustration using metaphors. Oh and the music and bgm throughout the drama are like, prefect to the core. The whole wire tapping and listening to the audio along with Lee Ji An - every single sound was crisp clear and really made it feel as if the audience is transported into it. Also up until now there are still various vivid scenes from the drama that keep appearing to me visually, such as the walk home at the neighborhood between the MCs and the subway train ride. This is definitely one drama that will leave a big impact to you if you take a chance to watch it. It hurts a lot at certain point to come to terms with reality of life but it hurts so good because that's how you grow to be a better person."
225,My Mister,"This is not my first Kdrama. I've already watched so many Kdramas and some of them are my fav and will always remain for sure.But while watching this Kdrama, I felt so emotional.This girl is so talented. Just because of her, I lived this drama.I liked her silence more in this Kdrama as that was too powerful to express emotions.I must say, You should watch this Kdrama but yes one more thing that this drama is not everybody's cup of tea as it is really slow and very intense but at the end you will feel so amazed....Fighting!!!!!!!!!!"
226,My Mister,"On Friday, April 27, 2018, I have finished watching EP12 of My Mister. This TV serial is indeed worth watching.On the whole, this TV series is highly fascinating and very attractive. The picture of this TV drama gives an excellent sense and quality feel. The OST is another main attraction. The actors' emotional performances are also in place. The makeup and costumes of the various characters are an important part of the plot development of this TV series. For example, the close-ups of her bare ankles and thin, dirty shoes appearing in various parts of the play, plus the fact which Lee Ji-an has been wearing shabby clothes, indicate that she is very poor and short of money. The dark eye sockets and swollen eyes also illustrate that the life of Lee Ji-an is miserable and depressed.
In terms of actor's lines, this TV series is still very excellent. For instance, facing a rogue property owner in EP4, Park Dong-hoon took advantage of his professional knowledge of the building structural engineer to speak out excellent lines, including the story of ""prison break"". Finally, he performed practical actions to make this rascal property owner to apologize to his mother and brother. In EP 8, Park Dong-hoon is a building structural engineer with solid basic construction knowledge and strong structural technical skills. When he was on his way home with her, Park Dong-hoon told Lee Ji-an not only about the contents of the work of the building structural engineer, but also described the relationship between internal forces and external forces in the construction structure. Thus, he derived the philosophy of life from the content of the knowledge of architectural structure. The lines are as follows:Lee Ji-an: 
When everyone knows that you are an architect in future, you must be asked to provide help everywhere.Park Dong-hoon: 
Not an architect, but a building Structural Engineer.
After working here for so long, you don't even know what the company is running.Lee Ji-an: 
Aren't they all the same?Park Dong-hoon: 
Not the same.
The architect is responsible for the design.
But building structural engineer have to think: if you want to construct the new building according to the design drawing blueprint, what kind of material you should use and how to do to make it safe. It is the person who performs calculation over and over again.
As literally speaking, it is the person who creates the structure.
All buildings are the struggle between external forces and internal forces.
The wind, the load, the vibration.
Calculate all the possible external forces.
Then design the internal force stronger than the external force.
The apartment should be designed to bear 300kg per square meter.
A crowded schools or lecture halls requires to be designed a much higher load.
Only one level of dining room needs to be designed different loads for different places where people sit and where the weight apparatus are laid up.
It has always been necessary to design internal forces more strongly than external forces.
Life is also the same.
Maybe it is the war between internal forces and external forces.
No matter what happens,
as long as you have internal force, you can hold on.
The characters of this TV series can represent various kinds people in today's society.Park Dong-hoon represents a class of people: It is a part of the middle-aged middle class that is under a lot of great pressure, but still struggling to live. In the plot of this TV series, he is a kind and considerate person who always wants to take care of his family and loved ones (not just his wife alone). He didn't want to tell his wife and other family members about unfavorable things what he encountered at work. Without no income problems, he still suffered from other sources from mental stress, causing him to live like a walking dead in daily life. The reasons for the above problems are:a. Park Dong-hoon had to provide for his elder brother and younger brother in need because they had a very poor life at that time.b. His marriage was under strain at the moment.c. His mother eagerly hoped that he would prove to be an elite in the family.d. In the power struggle within the company, Park Dong-hoon was marginalized by Do Joon-young who is a high - ranking officer, his college juniors and his wife's secret lover. The above points indicate that many problems can not be solved by money. These are the frustration of a part of the middle class. Looking at this type of crowd on the surface, the conclusion is not bad for all aspects, such as good work, good family and adequate leisure time. Even if they work diligently and conscientiously every working day, the troubles or misery of life given to this type of people are endless, so they cannot live a relaxed life.
Lee Ji-an represents a class of people: the bottom class of the society. In this TV series,Lee Ji-an is a very hard-to-reach young man with a callous face all day long, which is due to her heavy burden of life. Many time during working hours, she deliberately made the sound of the photocopier so loud that she irritated her office colleagues because of certain problem with the photocopier. Her colleagues asked her to take an A 4 paper, but she opened the drawer with her feet and asked her colleague to bend over to pick it up by himself. Close to the end of the working day,she stole the free coffee powder from the tea-room in the office unobtrusively with the purpose of serving as a part of dinner. At night she also continued to work part-time in the restaurant. While washing the dishes, she stole the leftovers and then took them home to eat. Even worse at the age of 15, she killed a loan shark who abused and assaulted her and her grandmother due to usurious loan. Today, Lee Gwang-il, who had inherited his father's debt collection as the loan shark, not only asked Lee Ji-an to pay back the money like an evil landlord, but also often beat her like a demon and even vowed to torture her forever. To fight against the harsh circumstances, she had the maturation that was not commensurate with her age and owned her inborn instinct wisdom. At the starry night when the moon is clear, Lee Ji-an smuggled her paralyzed and deaf grandmother out with the bed because she could not afford the cost of the sanatorium. In order to survive and because of the distrust of this society, she can basically ignore the corresponding rules when at works, but her heart is yearning for kindness. With the development of the drama caused by the merchandise coupon which was worth 50 million Korean Won, the contact between Lee Ji-an and Park Dong-hoon had increased gradually. Lee Ji-an understood Park Dong-hoon's kindness, tolerance and love for his family. Park Dong-hoon also knew Lee Ji-an's goodness and strength. For example, Park Dong-hoon said to Lee Ji-an, ""you are really kind."" Besides, Lee Ji-an told Park Dong-hoon ""because he scolds you"" and ""because you hate him."" They were guarding each other in their own way with mutual sympathy but without any trace of comfort. It seems that two people who are about to freeze could gather together to warm themselves up. In EP9, when Park Dong-hoon fought with Lee Gwang-il who was the loan shark due to Lee Ji-an's debt problem, Lee Ji-an eavesdropped on this scene through his mobile phone, and then squatted on the side of the road and cried. The plot of "" My Mister"" finally ushered in the first climax. For people like Lee Ji-an in the lower classes, survival has been the greatest victory and the rest things are luxuries.Wait for me to update"
227,My Mister,"Really great. Something different when it comes to Kdramas. Loved the acting, the subtle element of suspense, the real life themes including poverty/class and the seriousness(absence of the often seen comedy in Kdramas). This is a love story. I was wary of the lack of romance in the usual sense but liked it no less for it. Classy, well filmed and written. Not one for watching over and over, but still 10/10 for me."
228,My Mister,"Just ordinary life of two guys. There is no effects or fantasy. Just brilliant acting. Lee Jee Eun is already one of my favorite actresses. But everyone else's performances are too. I've watched so many movies and tv shows. But this is my first review. My mister is ""Masterpiece""!!! Just go and watch."
229,My Mister,Takes you through a roller-coaster ride of emotions. At the end you realize what life is..
230,My Mister,"This is one of the best things I have ever seen. The writing, the acting, the cinematography. ""My Mister"" explores the human heart, our troubled relationships with each other and ourselves. A mix of corporate intrigue and personal longing, of betrayal and friendship - and unexpected warmth and even hope. I was sorry to leave this world and these characters. But I was so grateful to have spent time with them. What an accomplishment. Bravo."
231,My Mister,"I'm writing this through episode 15 of 16, as it becomes clear I won't get the ending I want.I'm unsure on the stars to give because I have hated and loved this show to the extremes.I've watched a lot of depressing series and movies on purpose, but this has broken me and I'm not sure I will watch the final episode.As well I would like to mention I have stayed up watching this for 15 hours straight, through the night, just hoping I would see something happy and rewarding.SPOILERS BELOW
I understand there was a controversy and quite an understandable one regarding the age of the two main characters which led to the clarification that this was not romance between the two characters.Well whatever it was I needed them to be together.I feel genuinely hurt and powerless as I'm watching two people miss each other entirely after all they've been through together and the pain they've endured. This show made me empathise so much that I can't stand the idea of Ji-An not having Dong-Hoon.I'm actually upset seeing that he might remain with a woman who caused him so much pain, and let such a special and strong human who has protected him behind his back.Maybe because my age is a lot closer to Ji-An I don't see as much of an issue as IU did, but I really feel as if this show presented me with soulmates who just aren't going to be together in the end.I love sad endings, but after all this pain and sadness I just can't take anything less than a picturesque ending, and I don't think I will.I feel as though my heart is being stamped on, and I just want Ji-An to be happy."
232,My Mister,"It's a good but sad story. It is so worth to watch because it's real life being portrayed here. Good actors, specially the main couple. I found it to slow pace, to long and a bit depressing but it's a beautiful serie showing us it's possible to help each other even when we are in a miserable situation. some heart breaking scenes and strong characters. Worth the awards the had win."
233,My Mister,"My mister has to be one of the best kdramas of all the time with the perfect script, dialogs, acting and music. This show makes you believe in all the good there is in this world. Park Dong Hoon and lee ji an are actual people surviving and living their lives. There was nothing fictional about this drama. Each and every character here is based on actual people. Each episode is a tearjerker and the OST will leave you feeling very emotional. However, it also teaches the values of lives which many of us tend to either forget or ignore. Koreans do really know how to make life stories and I bet no other industry does it better than them. Kudos to the entire team involved in this drama. Thank you."
234,My Mister,"I rarely comment here on IMDB but for this i just had to. This is one of the best series/dramas out there, and i don't mean Korean, i mean in general. It's healing, insightful, moving, sad, happy and everything in between. If you have the patience to see this; and by this i mean, enjoy the character development at first which is essential to understanding the story, you will love it at the end.Do yourself a favor and watch this, you will NOT be disappointed at all."
235,My Mister,"I loved this drama from the beginning to the end. It shows the best & the worst of humanity, and depth that ones heart can reach to help another human being. Of how a community can bond to save another.
The girl 'child' was portrayed in a passionate realistic way. Forgiveness and love are main themes.
I even felt the heart of the childhood friend who even though he was a abusive person was only looking for her to live him.
I was genuinely caught up in all the emotion.
Again I loved this drama. The music was fitting."
236,My Mister,It's that great. Beautiful. Go watch it. Worth every seconds of your life. Every aspect of this series is almost perfect.
237,My Mister,"The most beautiful script. It's one-of-a-kind. Certainly the best Korean drama. I am not hesitant to say the most moving moving picture of all forms.I am Korean, and I believe this is the most honest depiction of my country in all aspects. This is South Korea at its raw state with both things I am proud of and I am not proud of."
238,My Mister,"This drama is heart wrenchingly real. It is bleak, depressing, heavy, frightening but there is moments of light, love, humour and friendship. It is beautifully written, acted, filmed, edited and produced. I can't really explain what this drama is about - but mainly it is just about life and how we all get through it. With a little help a long the way by those that love us. This show is recommended to anyone - not just kdrama lovers. It has become amongst my top 5 for sure."
239,My Mister,This has got to be one of my absolute favorites. This drama is a gift to society.
240,My Mister,"Technically this is a well shot drama with a reasonably tight screenplay, intelligent dialogues and an exceptionally good soundtrack to boot ! The relationship between 20-something Lee Ji-An and 40-something Park Dong-hoon is it love, friendship or infatuation we may never know but it's an absolute rollercoaster. While JiAn endures heart breaking poverty and physical pain that's out there Dong-hoon endures the breakdown of his marital harmony stoically mentally but they are both incredibly pitiful for each other and it is this pity that bounds them together...
IU nails it as the steely but hopeless world-weary girl that just struggles to get through day by day while caring for her grandma. I just can not stop thinking of her haunting performance specifically in the first few episodes. As a grown man her realistic performance has left me teary eyed on quite a few occasions. I hope she explores more such roles!
Sunkyun as Dong-hoon is great and is well supported by the rest of the cast specially his office mates and brothers and family.
Check out the amazing soundtrack Rainbow, Grown ups, Myself in my heart and others!
Overall this is a great package and I will definitely watch a few episodes and scenes multiple times as they are just too good."
241,My Mister,"Everything in one show.
Family, friend, love stoy, corporate, neighbors.. One of the best dramas i ever watched.
10/10 without a doubt."
242,My Mister,"This show is so amazing , i randomly select it to watch but woow i didnt expect it to be this good.
so real , so rough and raw you will feel all the feels with all the characters .
it's really on my all time favourite list now."
243,My Mister,"This is the best, wisest, most emotionally engaging, and super-good presentation of any type I've ever seen. At the same time, it is a realistic slice-of-life drama and won't appeal to everyone. There are many wonderful reviews here which I cant really add to, but I do wish IU could get an Oscar for this performance. And while I'm at it, the writers and director also."
244,My Mister,"""My Mister"" is one of the most heartwarming drama shows that I have seen, not just within the genre of k-dramas, but amongst all dramas I have witnessed. It brings us up close with the characters Park Dong-hoon (portrayed by Lee Sun-kyun who recently appeared in ""Parasite""), a civil engineer who despite being married, is probably in a state of depression and loneliness, and Lee Ji An (portrayed by the singer IU), a young woman who's just currently living through a harsh, brutal patch. Their stories get intertwined and we get this beautiful series as we explore themes of empathy, family, and resilience, traits we often associate with the best of humanity.While we have our two main characters, there are also an array of more minor characters and I have to say that the show does an immense job of developing the people who inhabit the world. They are very three-dimensional, and so are far from disposable side characters meant to just populate the screen. Some of the side characters have their own storylines, so there are multiple arcs running in parallel than just the main one. I enjoyed most of the arcs although I felt a few of them (there is one particular thread) didn't have enough pay-off by the end; in other words, when they reached their conclusions, I didn't really see much purpose in following them. But for the most part, and as far as the main thread is concerned, this show has one of the most satisfying endings I have experienced. This is a point to be said because I have just finished some shows where they were seemingly building into a sensational climax with huge payoff, yet stumble right at the final hurdle and you kind of feel bummed out. Not here.The cast performances were outstanding, and you can take a glimpse from some scenes where there is no dialogue on the characters' thoughts and feelings. They just bolster the emotional impact that this show has to offer and I guess that means the show is not really for casual viewing, especially if you're trying to watch something light since there are a lot of story beats here that will undoubtedly tug at your heart strings. The soundtrack is also pretty much top-notch, just perfectly accentuating the emotional notes of the series.I don't have much else to say because the main arc is quite unconventional and I don't want to get into it in detail. But this is one of those shows that really touched me with warmth, and I'm sure it will do the same to you too."
245,My Mister,"IU... where do I start. Her acting in this drama was truly touching and moving. She deserves endless awards for this. I loved watching her on my screen, playing the role of Lee Ji-An. I honestly believe that no one could have played this role better than her. The writing was absolutely amazing, beautiful script. Ahjussi.. WE LOVE YOU!! Both the characters of Lee Ji-An and Park Dong-Hoon were BEAUTIFUL. I also really loved the relationship of the three brothers and their mother. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THIS DRAMA!!"
246,My Mister,"If you'd asked me if I could fall in love with a show that plays the same sappy song somewhere in the middle of EVERY GDDM EPISODE, I'd have denied it from here to the Hallmark Channel. But this show transcends its form so that you hardly even notice that nod to sap. The slowly evolving relationship between the leads is utterly irresistible, as is the relationship between the three brothers. Even the minor characters are vividly three-dimensional. Hollywood would have boiled the story down to 2 hours instead of the endless 16 or whatever it is, but in doing so they would have sacrificed countless beautiful, hilarious, heart-bruising eddies and meanderings through the lives of these characters. I honestly felt love for them by the end, as though they were my brothers and sisters I'd probably never see again. 10 plus."
247,My Mister,Best kdrama i ever watched. Watched so many times and still making awww .Still have hope on this .hope Netflix revives it.please release season 2 already.
248,My Mister,"I started this series just because of IU. And i don't regret it. Really good story, i like the twists and character development. I was forced to hate a character since episode 1 but as the show proceeds I started to empathize with the character. Each and every character's story is different.. their pains are different.. May be it was my life's first favorite melo-drama.. At the end of each episode it leaves the viewer something to keep thinking or just start another episode right away. I watched this 16+ hours show in just 2 days.Some scenes I cant explain but it impacts me emotionally. And it left me teary but smiling. JUST WATCH IT."
249,My Mister,"The beginning is a bit slow and uneventful as life is at times but from Episode 5 on, it got me hooked. Amazing script, direction and actors. It is food for the soul and it can affect you positively at a quite deep level. Much recommended!"
250,My Mister,"I watched it twice! I think this was one of the best things I have ever seen in my life, not just in k-drama. It's raw. It's tough. It's everything amazing. The script is above and beyond.. each and every conversation leaves you with thoughts.. actors are very skilled, all of them.... Watch with tissues next to you."
251,My Mister,"Be honest I am not a big fan of K drama and I started with a doubt. Someone might find it is a slow start for the 1st / 2nd episode, but keep watching till the end and I assure you this is a masterpiece and you won't regret spending time on it at all.It is much more than romance and it will make you wanna be a better man in your real life. This is the magic of this series."
252,My Mister,"Before seeing My Mister, I already thought that, in the near future, certain works would have real recognition of their contributions to the Art and Cultures of this world. When I say recognition, I don't say ""awards"": I mean the study and look that allows us to learn and improve, both as human beings and our work (I'm an artist), as we do today with Van Gogh, Beethoven and Shakespeare.
Most of these ""works"" I refer to are Korean. My Mister is the culmination of that.
The only times I felt so intensely was experiencing one of the classic examples I gave above:
When I saw a painting by Van Gogh for the first time, when I listened to certain live classical music, seeing an interpretation of Shakespeare worthy of the original text or watching in the cinema The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.My Mister is on another level, I can't think of anything else that can compare beyond the classics. Everything here works in sync: Cinematography, acting, dialogues, photography, rhythm... everything.I thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who participated in the production.This is health food for your soul."
253,My Mister,"Perfect.Honestly I don't think there's a show better than this.
It's so real and moving. It's not designed in a way that there is a lot of tension and suspense or tragedy. Yet tragedy and suspense are deeply rooted in the show and it dismantles it slowly, piece by piece.You get invested in characters. You constantly want to just give them a hug. You sometimes want them to just cry, cuz it's okay to cry.
Amazing acting by the main 2 lead. Supporting cast where great too. But IU and Lee Sun-kyun really are great. Excellent way of understading that a lot of great acting comes from ""reacting"".In essence it's a story of a middle aged man and a girl who find comfort in each other.
And that's it. It's not a love story.
It's just a story with a simple idea ""everyone is capable of love""And No it's not a sad series even though has a sad theme.Also don't judge the theme of the show by its first episode (it's not bad, but it the depth of the characters come later)"
254,My Mister,I've never been more invested in that many characters in a single movie/tv show ever. Every scene has the needed time to absorb all the emotions of all characters involved. Directed perfectly top notch story telling and Oscar worthy performances.I can't say enough good things about this show. One of the best things I've ever seen. Can't recommend it enough.
255,My Mister,"I gave me feeling that I am watching Haruki's work. There are hurtful, miserable and lonely people in this world. Just like his words ""People in this world are connected together based on pain and pain"". And these people are connected just the same. They all are much in pain and have to live and stand those pain. They have to live by themselves. Healing series. Watching these people, my heart heals."
256,My Mister,"Whoa. One of the best shows I've seen. Filled with real human drama, excellent cinematography, outstanding talent. My only grievance is the portrayal of the two main baddies - way too comic-booky for my humble taste.Everything else works, though. IU gave an outstanding performance as a wronged young woman, the male lead was a strong match. Very little melodrama, plenty of action, the dialogues are brilliant, observant, and the English translation is superb, at least for the Netflix version. Each scene is full of meaning and propels the story forward. Loved how the characters developed and didn't stay static.Along with Black, this will probably be one of the very few shows I'll rewatch later on."
257,My Mister,"This Korean drama definitely stands out in a way that it is so real. Unlike other korean dramas, this one feels realistic. There is no show-off, nothing cheesy and nothing larger than life.
Every character in this drama has a life to it. It is slow, steady and never disappoints till the end. Everything is amazing about this show ; the direction, screen play, acting etc etc.
Very hard to find something this deep, touching and sensible."
258,My Mister,"I'm not someone who writes a movie /series review but this after watching My Mister I wanted to compliment the whole cast and crew of this series. Amazing work ..This is going to stay with me for a very long time. What a Direction, Screenplay, acting....30000 stars are even less. GREAT WORK!!"
259,My Mister,Sets the bar so high that makes other series seem bland.
260,My Mister,"My Mister is a masterprice - story, acting, dialog, cinematography, OST... everything is just PERFECT. When I finished the series, I felt something that I never felt for any other series.The Incomplete Life and My Mister are from the same director, and you can see the similaritiies. But My Mister way above The Incomplete Life."
261,My Mister,"Compelling, not entertaining. Dark side of life for all of the significant characters is expressed even in lighting and sets. Rising above the bitterness, pain and disappointment is a slow and nearly suffocating experience for the viewer, but the director, the actors and the filming have created an experience not to be missed."
262,My Mister,"Great writing, text is beautiful. Music gives a strength all scenes, Acting is awesome. Great peace of work. Thank you."
263,My Mister,I watch a lot of kdramas but for me it's the best kdrama i ever watched
264,My Mister,"Masterpiece? Bitter sweet? Something beyond that...
This is one of the most heart warming drama's I have seen.
I kept wondering that how could something be so perfect, from direction to storyline to acting!
I will just say that watching it will be one of the nicest experiences you ever had."
265,My Mister,"I started K dramas mostly for romance and I won't be wrong if I say that I always go for genres that are listed as romance and comedy. But after reading the reviews and popularity of My Ahjussi I thought of giving it a try. When I started with it I was at the verge of dropping the show but I continued. And just after 1 episode I was hooked. My Ahjussi is not an easy watch and it won't be shocking if you cry bucket full tears as I did. But if you are looking for something deep with no- nonsense stuff then you need to be patient and watch this show.
It depicts humanity in the most purest form and the power of kindness. It has some of the most powerful dialogues backed with powerful performances by the actors. I was not able to point out a single plot hole in the whole run of 16 episode. It is a must must watch and do not miss this gem of a show."
266,My Mister,"This truly is an authentic, emotionally raw, profound, soul-igniting, and deeply heartfelt K-drama that does an excellent job of expanding one's perspective/consciousness (aka further opening one's mind and heart). It's one of the best that I've seen so far, and the song, ""Grown Ups,"" by Sondia, is hauntingly beautiful."
267,My Mister,"""What a wonderful relationship you have with him, and precious too.""The mature relationship which the Ajushi maintains is astonishing."
268,My Mister,"Great storyline, amazing actors, scripts, and music.Life is hard, but no matter what, live happily. This is something that I learned after watching the show. We all struggles in life, but the best thing we can do to ourselves and to other who love us, is to live happily."
269,My Mister,"Anything more would not do justice to this series, so I leave it at 'perfect!'"
270,My Mister,"I can't believe some of my friends said that it is a boring one without even watching the full drama. This drama deserves every applause as possible. There is realism, the story line, the character, the ending everything is just satisfying. Will be in my top list forever."
271,My Mister,"If you are lost and looking for something that understands you without pressurising you with a solution or a path, then this is that masterpiece series. 16 episodes that will give you warmth if you are looking for it. But warmth in a twisted way."
272,My Mister,"This is the best korean drama i have ever watched, I felt a lot of emotion during watching this , the characters were sooooo great and i could feel all of their emotions,i laughed,i cried, i got surprised, i got sad and all those emotions felt amazing, This drama is my number 1 and I do everything to watch it all over again for the first time."
273,My Mister,"My Ajussi is far, far, FAR from the average Korean TV drama, though the vital part of longing and lingering feelings runs as deep as ever in this dark, brutal and beautiful story of love. Lived. Lost. Abandonned. Found.The drama is gifted with strong characters. Also in the supporting roles. All struggling and wrapped in the curse and poetry of daily life filled with dark corners and moral choices.From the perspective of a Scandinavian viewer, the story is told with a strangely familiar ""Nordic Noir"" grip and is definately some of the best Korean drama I have ever wiewed. Adding that I have viewed a lot."
274,My Mister,Please have a season 2 or My Mister 2. I've watched it multiple times... I love the actors facial expressions have been captured with such intensity
275,My Mister,For me this is the best drama show i have ever watched . sometimes it made me so happy and sometimes sad . i laughed alot . i even cried which is very rare to happen . this was the most touching show i have watched .
276,My Mister,"Oh wow, just finished My Mister on Netflix, and it's now up there as one of my top all-time dramas (not just kdramas) that I've ever seen. A real work of art and masterclass storytelling at its finest!
Such a great, deep story with very real, rich characters with so much emotional weight and humanity. If you think kdramas are just all pretty people and love stories, this will change your opinion. I haven't seen such a story about broken people and relationships since Koreda's Shoplifters. It's Breaking Bad/Mr. Robot-level masterpiece!
Incredible acting, especially from the leads Lee Sun-Kyun (he was the rich dad in Parasite) and Lee Ji-Eun (the multi-talented music artist IU in an Baeksang award-winning breakthrough role).
Finally, the cinematography and the OST soundtrack. Just mesmerizing, beautiful, and poignant. I want to watch it again, it's just that incredible!"
277,My Mister,"Started watching this hesitantly and soon couldn't put it down. My Mister is funny and sad and complex, and it is such a real exploration of the human condition, what it means to experience and to grow. Such a mastery of introspection of love, of death. Of life itself."
278,My Mister,"Broke my heart in the most pure way. This is my second time watching it and I still love it so much. It's flawless in it's honesty, difficulty and hopefulness. I recommend to anyone who feels downtrodden by life or has, to watch this. It'll provide you with solace in a wholesome way."
279,My Mister,"My Mister made me feel so many emotions I didn't even know was possible to feel. It taught me a lot, as I'm still young this drama became my motivation for life. I've never cried on a movie or TV series before but during this I've managed to drop some tears. Very emotional and touching. I especially loved that so many supporting characters had a really complex and well written backstory, but not in a way that would be annoying to watch. I seriously loved this drama. If you'rer thinking about watching it please do so! It leaves an impact, you really can't froget about this drama once you've watched it!"
280,My Mister,"For me, this drama is one example of a good package. Great story, great performances, great dialogue, great visuals -- all delivered in interesting & consistent plot. It tells you the story of every main character in beautiful-comedic-emotional-enlighten way, feels like watching 30+ eps great family drama in short 16 eps. Even tho, there was 1-2 exaggerated stuff, still I enjoyed this drama. The music score ""Grown Ups/Adult"" from Sondia shares the dark-and-sad vibe whenever it's played. Try to understand the lyric and you will feel the same burden Lee Ji-an bear all time.As if I'm alone in this big world...
No one tries to look into my heart...
No one..."
281,My Mister,"I hav seen a lot of k drama of the genre investigation,mystery,melodrama romance ..but this one caught me surprised..its a bit slow for those who are looking for thrillers..This drama is all about people around us.Most of the dialogues in the drama is worth seeing and will make us think about people going thru hardship..i really loved it.As always IU has done a good job.
All my favrite k drama always ends very soon after some tragic disaster.Even if it ends happily i dnt feel cmplete .but this is for u guys who love perfect happy ending..a complete happy ending"
282,My Mister,"I really can't believe that I just watched the last episode.
I loved every episode, every detail, every moment of silence.
I had so many thoughts that I would need a life to write them"
283,My Mister,"In this drama, every scene,every second is full of emotions and sense of humanity.people are not black or white.they are gray,they have their own mistakes and their own reasons.every dialogue makes you think and love the main characters more and understand them.
I may have cried more than 3 hours during watching this drama!
And of course i loved the ending."
284,My Mister,"In life there are times when perhaps you read, hear or see something that leaves an impression that stays with you for a long time afterwards. This drama is one of those special things that did it for me. Heartbreakingly beautiful."
285,My Mister,"Highly recommend this series. I have not watched many Korean dramas, but this was easily the best! It's an excellent story about brotherhood and family that's filled with pathos, but also hope. It focuses on two protagonists: Lee Ji An, a young woman who grew-up without a family, and Park Dong Hoon, a middle-aged man driven by a strong commitment to his family and an unwavering, unbreakable sense of what is right and appropriate. The two main characters are from very different backgrounds and at different stages in their lives, but their paths overlap and expose their need for each other.STOP HERE if you intend to watch My Mister. This is a 10-star drama, but it's not perfect. Following are a few critical comments about the series, including its unexpected and somewhat unsatisfying ending. First and not unlike almost every k-drama I've watched, there's some ""filler"" in the later episodes -- specifically the scenes involving the monk. The monk character has a purpose, but his backstory was unnecessary and slowed the momentum of the show. Deep into the show it became clear that the two protagonists were not going to couple romantically. You can obviously make a great drama without an explicit romance, but early on the writer introduced a bone-deep longing in one character for the other. It was this desire and tension in the characters relationship that became the central problem the story's characters had to resolve -- but alas, they did not resolve it. Instead, I was left adrift in a void of unrequited love and unanswered questions. Nonetheless, an excellent drama! Lee Ji-eun has a real, and uncommon talent.
I'm sure her acting career will grow unabated from this point."
286,My Mister,"Sorry to say, but i dunno i don't like this series so much because the story line is soooo boreeeddd, so frustrated, and also so sad from beginning till ending. I can't found something special about this story. This just slice of life which is uhmm i must say it seem bleak :(((("
287,My Mister,"At the end of the show the viewers were left with a little messege from the My Mister team saying the following
""You are all decent people. May you hang in there until you find for yourselves"".With that being said this show is something I could rewatch a lot whenever I am looking for help. The different layers the show has and is able to tell such a lovely story in 16 episodes amazes me. It makes me want to be a better person and too love. I think what the best part of this whole show was not the hidden meaning but the relationships, everyone was important and a big happy family. However what Park DongHoon and Lee JiAn had is something special. Yes they loved one another but it was more than that, it was their inner soul. (You will what I mean if you what it)When the last episode arrived I was not prepared. I didn't want to say goodbye, but at the end I think all the worries left me with the full circle happening.
I was crying a lot but I was happy."
288,My Mister,"Should I engage in a talk on best k-drama, My Mister would spill out without any havering. No review were read, no suggestion from friends or anyone, just crossed path on Netflix out of the blue and after finished watching it, my perception of k-drama was definitely redefined.Though I have to admit it was quite dubious during the first quarter of episode 1, whether to continue watching or just drop it. Closer to the half of episode one is where the verdict was made. At that point you kinda get a sense of the theme, work pressure, family value, silence dark inner-self, with a rare twist of dry-comedy. The major hit is at a little into second half that revealed the main actor Park Dong Hoon's wife's affair, that is the moment you realized this drama is non of mainstream, it is deep. The subsequent episodes brought you deeper and deeper into the generous-heavy-painful heart of Park Dong Hoon, a man who is left with no choice but to carry on living the life harder than death.
The theme is constant throughout the whole drama, with almost non exaggeration, to some degree of real-life reflection moments, and some rare drops of character satisfaction. The sound tracks couldn't have been any better.Most would say it is a sad drama, but is fact that is as real as life could be. The drama is deep, life-like story and (this might sound controversial) meaningful! If you put the right amount of attentions into it, be mindful of real life effect. Hope you get the positives out of it!"
289,My Mister,"I have seen many Korean series. But this is the most realistic, healing, beautiful series I have ever watched. This is a masterpiece. After watching Breaking Bad, I spent two days thinking about how brilliant it is. I could not stop dreaming about Heisenberg. Similarly after watching My Mister I spent two days thinking about how beautiful , pleasant, sweet, wise this series is, I could not take my thoughts away from Lee Jian and Park.Jung hee is also my favorite character. And their neighborhood! Profound on so many levels. I have never watched a series second time. But I am sure I will watch My Mister at least twice every year. I have never ever written a movie or TV show review. This is worth it!! This is spiritual stuff!!! Don't miss it!!"
290,My Mister,It's amusingly beautiful....That's the only way I can describe this drama!!!!
291,My Mister,"This is a series about ""human stance in life"". This drama really impressed me. Story, cinematography and directing is perfect. The entire cast of the series is very successful. Thanks to everyone who worked on the drama, especially Lee Sun-kyun..."
292,My Mister,A Beautiful Drama about Life. Watch it your not gonna regret it. Perfect Drama
293,My Mister,"I don't write a review to everything that ive watched. Idk, maybe im just lazy. But, this series has changed it and now I'm writing a review!!My mister would definitely touch your heart once you watch it. It made me more realize that we are really living in a cruel yet happy world. IU nailed it. Her acting was so real. Also, kudos to the male MC and all supporting casts for making this series so so real! 10 STARS isnt enough to rate this show. Thank you for giving us such a masterpiece!!!!"
294,My Mister,The story of the good man who became an adult and the good girl who is becoming an adult.
295,My Mister,"My Mister is a hauntingly beautiful series. The acting by all the characters is superlative, I will run out of adjectives while describing this series. IU's acting is hypnotic, I hadn't watched any of her other dramas before this but having watched this I also saw the Producers.
The acting combined with soundtrack and plot give the series a surreal feel. I have re-watched it, at least the favorite parts quite a few times. The other characters also have their own stories to tell which are very beautiful and engaging."
296,My Mister,One of the best K-Drama I've ever watched. It is beautifully delivered; feels like I am in a roller coaster.
297,My Mister,This drama gonna be the one of the best drama of all times.
298,My Mister,"Directing ,acting , screen write and every single part of it is awesome .the emotions and expression are perfectly portared , every moment is felt deep in . Amazing for such people who love emotional rollercoaster ride like me . Nothing comparable with this masterpiece.i totally love and feel it.best of it is that it's not fantasy it Sense as real or practical life story plot. Meaning of something for someone..."
299,My Mister,This drama will be on top of any other drama you have ever seen. Perfect.
300,My Mister,"I've watched this at least 3 times, hard to explain why I like this drama so much but this is really well made show has real life stories in it."
301,My Mister,"It's a drama that delves into so many parts of actual life. It's a very believable drama and shows both the good and ugliness of all people. How solidarity, or as koreans would put it ""Jeong"" saves us from ourselves. We all are guilty of selfishness (evil) ... the secret is to have our good balance and cancel out our mistakes as we don't repeat them. This drama was full of reality one could relate to. The depth of the cast was phenomenal and the writing how it distances you inward. A reflection but also a relief, a sense of luckiness, the subtle subconcious reminder to ourselves, how lucky we have it. This is where the tears come flowing ... not out of pitty, but out of sheer grief, a kind you would have with a sibling. Living life alone, while possible would be of less value not only to others but most importantly ourselves."
302,My Mister,"When my mister was release i tried to watch the first episode and didn't continue it because for me it was so dark and i feel like it was so depressing. Then one day i felt like i wanna watch this series. Then it did get me going until i finish it. This drama has a lot to give you. I gave a lot of emotion on this drama. I cried, laughed, annoyed and everything. The cast are really something they are all cute and have the best chemistry! I hope all of you watch it! 😍😍😍"
303,My Mister,This drama is not good as I hoped and the story line is sooooo booreeddd.
304,My Mister,"Being good never failed you indeed. Excellent story! Best actor, best actress. The writer is genius!"
305,My Mister,"Whether you like K-drama or not, if you have not watched this, you are missing out on a true masterpiece. For non-native Korean speakers, I wish you could get all the delicate nuances. As many reviewers pointed out directing, writing, acting and every else were just perfect for me. Hats off to the writer who can carve out this kind of humanity, brutality, and reality with very few awkward, unreal exaggeration."
306,My Mister,"In spite I'm a Korean, I seldom see Korean dramas probably because I never see news, shows and entertainment programs thru TV, recently. I happened to hear about this drama and began to see it and I could not stop seeing it. The acting , casts, scenario, OST and gloomy but beautiful Mise-en-Scène, everything is perfect, I have lived more than 50 years and have seen lots of Korean dramas when I was younger, but this is by far the best K drama ever. So far most Korean drama's plots are about romance and just fun but this one is totally different. I can't praise this drama too much. I am going to see this drama several times again with larger screen and better audio."
307,My Mister,"Great and wonderful, one of the best Korean series I saw, the acting was very good,"
308,My Mister,"Such an amazing series. I don't think I've ever watched anything that touched me so deeply. I love it cos it doesn't default to viewers' possible expectations of how the characters' stories would develop. For example, the lead characters getting together and living happily ever after or the monk renouncing his faith and getting back with his ex. Or the director brother making a directorial comeback. That would all have been clichéd and boring. This is more like how life is in reality.And the comments that the leads should have gotten together is just silly wishful thinking. She admittedly had a crush on him in a young and naive way cos he was the first man/person who had treated her kindly etc.. But he didn't feel romantic towards her even though he cared deeply about her and felt a strong emotional and psychological connection to her. It was a more complex and deeper emotion than mere romance.A beautiful piece of work."
309,My Mister,10/10 is not enough for that! It was really one of the best series I have ever watched!
310,My Mister,"I have watched so many dramas but this one is unique. It displays a very heart warming sequence of love and affection. Most of the episodes when I finished watching them I felt like crying, like something within me getting shaken. I love this drama because the way these characters displayed their emotions felt so real at one point I felt like I was watching someone's life. This is a review from my heart and I know some who watched this drama with me can agree."
311,My Mister,"The drama contains heavy conflicts that mirrors reality, and at the same time, the conflict will heal you and slap you with an enormous realization. At first I didn't want to watch it because it's so slow. The story moves so slow, not like amy other drama that every episode are mind-boggling. But I continued it hoping for the plot to strengthen and I was happy because it happened. For the people who want to watch this, be patient and feel every episode. Read their dialogue or script of the drama, you will surely be healed."
312,My Mister,"It is a great show that portrays the practical normal life and it's realities. The crew has done a great job in making every scene to the best. They story, screenplay and direction is very impressive. Friends, brothers and family relationships are beautiful."
313,My Mister,"It is first time that i am writing reivew about any movie or dramas.I watched this drama in 2 days until 5 am today. I could not stop myself.Nobody kills anybody, nobody flies to Mars, nobody has supper power here. It is about just simple life.I am done with my plans about watching drama at least for 1 year. The emotion that i got from this drama will remain for a long time i think. I did not know that sometimes movies or dramas can make men cry.I did not know that IU plays a role that good as she sings."
314,My Mister,"I can't explain what I feel..
This drama is so heartbreaking but heartwarming, too.It doesn't need any explain. Just go to watch this drama.You can become a better person than now."
315,My Mister,"I had never heard of this drama 'till I became a fan of IU this year. Honestly, you can't watch it nonstop, unlike the previous kdramas, which took around two days to finish. You must be mentally prepared: for each episode of My Mister. I've also realized that I need to take a two-day break since I can't get over the feelings and various situations that I can imagine. It takes time to complete it seriously.My Mister is a one-of-a-kind and beautiful piece since it depicts people's everyday lives. It's so raw that each scene doesn't need to be excessively wordy. As an audience, we can understand what the characters are feeling based on the emotions expressed by the artist in each scene. They used emotion as a language, and I know how difficult it is to create those scenes, especially for the actors. That is why I admire everyone who took part in this drama. They give justice to all of the characters. Scenes in which actors make eye contact are fantastic because you can see how their hearts communicate. That is when this drama captured the hearts of every viewer. This technique promotes the idea that actions speak louder than words, and through those actions, they used different kinds of emotions. When we are unable to explain our thoughts in words, that is the time we use emotions. Many scenes in the drama are too hard to watch as if your heart is being ripped apart. The only way to express it is to cry and use the eyes to describe what is going on. Humans are born and live with different emotions, and those feelings serve as a bridge to someone. It is used in this drama cleverly and amazingly.This drama depicts various types of relationships and love to which everyone may relate. It has many faces and forms, and it's fascinating how writers put them all together in every character. It's as if each character is a representation of a specific viewer. The most important bond in this drama, however, is the family. No matter how difficult life becomes, our family is always there to support us. That is how Dong Hoon and Ji An were able to endure all the pain and discover their peace and happiness. Family is the root and foundation of all relationships because it teaches us how to love, to forgive, sacrifice, be kind, understand, and keep moving forward regardless of what happens. My Mister reveals many flaws and failures in a relationship, but at the end of the day, those cracks reveal the true beauty of family bonding, love, friendship, and brotherhood.We might call this drama dark, but that is the reality of life. However, My Mister shows that there is always hope and peace beyond the darkness. It teaches us how to view the life, that we can rest for a while but we should never give up. Living and viewing the life as positive as it is, sooner it will become a reflection of who we are.Dong Hoon's character represents how men deal with issues. They approach and solve problems on their own. But, in the end, it proves that men are also human, and it is fine to cry when it hurts. There's nothing wrong with crying and expressing yourself. From Ji An's point of view, she teaches us that even when you're at your worst and everything is working against you. Getting out of bed and fighting for your life and for your family is something that everyone must do. It just takes one person, such as Dong Hoon, to help you change your view on life. To help someone, any type of relationship can work. We only need to open our eyes to realize that the world is not really bad. We surrounded of people who can extend their hand, share their life and help us grow as a good person.Romantic? This drama offers a new perspective on romance. Finally, I love how the two main characters can shake hands with peace on their mind. It's not too romantic, but as a viewer, after experiencing all of the heartbreaking situations, the ending is simply stunning. It genuinely helps me in moving on. It's satisfying to me, and I'll surely watch it again.My Mister teaches me a lot about life. The pain we feel as viewers is worthwhile since the drama itself helps us to find peace in the end. This show is a work of art that deserves to be watched, recognized and praised."
316,My Mister,"The first time watching a show I always try to avoid the previews that appear at the end of each episode, which is pretty standard I guess for korean television, because when I watch in short or no intervals in between the episodes the previews become a bit like spoilers. The second time around I quite like the previews because they become like highlights.I have just started watching My Mister for the second time and found out that after the previews there are short epilogues. At least at the end of the first episode."
317,My Mister,It makes my list of the best dramas I've ever seen.
318,My Mister,"How can the screenwriter and director
Tell the story of many lives lines deeply and reveal all the knots beautifullyAmazing ArtworkAll actors and actress are perfect fit with their roles."
319,My Mister,"Being a fan of top notch writing and directing from Stanley Kubrick, David Fincher, David Lynch, very few things are appealing. I am so glad I found this gem. It hit all the right strings. So grounded and the character arcs of going from cynicism to humane is just marvelous. Hats off to the writers, director and amazing cast.
p.s. first ever imdb review. Thanks Naui Ajjushi"
320,My Mister,"This is just a masterpiece! So real, so heart warming, so cute... Actors and actresses are so talented, the story is quite amazing. I love the relationship between three brothers and the neighbourhood"
321,My Mister,"I have always liked good stories, preferably on film and more recently also TV series. Much is perfectly ok, but soon forgotten. Other stories are really good, but the impression does not last. Then there are those that makes an impression that never leaves. South Korean ""My Mister"" is one of them. The tempo is slow, especially in the first episodes. But the story grows in strength. Lee Ji-eun (artist name IU), one of the greatest Korean superstars, makes an extremely strong and vulnerable portrait of the female protagonist Lee Ji-an. The performances of the other actors are very fine too."
322,My Mister,"When looking at this synopsis, My Mr doesn't seem like much. I put it off for a long time because I usually like more of the romance Kdramas like Crash Landing on You and It's Okay Not To Be Okay.Boy was I stupid.This drama is unlike almost any other Korean drama out there. The characters are realistic, each one having their ups and downs. And not in a grandiose, over the top way, like in most kdramas. But in a depressing, dark, slice of real life kinda way.Every singly actor in this is fantastic. IU, seemingly saying so little with her eyes hiding behind her hair most of the time, somehow manages to portray such a vast deal of emotion. And Lee Sun Kyun. Just wow.If you want something lighthearted then this drama is definitely not for you. If you want something complicated, with several subplots and character development then it is a must watch.I don't think I'm going to get over this drama in a long time..."
323,My Mister,"I watched this series for two ✌🏻 times till now, but I still miss it, and I wish it never ends 😢😭. There's nothing regarding it that isn't good, the story is so special, the direction is so realistic 😍👍🏻, the characters are so lovely. Anyone who loves drama this is the very right choice👌🏻. The story writer and director, if you read this please make more of this astonishing work."
324,My Mister,"The story takes us through the struggles of a middle aged man and a young woman who find themselves at odds with everyday life.
All characters are well rounded and brilliantly portrayed by the cast.
Great work!!"
325,My Mister,"First time to write a comment in Internet, I just rate the series or the movie
But it worth, one of the best thing I've ever watched! Really worth it! It will take gou to another place."
326,My Mister,"I really enjoyed this drama. The characters felt real, and their stories were well developed. I kept expecting this one to derail in an obvious (and American drama-like) way, but thankfully it didn't. I would love to see a second season of this one."
327,My Mister,"This drama is the best korean prouction this year 
 definitely worth watching"
328,My Mister,"""My Mister"" is the best drama I have ever watched! It is a life-changer! Absolutely watch it!
It raised my drama bar in a way that I can't watch anything else!"
329,My Mister,"Delicate, sensitive and exciting. A plot that envolves you from the beginning. Powerful! You get so much affection for each of the caracters that when the series ends, you miss them and want them to be well. Beautiful soundrack too. I loved it."
330,My Mister,Everything about this series are spot on. Salute to everyone involved in making this gem. Speechless.
331,My Mister,Excellent! The best Korean series I have seen this far. Each scene grabs your interest more and more.
332,My Mister,La serie con cierre más impecable y profunda que he visto. Parece un guion dejado por Dovstoieski para la posteridad.
333,My Mister,"This drama is a unique drama that does not portray the fantasy/romance world of dramas, but instead shows the value of life."
334,My Mister,"I've watched many k-dramas, and although I love the genre, there are few that leave you thinking, ""That's what a person's heart really goes through. This feels real."" This one captures the essence of humanity and connects you emotionally to every single character. Nothing is out of place. Every performance is brilliant. Definitely worth watching. And if you want another heart-gripping one, don't miss Mr. Sunshine."
335,My Mister,"If you are Korean Drama fan, Don't miss it anyhow."
336,My Mister,I can say it's the best kdrama till now I teach you so many things in so many levels! Bravo for the writer enjoyed watching it
337,My Mister,It's really hard for me to describe it..... watch it then u'll understand me.
338,My Mister,"One of the best dramas I've ever seen. Excellent cinematography, actors, script, sounds and soundtrack. Beyond all the deep meanings that I felt during the growth of the various characters in ""My Mister"" there is a constant search for peace with the world and with oneself, there is a serenity that is disturbed and sought even by the monk who initially seemed the only one to own it. There is so much to say but it's all hard to put into words ... it is simply a wonderful drama, a must-see."
339,My Mister,"I have watched all the episodes 4 times already.
Nothing more to recommend.
Watch it and feel it.
Everything is excellent from Directing, Writing, Acting and all OSTs."
340,My Mister,"Realistic, deep, non-romantic romantic story, heart- warming and heart wrenching!"
341,My Mister,"I had no expectations watching this drama. It was holiday season, I had already made my way through way too many shows running out of stuff to watch and i finally stumbled on this.The cover looked depressing and the first 1-2 episodes were slow... But something about this drama and these characters made me keep watching.At some point in this drama (and I can't put my finger on exactly when) everything changed. I found myself feeling many things, crying (and I don't easily cry for any reason), laughing and pausing the show to reflect at many points. This show made me hurt in the most bittersweet way. It took my heart turned it inside out and shredded it into a million pieces but that was okay, I was still smiling at the end.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I won't go into more details. The number of episodes felt perfect, although I would have watched more to spend time with the characters longer. I learnt many life lessons from this, and I'm a better person for having watched this. So thank you for writing this and producing it and to everyone involved."
342,My Mister,"Korean script writers are just the best. Every episode was fully interesting, with interesting unpredictable twists and turns. The main actress was truly awesome in her character!"
343,My Mister,"I enjoyed this drama for its ability to incorporate many human emotion in capitalist city such as Seoul where corporate work and enterpreneurship become the core of human survival nowadays. Not only focusing on human emotion within work, this movie speaks much about fundamental emotions of human being such as family, happiness, sadness, decisions, fate, faith, bravery and much about integrity. Its hard for me to tell others what is this movie all about since it has many life values and purpose within a single drama. Unlike other drama I had seen which usually has one main problem and has only one purpose or ending, this movie has much of values and purpose.Subjectively I emphasize IU's acting as female protagonist in this movie is remarkable. I watched some of her movie she played which usually have happy and bright mood. In this movie she was very depressed and negative. I think all the characters can be played by other actor or actresses but the main protagonist it needs to be her since she has equal struggle to the characters. I like IU's character more than the real IU now. haha.The color ,script, and scoring of this drama need to be mention too since it has characteristic of many good korean movie which is dark and gloomy (like wailling, or old boys)."
344,My Mister,"I saw many K drama's but this one
stands at the very top for me. You get so emotionally attached to the characters, even months after watching they are still stuck on your head. Atleast it was for me. This is also thanks to the incredible soundtrack that goes with it."

508,Prison Playbook,"Quite unexpectedly this series turned out to be a very involving and meaningful series. Funny one scene and scary the next it is thoughtfully written and makes the viewer think about the choices one makes in life. Each episode is 90 minutes long so it's longer than the usual 16 episode series but it is rewarding because he characters are so interesting and if you concentrate and give this a chance you will empathize with them. It really makes the viewer feel for the criminals both wrongfully imprisoned and those who have just made wrong choices, wardens and correctional officers and families. The ensemble cast is memorable. Park Hae Soo stars as the main character a baseball player who goes to prison for going overboard defending his sister from a sexual assault. Early breakout role for Jung Hae In as a army captain framed for murder.
Usually I don't like prison shows but there is a lot more depth to the story than you would get from a Hollywood series. Very moving series about friendship and loyalty."
509,Prison Playbook,"I've picked up this drama because it was one of the popular ones and everyone had only praise to share about it. It did took me a while to finish it, mainly due to the episoded being more than one and a half hour long, when the standard length of a k drama episode is about forty minutes to an hour. The length, fortunately, didn't make it boring or tiring. Though the story was kind of odd at first, as I couldn't make sense of what was happening or why the lead character ended up in prison. Things got clearer after the first episode. The story itself is okay, without too many twists and just enough drama to keep it interesting. It doesn't surprise in containted but, if you love slice of life stories with the comedy element to lighten up the drama, this is a drama for you. Finally, the performances were really good by everyone and the soundtrack just perfect for this drama."
510,Prison Playbook,"The warmth of Korean drama. The plot is soothing but it can keep people from moving too fast. The male champion changed many people around him by being positive and upward. Several of the main characters are very vivid. Although the hero's aura is a little bigger in the plot, it is not too abusive, and the water flooding of love is also controlled in an acceptable range. But why is it that the whole character only eats instant noodles?"
511,Prison Playbook,"This is a well written and well acted show. It's also quite funny in places and has quite a few laugh out loud moments. Yesterday, I left a 5/10 review for The Queen's Gambit. My main criticism being that I felt no empathy to the main character. She was too perfect = too bland. This show, however, has many excellent and well written characters. They're not perfect, they have flaws. You laugh with them, you feel sad for them. That's good writing. I also enjoyed how the characters slowly changed over time. Again, excellent writing. I also found it fascinating to see Korean prisoner life. It's definitely different to UK prison life. I genuinely thought this was a great show. Thumbs Up 9/10"
512,Prison Playbook,"A series that reveals why the best of KDrama is loved worldwide. The writing, direction, and acting are a joy in a clever, intelligent, compassionate, and often hilarious prison story that surprises at every turn. Strongly recommended."
513,Prison Playbook,"Prison Playbook is a character-driven human comedy, warmly written and bolstered by stellar acting performances. The drama expertly navigates its audience through its spot on comedy as well as powerfully heartfelt moments. The drama succeeds in delving into the characters & the beautiful & melancholic storyline. Serene and hopeful, Prison Playbook is a magnificent drama."
514,Prison Playbook,"Prison settings are a common milieu for stories as we see multiple characters and easy to put them in conflict. This is a look into a medium security pen in Korea, not that bad a place; only mild violence and the guards are generally softies at heart, the Warden a fool like an old sit-com. Antagonists are generally dealt with quickly to avoid the K-drama ""drats, foiled again"" plotting. The hero is a stoic good man doing his time; his cellmates have their own stories, most are in jail through bad luck or bad bosses, will they survive? Oh and the boy/girl romantic part has to play out and these side stories dig deep into K-Drama playbook."
515,Prison Playbook,"Brilliantly written, heartwarmingly executed, amazing drama! Simply fantastic! If someone asks me to mention a perfect kdrama, I will happily introduce them to Prison Playbook!Each episode contained dark humour and great twists that I never predicted along with heartwarming messages. In each episode I laughed out loud and teared too. I loved all the characters. Every single one of them.So thankful for the drama team for this wonderful gift to us. Thank you!"
516,Prison Playbook,"The series is a DIAMOND, it's a MASTERPIECE!!!It deserves more than 10 stars!!!Oscar performances by all the actors (one was better than the other, I could not even say who was the best or better than the other)!!!Great script with incredible messages!!!!This is how you set the example to others, with your integrity, even in an evil world!!!It belongs now to my personal TOP10 kdrama series!!!!Definitely must watch!!!!"
517,Prison Playbook,"Starting from the beginning , I felt the excuse for him to go to jail was a little bit forced. I honestly don't believe anyone would send anyone to jail in those conditions but if you accept that then the story is basically flawless. I love the ""innocent"" ""character of Kim Je-Hyuk that is contrasted by his latter decisions and plans, Looney is also a character that brings joy and amusement to the series. Every character is likable and there's a balance between good things and bad things that happen along the story.
One last thing that I think was missing is related to the finally. There's no mentioning of Min-Chul's life after getting out. The same applies to Captain Yoo, Kaist and Je-Hee.
Overall I highly recommend this series"
518,Prison Playbook,"PRISON PLAYBOOK (2017-2018)Unexpectedly Beautiful!To be honest, I thought this would be full of action and suspense. Wow! I never thought I would laugh, cry, laugh and cry more.Hats off to screenwriter Jung Bo-Hoon. I loved the twist and turns!
Another gold for Director Shin Won-ho! I love how he emphasized on faith, hope, and love.Bravo, to all the actors! I love Je Hyeok, Joon ho, and Lieutenant Paeng the most!I give it a 9.5/10.I love the OST, Bravo, my life.Don't let go of hope, everyone! 💞"
519,Prison Playbook,"If you had told me five days ago that I would be this enthralled about a series revolving around a Korean professional baseball player on the brink of being signed by an American Major League team being sent to prison for assaulting a sexual predator, I would not have believed it. Yes, I am a Korean drama fan and knew this series was well received in Korea but had dragged my heels on watching it. Who knew that this series would be chockful of so many funny, heartbreaking, happy, sad and truly heart-tugging moments? Each of the main characters has a rich personality and you quickly find yourself emotionally wrapped up in their stories. Each episode is about an 1.5 hours long with 16 episodes so there was plenty of time to flesh out the stories and characters, whether the prisoners or their guards. Of course, we know it is far from what goes on in a real prison but the humanity and character depicted in this show leaves us with hope that we will look beyond the prison jumpsuit or the guard uniform to find the human inside. Watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
520,Prison Playbook,I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this series! I'm watching it for a second time. I fell in love with each character even the guards. Their stories captivate you and help you see them in a different light than at first. I highly recommend it!
521,Prison Playbook,It started out boring but every episode is special.
522,Prison Playbook,"I started watching Asian dramas after being fed up of woke / super hero related American productions. I really liked Extracurricular Activity, Misaeng and My Mister but I'm kind of disappointed with this one. Ep 1 is pretty solid, but then it turns into a comedy more than a drama. What really irritates me is the sounds effects like birds tweets they used every time there is a joke. Not a big fan of their humor too. They should have stick to a serious tone in my opinion."
523,Prison Playbook,"I was taken aback when i read the description and started watching this drama because the plot and script was so refreshing. It is actually kind of a comedy drama in itself. This drama touches the themes of friendship,love,guilt,suffering,perseverance,motivation and bad habits which destroy a person. This drama was able to achieve displaying the many perspectives of the people in jail.
It mildly reminded me of the shawshank redemption."
524,Prison Playbook,"DESERVING OF A PERFECT SCORE.
This series will make you laugh while crying vice-versa. It may not depict the real horrible situations in prison (since it's made for TV) but somehow an eye-opener of the hardships of our inmates innocent or not. I wish there would be a season 2 but it's already perfect the way it is.
Kudos to all the cast and crew! Well-recommended. Haven't laughed like this since FIERY PRIEST! 🤗"
525,Prison Playbook,"The first time I watched prison life but it drained the audience's emotions at a maximum. There are sadness, annoyance, anger, joy, laughter until they laugh, crying, shocked. This drama is very touching and I like Jung Woo and Loony's interactions the most, they are really cute."
526,Prison Playbook,"An ideal world to learn and restart as new human, too ideal in reality. Dreamy, but we can try in real life. Still I really love every scene in this show. Every character is unique and progressing. Top musical background. What a playlist of soundtrack.""He is an athlete, he may look dumb, but he surely know how to win"".It's my happy place, I rewatched any episode in random again and again."
527,Prison Playbook,"I seriously enjoyed this show- the characters were absolutely great. The plot was so well executed. I just wish we could have an ending for Crony.. I fell in love with all the characters so was sad when Mr Ko and Kain left and we didn't follow their story anymore. But did wonder why we didn't have a little more to go on for Crony. I was so upset with Looneys ending so mad at him for falling for the drugs again, I know I real life this could happen but I like to watch tv to not worry about real life .. when I watch these shows I want to escape reality
An amazing drama."
528,Prison Playbook,Good story lines. Good humor. Writing and acting were very good. I binge watched the entire series in about a month.
529,Prison Playbook,"Everything felt perfect in the story, characters and relations. Nothing was overdone and over stretched. Never felt a dull moment while watching this drama. The characters and how all grow together is well depicted.Loved everything about it - The morning announcements, fan boy best friend, correction officers, easy going warden, prison mates and ""Never Back Down"" Je-Hyeok.
Must watch KDrama and easily my top 10 Kdramas"
530,Prison Playbook,"Well...after Reply 1988,this is another drama that made me feel something inside. Each and every character had their own story, which was shown so perfectly. Some prisoners were actually evil,some were guilty but repenting...and some were just unfortunate or framed or chose the wrong path. All of their stories, actions will make you cry,laugh or think. I was really emotional at some parts and the comdey roles were done brilliantly. Beside the prisoners,the correctional officers were also the life of this story.I have only one objection,i didn't get to know the end of some characters.. Dr. Ko,Looney or Kaist. Did they get release eventually? Where did looney go? Did his family know about him? What happened to Captain Yoo's retrial?... A little reunion at the end of the show would be great!Whatever, great show....a hidden gem in my opinion 😊"
531,Prison Playbook,"I really enjoyed this one, it's funny yet has its dark and serious moments. The characters in it are solid and I haven't found any plot holes. I did wish I'd see a bit more about those missing at the end. But I still love it."
532,Prison Playbook,"Finally a show which is actually funny, have been a long time since I saw a decent comedy show. Worth watching if you are looking for some light hearted stuff.Don't overthink and try to compare with reality though, its obviously a sugarcoated version of prison.First couple of episodes were slow but once you get into it, you will enjoy the journey. ""Untouchable"" joke still makes me laugh."
533,Prison Playbook,"I'm still giggling as I'm writing this. I work in a prison so I'm always curious when shows revolve around a prison setting. Wow, what a surprise. Each character had a purpose and played a meaningful role in the intricacies of the storyline. Every scene connected well with the plot. I will never forget the build up for hot water or the scene for the dream. LMAO! I'm a sucker for great story telling. The humor is subtle at times but so hilarious! I'll watch all genres. This one is super adorable and it's about the lives of inmates and correctional officers. Not a typical adjective to describe the criminal world."
534,Prison Playbook,"Prison Playbook surprised me. I was imagining a vicious action but turned out to be unexpectedly emotional, heartwarming and hysterically funny.The plot of this drama shows not only about the story of our protagonist who has the determination, kindness and the modesty but also with the life of people around him battering with struggles, regrets, and redemption. Even the smallest details make each of the characters sensible to the whole journey of the story.The casting is perfect. It was so refreshing to see different kinds of lawbreakers who wonderfully develop a kind of friendship that you never expected to be. Many things have happened inside the prison that makes the viewer anticipates every episode and a lot of things to learn.Prison Playbook is kind of a drama that will take you to humanity. It will test your empathy or stick to whatever belief you have about a person who breaks the law."
535,Prison Playbook,"I really don't understand the hype of this series.The main character is so boring. Great production, poor writing.The cast? No chemistry. Jus an overrated kdrama."
536,Prison Playbook,"I fond this drama while looking for the best ones in korea, and after episode 10 i have forgotten that its a drama and mistaken as a personal story, and aigooo completely forgotten that its 1hr 40min episode each. I think i need to join the fan party who says that this is a best korean drama so far."
537,Prison Playbook,"Wow what a drama it's the best Korean drama I've watched so far, well I loved LIVE too so they are both worth a look see. The actor who plays the druggy in this show was my favorite and I am sorry I don't his name now but trust me when you watch it you will know who I'm talking about he is so funny and sad but mostly funny the way he interacts with the other actors it's just pure gold. Ohh wow all the actors are brilliant really. I just think it's a binge worthy drama and I know you will love love love it! And if you don't well I'm sorry lol but you will"
538,Prison Playbook,"Such a wonderful drama about life in prison and all the characters in prison...really a positive show and stresses upon emotions in life and the things that prisoners miss out on...
It's a must watch for those who want to understand the values in life...
Netflix - sponsor more shows of this kind..."
539,Prison Playbook,"Absolutely love this show! So well acted with twists and turns in every episode. Everyone from the errand boy who yells about meals or water all the time to the guards and the prisoners, all were so funny and heartbreaking and inspiring. I found myself laughing and crying in almost every episode."
540,Prison Playbook,"After about 4 episodes, which were nice, I wasn't sure if it's intersting enough to continue watching the entire 16 episodes.
Reading the reviews here in imdb helped me.
I'm so happy I didn't gave up this show!!
It just gets better and berter and you fall in love with the charcters and the stories.
Really great emotional drama."
541,Prison Playbook,"I'm reviewing this cause there is only one review and this show needs more credit!The best about the series is it's comedy, it's like watching an anime of madhouse like One Punch Man.
At first I didn't think of the series that much, but you hooked pretty quickly and there no dull moments.This is the one show you can put on after a hard day of work when you don't want to stress yourself that you've got to keep absolute attention in case you miss a line.It's has a good story, some romance and enough laughter to get you through easily."
542,Prison Playbook,"I watched this as my first KDrama tonight, the first episode and found it refreshing. Evenly paced, thoughtful with a sense of irony, I'm pleased I chose this as my introduction to Asian TV. This is character driven and the characters are relatable, even the less moral ones. A fine lead actor performance from Park Hae-soo saw him praised for his work and it's easy to see why. I will be watching the rest of the series now, and look forward to seeing how it develops!"
543,Prison Playbook,Such a heart warming story and characters. This is kind of drama that make you feel good after each episode.
544,Prison Playbook,"The series was enjoyable, and both funny and heartwarming in turn. The main character Kim Je-Hyuk (baseball player who ended up in prison) and his inmate 'friends' formed an entertaining ensemble, for the most part. Oddly enough, I personally found the character of Yoo Han-Yang irritating and overly done. I thought the idea of putting in the mix a drug addict battling his addiction and struggling through withdrawal symptoms a good idea, but ultimately, the premise was drawn out far too long - pretty much throughout the entire series! His quirkiness and the constant bickering eventually got tiresome. This was a shame. The comedic elements were hit and miss, though more often hit than miss. It failed when comedy veered into slapstick moments (often yet again involving Han-Yang's character), accompanied by her icky comedy sound effects ('boing' and such). The 'brotherhood' theme worked really well, and I like that it downplayed the prison yard clashes trope (although there was of course some of this) more in favour of prison friendships. The phased exit of key characters (as inmates were released from prison, or moved from one prison to another) worked really well to highlight the bonds formed between the characters, but also introduced a measure of realism in the show (people after all move in and out of each other's lives). It was unfortunate though that Dr Ko (portrayed excellently) was the first to leave, but I suppose this allowed Jailbird to move back in to the position of sidekick to the main character. Overall, a good k-drama with plenty of touching moments."
545,Prison Playbook,"The storyline is interesting - slice of life with dark humor. The characters are well developed and the actors do a good job making you empathize with their stories. -Lee Gyoo-hyeong, who plays the addict, is brilliant...and the bromance between the main actors makes you love them even more. :)"
546,Prison Playbook,"This is a star-studded tv series that will not disappoint. You would think you know what's coming, but you don't. Very entertaining from start to finish. You'll find yourself laughing out loud, and in some moments, touched by heartwarming scenes. Excellent cast selection, well written, well directed, great editing and cinematography.

547,Prison Playbook,"To be honest, I'm a little sad to only discover this Korean series in 2021. But anyway, Prison Playbook is one of the most worth watching dramas to this day in my opinion. Believe me, it's not gonna waste your time.What I like about this one is that the script, the storyline, the character etc are different from other modern teen Kdramas that are full cringey, impossible love stories and clichés with characters being dumbed down.The script is like a combination of everything, there's the romantic relationships, the corruption in politics and criminal justice systems, pure gold friendship etc. One more element that keeps me watching from beginning till the end is the funny scenes. Like you can't keep your eyes off of the TV whenever there's a daily dialogue between the inmates in the same cell with the male lead lol.The acting of the cast is flawless, from the leads to the supporting roles and the extras. It feels like they are their character in real life.Most of the series were shot in prison, depicting daily life of criminals, filled with hilarious situations, violence occurred there, the journey of a famous basketball star of rebuilding his career... Along with all these, the series will also give you hope, optimism in life, warmth in a society considered ""horrible, dangerous, disgusting"" and a tiny sliver of slight in the darkness. It teaches us not to give up, not to lose hope, to appreciate friendship, to always try your best to achieve your goals, to live to the the fullest even when being in such place.I only have 2 episodes left but I don't really want it to end. It's such a fun and memorable experience to enjoy Prison Playbook with your family where all the members burst out laughing non-stop, or it can be an interesting roller-coaster of emotions for yourself all alone^^
I hope that this review will make you want to watch it because Prison Playbook totally deserves more credit!! You will love it!!"
548,Prison Playbook,"I just wish to watch Season 2 of this. Absolutely full of emotions while watching it. If u think this is more like Prison Break well it wasn't. It'll make u cry, laugh, paranoid and all mixed emotions, u should try to experience it on ur own. I just wish they had like a reunion after Je Hyeok was released. More than that I can't add anything else. Loved it!"
549,Prison Playbook,I have enjoyed so much watching this drama. Full of laughters! My best K-drama so far! daebak!
550,Prison Playbook,One of the best if not the best tv series i have ever watched. For some reason the korean tv shows all seem to have a different effect on me when it comes to making me feel involved in the show/film but this was just different I felt a heartfelt connection at points with the characters even the prisoners like crony at the end. Hope to see a season 2 one day but I highly doubt it will happen as it's been 4 maybe 5 years now and they would need a new story and cast and maybe would have to keep the old cast there for every other few episodes to show how they are now living. Overall tho 10/10 series definitely worth watching but watch it remembering there most likely won't be a second season so make the most of it.

600,Move to Heaven,"Korean Drama ""Move To Heaven"" is an emotional drama with lots of shades of sadness, happiness and a big dose of closure.The story starts with a tragedy right off, an event that triggers the rest of the action which mostly hides behind short per episode cases of death and how the main characters help those who had lost someone to move on. Those short stories were different from one another and covered a lot of topics, from parent love to lost lovers. They were beautifully portrayed and fitted in the main story axis well.As for the main characters' mystery, that unfolded slowly but steadily, being boosted by the smooth pace and the intense background stories. The performances were spot on, simple but emotional, and, overall, enjoyable. The few characters were a good choice also.So, 9.5 out of 10."
601,Move to Heaven,Life is comprise of many regrets but a matter of fact we need to learn to minimize the regret in our life. Learn to cherish the things you have and treat your healthy normal life as a plus vs many unfortunate ones. Seldom watch drama series but this one makes me cannot resist.
602,Move to Heaven,"Review By Kamal KThe series is all about emotions and feelings, especially, empathy towards the deceased who are no more in the world yet they have left their own messages to their loved once. The only thing we need to look for their message is by having empathy and the power to look through bits and pieces of their belongings. This series will make you respect the ""Trauma Cleaners"" which is a designation that I didn't know existed until this series. I have built a huge respect for them. Whoever is reading my review, get ready to cry your heart out because the story is so heart touching. You just can't resist from crying. The structure of story-telling was great, simple yet grandeur. The editing was amazing, CGs were top-notch, the effects were beautiful and last but not the least, the actors/cast, they were all amazing in acting and made me feel like I am one of the characters in the story. All in all, I believe everyone in the world should watch this series to develop their empathy and to understand and have compassion towards each other. It is a very good lesson for all the human beings to never give up on your life because there's nothing more precious than a human life."
603,Move to Heaven,"Depending on who you are, ""a slow drama"" could be either a bad thing or a good thing.But for me, it's refreshing seeing something so unique, and so well done, in a genre I usually don't like -- making me like it.And to be fair, it picks up a bit after the first episode.If you're tired of all the samey garbage Netflix peddles, watch this for a change. It's pretty beautiful."
604,Move to Heaven,"A tender and deeply moving series with a terrific cast, director, and writer. One of SK's best."
605,Move to Heaven,"South Korea has been known to make some incredible movies for many years. This is the ""first"" South Korean series I've ever watched (my wife and kids wanted to see it so I ""had"" to oblige).Despite not being a choice I made, I was completely stunned by the level of quality this series offers: Top notch acting, incredible, touching stories and an incredible character arch development. I can easily say that when I watch quality stuff like this, I hardly miss the expensive special effects and over-the-topness of some ""current"" series, specially American produced ones. Not that it a bad thing, but it shows how a greatly written show can be made successful without showing budget muscle. Still, this ISN'T a low budget affair: the camera work is incredible, the shots, the cinematography, the music, the acting. Like most modern series, this looks more like a movie than a TV show.No spoilers this time, you have to see, ""Move To Heaven"". Some might find it a bit corny... probably those looking for a more action oriented series, but the little action sequences here are incredibly filmed and will come as an unexpected surprise to some.10 out of 10. Yeah, it is THAT good!"
606,Move to Heaven,A young man with Aspergers works for his father at a company called move to heaven which clears the properties of recently deceased people. When tragedy strikes his step brother becomes involved in the company and he is not the caring or compassionate type but over time will he view things differently. Each episode deals with the death of an individual and looks back at their lives and how the young man with aspergers can see the things other people miss relating to their deaths. A predictable series but because of the quality of the acting and script it draws you in and each death usually means a heartbreaking look at the final days of a person and the struggles before they pass away.
607,Move to Heaven,"""Move to Heaven"" is a little gem of a series that is fulfilling and uplifting in its short 10-episode story arc. The show is like a yellow box that has all of the important things in it, leaving nothing out, and putting no extraneous or unnecessary plot devices into it.The story is about trauma cleaners. Don't know what trauma cleaners are? Neither did I until I watched the show. Trauma cleaners are hired to go into a deceased's dwelling and clean it. Sometimes, it is not very glamorous, especially if the body of the deceased has been there for an extended period of time. But the key element of the job is to collect those important and necessary items that the deceased has left behind and give them to a relative or someone who was important to the person who died.Han Geu-ru--who is masterfully portrayed by Tang Joon-Sang and should win every actor award that he's nominated for--is a 20-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome who is gifted with unique and special insight. Not only is he able to remember anything with a momentary glance, he is able to piece things together in order to learn more about the person who died. Of course, Geu-ru's world is strictly ordered, and any deviation from that order brings him into hysterics.After his father suddenly dies from a heart condition, Geu-ru is put into trial custody under his uncle, Cho Sang-Gu, a man who's just gotten out of prison and is an ex-MMA fighter. Cho Sang-Gu is rough around the edges, to say the least, and the last thing he is initially interested in, is taking care of a nephew he doesn't give a hoot about from a brother he hated and despised. Part of the beauty of the story is in how these two grow closer together.Move to Heaven reminds me a little bit of ""Highway to Heaven."" It seems like the kind of show Michael Landon would have done. The show runs much deeper than two men packing up items. In each episode, we learn how the deceased lived. There are some truly though-provoking stories of people--who may seem unremarkable--but end up being remarkable in their own, unique ways, that in real life, might not garner much attention. But we quickly learn the invaluable truth"" Every life is precious. And every life has a story to tell.Don't be surprised if a number of episodes has you reaching for a tissue or a hanky. There are many beautiful moments that will have you doing just that!The story implores people to think about how they treat others. To think about what is really important. We see our share of greedy, selfish, and vindictive people who clearly don't give a hoot about their fellow man. Even when that fellow man is a relative. The story begs us to prioritize and remember, not only WHAT is really important in life, but WHO!I was more than happy to see that the writers seemed to leave the door open for a second season. Ten episodes went by a little too quickly for me. But it's also a series that I loved so much that it invites repeated viewings.In short, the world desperately needs more shows like this one!"
608,Move to Heaven,"I wasn't sure what to expect going into this show, and this turned out to be one of those healing drama's that is really wholesome to watch. Acting is top-notch, great cinematography (perhaps due to netflix?) and a fitting soundtrack make this a great binge-watch. Lee Jehoon is a fantastic actor, and he gave me a very ""Klaus"" from the Umbrella Academy vibe in this show. Tang Joon-Sang is a new actor for me, and I was really impressed by his performance as the autistic nephew dealing with his father's death. I really loved the trauma-cleaner plot-line, it was interesting and definitely tugged at the heartstrings.Overall a very well done show and well worth a watch!"
609,Move to Heaven,"The title didn't recruit me, I'll admit. It looked to be one of those afterlife shows taking place in Heaven, or the like. The ratings were too good to be ignored, however. So I wagered my time on this contest, & so should you.In typical Kdrama fashion, they introduce people early on that are impossible to imagine caring for each other in a neutral corner.Geu-ru is a 20 y/o w/ Aspergers Syndrome. It's on the ADHD spectrum w/ bonus callenges. Aspergers victims are akin to fragile angels. They tend to be highly intelligent & focused on a narrow range of topics that captivate their interest. They have no social skills, no comprehension of non-verbal communication, body language, or other such subtleties. Innately pure, they would never understand stealing, cruelty, or even white lies. They don't have the resources to Roll with the Punches. Without proper oversight & gentle handling at home, they won't make it. Geu-ru's intellect will be the glove on the hand, preparing him for a counter punch.Geu-ru & his father are ""Trauma Cleaners."" Cleaning up crime scenes, the aftereffects of deaths occurring at businesses or other properties, and messy deaths, is what Trauma Cleaners do. But Geu-ru & Dad don't just clean. They respect the deceased. They also console the ""survived-bys"". Geu-ru and his father would determinedly follow the departed's wishes regarding dispersment of their worldly goods. Absent explicit instructions, detective Geu-ru pieces it together w/ the evidence at hand.Many of the early episodes are about the effort and care Ge-ru has adopted from his father's ways. Geu-ru is inspired & compelled to scry the deceased's wishes & carry them out, to the shock of the bereaved. These scenes are emotional. Don't get Caught Cold: Hankies out!🤧Geu-ru is suddenly left alone. His father had pre-bequeathed a domicile & occupation to his brother & Geu-ru's uncle, Sang-gu, as long as Unc cares for Geu-ru in dad's absence. Sang-gu is a Pugilist and a boxer who competes in underground fights. He's suffered a series of low blows in life. Just released from prison post an attempted murder sentence due to a tragedy in the ring, his life is On the Ropes.Geu-ru, unaware of the arrangements made by his father, had never met his uncle. Unannounced, Sang-gu arrives at the house one day. He takes a dive onto the couch, & demands a beverage. He's angry, impatient, flippant, & aggressive - the scary variety.Sang-gu must carry on the business w/ Geu-ru or he lose the income & the sofa (Geu-ru won't allow him in daddy's BR). Their first job together is cleanup of a corpse that had been there a while. The scene is... unpleasant. Sang-gu has the heaving & hurling reaction one might anticipate. It progresses from there.It's hilarious to drive w/ them for the 1st time. We'll just say that Sang-gu is not methodical like his brother. He's a brawler, in & out of the ring. Upon landing, Geu-ru cites every law Sang-gu had just violated, along w/ the fines & imprisonment levis, Sang-gu starts to see that he's moved, not to a house, but down the rabbit hole.Sang-gu additionally learns that he can't win a battle of the wills with Geu-ru. As he's rarely wrong, Geu-ru is, in essence, landing a Bolo Punch to Sang-gu's hard shell. It's starting to crumble.The distance characters must cover, to reach the main event and eventually unite, always makes the journey better. The bigger the better. In MTH, a vast one handed down to viewers.The main 3 characters did an excellent job. Tang Joon-sang, as Geu-ru, is authentic. In the same year, he starred in Racket Boys (an adorable show) playing a hot-headed & uber aggressive/competitive athlete. He is convincing in both roles, to his credit. Then there's Crash Landing On You. He's in that - a trifecta! (Don't miss CLOY, btw.)Lee Jehoon is fantastic as Sang-gu. I'd seen him effectively play a romantic lead, but he really dazzles in this sort of role. Did they speed up the camera for Sang-gu's punches, or is he actually that fast? He's ripped, too... Convincing body suit? I think not.He beats up people (all are in acute need of it) by slapping them, b/c as a boxer, he could be arrested for attempted murder again if he punches anyone. Given their power, fists of some boxers may be considered lethal weapons. Sang-gu forgets all of that when he schools that abuser, though. Dude hit a nerve, after all.There's no glass in Na-mu's jaw. Geu-ru's friend from across the street is played by Hong Seung-hee. Na-mu's a brawler herself; an indefatigable one. Ms Hong is an upstart with only 3 bouts on her card, but all of them are winners. So far, so good. In fact, having just finished Run On, in which she's part of the 2nd couple's story, her talent is evident. She steals the show along with her other half, in convincingly playing the ""poor"" little rich girl. She looks leaner, taller, & as hot as burning thermite. (Apparently, nothing burns hotter than thermite. It's a tad hyperbolic. Beauty is, as always, dependant on personal taste. Anyway, between the 2 roles she's barely recognizable).Having already been plagued by a twisted desire for Na-mu to hook up with Sang-gu in a season 2, I know see that Ms Hong's potential to rock Sang-gu's world is just ""Mama-said-knock-you-out."" Can you imagine how stunned he'd be, once he realizes that Na-mu would outmatch any ring girl? It writes itself. Oh please, please, bring it on! We should keep her in the family, shouldn't we? Given her competitive hostility toward him, it would be hilarious,. While the Ofr.'s who's been scouting her is a better man than Sang-gu - at the moment, she was quite tenderized by S1's final episode. Sang-gu should be a contender.The ending is oblique. Hopefully they are leaving an opening for a S2. More rounds with them is a good thing.Let's now take an intermission to evaluate proper treatment of those with special needs. In several scenes Geu-ru is misunderstood & mistreated. Sufferers of Aspergers are human beings, and being so, they long for postive interactions & relationships. The tragedy is that they are denied the skills to satiate this longing. For example, they are unable to make small talk, but they love to talk about their favorite topics, as with Geu-ru & fish.Ignorance begets fear. Modern day living does as well. Our innate 1st reaction when confronted with somebody different, is to recoil. Understandable, it's a dangerous world. Here's a challenge to help make the world a better place: Stop for a moment & assess. Whether you sense danger or not, utilize politeness. An ""Excuse me"" will do. If you recognize that this fellow human merely wants to talk about h/h favorite subject, be an angel & exchange a few smiley sentences. Watch their beleaguered guardians un-tense as warmth replaces protective anxiety. Always be safe, but also be decent.While Geu-ru has no obvious affliction at first glance, many precious humans do. We have friends w/ a severely disabled child, and it's obvious to spectators. I had the honor of escorting this little soul down the boardwalk one night. His parents never warned me about the looks. People blenched unpleasantly at the site of him. At least we were afforded the benefit of a wide berth, lest they get too close. Being taught when growing up, that every person is of same value, I was naively shocked - More than that, I was ready to slug someone, People will subconsciously act casually cruel. We all love us some Rainman... in a fictional tale. In real life? Give it some thought. Shining the spotlight on our repulsive behavior should be the cure. Seriously, who is truly repulsive in the prior scenario? Not me & my boy. Kindness is free. It costs you nothing, yet it provides life's highest rate of return.As this bout ends, we go to the Cards for a decision: Right before Sang-gu threw in the towel, Geu-ru calculated his final move for the win. Sang-gu hits the canvas in round 10. Geu-ru is the new champ.You'll also feel like a champion after spending time with this group; this family.Quote:

610,Move to Heaven,So refreshing to watch something with no political agenda. American movies are exhausting and tedious now. This was sad and beautiful.
611,Move to Heaven,"This is a great, stylish, delicate and powerful minimalistic series. It is beautifully written, directed and designed. It is such a shame that the absolutely terrible and unprofessional american accent dubbing 'actors' ruin it. I really do not understand why Netflix cannot improve on this. It's an embarrassment. Maybe use some more educated British accent actors and decent translators. Apart from that, this series is a little masterpiece."
612,Move to Heaven,"A very good serie. Respect how the stories are put together. It made me cry. Funerals always make me cry.😢every person is special and unique with its own story. Very well acted Tang Joon-Sang you can be proud of yourself. Of course also the other actors, actresses and people behind the scenes.🙂"
613,Move to Heaven,"I was really waiting a lot of from this drama. But it was just waste of time. The storyline wasn't focus on the relationship between the uncle and the child (which has perspectives to be better) and the plot was really predictable and sometimes boring. Also, after seeing the great performance of Oh Jeong-Se ,as Moon Sang Tae, in the kdrama ""It's okay ,not to be okay"", playing the autistic , Tang Joon-sang as Geu Ru in the drama ""Move to Heaven"" seems to be so bad acting. Moreover, all the supporting roles was just unnecessary as well as the first half of episodes with the stories of the customers which was so boring.The worst is that the high moment,the finale was so bad and I caught myself thinking ""what the h@ll was that?"""
614,Move to Heaven,"Expectation was high maybe it's because of after watched great tv shows. Just watched first 4 eps. Not too good so, decided to move on next tv series. Not bad, but little bit longy and not richful with fun parts or adrenalinely rush parts etc."
615,Move to Heaven,"The synopsis of the series didn't sound like it something I'd get in to, but after the first 1-2 episodes I was hooked in. Watching the backstories of the deceased unfold and how they ended up that way really hits you in the heart strings.Really loved all the characters in the show, especially Han Geu Ru.Would recommend."
616,Move to Heaven,Beautifully crafted story telling from South Korea. Though some might find it a tad weepy I found each episode to be satisfyingly cathartic and joyful. Loved every moment.
617,Move to Heaven,"Acting, script, movie pace is great. You will not be bored. Characters are smart and interesting and on the sidelines they touch deep emotional situations that are revealed along the main story.Nice humor too."
618,Move to Heaven,"The ongoing storyline unfolds in such a way as to remind us of the vagaries of life, and the fact that many of us are successful only through chance; while those who are less successful are often branded as lazy - when luck usually played a large part there too.The individual episodes are stand-alone, and tackle some really quite important and profound issues faced by us today. They do so in a beautiful, considered, and moving fashion, without seeming preachy.I did have some reservations about one of the main characters being presented as having ASD, but by and large the show developed to present his abilities growing through his strengths, and didn't overly dramatise the challenges he faced. It also normalised the relationships that he had with others as being just like every other relationship, instead of being a 'carer / person needing to be cared for' situation - which is still relatively new in mainstream TV."
619,Move to Heaven,"This was one drama that is so heart felt, emotional and moving. I cried a few times thats for sure. The 2 male leads really took hold of their characters and made it their own. The performance from each actors was so well done. I was just shocked that it ended at episode 10. I hope they have a season 2. If not it was well done. This is a must watch drama, if your a kdrama fan."
620,Move to Heaven,"This could have been so much better but for the glaring inconsistencies like, how, in that climactic scene, he finds his dad's phone in the uniform pocket - with the battery still charged? What about mom's birth and death dates?What happened to the fight organiser? (That would have been a fascinating story line to explore... what made her so evil and why was she under pressure?) Who was the girl in the final scene?Argh! So many questions!It's a 5-star only because of the premise. This series lacks the attention to detail and careful crafting of non-flix kdramas."
621,Move to Heaven,"I can't hold my tears back. I got so emotional during the season. I cried a few times. This is a pure real life drama series for me. I can identify myself in the position of the uncle, father & friend ( protectors ). My brother has the Kanner Syndrome a worser autism than the Asperger Syndrome. That's why I can relate to the drama series. I feel a kinda bond to it.The plot is creative and I wonder if it's a real life story. A father and his son with Asperger Syndrome are estate cleaners for deceased humans. They don't just clean up things and collect things for their family and relatives. They do such a wonderful job with a sense of humanity that flashes me. So many heartbreaking stories during the season. It's unbelievable sad and touching.The cast was very much unknown to me. I do love Korean art, but didn't recognized any actor. Furthermore I can tell they did an amazing job. Specially the actor Tang Joon-Sang who played the Asperger teenager made an impressive act. It felt so real to me. I really felt the sorrow and love.All I can say is if you're mature enough and maybe lost loved ones, then you should give this series a try. You won't regret it. I can't recommend it to younger people, cause they might not like it or go into the series with high expectations of silly dramatic thoughts. Move to Heaven is definitely not silly, it is well written and played. For me it's a 10/10 as I said i can relate to the entire story and got very emotional. I even thought about quit watching it to avoid more sadness to myself, but finished the series. I don't want to go into more details. Give it a go !"
622,Move to Heaven,"This is a clever concept, Here are many moving stories, beautifully photographed, and the series is almost excellent. But it is spoiled by some over-acting. I know that this is common in many Asian movies, and is widely accepted, but does not have to be the case. Look at the success of recent Korean movies which have won acting awards.. In this case, a little holding back, ""being"" the character instead of ""acting"" the character would have added two more stars.I understand that this series is made for Koreans and I can be accused of cultural elitism, but the fact is that it is being distributed world-wide on Netflix, where we are now regularly exposed to films and TV series from around the world. Standards are very high.Despite my reservations, I intend to watch all episodes.Edit: Maybe a little unfair. There are some fine performances here also. Geu Ru's father, Yoon Na Mu's father, the tailor - are all good and believable Sorry I cannot find the names of these actors."
623,Move to Heaven,Other kids have autistic that they have problems with their families even that they love you they'll always respect as family. But even they see you as different but is good will always be different because that's good.
624,Move to Heaven,"I like how this drama explores different social issues- it makes me more aware of them. From the abandonment of old people, LGBT to problems with overseas adoption, I've gained different perspectives after watching this drama.Lee Je-hoon's role is sexy, an outwardly cold man who is involved in illegal boxing, but has a soft side (though he likes to deny it). Tang Joon-sang plays his role well too. His acting as a mentally disabled kid seems natural. I enjoy watching the growth of the characters.However, the pace is sometimes too slow for me. I don't have the urge to keep watching the drama. Maybe the genre is not my type. I even wonder why are there still so many episodes left. So if there are many episodes of this instead of only 10, I might gave up."
625,Move to Heaven,"The story telling and writing in this programme is unbelievably amazing and realistic. The characters are fantastically written and acted out beautifully by the actors. I love this programme! I don't wanna give much away but even if you're not into Korean programmes it's the kind of programme you have to watch at least once in your life time!! I cried EVERY single episode as the characters were so easy to get attached too. Shout out to the actor who played the guy with alsperger's syndrome, he did a great job! The actor for the uncle did great too! All the actors did! I'm so glad I watched this, it was truly beautiful! I won't be able to get over this for weeks."
626,Move to Heaven,"I've been lately getting overwhelmed by Korean series on Netflix. One the best examples I can give is Move to Heaven. What brilliant drama it is! It really touches your heart, sometimes it breaks it, sometimes it heals.. A complete drama with all the ingredients needed for making an excellent series. A must watch for fans of all genre."
627,Move to Heaven,"To better understand a person is not easy. What we see is often not what is real. Look hard, look with attentiveness, look with good will, and we are able to share other's real self."
628,Move to Heaven,So touchy that I cry every episode.I loved the story of each single episode .Is very emotional and deep.
629,Move to Heaven,"Well... this kdrama starts okay and I had already read some reviews here so I thought that it has to be a masterpiece !BUTThe plot was soo predictable and almost all episodes was a different story that sometimes was getting more and more boring .The main boy was tried his best I think to lead and support his role but his acting skills wasn't the best at all :/
Also I believed that the neighbor will fallen in love with the uncle as they had a lot of scenes together and they had chemistry too .However this never happened and uncle was with a woman that comes after 6 ep. ( so disappointed) .What is more the plot after 5 ep was so boring and I struggled to finish it !!!Above all the last episode. IT WAS SO CONFUSING. In the last couple of minutes a girl appears who was so creepy , make the things even worstI don't really recommend this series and I think that it's too overrated."
630,Move to Heaven,"I cried every episode! In fact, I'm still crying while writing this review... It's currently the top-rated drama on MyDramaList and I can see why. Move To Heaven deserves a 12/10 for that beautiful writing. Move To Heaven is the best K-Drama for me so far. Baeksang Arts Awards 2022, I swear if you snub Move To Heaven, Imma start a riot lol just kidding but they deserve every award out there. This is what storytelling should be and Move To Heaven delivered it!"
631,Move to Heaven,"I was taken with this series from episode one. It was clear that the part of Han Geu-ru was not an easy one to play but Tang Joon-Sang does admirably. Korean dramas are quite fond of leading characters on the autism spectrum: The Good Doctor, Alice (Joo Won in both cases) and now this. No love story here to speak of for a nice change but a series of stories created by a former trauma cleaner. There is a sub plot but the main thrust of each story is the cleanup following traumatic death and those that do it. Each vignette has quite the powerful message conveyed through the fearsome logic of a 20 year-old Man born with Asbergers Syndrome. Get-ru's uncle moves in as his guardian following the death of the father. Together they run Move To Heaven and each story follows a traumatic death. On a personal note episode 5 following a rare gay love story for Korea had me in floods of tears, but all episodes are quite affecting."
632,Move to Heaven,"As with most Morgan e movies, it's filled with heart. I like English dubbed
At first I couldn't stand one of three main characters but after one or two episodes... I couldn't stop watching..I love Al three neck stories..all touching.. But after a while.. your heart is so full that ugly cries start. My poor dog was concerned and confused lol
Just be prepared."
633,Move to Heaven,Was not expecting it to be so good. Hope they do a second season. I'm about to watch the last episode. I couldn't stop watching it.Yesterday I watched 7 episodes back to back.Just keep a box of Kleenex handy for every episode.
634,Move to Heaven,"Those that haven't experience trauma or loss, or have no patience or introspection; just don't watch. Watch 1 episode, say it was boring and leave your 5-6 rating...For the rest of humanity, this is a beautiful story. If you have any feelings at all, be prepared to pause and cry. The occasional overacting and goofy translation, deal with it and ignore as there are so many amazing performances here and some really funny moments too.One of the best shows on Netflix without a doubt. The best thing I've ever seen come out of Korea, absolutely. I can't recommend this show enough."
635,Move to Heaven,"As someone else commented , this is a class act production/acting & one of the best in Kdrama series.This show is so unique, beautiful, touching, emotional, gentle, gut-wrenching and humanizing from beginning to the end. Episode 9, especially, really got to me and you know what I mean when you watch it and I hope that you do.When Kdramas are good, they are really good better than many US/international shows out there and thankfully their TV series are not always full of violence, gore, sex scenes or bad language. The good ones are just all about true storytelling and always thought provoking.I hope that there will be a 2nd season. This show deserves one."
636,Move to Heaven,It does not bore either excite you that much. The first time I heard about trauma cleaners and they made a good story behind it.
637,Move to Heaven,"I liked every thing about it the characters, the stories and their acting. The series is so soft and beautiful, I've enjoyed each moment watching it and can't wait for season 2."
638,Move to Heaven,"The story is basically telling you that no one actually die.. because the living will keep them alive in memories, or the items that reminded you of that person or what you learn from each other.. just beautiful.. i cry like there's no tomorrow.. but its so rewarding after finishing it. Great job to the production team and cast."
639,Move to Heaven,"The acting by this cast is brilliant. The stories are significant, inspiring, emotional and completely satisfying. It shook my heart from beginning to end. This series gives reverence and dignity to the living and the dead. It makes me want to have a yellow box worth collecting after I am gone. If only there was a business that would clean and clear out our possessions after we pass away with such compassion, awareness, intuition, intelligence, grace and interest to find our stories and be able to share them with the ones we love after we are gone, this world would be a better place. The writers did a great job with every character's storyline. The young man being on the spectrum, could have the ability to be more organized and focused, have an almost eidetic memory, be determined to complete tasks and make meaningful connections. The guardian is portrayed as rough and tough on the outside, but we learn about the traumas he has endured and experienced throughout his life. We see how we might judge people based on first impressions, but once the whole story is revealed, all of the perceptions will change. The guardian becomes one of my favorite characters. The neighbor is a young woman who is determined to protect her friend that she has loved since they were 6 years old. She is courageous and resolute in this purpose. These three people become the perfect trio to run the business. The father lives for his son. He loves his family more than his own life and is the ideal father, husband and human being. The entire cast is brilliant and interesting. I hope the whole world will watch this series and think about their loved ones and connect with them and communicate how they feel, so they will not have to live, or die with regrets."
640,Move to Heaven,"Netflix once again continues to narrow the gap between often cliched Korean TV drama and the very high storytelling/production standards set by Korean cinema. This is an intriguing and life affirming original series about the end of life. In so many shows, we see people die but we never find out what happens after that. This refreshing series tells us some of their stories and is a gem in scriptwriting. Every heartwarming or heart wrenching episode is wonderfully acted by the talented cast and from the get go, you care about each one you meet. I cried a tissue box while binge watching the series and can't wait for Season 2..."
641,Move to Heaven,"Netflix's Move to Heaven is an unexpected gem, one of the best dramas produced from South-Korea, told in a realistic and wonderful way, unique and very original Korean drama, and will truly appeal to a global audience.Originality, sincerity and universal values are what makes Korean dramas produced by Netflix stand out compared to the regular Korean dramas which are still very catered to the local audience. From Kingdom, to Love Alarm, to Sweet Home and now Move to Heaven. All amazing pieces of art that are unique and very original.The story centers around trauma cleaners, who are people who clean up and move stuff of the deceased. This explains the title of this drama: Move to Heaven. It is also the name of their company. In 10 episodes we see multiple story arcs evolving, including those of the main characters Han Geu-ru played amazingly by Tang Jun-sang and his uncle Cho Sang-gu. We see very relevant social themes being addressed by the trauma cleaners, all in a very sincere, realistic and emotional way. Keep your tissue box ready though!A special shout-out to Tang Jun-sang for his epic performance and realistic portrayal of the Asperger syndrome and for connecting the different story lines. His character is smart, remembers everything, connects the dots, and speaks like a robot. It is something that viewers will not easily forget.Han Geu-ru was told to tell himself every day in the mirror that he did an excellent job. I can only agree, and would like to extend this to the whole show. You did an excellent job!"
642,Move to Heaven,"There's not a single episode where I didn't cry, I love all of the deceased back stories and the acting of the two main leads is incredible. The script is one of the best I've seen this year! Definitely Worth Watching!"
643,Move to Heaven,"So much tears.... I've cried a lot when watching this series. The grief and how all the character cope and fight their trauma really touch my heart. There's always been a hidden story in every death and grief. This series remind us how to appreciate our lives, how to move on, and especially how we valued the time and memories with our loved ones.All the actor potray the character very well. Their acting skill so great and so emotional that made me so broken-hearted and relate with their emotion."
644,Move to Heaven,"After thriller drama,it's a must-watch to refresh & calm your mind. Such a heartwarming drama."
645,Move to Heaven,"The father and son formed a trauma cleaning company called ""Move to Heaven"". They clean up after the dead and sort out the worldly items they left behind. In the process, they tried to piece the story and last wishes of the dead and gave them a respectful closure. This drama reminds me of the Japanese movie ""The Departures"", which I really liked.Every episode is a subplot on societal issues: elderly with dementia, same sex love, crime of passion, adopted Korean babies who fell through the cracks of the society etc. You can say there's a lot going on in the show and due to the limited screen time, some of the subplots may feel like they end abruptly.The show helps us understand Asperger Syndrome through the male protagonist - the son in the cleaning company. It also demonstrates how a wayward person discovers a meaningful mission in his life, and grows to be a more wholesome person (the male protagonist's uncle). Other life lessons: closure for the surviving loved ones, regrets (which teaches the audience not to have regrets like the characters!), and the power of healing.It's not a heavy nor overly sentimental drama till it feels contrived. It's a show that warms the hearts. It's easily one of the best dramas in 2021!"
646,Move to Heaven,"Such a beautiful moving series. Like other reviewers moved me to tears. Such great acting, storytelling and the music just added to the overall theme. Wonderfully done in such a touching heartfelt way."
647,Move to Heaven,Best K-Drama I have seen. I wasn't sure what to expect from the series description but thought I'd give it a go and was very pleasantly surprised. Great central story about the relationship between the nephew and his uncle. All the other touching interwoven stories were great. The way they covered the main character's back stories. It was so well written with great characterisation. I'm not really one for waterworks but produced tears for many episodes and actually sobbed for some.
648,Move to Heaven,"Apprehensive at first, but I must say the South Korean film industry is doing a remarkable job creating movies and Series. This show has a good flow in terms of timing, it's quiet, provides a different perspective on loss that most people don't think about, emotions are played well by the actors and actresses (there are some cheesy moments), plot is organized enough to put the pieces together, music is perfect, and panning and camera angles are pretty decent. This is a good show!"
649,Move to Heaven,"I've watched a fair few kdrama's in my time.With most, I've found myself getting bored, yet obligated to stick with it.I can tell you now, this is definitely my favourite kdrama.I didn't have any expectations of this when I put it one one evening. I just wanted to watch something easy.I absolutely fell in love with the characters. I felt myself craving this show, I watched as much as I possibly could in few sittings. I've never experienced that with any kdrama I've ever watched.The acting is absolutely fantastic.I found myself laughing and crying in every single episode.I sobbed at the end.... I really wished that this went on for longer. Though, there is some clue that there may be another season. I will keep an eye out for it if so.I would thoroughly recommend this 10/10."
650,Move to Heaven,"Ahh it's just full of emotions made me cry so much, the story of this series is really unique and every story for each person made me think a lot.. worth your time believe me 👍🏻"
651,Move to Heaven,"The second I finished episode 1, I knew this was a quality show and I was not disappointed by the rest of the series. The story line is well thought out, and I enjoyed the writing style very much. An excellent job done by each and every one of the actors in this series. And not to mention, this has one of the most perfect endings that actually gives closure, once again worthy of praise. I would also be content with or without a season 2; what kind of show is able to do that???!! Each character was unique, and the character development was amazing, especially that of Sang-gu. An absolute hidden gem and I would recommend this series to anyone."
652,Move to Heaven,I usually go by imdb rating for all shows and this one stood out because had good rating and of course it was worth it.The whole idea and concept is new and you get so attached with every single story.It gave you an idea of every genere of death and beautifully explained the stories.The main characters played really well i loved this show on the whole just beautiful and has definitely showed what they wanted to say.It is worth 10 for every single ep.
653,Move to Heaven,"This remind me of Midnight Diner, if the Master listened to his customer's stories. Move to Heaven try to listen what the deceased through their belongings and it is sooo beautiful. It's another level of family drama and it tells a story that a child with disability like asperger syndrome, can fit in in the society with the right cognitive taught and love. I loveeee this series and finished overnight, I need more stories like this. The acting, the set, the plot, the vibe all perfect💛✨"
654,Move to Heaven,Absolutely brilliant theme that I've never come across before. I was instantly hooked with Episode1. Episode 5 absolutely ripped my heart out 💔 One of the best series I've ever watched! 👏⭐💯
655,Move to Heaven,U must watch this series due to the story telling way of this it. Many stories are scattered but coupled perfectly by the flow of the series.Giving rating 8 and deducting 2 points due to some end episodes. It could have more perfect as from starting it set that much of high expectations.
656,Move to Heaven,"This is the first time I am writing a review on IMDb. I couldn't help but write my feelings about this show because it has left an incredible feeling with me. When I first saw the trailer a couple weeks ago I immediately became emotional by the story and knew I was going to like it very much. It turned out much better than I'd expected.First of all, the story centers around the funny yet heartwarming story between a very irresponsible and ""bad"" guy who has been appointed to look after his nephew he's never seen before, who is mentally disabled.What I love the most about this show is that throughout the story, the two main characters create a very intimate and heartwarming relationship which changes both of their characters. Geu-ru learns to adapt to life after his deceased father while Su-cheol learns to become an uncle and change for the better every single day. They become each other's family.The second incredible thing about this story is the very interesting job they have: trauma cleaners. Every episode we get to witness the stories left behind deceased people and as taught by the main character, we learn to ""listen to their stories"". Every single one of these stories are emotional and full of life lessons.The show teaches you to look beyond what is visible on the surface. It makes you want to empathize with other people to understand their feelings, their hopes, their failures and the good and bad they've been through. You go through a process of healing with these stories and seeing the characters change for the better, excepting their faults and finding condolence from each other warms your heart.I couldn't help my tears in almost every episode of this show. The only downside is that it is only 10 episode. Now that I have finished watching it, I feel like I am saying goodbye to friends. It is such a sincere show. Don't even hesitate to give it a try. Definitely one of the BEST k-dramas I have ever seen."
657,Move to Heaven,"Couldn't stop crying through the episodes! I love the way this directed very very very well...this story made me believe to stay kind give me more reason to live life beautifully...
Thank you to all cast and crew. This is a heartwarming ."
658,Move to Heaven,The message this series sends is to think of the people around us. Our beloved once. What do they mean to us and what do we mean to them. Are we showing them and telling them how we feel about them.Or are we always hiding things and ourselves from whom we love ?!
659,Move to Heaven,"If your looking for a kdrama that will make you cry i really recommend this one. Amazing acting, writing and directing. Its so intresting and heart wrenching to watch i even got me mom into it witch suprised me because she usually never wathes kdramas with with me not to mention Tang Jun-Sang who played Geu-ru his acting was very impressive since the role he was playing was defintly not an easy one he did a really great job! The plot as well is unique and not like other kdramas so if your doubting whether to watch it or not you should you will not be left disappointed defintly not if you want a good cry!"
660,Move to Heaven,"One of, if not the best kdrama I've watched. Wonderful writing, acting, directing, editing, cinematography, casting -- but most of all beautiful stories told and characters molded in little time (relatively shorter than most kdramas).Shows the beauty, the good, and the love behind every person and will have us second-guessing and postponing our prejudice.Wonderful use of Trauma Cleaning and Asperger's Syndrome as a plot.Much of the storyline has been resolved by the end of the season so I'm not looking forward to a second but they have good foundations in characters and framework unlike most kdramas so I think there's potential."
661,Move to Heaven,"I am usually one to complain that most Korean dramas and unnecessary long and have at least 3-5 filler episodes that serve no purpose to the plot but in the case of 'Move to Heaven' I am quite on the opposite opinion. Ten episodes with Sang Gu, Geuru and Namoo were simply not enough. The 'found family' trope is a personal favourite of mine and seeing the relationship development between these three had me binge watching. The MTH clients' stories were also compelling and poignant. The cinematography, the music, the acting.. everything was in perfect synchrony. The very last scene got my hopes up for a second season."
662,Move to Heaven,"I love watching series no matter what country they produced such as USA, UK, Japan etc. This series is quite different , unique storyline. Even though I feel like this is categorized as a drama but the film tell so fast and meaningful in every part. I don't want this series to end, hope that it will continue to produce next season soon."
663,Move to Heaven,"It's hard not to appreciate this series, one of the best series I have watched in a long time. If only everyone could model the leading character's spirit, the world would be in a better place."
664,Move to Heaven,"I literally had to shut my bedroom door to watch this TV show. I could not allow my housemates see me like this. This show was done so well that it kept me wanting more. Every single episode kept the Kleenex box so busy that I went through a few boxes with the whole season. Lastly, this series will bring forth feelings that you never thought you had.I recommended this to my friends. Most of them watched is and said that they had a similar experience as I did.As for a season 2? No, I cannot imagine a season 2 to be this good."
665,Move to Heaven,"Please, please, please give Move To Heaven a chance. It is most definitely my top favorite K-drama of 2021. The cast simply did a fantastic job playing their respective roles and told the overall plot/story so beautifully. Loved how every episode had a different tale of the deceased talked about. I cried a ton so have tissues near and handy. Tang Joon Sang is not on the spectrum and is much younger in real life but embodied Geu Ru so well. As someone who is autistic, he played the role of someone who truly had this disability very realistically. Also, just because someone has a disability does not mean they can't do things. Anyone is capable of anything they want to do when one simply has the goal and motivation to. After this drama, he is going to get bigger roles because of taking the chance with this one. I'm looking forward to his next role. Lee Jee Hoon is so very TALENTED and I highly recommend you watch his recently aired drama Taxi Driver because that's where I first discovered him and was swooned by his acting! Anyways, please watch this drama because you will not regret it!!"
666,Move to Heaven,"This drama is going to be so close to my heart :"")
I urge everyone to please give this a watch
Whether you watch kdramas or no
This is the kind of drama which teaches you so much:"")
Every person in your life has a purpose, respect them, cherish them, enjoy every bit of the time spent with them. :"")
The story is about a young boy with Asperger syndrome and his uncle who work as trauma cleaners, clearing out the possessions of dead people, uncovering the stories they left behind and telling them to loved ones.The series is all about emotions and feelings, especially, empathy towards the deceased who are no more in the world yet they have left their own messages to their loved once.The way the story started the way it went forward every bit of it just leaves such a huge impact :"")
10 episodes and each of the 10 episodes made me go through such a roller coaster of emotions :"")I don't understand how this drama has been so underrated and why aren't people watching it :"")
You're definitely missing out on something so beautiful
Please go watch ""move to heaven""
Much love and respect to the whole team of this drama :"")"
667,Move to Heaven,"This was an emotional ride with every singel emotion known ... I have probably cried every singel type of tear i know of.... so to say I was touched is an understatement.This drama also taught me that even dead people communicate, we just have to listen and observe the objects they leave behind and that as long as some one is in your memory you will never be alone... kind of creepy but sweet and comforting."
668,Move to Heaven,"As an Asperger person I can relate and this says that the writer really understand's Asperger. There are many individuals stories each with their own meaning. The attention to detail is insane, although I found an exaggeration. There's a subtle thing that confuses me, why are they use these old smartphones? Highly recommend!(Sorry for any spelling mistakes)"
669,Move to Heaven,Form the first episode this drama was so emotional. I wasn't excepting something so nice and sweet. You wont be disappointed and the last scene let us believe that they'll be a second season!!!!!
670,Move to Heaven,"From begining to ending every scene has tremendous job it makes me so emotion also it is my first kdrama by this drama my perspective about korea is change they are same like indians ,, so emotional."
671,Move to Heaven,I've seen many korean and non korean shows and Move To Heaven is totally different. It has 10 episodes which is considered short but to me nothing was left out. Each of the characters has their own life story that shows us so many things like how misunderstandings can cause a big regret for someone. One of the main things that is shown is the fact that we live in a society where everyone has problems but there are things that we can do in order to help them or make things easier. The cinematography is also incredible we can feel character's emotions by looking at the location and lightening. Don't miss this show:)
672,Move to Heaven,ME ENCANTO LA HISTORIA Y MAS ME IMPACTO QUE ESTA BASADA EN UN LIBRO. DE VERDAD LA RECOMIENDO TODOS LOS CAPITULOS TIENE MUCHO MENSAJE. NEXFLIX SE VOLO LA BARDA. LOS ACTORES MUY BIEN TODOS Y LA PRODUCCION SUPER Y LA FOTOGRAFIA OMG. GRACIAS POR ESTA HISTORIA.
673,Move to Heaven,Is a movie series from Korea That gives the audience a wide variety of feelings from their viewing Stories that talk about the meaning of life Relationships and memories Which only those who have watched will understand the essence What the movie wants to convey.
674,Move to Heaven,"I really love this drama, it have funny, touching & sad part. I really enjoy watch this, and I finiah all episode in 1 day. Really worth it to watch, please Netflix make season 2.. 😊"
675,Move to Heaven,"I was invested on watching this Netflix show because the lead actor played in Crash Landing On You. He was a promising actor after watching him in that said show. So I would like to see more of his acting skills and to my surprise, HE WAS A PHENOMENAL actor. He indeed gave justice to the role of a teen with Asperger's Syndrome. This show has led me to read about it. Other actors did so well, too. Each episode never fails to deliver quality acting! What makes this show a stand out is they acknowledged love beyond genders. Great job to all who created this masterpiece! A must-watch! Congratulations, everyone!"
676,Move to Heaven,"How beautiful of a drama can come from an essay, this drama shows it all. Who knew a work like this ever existed? The set up of different premises touching different demographic was a fresh take. When you pick a drama with a title as this, You have to be prepared for what might come next. Yes, it was heart breaking yet beautiful to certain points. I have always admired Lee Je-hoon's acting and his pick at the character he plays. He doesn't disappoint in this either.I feel 9/10 because the need for the push of storyline in the boxer side with the boss lady was bit of a stretch. It might have worked without it also."
677,Move to Heaven,This kdrama made me ugly cry in each episodes you should give it a try!!
678,Move to Heaven,"Unexpectedly loved this show! What a great show! Can't wait for the next season! So creative and full of great inner stories. I didn't know what to expect with this show, but I ended up loving it. I would totally recommend it!"
679,Move to Heaven,"The journal of death is oftentimes being overshadowed by grief and pain.. but Move to Heaven was able to show to its viewer how death is not the end especially for those who are left behind.The story does not only centers on the main lead which is not common particularly in k-dramas. Move to Heaven is on a different level. Honestly, I watched this drama without even having any idea who are the actors. But after episode 1, I was prompted to search the actor portraying Han Geuru.Tang Joon-sang portrayal is just so pure to the point that you would forget that he is just another fictional character. I was more surprise to learn that he is even younger than his character. Lee je-hoon is a legue of his own.I will be rooting for Tang-Joon sang.This is the first and only drama that my whole family watched together. Given our varied preferences of genre. Move to Heaven has left a special place in our hears."
680,Move to Heaven,"Wow, I Thought Sisphous great. This show was touching. Love the concept. Squid Game is ok compared to Move to heaven. I love the back stories really fits for me. The show goes very deep with it relationship. Well put together love to see how far they can go ..."
681,Move to Heaven,"I have experienced a lot of feelings in this drama sad, regret, mercy, and how death can be a bless.+ u can watch it with ur family there is some violent scenes but no sexIt breaks my heart."
682,Move to Heaven,"The storytelling is amazing. Also, I've never cried so hard in my life-every episode."
683,Move to Heaven,I cried all the episodes. I loved it! It was very emotional and beautiful.
684,Move to Heaven,"Very emotional. The concept is original and the series is well-made.I am not a big fan of drama genre but this is so meaningful. It makes me to learn to appreciate what I have and who I have, because the future can take it all."
685,Move to Heaven,"Not too often when each succeeding episode continue to hold you and can actually meet the expectations of the prior ones. Culturally interesting as well! Add to that the unique lead character, to outstanding supporting actors and even better script, I couldn't stop watching them. Why tell you about it, when 2 episodes are finished and you're not hooked, I can only fathom that you don't like subtitles! :-) Can't wait for the second season!!"

772,Navillera,Promising at first. An old man who wants to do ballet and a young dancer form an affecting friendship. The problem is there was too much about the old man's Alzheimer's and not enough about the young man's dancing. The focus should have been more on the dancer's career instead of illness. The obstacles like the young man's injury and family opposition for the old man felt cliched and forced. The back stories of each one and family history were interesting at first then were draggy. 12 episodes was too much. 10 would have sufficed.Some good points. Expert blending of Song Kang and a body double dancer so that it looked like he really was dancing. He got into shape and practiced for the role and it shows.
773,Navillera,"Korean Drama ""Navillera"" is a bittersweet story about an unusual friendship.The drama starts slowly, with a simple plot prompt: an elder wants to learn how to dance ballet, the ballerino who is forced to teach him doesn't really want to. From then the drama builds up the melodrama element, adding family drama here and there, a few twists, and then finally it let things come together and creates a puzzle of a heartbreaking story and a strong, warm friendship.What, however, makes the drama even more special are the performances and the dancing scenes that were perfectly executed. The atmosphere was nicely created with the settings and a suitable soundtrack that was simple, melodic and in the background, creating a more intense drama. The pace was perfect as well and, fortunately, the drama didn't overdo it with the length and it ended when it was needed.So, overall, nine out of ten."
774,Navillera,"Much like the image of the butterfly and the soul in poetry and art, this series is superb, sweet, and compassionate with the grace and elegance of ballet as the frame for the deeply touching real story. The cast, direction, cinematography, and writing are outstanding: not a misstep anywhere as all involved work to tell the story of discovery, friendship, love, support, forgiveness, and healing. Filmed with such love and gentleness, this is one of Korea's finest series in its relatively short but brilliant history. Strongly recommended."
775,Navillera,A ballet dancing protégé ends up reluctantly training an old man in his dream of learning to dance Swan lake. Soon they begin to learn life lessons from each other. Heartwarming story even if a bit formulaic.
776,Navillera,"The story is simple about young ballet dancer Chae-rok who starts to teach elder man Deok-chul. I didnt think it was my type, as it started slow, but then suddenly I was too attached to the main characters, especially the dynamic between Chae-rok and Deok-chul. The acting is really good, especially Song Kang. And so, he almost becomes a father figure to Chae-rok, in a touching way, he is better father figure than his own father. ""Even if you dont remember me, I'll remember you"" must be one of my favorite lines ever here, and totally sobbed at the scene.I think there was some plot flaws, of course, and wished the situation of Chae-rok's father was explained, or why he suddenly left at the ending (for a competition i think? It wasnt really explained..)The last episodes were better, and more emotional. It was heartbreaking to watch Deok-chul lose his memory an try remember ballet. The last performance was wonderful, and ending emotional. I wish were more to their meeting, and maybe see the show, but it was still beautiful ending."
777,Navillera,A rewarding drama with considerable emotional heft. The unlikely relationship at the centre of this series never felt forced or false.Well worth the watch.
778,Navillera,"The aged ""Mr. Sim"" is a loving grandfather in a touching tale about an old man's battle to fulfil his frustrated childhood ambition to learn Ballet, but Mr. Sim, in his battle to find his most cherished desires becomes an unwitting agent of change for almost e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y around him. The nice thing about this human drama is that no actor stands out too far from the crew, though all make a genuine contribution to presenting the audience with this sometimes sad but often heart-warming tale."
779,Navillera,"A very nice story. Touching to see. Something different from other series. I could already see from the notebook at some point and that he forgot things, where this was going. Losing yourself and not recognizing others. I think this is terrible. Well played everyone, applause!"
780,Navillera,"A touchy and heartwarming story about an unusual friendship between a young boy and an old man. Awesome performances from all the cast. Great moral messages about dreams, love, friends and family relationships. A totally must watch kdrama!"
781,Navillera,"Heartwarming story of a friendship and care being developed between a young man and an old one.Never give up on your dreams no matter what, is the 1st message.Talent with no hard work and practice is not enough to win, is the 2nd message.Forgiveness and understanding warms and heals people's hearts, is the 3rd message.What can I say about this MASTERPIECE!!! I am speechless!!!The 2 leads were performing so amazingly that they were capturing the screen and our hearts! Park In-Hwan was so great!!!! Song Kang (OMG!!!) was stunning, a God of acting and beauty!!! I admired him for his versatility and his skills!!!The aesthetics of this series in the ballet scenes was out of this world!!! I loved them especially in the last episode, where I watched them again and again!!!I have seen about 90 kdrama series so far, and this one is definitely now one of my top favorites in my list.Very well done to all cast, director, script writer and the rest crew. You all did a great job! :)"
782,Navillera,"No spoilers here, but this excellent series is even more well-done than most Korean dramas. It puts American TV to shame. I don't give many ""10"" scores but this one effortlessly earns it. Acting, story, staging, music ... this one scores in every category. Not to be missed."
783,Navillera,"This is the only Kdrama in which I cried on all episodes! Bravo, Song Kang (Chae-Rok) and Park In-wan (Shim Deok-chul)! You both deserve awards for this drama.I am truly impressed on how all the actors delivered their characters magnificently!Massive salute to the Director, Han Dong-hwa and Screenwriter Lee Eun-mi!10/10 without a doubt! Highly recommended!Grand jeté! 💞
Soar high, everyone!!! 💙"
784,Navillera,Just finished watching the last episode with tears in my eyes but also with the biggest grin. It was a very satisfying ending to a beautifully done story of a man achieving his dream long after an age when most wouldn't even begin trying. The love and respect between the teacher and student is obvious but so is the love of family and friends. A great family show that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.
785,Navillera,"If you loved Dear My Friends (2016), you're gonna love this one. It's good to see a male ballet dancer being the protagonist for a change. I had to present a project on Alzheimer's disease and it's genetic component last year. I instinctively studied Alzheimer's and made a cool project. I even discussed Alzheimer's with my assessor quite matter-of-factly. I actually looked up some case studies on Alzheimer's and dementia but I had never felt what an Alzheimer's patient probably feels, so closely. It must be heart-wrenching."
786,Navillera,Im speechless.. i don't like much korean drama but this one caught my attention and this old man touch my heart.. ready your tissue if you watch this..
787,Navillera,"Amazing story, the acting is great, you can feel both main characters dreams! You can definitely enjoy this show."
788,Navillera,I have to say that this drama has moved into my top 3 favorite shows. I can't wait to see the next show and I find myself becoming more and more emotional with the development of Lee Chae Rok and Shim Deok Chul's heartwarming relationship. The director Dong-Hwa Han should be given a standing ovation as well as an academy award in my opinion. I look forward to seeing many more shows by this amazing director and awesome writers Lee Eun-Mi and Hun. The cast is also academy award worthy. They work so well together.... outstanding job of cast choice!
789,Navillera,"A beautiful story told in a beautiful way. I really enjoyed watching this programming regardless of my lack of interest in ballet. I thought I wouldn't enjoy it since ballet doesn't pique my interest. The acting was good, the cinematography was good, the cast was good and the directing was good. Everything was good!! Some parts were quite emotional and very well executed!!"
790,Navillera,"This is not typical romantic story, or typical K-Drama. It carries heavy message. I hope lots of people will watch this series. It will help to understand about people, dream, passion, support, family, humanity, love and all kind of emotions feelings well explained and directed. Thank you for this 2 main actors. They nailed it. Everyone have rights soar , can soar. Navillera."
791,Navillera,"This kdrama is one of my favourites , I have just ended it and I feel so blessed that I choose such a brilliant kdrama to watch this period of my life !To begin with ,the soundtrack is so cute and emotional ,also the direction is top!Song-kang act soo good for his age and all the cast play fantastic too
There are a lot of emotional moments that made me almost cry and I totally felt every character !Finally it offers good messages to the viewers that everyone has a dream and should never stop believing in it .The only thing that prevents me from rate this masterpiece with 9/10 is because the last ep was somehow boring but nevermind i totally recomend ''Nabillera'' to everyone !! It totally worth watching it."
792,Navillera,"I usually give a longer review. However «Navillera» needs just two words... beautiful and touching. Just watch and enjoy every episode!Ps. If you shed some tears while watching, that makes your session complete."
793,Navillera,"Words fail me for how beautiful this show is. It combines two aspects that have touched my life greatly at one time or another, the first being ballet -- I danced as a kid, but had to give it up due to my own disability -- and dementia -- something which has affected my grandmother for many years now. This is the most honest portrayal of dementia I have ever seen on screen, which made it heartbreaking at times, and I cried through various episodes, but that only lends to the power of this show. Truly magical. Park In-Hwan and Song Kang have done a fantastic job playing these two men. I can't say enough."
794,Navillera,"This is the first Korean series I have watched. I was drawn to it because of the ballet. It turned out that there really isn't that much ballet in this drama but I kept watching because I really felt for all the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them. However, I feel that the series was too drawn out and could have been told just as successfully with fewer and shorter episodes."
795,Navillera,"Although I'm not very interested in ballet, this doesn't matter in that drama. I thought it would be just another ""you can reach everything if you try"" series, but it's so much more and ballet and dance is just like a platform for a really big story. I cried tears in the last episode and I swear, I don't do that in many occasions. You must see that drama.And thanks to all actors especially the two main characters, who did an Oscar-worth job."
796,Navillera,"Almost immediately, the characters are introduced and from then on it is a heart wrenching story of challenge, rising from the ashes and maybe being born anew.I think it teaches us that what we love in life is far more important than what others think we need. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time."
797,Navillera,"Why did I upgrade from a 9/10 to a 10/10? Because this series deserves all of it. I am still very emotional when I think of it and honestly I do not believe this Series? Movie? Could be done any better than it was. The Chemistry between the two Leads is incredible, the lessons you will learn are important! Your life will be made better and your heart will be moved when you watch this. Do not miss out!"
798,Navillera,"One of the best dramas I have seen. Is a reminder never to let go of your dreams no matter how old you are, it is inspiring and so beautiful.Had me crying so many times, specially touching as someone in my family suffered from dementia.You can't miss going on this journey with Duk-Chol.Thanks for making this wonderful show."
799,Navillera,"Gives you that feel good vibe, also inspiring, gets you emotional and helps you appreciate the work behind the scenes of a successful ballerina! The story actually made me want to stay more in touch with my mum."
800,Navillera,What an incredible acting! I knew that koreans are good artists but the performances of In-Hwan Park and Song Kang are worthy of a Golden Globe. I waited until the last episode to write this review. This is an amazing drama about life itself from the very beginning to the end. This series made me cry and I must point out that I am not an emotional person.
801,Navillera,It touches my heart and soul. And it is nice to watch that older people can still act very well.
802,Navillera,"I came across this by accident. It turned out to be perfect and better than I expected.It made me laugh, smile, get really angry and cry.I thought about myself and what my passion is, my parents and how grateful I am for them. How I'll be growing this much old.Just great. I recommend it. Highly."
803,Navillera,"I cannot believe how much I cried with this drama. I was probably in tears every single episode. Each of the characters has a struggle and a story of their own, and the series could not have told these stories any better than it did. Having said this, if the prospect of a depressing drama concerns you, worry not! I laughed a lot too -- deep down this drama is quite lighthearted and uplifting. The ending was also very satisfying, with all subnarratives coming to a natural resolution by the end. Definitely recommend!"
804,Navillera,"Look, the fact that I took time to write this review because I never thought that giving review is important.......This is a must watch!!This is not a romance, comedy or whatever genre that you probably used to for a Kdrama. It's a really simple and relaxing drama. I mean, it brings me to tears a lot but I don't wanna say it's a sad story. It's just a beautiful story!!Oh my god, if I can erase my memory for a movie/series so I can rewatch it again without knowing the entire story, this is it. This is really it.Sad that I can not rate it more than 10 score!!"
805,Navillera,"Only for the most sensitive and aware of the young. Definitely for mature folk and those parents sandwiched between children and older parents.Draaags in parts...but do not stop watching, fast forward if need be but do not give up on series. You will be glad, and thankful, that you watched the entire series."
806,Navillera,From Canada français. For purist It is not perfect but who cares it is full of tenderness and love. We really enjoy this serie. Hope that Netflix could translate more Korean show in french.
807,Navillera,"This series becomes my top 2 favourite kdrama of all time - wondering why the overall rating is 8.8 because it should 9/10
I just love how they executed it and the casts are so good. I will surely recommend this to my friends."
808,Navillera,"1.) They picked the cutest old man for this roleI really almost could not finish this series because of the emotions it made me feel. I was in tears.It took me through the full spectrum: Inspiration, joy, sadness, grief, and hope. I felt a longing for family or the familial in a very visceral way.2.) They picked the cutest youngin' for the roleThere is a beautiful juxtaposition between youth and age. Being at the peak of youth and sunsetting after well after you prime. It was poetic watching the two main characters interact, feed each other, motivating each other, and the ultimate take away for me:You can learn at every stage of your life, that family/security is important, and that it is never too late to dream.10/10 recommended."
809,Navillera,"It's great to see this show give me the biggest motivation to keep trying, even if it fails so many times, and there's Another opportunity at any time and at any age I was, whether you were young, that an old man and that motivation and dream existed, so take this opportunity and do not lose it at all costs, and no matter how bad the circumstances, I advise everyone to watch it in order to be aware of life and not to waste his time on trivial things. I hope that my comment reached you even a little bit of the idea of the series (remember: Keep fighting and have a good time)"
810,Navillera,I wish more people would watch this drama. It's not a typical romantic or action series which interest the majority but the story alone can move anyone cuz it's so heart-warming and touching. Plus the acting is superb.
811,Navillera,Again I find myself offering an opinion for the 2nd? Maybe 3rd time.Not being a Ballet fan I thoought...But I felt the characters and the dancing were absolutely beautiful and was well worth the watch.
812,Navillera,"I finished this series last night. I must admit I am a K-drama addict as most are well written, well acted and extremely moving. This one tops out in all regards. It can touch any age group above pubescence. The actors are amazing. The screenplay gracefully moves through the lives of family and their friends and nemesis. I laughed, got angry and cried throughout the show. The cinematography is elegant and beautiful. My words are woefully inadequate."
813,Navillera,"I really loved this drama, the chemistry between the two main characters was more than I expected. The history was beautiful made, and I clearly can recommend if you want to cry a little bit, one of my favorite so far."
814,Navillera,"If you think this would be a boring drama so decided not to try it, you are missing out one of the best K drama.Can't recommend it More!!!Not only it is heartwarming feel good drama that would make you smile and crackle so many times, it's also heart-breaking in such a beautiful way.Acting is superb... can't find better actors, actresses for this drama. Casting was amazing even to every supporting roles.Park Inhwan (grandpa) is just one of THE best K actor, He is 76, huge respect for him as he said in the later interview that he needed lot of courage before accepting this role thinking he might not do well but he couldnt have done a better job!!!! Thank God he accepted this role. Such an inspiring character, he kept it alive and so realistic yet with such a huge charm... you will fall in love with him!First time seeing Songkang and he impressed me so much with his acting and beautiful ballet scenery he created (he actually learned ballet for 6 months just for this drama)Love a drama with every supporting roles aren't just simple one dimentional character. Awesome realistic acting.Unique, heartwarming drama with beautiful, emotional yet realistic storyline, exquisite yet not overpowering, amazing cinematography, incredible acting, PERFECT from beginning to the end...Just Watch it!!! You wont regret it!"
815,Navillera,"I would like to thank all whoever worked on this master piece ✨ utterly beautiful story
A Must watch drama."
816,Navillera,Absolutely beautiful show wih amazing casting and well written story... each episode leaves us with wanting more to warm our hearts.. simplicity is the essence of this drama and yet it touches the heart.
817,Navillera,"What can I say about this beautiful masterpiece of a drama? I usually do not cry. However, this drama brought me to tears multiple times.I like watching K-dramas and dramas from other cultures or countries, and though I have seen many dramas and movies from various cultures and countries, this drama led me to write my first review on IMDb.A quote from the drama that I would like whoever is reading my review to take away, and that is also seen from the trailer on NETFLIX is this: ""Before I die, I want to take off just once."" I do not think it sums up the entire show, but I think the quote in and of itself is inspiring and leaves a lasting impression. I hope whoever watches this drama gains knowledge from it that can be positively influential in their lives.For me, this drama is a 10/10!"
818,Navillera,This is one of the most beautiful shows I've come across.
819,Navillera,"A story that is worth watching .
Best plot and great acting."
820,Navillera,"Really THE best K-Drama of the year for me.It's really moving, so refreshing, and thought provoking.I cried for every episode, but I also feel so healed and encouraged by the show.It really touched some of the softest part of my heart.The first episode is a little bit slow, but it really builds the foundation well. Recommend it to everyone.Also strong shout out to amazing acting of Park In-Hwa and Song Kang! I'm surprised by Song Kang's flexibility and range of acting (plus his ballet scenes in the snow at end of EP8 is absolutely gorgeous.)"
821,Navillera,"This series is very touching! I cried in every episodes. The grandpa acting is excellent! So warm & he has loving laugh :)
The storyline is quite slow but its very enjoyable :)"
822,Navillera,Every episode is worth watching. I was bawling my eyes out for the whole episodes! THUMBS UP to everyone. It literally brought a new perspective in life upon watching it.
823,Navillera,"Such a beautiful story! This series is set in the ballet world and focuses on a young man , a ballerino in training and an elderly man who has always dreamed of learning ballet. Their paths come together and what followed is a beautiful, heartwarming relationship between the two. The characters are really brought to life by the actors, Park In-Hwan and Song Kang. They did a wonderful job! The show made me smile, laugh and cry. I would highly recommend this show! I hope to find this series on DVD so I can add it to my growing collection of Korean television programs."
824,Navillera,"I have never ever seen such a drama, that touched me from the beginning to the end. Navillera is from funny over exciting to heartbreaking... So many emotions, so many tears on my side. The acting is fabulous!!! I was absolutely impressed because it was so so honest and true. Love both main actors...!!! It's a MUST WATCH!"
825,Navillera,"I, too, cried in certain parts of the show. I watched it intently and couldn't believe how well the love for ballet was depicted. I felt like jumping up and down because I feel the same way. I had to stop taking ballet in my 20's as I was never going to be a professional dancer. But at age 60 I started again and my life is filled with so much joy; I could even understand the unspoken words in this movie. I fell in love with each character. Funny, a fellow ballet student/friend of mine, age 75, told me to watch this. I loved it."
826,Navillera,"This series touched so many personal sensitive issues. I fell in love with the characters. The acting was exceptional and I was sad when it ended..
I could have lived in this series forever."
827,Navillera,"I liked Song Kang in Love Alarm and Sweet Home, but even he can't save this. This show is just so boring. It's boring from the very start but as it goes on it becomes even more boring. I can't even finish the seventh episode.I don't know what it is trying to even tell, it feels like there is no story to convey. It is like watching some random 20-year-old man's life that is not interesting. The fact that he trains ballet could be interesting but him actually doing it is shown maybe a minute per episode - very weird, since the whole premise kind of revolves around it. Otherwise, there would be no plot at ALL.So, I don't understand why is this even a show. Why not show more of Song Kang dancing rather than focus on all the pointless drama that goes no where? Episodes are filled with pointless dialogue and drama. Some scenes are entertaining but rather than that, lead to no where or give any substance to the story whatsoever. I don't get the high raitings for this one. It's not an 8.8. I'd say it's one of the worst dramas of 2021 (if not the worst). The actors did a great job but other than that, the show is bland. The main character is bland and so is his love interest (though she's a good actor). I liked the grandpa but even he gets boring around the sixth or fifth episode. There is just no interesting story. Even the bully and his motives aren't clear and it feels like the writer is keeping things from the viewer, as for waiting to reveal more in the future episodes, what ends up filling episodes with pointless drama and stupid dialogue, and scenes. Who cares if the grandpa's son does not like that the grandpa does ballet!? No one!Most of this is just pointless filler but the vibe is fine. The characters are boring but work well. 5 stars for the acting (especially for Song Kang's effort). But I can't finish this.Don't watch it even if you like slow ""slice of life"" type of shows like Romance is a bonus book. You'll be disappointed."
828,Navillera,"Wonderful cast, and a very touching story! Definitely recommend this one."
829,Navillera,"This kdrama is so beautiful, with a thoughtful message that u are never too late to soar in your life there are always second chances😇 do what you love❤ this kdrama is so heartwarming, Park In hwan and Song kang has done a beautiful job and worked hard learning beautiful ballet💜💜 and not just them all the cast is so amazing❤❤"
830,Navillera,Nothing to say just.crying will make you understand. Its the first K-drama i realy like . I cried a lot in the end of this drama.and this is the first time i write something in imdb.
831,Navillera,"Absolutely LOVED this show! Every single episode revels depth of character. Warmth, humor and uncomfortable feelings that truly bring out the truths in all of us. I highly recommend this TV show to everyone. Especially those who struggle to live for their lifelong dream in a life altering state. Great acting."
