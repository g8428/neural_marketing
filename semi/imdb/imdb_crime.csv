0,Beyond Evil,"The story is unnecessarily confusing. Best screenplay? It jumbles up the time sequence for no good reason. The acting is one dimensional. Shin Ha Kyun smiles inappropriately and that is supposed to be great acting? Too much is filmed in the dark. Same morose tone for too long. The 2 heroes are so uninteresting as characters and so unlikeable. In contrast to the better K dramas the villains here are just defined by their crimes and don't have any justification. The plot doesn't have that much to it. They could have fit the whole
story in 12 episodes if they left out unnecessary scenes and lengthy repeats at the start of each episode. Best series? IOTNBO was so much better more original and more enjoyable. As a crime show Flower of Evil was way more involving and 10 times more exciting. The Baeksang awards got it wrong this year.Skip this heavy going boring dud."
1,Beyond Evil,"A very good series with 70% suspense in the screenplay, 95% superb acting and a 80-85% engaging and thrilling flow throughout. I saw the high praises, gave it a watch and my honest opinion is that it shines more because of its awesome acting above anything else; the deep & meticulous storylines, plots and events of the 2000 to 2021 period come next.The acting by the awesome cast, spearheaded by the amazing, shiny and super charismatic Shin Ha-kyun, the tender, sensitive and enigmatic Yeo Jin-gu and the whole band of charismatically mischievous antagonists was a real treat to watch and follow. Heartfelt congrats to them for their believable camaraderie, animosity and their super yummy stews and broths eaten together between friends. Loved the Manyang butcher shop and its warm and very beautiful owner Sung-eun Choi.Overall very satisfying; I will skip the weaknesses, it's not my place here to judge and above all the greatness of the show supersede the few cheesiness and weaknesses noticed by keen eyes.Worth the time spent watching it and the awards that it deservedly won."
2,Beyond Evil,"Outstanding show. Phenomenal characters, great acting, plot twists, drama, thrilling and creepy moments, precise and bulletproof writing. It's not easy to keep you invested for 16 hours on a thriller show (without stand alone episodes) but this was fantastic. 🙌"
3,Beyond Evil,"Loved the series. Just a bit of a quibble with some filler scenes that I don't have patience with. That's just me, for I thought it was an amazing series with SHK giving the award winning performance of a lifetime. YJG held his own brilliantly as well, and the two actors moved me deeply. Serious Korean cinema just gets better and better."
4,Beyond Evil,"A successful young police officer with powerful connections joins a substation and becomes involved in solving the murder 20 years earlier of one his colleagues sister. Is it a serial killer who is still operating and what are the dark secrets that the members of the station and local community are hiding. Interesting plot, well acted but too many psychological problems for all the actors and little real character development makes it a little heavy going."
5,Beyond Evil,Acting is fine in fact it's top level but this goes on to long with little happening and its very boring.i did waste 9 hours of my time before just going to the end to finish this series that had potential.
6,Beyond Evil,"This is obvious, the series is made for actors from the writer. The whole series is set of twins. Every 2 episode is a set, and 1-8 is one bigger set, then 9-16 is the second large set. And everything is combined as a whole. And of course, the two main characters are kind of twins that slowly merge together. The city counsel woman and the developer is another set of twins? Any more?In the 1st 8 episode, the ground works are lay down for the next 8 episode. And the characters are built up, ever so slowly. The pace is tactfully slow since the events and reveals are at a faster pace, a thriller's pace. It gives the audience time to think (or to participate) about what is REALLY going on here.The 2 main actors are excellent, especially the manic veteran cop. I'm reading subtitles, so the 2nd half has a bit more complex plot wise but not over done IMHO. The twists if any are relative minor and believable, but impactful. Well written.The young leuitenent's sacrifice is well telegraphed, along with his crushing realization that he long syspected. Loud as the express train on a rainy night. But the manic cop's revenge plan is a bit more problematic. Much too calculated. But he's a bit crazy so I give you that.The entire supporting cast is also excellent. The blues music score is very fitting. The serial killer themed type of thriller is only scratching the surface of the plot. I'm seeing lot of this onion layering recently in plot reveals and it's a effective tool in hooking the audience in. Here the writer also uses a simile of a new cop going into a small town's precinct, just like us, the audience going into the plot half blind and has to get to know the culture of the plot.Very well done.P.s. I'm rewatching the series again on Netflix and is catching more of the great writing with English subtitles instead of Chinese. The dialogue is just full of irony. Often from either the manic veteran cop or more often from the pretty boy. And all characters in the show are mulit dimensional too. From the substation chief, to Park Jeung-ji, the meat shop owner, down to the tertiary characters. They get meaningful dialogue and closeups to express their feelings, predicament and personality. In subtle ways. And the small town mentality is so spot on.And the quiet meat shop gathering is very cozy... comes with a slogan too ""Got money? No! Got good health? No !..."""
7,Beyond Evil,"Phew, What a ride has it been since I started Gwimul about four days ago. Right from the start Gwimul sets the tone, it's intense and gripping, with a storyline filled with a lot of suspense and of many mysterious characters. There are a number of sub plots to keep the viewer very interested in bargain, The first ten episodes focuses on a serial killer genre like Hollywood's Silence of the lambs, and travels at a breakneck speed but then the director for some reasons unknown tries to pull an ""à la Chinatown"" from the eleventh episode onwards after which the series goes into a lazy cruise mode till the very end. The season one contains a whopping sixteen, hour long episodes and runs a little over seventeen hours for it to end.Cinematography is brilliant and is very atypical of Korean movies in the recent years. Music and background score is good and grows on the viewer as the series progresses. Screenplay is both brilliant & terrific at times and confusing & boring at times, The writers gave away too much material early on but couldn't keep up the tempo after a while. Their usage and recall of a, unusually large number of character's names time and again, gets very confusing for non Korean viewers. Production design, costumes and makeup were decent. The editor makes a little impression in series that runs a whopping seventeen hours long. All the actors and the supporting actors were good and deliver some good performances, the many scenes where voices and tempers are raised are just terrific.Overall, Gwimul definitely entertains the viewer thoroughly for the major part of the series but strangely goes flat on the later part of the series. During the later episodes things are repeated over and over again, sometimes to very annoying levels. If one is a fan of serial killer or Korean movies, Gwimul would be a treat for sure, and is unmissable. I would advise viewers to binge watch the first ten episodes and watch not more than one episode per day after that, for better results. Trust me it will be easy on your head. It is not recommended for young audiences as the series features a lot of blood and gore. 6.9 stars out of 10 for a highly entertaining series, which could have been even better if edited well."
8,Beyond Evil,"This was incredible. The story is compelling and it's a show that keeps you guessing. The characters are unpredictable and there are hidden and darker sides to them that we get glimpses of as the show progresses, like the layers of an onion being peeled. The show is definitely confusing at some parts but everything gets revealed in due time.And the character development of Han Juwon and Lee Dongsik is so satisfying as they work together to unravel the truth of what happened 20+ years ago. And the actors who played them were phenomenal. What I really liked about this show is how it makes you think about the things people are willing to do to save themselves or to achieve a goal, and what lengths they'll go to to keep their reputation. It strips humanity's ugliest parts and incorporates them into this crime and mystery show, showing that ordinary people are more than capable of doing evil things to each other."
9,Beyond Evil,"Beyond Evil was a unique show to say the least. Full of fantastic acting performances and a really well written mystery with lots of red herrings and twists that keep you guessing. The soundtrack was also unique but fit the atmosphere of the show really well. The cinematography was dark, creepy, and perfect for the story. There was also a decent amount of character development that is usually lacking in these plot-heavy thrillers, so that was very rewarding. Overall this show is very well done and definitely worth a watch.I think some people complained that the show should have ended sooner, and I don't want to spoil the mystery at all, so I will just say that I thought it ended perfectly and exactly when it should have by resolving the main conflict/mystery presented at the very beginning of the show."
10,Beyond Evil,"... struggling to stay awake during some episodes.That is weird isn't it! Usually I would give up on a series which failed to keep me awake. What's more, I didn't just persevere with it - here I am awarding it a 9.This series boasts a layered plot that keeps you guessing, well-drawn characters and believable relationships. But such things are no more than you learn to expect from Korean drama. It also showcases some fine acting - the quality of acting on display in Korean TV series is always outstanding. But here the two leads manage to deliver performances that stand out even against such a high standard. Simply marvellous!So what's my excuse for dropping off from time to time? Some episodes have far more talking than action. And I must be getting old!"
11,Beyond Evil,"Episodes 1-12 were nicely done but from episode 13 startd to be nonsense illogical and no common sense. As the episodes proceeded from ep 13, it was getting more worst, especially the last episodes was so full of craps. The director and writer obviously dont know how police and prosecutor operate.It is foolish to appoint 1 big enemy to investigate internally and worst employ a second enemy to do the same job! You can see the whole time they refused to employ lawyers when investigated. What a petty director on saving some cost on more actors. There were too many flaws too. This is a very budgeted drama and many rushed to complete without putting too much effort into the storylines.Due to the over-nonsenses in ep 13 to 16, I decided to drop from 10 to 6 points because this is like below average standard drama from Korea. The main actor is good but the story is worsened by too many nonsenses.So sorry, my expectations is higher than many and I do not care if they are my favourite actors or actresses. I only care that I tell the truth from my experiences watchiing dramas for 40 years since I was a kid."
12,Beyond Evil,"Good story, the execution was smooth and the mystery was gripping. It managed to hold my attention while I was watching it. However, the characters, while well-acted, did not pique my fancy well enough to make me want to watch it again."
13,Beyond Evil,"It's a 16 part series . At episode 7, I thought it was dragging on a bit and presumed it was going get tedious to watch the remaining episodes but I was wrong! It was actually a good watch . It was predictable at times but very well constructed . The acting was excellent . An actor who played the main thug in Squid Game was in it too!"
14,Beyond Evil,Confounded. The story seems unique. The development of the characters is good. Confusing to say the least. The lead is manic. It keeps you guessing.
15,Beyond Evil,"BEYOND EVIL was an insanely good drama. Going into it, I really had no expectations set and so I was very pleased to realize this was going to be a stellar drama. I realized that right off the bat. It wasn't hard to guess it would turn out to be great, given the super great acting, intriguing storyline and mystery, and awesome music. The first episode was very compelling. There was so much to love about this show. It was very addictive and masterfully executed. This isn't your run of the mill crime kdrama by far.Being a psychological thriller, and featuring a lot of crime, involving some gruesome murders and some graphic and highly emotional scenes, this series is rather dark and certainly not for everyone. It has a way of getting in your head and under your skin, without being classified horror. However, the complexity of this drama is pretty mind blowing. Definitely a series to try if you enjoy dark, gritty, psychological crime thrillers.While there certainly is crime, murder, mystery, intrigue and heavy psychological elements, this drama is wholly original in flavor and it's hard to peg down why. Certainly the two male leads (Shin Ha-kyun as the jaded and misunderstood Lee Dong Shik, and Yeo Jin-gu as the determined and incorruptible Han Ju Won) are fantastic actors with definite on-screen chemistry. Though the story is non-romantic, and not sexual in nature, the two partners gradually form a deep bond hard to describe. They grow from enemies to partners to true friends, of course, but the platonic bond they later share is something truly powerful. Possibly result of a shared trauma, or a trauma bond. Either way it's incredibly moving. A Bromance unlike any other, especially in this genre.The story itself was excellent and kept me on the edge of my seat. The entire drama is a rollercoaster ride, from one thrilling point to the next. The characterizations were great and memorable. There were so many likable characters besides the main leads, and all were so well written and existing in various shades of grey. I really loved the connections and friendships between the people of the small town. Great casting and great acting. On top of all that, the visuals, cinematography, script, music, it was all top notch. This show makes you feel so much. Just prepare for a wild ride. I really hope there will be another season/series.STORY: 10/10
CINEMATOGRAPHY: 10/10
ART/DESIGN/VISUALS: 10/10
MUSIC: 10/10
OVERALL RATING: 10/10."
16,Beyond Evil,"Started off really great kept my attention with a whodunit, dark, crime, mystery series. However this is very much a slow burn type series snd can be complicated with all the different characters. The hard part with the series is that you end up not having a favourite character because, like the Korean title means it Monster, every character is portrayed with a dark side. Thus with a slow burn and the disconnect with characters, it's really hard to really engage.Biggest complaint is it tends to be very slow, especially after the seventh episode it seems to have lost a lot of its momentum. Overall 6.5/10, I have seen better slow burn detective thriller dramas that is cohesive throughout."
17,Beyond Evil,"Watching any film or series from South Korea does take a bit of time to settle in but once it gets going and you are use to the characters, their inflections and the storyline...it's all good.If Shin Ha-kyun doesn't have the best smile...I don't know what actor does.It's basically a 10 rating, but a few parts did drag and were implausible, yet it's a blockbuster!Too bad that 99% of the American public that are on Netflix will pass by a lot of foreign films and series because they can't seem to read subtitles.Really?It takes nano-second to do, yet to read a subtitle for most is like a huge undertaking.Too bad for them...they are missing some amazing films and series."
18,Beyond Evil,An awesome drama! One of the best I have watched! Fully deserved all the awards it got too. My only complaint was Yeo Jingoo should have gotten more awards as well for his portrayal just like Shin Hakyun did.
19,Beyond Evil,"This drama is awesome, especially the story line, when you think you know a very suspense drama, then watch this Beyond evil. It will keep you at the edge of your sit. I really appreciate and enjoyed this drama. Thank you all❤"
20,Beyond Evil,"I just finished watching the finale and I'm uncertain as to how to honor the remarkable quality of this series. It is all just so, so damn good.If you like Korean crime series, this is the one. It's an absolute masterpiece."
21,Beyond Evil,"Let's get this out of the way, the acting was really good, there were no major flaws, at least that I noticed.In relation to the story there are a lot o episode endings that lead you to believe something and then it isn't which can be a good suspense tool, however they overused it so I never believed what was showing on the end because I knew that it was super misleading.Also worth noting that the final felt incomplete. There was no major interest in wanting to portray how they got arrested (we know how but we don't see some people getting arrested, we don't get a follow up of how those guys were doing in prison or how their imprisonment changed the redevelopment of the city for example) and what happened during the ""time skip"" at the last episode.Overall I give this a 7/10 but I easily recommend this series."
22,Beyond Evil,Personally I really like this drama. I just love the way how this drama was produced. The story was engaging from the first episode. I really like Shin Ha-kyun character in this drama which is Lee Dong-sik. He's giving a good vibe to this drama.
23,Beyond Evil,Great storyline keeps you guessing from beginning to end! Great acting by both leads. Wonderful Bromance. They both deserve awards. Supporting cast was also very good. If you like suspense this one's for you.
24,Beyond Evil,"It has been ages, since I ve seen a well executed thriller drama. It keeps you guessing n in the edge... It's a must watch. Great acting.... Simply brilliance. Both main leads compliment n contradict each other soooo well..shin han kyun deserved the best award. Yeo jin gu was amazing as always."
25,Beyond Evil,"After mostly liking the show for the first 75% the writers just had to throw in one twist too many. I have no desire to see how many more twists and turns they have managed to shoehorn into the final four episodes just to make sure they reach their quota. Perhaps if Rube Goldberg had written murder mystery cop shows this is what it would look like. In the USA in the 1990s there were a handful of movies that began with the protagonist about to die that would then go back a matter of days or weeks to a real beginning point. Now it seems that about 40% or better of American movies do that in the best METOO run it into the ground tradition. Korean writers seem to be doing the METOO run it into the ground on cop shows by adding more and more convulutions, twists, turns, mazes etc. At a certain point it just gets beyond ridiculous and further willing suspension of disbelief is too much work."
26,Beyond Evil,"I cannot lie it's been a while since I've been this attached to a programme. The characters have so much depth to them it's almost like they are actually living the story, and the acting couldn't feel or look any more real, the emotion is completely raw, the actors did an absolutely amazing job, even the background characters looked like pros. The OST!!! The songs in the background add so much atmosphere and match the characters and story perfectly, the songs are great especially Choi baek ho's the night, his voice is incredible!! Some episodes were quite slow but the acting and characters get you through it and the build up is definitely worth it because when the emotions reach the climax everything just explodes in a great way. They also wrapped up the series very nicely. I also love how the director decided to do certain shots, at some points it felt like I was right there and I was looking right at the characters, some beautiful shots taken too. Although this is a fairly male dominated series, the female characters had quite high ranks and were very strong minded and weren't damsels in distress, apart from the female victims, which is nice to see. It kept me guessing a lot as to who the monster truly was, maybe there was more than one? Guimul is the original Korean title for this and it means monster, matches well to the storyline obviously, Beyond evil is also a pretty good title for it. Highly, highly HIGHLY recommend because it's enticing and insanely gripping!! Wow I could literally go on and on about how this is a masterpiece, definitely won't forget this!!"
27,Beyond Evil,"This is one of the best crime/thriller series I have ever watched. And, believe me I watch a lot. The two main characters were outstanding and the rest of the cast definitely weren't shabby. I thought after they found the serial killer that it would get boring. Wow, was I wrong. So many twists and turns. I didn't mind the lack of sleep trying to watch every episode as fast as I could. I'd give it higher than a 10 if I could."
28,Beyond Evil,I've seen so many tv shows about crime i can't even count them but this one however like how am i supposed to recover from this? This just threw me into the washing machine of feelings or smth and now im out and wtf am i supposed to do.
29,Beyond Evil,"Just finished Beyond Evil. Great plot, wonderful acting. Tremendous suspense. Great characters . If you like crime series , this one is as good as it gets. No spoilers here. Just sit back and enjoy."
30,Beyond Evil,"Good story ruined by superfluous soap-opera drama. This series quickly becomes dull, plodding, predictable, and OFTEN illogical. Could have been a great show if the HOURS of mind-numbingly redundant filler was edited out."
31,Beyond Evil,"Overall, not a bad show. Its a crime thriller and is definitely gripping at quite a few places. What I didn't like about this is that there are too many subplots for my liking, and the timeline shifts could have been executed a little better. The two lead detectives are ok and just about deliver. There are few scenes where they get annoying but thankfully doesn't linger for too long. Could have finished in 12 episodes instead of being dragged till 16."
32,Beyond Evil,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It had me screaming and trying to figure out all the twist and turns of who did it. Then, they impressed me by letting me know and showed me how it all comes together. Brilliant!"
33,Beyond Evil,This is a masterclass for acting aspirants all the major casts where just outstanding in their performances.. The script has encapculated all the element of a good mystery thriller along with a great drama style story telling. Love cliffhangers at every episodes keeps you on your toes for the next one.
34,Beyond Evil,First K-drama i've watched and it did not disappoint. The series had so many unexpected twists and kept me continuously entertained. Main characters had good character development too. Highly recommend if you like mystery thrillers.
35,Beyond Evil,"I'm usually a big fan of gritty crime dramas, but I just couldn't get into this show. I watched three episodes and found it irritating. The writers spent almost the entirety of those three episodes trying absurdly hard to make the main character look like the guilty party, to the point that there was no on-screen detecting at all and I could no longer suspend my disbelief that all the things that were happening could be ""just coincidences"". I also don't understand some of the acting decisions that were made - I know the main character is supposed to be a bit unhinged, but would anyone really behave like that in those situations? It flip-flopped between bizarre and boring. In the end I was just so annoyed that I gave up watching."
36,Beyond Evil,"It is currently available on Netflix & Viki TV. I have watched this series 5 times. It is without a doubt the best writing, screenplay, acting & music I have ever seen. After seeing the performance of Yeo Jin-gu(Han Ju Won) in ""Hwayi: A Monster Boy"" 2013, which was like watching a young Brando in ""On The Waterfront"", I thought I 'd check this out. He plays the younger detective Ju won to Shin Ha-kyan (Lee Dong Shik) to the older detective, who is amazing. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. He clearly is an experienced actor who made this character his own. The entire cast of great performances made this a great series. Check out the number of awards this is getting. I would highly recommend this series to everyone. I think it will become a classic & a cult film at the same time."
37,Beyond Evil,"I gave this drama five stars because the the first 8 episodes revolving around the serial murders was really quite well done. There were numerous plot twists, smoke screens, red herrings and all these plot devices kept me guessing. It was well acted, and pacing was just right.The second half of the drama is about police and gov't corruption. This second storyline was dismal compared to the first. There was no creativity in it. It was complex to the point of dragging down the pacing. The eerie atmosphere of the first half had dissipated, but the suspenseful plot twists that one would expect from a drama about corruption just could not hold up.Korean dramas need to stop recycling the corruption plot line. It's over-used and too predictable now."
38,Beyond Evil,"I have been waiting for this drama since they announced it, and I wasn't disappointed! In FACT, It's already made it's way to my all time favorite drama, regardless of how it will END...it really doesn't matter since it's gonna be LIT!Psychological Thrillers are always a treat to those who love suspense and making things out in your mind before stuff happen on screen! To top that with a heart-wrenching emotional ride isn't the most common stuff coming out these days, so I urge you please, DON'T miss THIS ONE!!!Without further ado, let's get to the actual review,STORY: It's a very DARK STORY-LINE. The main character (Dong Shik) who is a demoted detective, is suspected of killing his own sister, and the others on his team aren't totally innocent. The drama unfolds when a frightening murder happens which resembles ones happening in the span of 20 years to the past! And the young detective from Seoul vows to catch ""Dong Shik"" for he thinks it must be his doing and he must be the culprit of the serial murder case!Acting/Characters: Lee Do Hyun gave an outstanding (tho very short) performance as the young Dong Shik.Shin Ha Kyun's acting is stellar! Once again beyond words! His voice is so fitting, calming and apologetic, as if he have done the world wrong! Yet his laugh is so creepy, it's quite a thrill to look at him smirking. Jin Goo's character is usually cold and unwavering... yet with is amazing acting, he manages to make way into anyone's heart early in the drama!
All the rest of the cast are doing immensely great job, with their acting naturally flowing in, very realistic and never feel forced!
Special thanks to the lovely rookie actress, Choi Sung Eun as ""Yoo Jae Yi"" and much respect for the amazing portrayal of
""Park Jung Je"" by Choi Dae Hoon and ""Oh Ji Hoon"" by Nam Yoon Su.
Music: The score is DRAMATIC, SUSPENSEFUL and very pleasant to listen to. The main theme grabbed my attention from the opening scene, with the beautiful blend of the violin and the percussion. and as for the songs. The song ""THAT NIGHT"" is the PERFECT music to give anyone chills watching this PERFECT DRAMA! It feels like a sorrowful man's screams and says letting out his long held grudges to be heard by someone in a corner... An absolute classic masterpiece that would easily have won best music awards, was it released in 1990s! With those said, I just love the theme song so much I want it to win some awards of 2021 too! And the rest of the songs are all amazing, especially love ""Timeless"" by BIBI, will surely be in my playlist for a while!LAST WORDS:
This drama is GREATNESS beyond WORDS! and I'm quite bad with crafty expressions, so all I can do, to give this drama justice, is ask you to start watching the first episode RIGHT AWAY, and don't let anything get your attention till you're done with the first! The rest will be history, as a matter of fact, you won't be able to stop watching! Guaranteed!**Unless you're the type who can't stand very dark and regretful stories!**A MUST WATCH! If you're looking for a DEEP and FASCINATING HUMANE STORY."
39,Beyond Evil,"This is a very good investigation drama . It is a little bit slow but it pays off at the end .If you like thriller , detectives , twists and guessing you should see beyond evil !"
40,Beyond Evil,"Saw another reviewer write keeps you guessing and it does but only as to why you are watching it and how it's rated so high the horror props are so bad it's like something you would find on the dollar store shelves at Halloween if you are looking for a good Korean show to watch Mouse is one of the best shows in general i have ever seen in my effort to find something even half as good i have failed so far tried the devil judge beyond evil and sweet home but every one of them is overrated, and downright boring."
41,Beyond Evil,"I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers. This one actually is not that creepy compared to most serial killers thrillers, it instead focuses on justice. My vows to all the actors who did amazing jobs. And the best thing about this drama is chemistry between two leads, episode 1 to 16. I am in love with their love- hate relationship. They are really on fire !"
42,Beyond Evil,"'Beyond Evil' is a 16-episode long Korean drama, starring Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo in pivotal roles. The story is about two police officers who are determined to solve the case of a 20-year old murder case. Their desire to uncover the truth is strong enough to lead them to bend laws and reach a stage where they question everyone around them, including themselves. The main reason behind me starting this drama was the amount of appreciation it got in the recent Baeksang Arts Awards. The drama was easily able to sweep away the 'Best Actor', 'Best Drama' and 'Best Screenplay' among many other titles, which perked up my curiosity and led me into giving it a watch.Talking about the acting, one man that stands over all others will be Shin Ha Kyun. He is the brightest star in the big galaxy of actors in the show (haha, poetic much--:P). He has done a very good job and deserves all the appreciation that he has been getting after this show. The finesse with which he is able to convey each and every emotion to the viewer is highly commendable. On the other hand, Yeo Jin Goo also has done a stupendous job of maintaining a steady love-hate relationship towards Shin Ha Kyun's character. Both the actors' chemistry is very well maintained throughout the drama, and makes it a delightful watch.While the first half of the drama was very intriguing, scary and full of suspense, the second half doesn't seem to match up to the already maintained thrill. Things get a tad bit slow and predictable but the show is still watchable and holds adequate amount of suspense to keep you hooked. Overall, 'Beyond Evil' is a very compelling drama to watch. It talks about the actual power that a cop holds and throws light on the evil face of people in power, which is hidden by their mask of good deeds. For people who enjoy watching thriller and suspense-filled dramas, this show is a very good pick and is worth a try."
43,Beyond Evil,"Excellent. You will no regret watching it, very well written and the actors did an amazing job."
44,Beyond Evil,"As someone who has enjoyed some great Korean films this was a huge disappointment. The way the music would ratchet up every few minutes to try and make something seem dramatic when it wasn't at all. The writing was interminably slow, if you want people to continue to watch a series things have to happen that make you want to watch. Also even if the plot is not believable the way the characters act should be. In the natural way humans do, not in this melodramatic cod acting that had died out in cinema some 70 years agoGot to the end of episode 5 and stopped."
45,Beyond Evil,"I don't know how to say this in the right words but this drama is a rare masterpiece and it would be a crime to miss it , first , the story, it is just beyond good the style is so cinematically deep ,dark and heart breaking in the most artistic way ever.
The music, I actually consider it as one of the main characters in this drama because of how powerful and haunting the sound of it is and how it just makes the scene better if that is possible.
And for the main dish ( the acting) iam sure if shin hakyun was an American actor this guy would have made all the important awards easily his, one of the best character and acting I have seen in years, also Jin goo is doing a great job playing han juwon a character that I won't forget his gaze for a long time .
And for last we have THE CHEMISTRY I swear I didn't witness a chemistry like that since long years ago like !! Dong shik and juwon can just exist in the same place and their chemistry would be a burning fire , surely the one how picked them together is a genius.
To conclude it would be a shame if this drama didn't get the popularity it deserves because I have a good eye for this and i can say with confidence that we won't get anything like it for a long time so don't miss it."
46,Beyond Evil,"SPOILER FREE
Everyone can appreciate some aspects of this drama, like the acting or the OST, but plot-wise this is not a series for everyone. Beyond Evil is a character-driven drama, that some may find slow paced. Anyone who likes multilayered and morally gray characters will appreciate it. The acting (especially from the two main leads) is probably one of the best I have seen.SPOILERS
It's been a while since I saw such an intriguing series. Was it perfect without even a single flaw? No. However the flaws were minor, so I didn't really care about them.Beyond Evil is a gripping drama from the beginning. The plot is very well written and the characters are so interesting and complex. The acting is outstanding. Shin Ha Kyun delivered one of the best performances I have ever seen. He is an amazing actor, and Yeo Jin Goo was such a great choice to play Han Joo Won. I don't know who thought of putting Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo together in a series, but whoever did, thank you very much! This series would definitely not be the same without this great cast and the phenomenal chemistry of the two main leads.Generally, I don't pay too much attention to the directing, since most of the times it is good or at least decent. Nonetheless, it was impossible not to notice the great directing of this series. I loved how it was like seeing the POV of another character and it led the viewers to certain assumptions to distract them from the truth. The color tones were all so dark yet not too dark, which made the series even more appealing and disturbing (especially in the first episodes). The OST fits the series in an unimaginably good way.Did this get draggy, tiring or just not as good comparing to the first half? Kind of, but it was inevitable. This isn't a series that reveals everything on the last episode, so of course every single clue added a piece to the puzzle and when things started getting clearer it was natural for the series to not be as mysterious as it was in the first episodes.What I really loved, is the fact that everything was revealed slowly but surely and we didn't wait till the last episode to find out who the killer is.I loved how Beyond Evil tackled many issues like the stigma that follows a falsely accused person or the pain that people who are left behind are going through."
47,Beyond Evil,Solid watch for anyone into Korean crime drama. A slow burn that unravels and hooks you in. The two main protagonists fizz with intensity and keep you entertained. Shin Ha-Kyun is an absolute delight to watch on screen with a great supporting performance from Dae Hoon. Well worth your time.
48,Beyond Evil,"Don't hesitate, just watch it! It's beautiful and very well written. Keeps you at the edge of your seat!"
49,Beyond Evil,"One of the best series for this year, and they are not a lot btw I can say it's only three.. the mystery of the series guides you for another secret episode by episode definitely amazing.. really worth to watch it."
50,Beyond Evil,I shall say that is the best drama ever I watched.
51,Beyond Evil,"This series too much conflict that didnt need too
I just stop in ep 3 and didnt continue...very boring."
52,Beyond Evil,"If there's one thing that needs to be said about Beyond Evil is that is the most perfect example of how lots of 16 episode Korean shows are too long for their own good with the last half not being up to scratch.In no other show is this more prominent than here. The first half is a legit masterpiece. A psychological thriller about hunting a serial killer filled with great and realistic twists, fantastic acting (especially from the lead Shin Ha-kyun who gives the performance his life), music, atmosphere, tension. It did not surprise me after reading about the show to learn that it was inspired by Memories of Murder, a must-watch K-movie. This is the Korean True Detective but in some ways even better.Unfortunately the second half is totally different. To call it a second season or wholy different show would not be an overstatement. Its twists are far too many, all of them predictable and implausible, its characterization lacking, its pacing terrible. Even the actors start going through the motions of a plot that is essentially over at this point but doesn't know it.So all in all I would definitely suggest watching this, just for the first 7-8 episodes and if you don't mind the huge drop in quality, by all means watch it to the end."
53,Beyond Evil,This drama will keep you on edge about who's the real culprit. If you're a fan of k-thriller then this is for you.
54,Beyond Evil,"Starts off strong. But devolves to high school writing by nonsensical character thoughts/ action/motivations that are inconsistent with the previous 10 episodes for cheap surprise twists. Eg when jeong je's mom reveals that she actually hated him the entire time. There are also major logical inconsistencies such as when when trying to figure out who killed Mi Jeong, the police officers blame each other and themselves because they thought they were the last to see her however it has already been established that they know that her father was the last to see her! Why does dong shik smile in a devilish way only up to the episode where it's revealed that he actually is not the serial killer?? Why does Ju won get surprised when his father gets angry at him for acting like a insecure malignant son the entire series??"
55,Beyond Evil,"Not so many Korean dramas have a nice ending like this, mostly it's gonna end weirdly."
56,Beyond Evil,"I would say the real hero here is Shin Ha Kyun with his amazing performance.The Plot itself, despite all the plot twists and mystery it has is not enough to get 10/10, yet the acting of characters is what making this show best thriller of 2021."
57,Beyond Evil,Love the series but only up to when they revealed the serial killer. The series should had stopped there. It's anti climax thereafter.
58,Beyond Evil,I was not expecting so many juicy plot twists that left me at the edge of my seat. I'm a sucker for cliff hangers & this show definitely gave me that. The acting was done superbly and I recommend this to a lot of family and friends!!
59,Beyond Evil,"Beyond Evil is not a typical crime or detective drama. It focuses not only who the culprit is but also how the incidents influence and change suspects' and victims' lives. Watching BE is like doing a difficult jigsaw puzzle. Patience is needed, but it's worth it. No plot holes, and all cast did a brilliant job. The music also goes well with the scenes. In addition, the cinematography is awesome. BE is a drama that makes you think a lot and gives you profound feelings especially during your second watch."
60,Beyond Evil,"Saw some weird ass reviews here calling Yeo Jin Goo ugly and what not. Jin-goo is one of the most celebrated young veteran actor. So people who will scream ""Beyond Evil is overhyped "" but then turn around and watch the ""actually overhyped dramas with just good looking leads but not much acting and plot"", let's not delude ourselves here, ok ?And to the people looking for reviews and thinking whether they should watch it, I'd say give it a shot.Beyond Evil is a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER. I always put the genre in caps so that it's clear for everyone and they get an idea of what to expect from the drama. Watching it once isn't even enough to be honest because you don't end up catching all the details during the first watch. I really don't have anything to say about the acting because the performance of the actors speak for themselves. Just that you're in for a ride !!!"
61,Beyond Evil,"GENRE: This drama is a full package psychological thriller - one that focuses on psychological narratives in a thriller setting. Acting, writing, directing, cinematography and music all monstrously good. One is totally missing something if one just thinks it's a mere crime-solving / detective / find-the-culprit drama. Beyond Evil tells the story of the pain, sorrow and wounds of the families and friends of the victims who are left behind. Its key message is to bring out how the selfishness of one person could have a knock-on effect to turn everyone into a monster, how one mistake can grow into multiple bigger ones which inflict pain on people, as they find ways to cover things up (hence the title ""monster"" - the name of the drama in Korean, ""gwemul"", means ""monster"" literally. ""Beyond Evil"" is the official name of this drama in English). It also explores various issues like the loopholes and injustice of the legal system, and ""necessary evil"".STARTING: It is one of those rare dramas that lingers long after it's ended. The first few episodes are slow-burning, focus on setting the scenes, laying the leads meticulously (so if you re-watch the first few episodes after finishing the whole series, you will find that all the dots are amazingly connected).ACTING: The chemistry between Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo is no joke. The intense gazes, ""hate-to-heal"" dynamics just keep you on the edge of your seat! Shin Ha Kyun won the best actor award for his role in Baeksang Arts Award and Yeo Jin Goo, who is just 23-year-old now, is critically acclaimed for his mature performance in the drama. Han Ju Won played by Yeo Jin Goo is a complex character - someone who appears calm and cold about everything on the surface, someone who has a somewhat broken childhood, who holds up to his belief in justice, who is extremely startled but not shaken when the truth is unraveled. Yeo Jin Goo, who has been an actor for over 15 years despite his young age, shows you the change and growth in Han Ju Won with his excellent and natural acting. There is a heavy use of close-up shots - the director explained it is to show the subtle changes in gazes and micro-expressions of the actors/actresses such that various subtexts could be understood by viewers even they are not explicitly depicted by way of dialogues.SCRIPT: Even though the ""main dish"" of the drama is the deeper psychological narratives, Beyond Evil delivers perfectly in the crime-solving side as well. There is a plot twist in basically every episode. But note that the twists are not unnecessary at all for the sake of creating suspense - every twist is meaningful and if you watch till the end you will marvel at how meticulously the dots are tied together so well. Even the seemingly ""not-so-important"" scenes embody certain subtexts! The amount of careful design is just breathtaking. Beyond Evil thrives so much on subtexts and deeper meanings which makes it so fun to watch.DIRECTING: I usually prefer movies over dramas for the better cinematography (in general) but Beyond Evil really surprises me - excellent camera movement and mise-en-scène (roughly, the stage design and arrangement of actors). For example, in the scene where Han Ju Won learnt of something important, a train passed by at the backdrop quickly, as if Han Ju Won's complicated emotions were splashing out at that very moment. There are countless metaphors and stage-setting like this - one has to watch it to find them all out!MUSIC: The OST just match very perfectly with the theme, from the song ""That Night"" which conveys loneliness and sadness to the instrumental background music designed for various scenes (especially the opening title - that's my favourite. To add, if you review the opening title after you have finished the whole drama, you will find a lot of clues and hints in it. Yes, this is how meticulous the whole production is!!!).CONCLUSION: Beyond Evil is a masterpiece of acting, writing, directing, cinematography and music which carries very meaningful messages. It totally deserves the awards and positive reviews it got. I have watched it 3 times to date and every time I re-watch it, I find something new (either something I missed in my previous watching, or a metaphor/subtext that I come to realise a certain scene is getting at). It is definitely my ""YOLO"" drama and I would highly recommend it to you."
62,Beyond Evil,"Acting, directing, script, music, camera movement are all top-notched. It is not an everyday detective story that just focus on catching the killer - the messages the drama brings out are very meaningful and are the major focus. Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo have a pretty big age gap there but that was exactly why the chemistry was so well - the contrast in terms of age, personality, approach to issues brings out so much sparks and chemistry between them. The acting is natural yet impactful. The supporting actors/actresses all deliver very well. Music gives me goosebumps. Heavy use of metaphors, hidden meanings and subtexts. Clues and leads are set out in a subtle manner throughout - there is no meaningless or useless scenes if you understand the story correctly. It is one of a kind indeed. Highly recommended."
63,Beyond Evil,"I am a fans of dramas/movies which are not shallow and carry certain social messages that warrant reflections. At first I thought Beyond Evil is just a crime thriller drama depicting a typical detective story as I read some reviews here before starting watching it on Netflix. But as I finished the whole drama I think it is simplistic, if not incorrect at all, to characterize this drama as just a crime thriller - Beyond Evil delivers much more over and above a typical catch-the-killer story. It carries much more depth and meaning than that. If you follow through the series, you will see that the focus of this drama is actually on the psychological states, sorrow and pain of the missing persons' families, and the prejudice and bias of people towards people whom they think have committed a crime. It is also about the devastating effects of selfishness of human nature and how people not making choices just for their own benefits could have led to entirely different outcomes. In short, it talks about how evil human nature can be. If you are into dramas that explore human nature that make you think and ponder on issues Beyond Evil will be something that you dearly like."
64,Beyond Evil,"* Beyond Evil is among the most cinematic korean dramas I have watched. Some of the camera movements and detailed stage setting are normally found in movies only. The music is so profound and the blue tone of the OSTs is just perfect for the theme. I feel like watching 16 movies (which are tightly tied together). Hands down a masterpiece.* In terms of acting, the performances of the actors and actresses (basically everyone, regardless of whether it's the main or supporting) far exceeded my expectations. I have always known the two male leads Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jingoo are excellent actors, each of which has won a number of major awards for their good acting skills. I can't imagine anyone else playing Lee Dong Sik or Han Ju Won after watching the whole series. They are the characters themselves.* In terms of plot, there is no major plot hole. A lot of suspense and questions were thrown out in the first part of the drama but all of these questions were answered in the subsequent episodes. As such the drama is not difficult to understand at all because you will be given the answers if you follow through even if you do not understand everything at first.* Most importantly the director and writer did not forget a good drama cannot come without meaningful messages that provoke the reflection and thinking of the audience. This is also the reason why I think notwithstanding a number of other K-dramas were also very well done in this year, Beyond Evil is simply on another level because it is able to deliver an intriguing story with perfect execution of the actors/actresses while not losing sight of giving audience a thought-provoking message."
65,Beyond Evil,"I did not hear much about Beyond Evil from the news and media in my country but my friend spoke so highly of it so I watched it on Netflix recently. It was so good that I just binge-watched it in 2 days! The story revolves around a small neighborhood called Manyang and the people who live there. It started off with a flashback to 20 years ago where Lee Dong Shik was accused of murdering the victims in a serial killing case. 20 years later, as an up-and-coming inspector Han Ju Won arrived at Manyang to re-open the investigation, another victim emerged, drawing resemblance with the serial killing case 20 years ago. The drama starts off with a slow pace with a major plot twist kicking in just at the end of the second episode. Thereafter there are decent twists and turns throughout, with Episode 8 being the end of the first major plot. While I wondered how the drama will develop after episode 8, as I went on I realised episode 8 was an important turning point that brings out the climax, which I am not going to spoil here. I can't explain more about why a psychological thriller drama can be a ""therapeutic"" one without spoiling so I will let you find out by watching it :)"
66,Beyond Evil,"The plot of Beyond Evil is well twisted, and a new intrigue is revealed behind each denouement. But at the same time, already in the first episodes, I felt that Beyond Evil could be more than just a good detective. And I was not wrong.From the very first episodes, we plunge into the drama, like into a fabulous whirlpool. We get to know the life of a provincial town. We watch Lee Dong Sik intently, trying to figure out what is behind his extravagant behavior. Shin Ha Kyun in this role masterfully balances on the border of light and shadow, sober calculation and madness. In the meantime, we are wondering who he is - a ""fallen angel"" or a bright angel who fell from a height and broke his wings. We look into the faces of all the heroes, trying to determine which of them is the monster. And gradually we are imbued with the mesmerizing beauty of this world and its inhabitants.At first, Han Joo Won was perceived as an outsider. ""Young master"" in an expensive suit, completely alien among the ordinary people of Manyang. And it's not just about social status. Han Joo Won chose this role for himself - an independent observer who looks from above at the ugliness of this world and does not touch the dirt. However, the further he progresses in his research, the more personal it becomes, and the mask of equanimity slips from his face. This is how a classic detective story turns into a psychological journey - to feelings and memories walled up in the basements of the soul, into a journey to someone else and to oneself. Because these two processes always go together - to find yourself, you need to see the other and be seen. Find your own reflection in the other person's eyes.The drama Beyond Evil is a real maze of reflections. Each significant event, the history of each hero has its own reflection. Some of them are false, some of them are true, but all these fragments, put together, allow you to see the truth. There is such a method of image restoration - from several dull and even distorted reflections, you can recreate a real image. We recognize heroes by the way they are reflected in each other. And each new meeting, each new dialogue is another step towards finding a real face. This approach makes the image of each character multidimensional and deep.The drama really captures all aspects of the relationship. Family relationships - healthy or toxic. Relations with oneself, relationships with the world, social relationships - the law and its implementation. Morality as the ability to contact. Breaking up relationships like disappearing. The attitude towards the deceased loved ones and the ways of dealing with loss, with death. Relationships are alive, supportive and healing. Relationships are codependent, burdensome and suffocating. Personality always lives in a relationship. Fencing off from the world, a person cuts off a part of himself and, ultimately, can completely die as a person. This is how a person turns into a monster.""Everyone in the city is like one family,"" says Han Joo Won of the residents of Manyang. And he is absolutely right. All heroes are connected to each other by a whole network of threads. But somewhere these are the supporting threads of life, and somewhere they are suffocating fetters. The family image is central to the drama. Everything begins with it - everything ends with it. For each of the heroes, this word means something different - a project, a burden, a duty, a dream of absolute happiness. But for everyone, it carries a lot of weight. Thus, a small town turns out to be a global metaphor for a community, a social family, in which our humanity is born, but sometimes dies.The density of connections and meanings in the drama is so great that not only each character, but the whole world of the drama is felt as something living, animated. The city of Manyang is not just a place of action, but an independent character. The whole city, as an integral living system, exists according to its own laws. The Beyond Evil story is the story of Manyang's illness and healing.What's also great about the Beyond Evil is that there is no moralizing in it. Despite the great semantic load, the author does not reduce everything to one idea, does not teach, but shows reality in its complexity, even paradoxicality. Each character is a part of a big picture, an element of the inner life of an integral system. But also everyone is a separate unique person, with their own choice and responsibility for this choice. The story of the Beyond Evil is the story of Manyang, but it's just as much the story of two people meeting. It is no coincidence that all the main scenes are ""doubled"". If you look at the titles of the episodes, you can see that the pairing is ""sewn"" into the very structure of the script. As if the whole story is a long dialogue between two, a series of questions and answers. Each character in the drama is interesting. Each has its own story, its own drama, its own unique personality. But the main axis of the whole story is the meeting and dialogue of the two main characters.Lee Dong Sik and Han Joo Won, so different, but equally extraordinary, strong in spirit, but practically buried under the rubble of their own psychological trauma. Throughout the drama, they continually drift apart and collide, let go and catch each other, meeting again each time on a deeper level. They go a long way from mutual irritation, exploitation, projecting their fears and expectations onto each other, to true mutual understanding. Throughout the entire drama, the characters stare at each other - with suspicion, with rage, with interest, admiration, tenderness. But invariably - with intense attention, as if looking for something very important in each other's eyes. And in the end they find and return to each other the opportunity to be themselves - whole, feeling, alive.In my opinion, Beyond Evil, like no other drama, showed us an example of perfect human contact. At that difficultly attainable level, when you see and accept another as he is, in his true essence. The bromance of the main characters of the Beyond Evil is so beautiful that it overshadowed all the drama love lines for me. In fact, this is a ""love story"" - like the love of one soul for another soul. Someone sees them as a mentor and student. Someone sees them as father and son or even as a couple in love. In my opinion, we were specially shown these relations at such a level of generalization that each viewer is free to interpret them in his own way. For me, they are the embodiment of the idea of an existential meeting, beyond any categories.The Beyond Evil is a theatrical chamber drama. But this simplicity of the means has a deep meaning. The real challenge for an artist is to show everyday reality as something magical, wonderful, and sometimes monstrous. And the Beyond Evil succeeded to create a heroic epic in the scenery of a small provincial town, where a butcher's shop, the basement of an old house or a reed field feel like a mystical place. Where dramatic battles and wonderful metamorphoses take place in the dialogues between the characters. Magic is created in the Beyond Evil, not taking away from reality, but immersing it in it. This is the fantasy world that really exists - in the space of the human psyche, in relationships between people.This is a huge burden on the actors. They don't just need to play their characters, the actors pretty much create the world and atmosphere of the drama. And they also need to show the development and even the rebirth of their characters. Many characters in the drama wear masks. But in the end all the masks will be removed, ripped off or washed away by the rain. And under someone's mask we will find a monstrous grin, and under someone's - a beautiful face. Shin Ha Kyun and Yeo Jin Goo play characters whose faces change throughout the drama. In each new episode, they experience new trials, different emotions, but their eyes express not only situational emotions, but also profound personality changes. In some scenes, they need to act so subtly that it is like walking on a tightrope. A slightly different expression - and the impression would be wrong. But the actors are perfect in every shot.The talent of all the participants has created an amazing artistic world. It's like the famous Doctor Who machine - more inside than outside. And you can dive into this depth over and over again, finding new nuances and meanings."
67,Beyond Evil,"Keep you on the edge till the end! Very well written, 10/10 acting and soundtrack!"
68,Beyond Evil,"This is my first ever review and im compelled to show my support, Shin Ha Kyun delivers a masterpiece in his portrayal of this character just like Walter White in breaking bad. The amount of emotions expressed and character development is nothing short of amazing. The story might not be the best or smartest, but the execution, story telling, characters development is definitely the best i have seen in a long time. Well done Beyond Evil."
69,Beyond Evil,This series is so phooking good...I literally binged watch really had goosebumps while watching everything from the starting to ending you felt immersed in this series... really awesome ! Highly recommended !
70,Beyond Evil,"Words can't describe how beautiful this k-drama is!!! After watching The devil judge I was hoping to find a k-drama that can satisfy me as TDJ did and this one did not disappoint me , love it and would recommend to everyone who want to watch it."
71,Beyond Evil,"I think Joo-Won and Jae-Yi deserved a relationship, but I guess it's my thing for a little romance. Besides, the serie is perfect. Everything on point."
72,Beyond Evil,"Really enjoyed the series and all its twists, but most loved the acting - so very impressive! Not just that of the main actors, but the supporting roles too!A not to be missed series for those who enjoy a good drama that's suspenseful and a psychological thriller!I would have given it a 9 ½, as it's not exactly all perfect, but I chose to round up instead as overall I think they have done a great job!!Definitely one of my recent favorites and highly recommend it."
73,Beyond Evil,"This is a top-notch TV series ruined by its final couple of episodes where things turn a bit too melodramatic. It seems like a common feature of Korean TV series to have soap opera like finales which is such a shame because the show was so fresh and original.The soundtrack is amazing, and so is the acting. Shin Ha-kyun, in particular, gives a hypnotising performance."
74,Beyond Evil,"The acting was 9/10 but the storyline had repetitive theme of accusing each other and too much boring conversation ,, too many psychotic people , not colorful ,dry , dark sorry .Vincenzo and it's okay not to be okay, we're top two plus start up , law school, and the others , were overwhelmingly better dramas that were exciting , adventurous, humorous, fun action pack and romantic."
75,Beyond Evil,"Have really enjoyed every Korean program I have watched. The likes of Signal for example is terrific. This however is simply awful. Managed 4 episodes before giving up. Slow, boring, annoying and unlikeable main characters, not even sure what the plot was as they didn't do any work trying to find the killer. A massive disappointment."
76,Beyond Evil,Rivetting murder mystery which keep you guessing where the 2 main protagonists did justice to this amazing TV Show. Was not really a conoisseur where K dramas are concerned but have to admit this GWIMUL is up there with others in this kind.
77,Beyond Evil,"If you're looking for dry-logic crime solving this one isn't for you, the story focuses on the emotional structure of the characters, I've watched too many psychological thrillers (it's my fav genre) what makes Beyond Evil special is that it has a realistic sense when it comes to the characters emotions you can easily understand and relate to, nothing exaggerated or artistic, they go through their own struggles while they have a twisted way of messing with each other's minds, especially Dong Sik and Joo Won, it's a very interesting dynamic and you needs some good attention to truly understand what they're thinking, especially Han Joo Won, for most viewers at first he's hard to read cause he's not self expressive but once you understand him he's one of the purest characters ever written, i find his emotional involvement in justice beautifully heart breaking, Yeo Jin Goo is one young genius actor."

156,Hellbound,"A Korean miniseries that offers a bit of everything for the viewer. It's a little choppy at times and essentially feels like two three-episode series stitched together, and at times it's rushed or too slow. But I enjoyed the religious-themed plotting and the way it's used to shine a light on various aspects of human behaviour. The CGI isn't great but the show is high on drama and I can forgive the occasional misstep for the exciting set-pieces it has to offer. It's not SWEET HOME, but it's better than average."
157,Hellbound,"I sat down to watch the 2021 South Korean TV series titled ""Hellbound"" (aka ""Jiok""), partly because I saw the trailer on Netflix and also because I was told that it was from the guy that made ""Train to Busan"". So I was gearing up for something spectacular, especially since the trailer was interesting.And I made it two episodes into the ordeal and then I just gave up. Wow, talk about a swing and a miss. The storyline told in ""Hellbound"" was just laughably poorly written and had nothing that appealed to me, to be bluntly honest. So this was a major disappointment.The storyline told in ""Hellbound"" was just downright boring, especially because nothing particularly interesting happens as you suffer through nearly 50 minutes of excruciating boredom with each episode. And it didn't help one bit that the character gallery in ""Hellbound"" was generic, flat, boring and had the appeal of watching paint drying on a wall.Now, I am sure that the concept might have seemed interesting when the creators were penning it out on paper. But the transition from idea and paper to the screen was just bland and anti-climatic.Visually then ""Hellbound"" was actually okay. But special effects can only do so little when there is nothing in terms of contents for a storyline or interesting characters.My rating of ""Hellbound"" lands on a generous three out of ten stars. And this is not something I will be returning to watch the rest of, since it totally fell short of providing me with anything worthwhile in terms of entertainment or enjoyment. Usually South Korea puts out fairly good movies and TV series, but of course it is utopia to think that everything that comes from South Korea is going to be gold, and ""Hellbound"" certainly was not gold."
158,Hellbound,"Korean Drama ""Hellbound"" is an atmospheric drama with a dark story and masterful direction.The drama has an interesting story to offer. Exploring the nature of men when an unexpected new element appears, changing the way we lived so far and spreading fear. Fear that is the common factor that everyone uses in order to achieve their goals. And the ending was masterfully handled as well, with a huge cliffhanger to prepare the audience for what is to come next.However, and apart from those, the drama felt hectic and partial. The pace was all over the place, with events following one another in a way that wasn't either smooth nor served the drama well. In addition, the drama was disjointed, as its parts didn't blend in together nor followed each other nicely.Finally, the CGI were not great, but the performances were masterful by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 5 out of 10."
159,Hellbound,"As daemons manifest on the streets of Korea, torturing and then incinerating their hell-bound victims, a brutal new religious hierarchy arises. Intentionally or otherwise, 'Hellbound' is a scathing attack on religion. In the face of horrific and inexplicable events, people desperate for answers turn to those who claim to hold a monopoly on truth, who take it upon themselves to rule in the name of the divine, who set the rules that define goodness and sin, and who quickly turn to coercion and force to supress alternate ideas and maintain their exalted position. The classic theological paradox manifests (reconciling divine love with infant damnation) and the fate of non-believers is traditional: immolation. I watched an English-subtitled version on Netflix, so can't really comment on the acting or the original script but I thought the series was excellent. The special effects are a bit weak at times but the plot is fast moving and compelling. The film has a bit of a scale problem, coming across as a bit of an isolated fable with little mention of the world outside of Korea or the response to the events from other religions, otherwise it's outstanding. Fans of Philip Pullman and Dawkinistas should especially enjoy the show's bloody spiritual excesses."
160,Hellbound,"To put it shortly, Hellbound is an interesting mumbo jumbo series, well-acted with a very good flow, some outstanding VFX, beefy ""things"" that would have been better depicted and shown as skinny witch-like creatures, some total nonsense along the way, messages that every viewer would decipher and analyze at his own pace and on his own belief.It is gripping with a compelling flow and finishes on a super high mysterious note that just shatters all viewers' built-up belief momentum up to that point and starts constructing a new brazen wall with unlikely bricks."
161,Hellbound,"Panic on the streets of Seoul, as three demons seek to harvest sinners souls, if you're one of the selected, there's no chance to be neglected, as a god has got you under his control - with the usual misguided disciples to help.If this doesn't get you thinking of your own mortality and the extents that false prophets, and those that feel they have more legitimacy, try to corrupt and misguide, then I'm not sure what will. Powerful and thoughtful stuff."
162,Hellbound,"EVERYTHING about this show is terrible, oh wait the CGI was decent but it last 2 minutes out of an hour story is stupid the acting is mediocre and dialogue dialogue dialogue and its BORING dialogue. So if you want to watch people talk and they talk about a story that is absolutely idiotic here you go. I read this is from the creators of train to busan, I really hope that's not true because train is an absolute BRILLIANT film this isnt even close to a bad high school documentary series."
163,Hellbound,"Hellnound: Korean horror series. Monsters/Demons appear chase sinners, rend them asunder and then reduce their remains to burnt bones and ashes. This is preceded by visitations by ""angels"" who tell the damned of the time and date of their death. A Cult leader claims that these deaths are god's judgement and the dead are sent to Hell. A Social Media influencer, Arrowhead, seeks out those who have been condemned to out them and also calls on his followers to attack wrongdoers. A condemned woman decides to allow her death to be live-streamed. The Arrowheads savagely attack the police, lawyers, anyone who aids the damned. Rather disturbing, especially the sociopathic Cult leader, Jung Jinsu, laughing at the idea that the police would investigate the will of god. The scenes portraying the relentless attacks by the Demons as they pursue, attack and tear their victims to pieces are really top notch horror. Mixed in with this is the tale of a detective, Kyunghu,n investigating the deaths and how Jung Jinsu involves Kyunghun's daughter in the cult's activities. Good and gruesome. Directed by Yeon Sang-ho (Train To Busan), written by Choi Kyu-sok. On Netflix. 8/10."
164,Hellbound,This one is not enjoyable.Main leads boring .Story script/dialogues not enthusiastic.Cinematography uninteresting and add not much.Just finish 4th episode and consistently used FF button since 3rd.Watch Host instead.
165,Hellbound,"Death Note but Light Yagami is actually Kami and he sends Shinigami to execute the victims.A new Korean horror added to Netflix. I came in knowing minimal about the premise and didn't watch any trailer videos. You should too, because the first 6 minutes of the series gave you an exact taste of what the show is about. Only 6 minutes and it would definitely hook you in, especially if you like horror.The first three episodes was what I call perfection. Since the show has only 6 episodes, it did not waste any time. Even though there's not a whole lot of time for character development, the pacing was incredible. The intensity was through the roof, and I was transfixed to the screen in terror of the inevitability that some characters would face.The last three episodes was where the problem with the show arose. The transition from episode 3 to 4 wasn't smooth because the pacing took a pretty big deceleration. It took some buildup and then the last episode became amazing and rewarding, similar to the first three episodes.Also, this show almost had no chill. It was very violent almost to the point of violence for shock value. Unfortunately there were scenes where people getting beat up that would be very uncomfortable for viewers. However, the portrayal of how cult or religious leaders could bend the meaning of an event or text and manipulate the mind of a large group of people justified the shocking violence of the series. The story worked this theme very well and hooked me in even more.Overall, an incredible and intense horror series that does not pull any punches. For sure for sure check it out. 9.5/10."
166,Hellbound,"""Upholding righteousness and justice in fear of damnation. Is that truly righteous and just?""Right off the bat, I must clear up some obvious misunderstandings! This isn't one of those typical Fantasy/Sci-fi/Supernatural shows that deal with Monsters or otherworldly creatures; as opposed to what Netflix might have suggested through their various promotional content on numerous social media platforms lately.This show goes way deeper in scrutinizing not one but many societal demeanours and it is indeed way more philosophic than you guys might have ever imagined!On top of having a powerful statement heeding Religious beliefs, faith, cults etc; Hellbound seemingly speaks against the core idea of Extremism, Radicalism too. The show with much profundity contemplates and argues the very foundation of this dangerous, self-destructive stuff, that can only give rise to chaos and social unrest in society.However, the exact representation here isn't as simple as it may sound. Believe it or not, It has got multifaceted layers of complicated matters and countless subtexts which can only be found out only if you pay good enough attention.Speaking of attention, the terrific writing willingly takes on the mantle and manages to withhold the all-important momentum and that too in a quite sophisticated manner! On the other side, you will get to know an array of versatile characters and each one of them's individualistic narratives that feel so relatable on so many levels!Let us all just appreciate the whole ensemble, the entire cast; who had shown tremendous commitment and sincerity to each of their respective roles! And kudos to the technical team (Especially, the guys who were in charge of the Background Score); for giving it justice from a technological stance as well.My main criticisms lie in its core storyline, which at times, reveals glaring loopholes and is yet to provide transparency in regards to a few of the questions that sprung to my mind. Even though, it was expected that the story would take more than one season to come to a feasible conclusion; got to admit, I was expecting to get at least some kind of closure."
167,Hellbound,"If South Korea had half the population and money of the US, nobody would care about Hollywood again.So far, so VERY good!What a year for South Korean shows!"
168,Hellbound,Ok first off the monsters are pretty cool and the FX are good but man does this thing drag on story wise.There is also this weird character with glowing makeup that is annoying has hell.All in all boring and i don't understand this 7 rating.
169,Hellbound,It's reasonably well acted and isn't as fast paced as trailers make it seem. The general idea is fine and I do like some of the characters however the storyline is a little patchy and some of the violence may not be to everyone's taste.
170,Hellbound,This show is so utterly ridiculous. In the modern world I cannot imagine a society reacting with such ignorance and stupidity. Hard pass on the next season if there even is one. Fans of this are low IQ fanboys and girls who will eat up anything.
171,Hellbound,"Korean shows are trending: a horror series in which hairy monsters send sinful people to hell in a very brutal way. According to the synopsis, one would have expected otherwise. Because Netflix advertised that creatures of hell walk on earth and draw people into their realm. That happens here too, but it's just the catalyst for the actual plot. Rather, it examines how such events change society. Monsters and The Manipulation of Mankind."
172,Hellbound,"The series even in its trailer shows some demon like characters but the series is about humanity and not those demon like characters. There are a lot of unanswered questions along with a few characters whom we follow from ep 1 and then suddenly they are gone. We don't see anything about them.Yet, I am very interested in Season 2 (if there would be any)."
173,Hellbound,"Do not watch the dubbed version, it is very bad and does not follow the Korean version. Watch the subtitles and it's a much better series, with much more emphasis on what it is trying to show."
174,Hellbound,"At first, I thought, these groups of people are betraying ordinary people to gain something. They are frightening them using special visual effects. But then all these assumptions proved to be wrong, there are actually some magic or power which has been punishing people who are sinners. But, I didn't understand, why the group of people who are frightening people for their own benefit, are left unharmed. But how? They are also sinners, some are murders too.Another thing, I didn't get. What is origin of the power(The monsters or the punishers, I dont know what would be more appropriate).There are just too many plot holes which doesn't make sense. Besides,I felt bored while watching this. I won't definitely recommend this to anyone."
175,Hellbound,"Interesting characters thrust into an intriguing fantasy situation. Good thrills, plot twists, and some action. But most of all, beyond the cool visual effects, the most compelling aspect is how people behave when presented with this predicament."
176,Hellbound,"The concepr is good but this makes no sense. How can an ""angel"" condemn a woman that has children out of wedlock but NOT condemn the leader or his followers that commit murder constantly? I'm into the 3rd episode and can't take this kind of stupidity!!! STUPID!!!!!!!"
177,Hellbound,A mysterious face begins to appear before individuals and inform them of their time and day of death. On that day and time three monsters appear and pulverise the victim. The world then becomes embroiled in mass conspiracies about why this is happening and for some it is entertainment and for others it becomes a way to head a new cult. A clever idea with impressive cgi monsters but it doesn't quite work for me and seems a little disjointed.
178,Hellbound,"Grey, gloomy, drab color palette at first turned me off. That is after a much needed catchy opening of events. But the more the story is told it becomes obvious. I've never seen this before. That is the thing with Kdramas. They take risks and carryout to their logical extend. Not all of them works but when they do it really hooks you in.It's a short series and that's good because there's a lot of explanation and heavy thinking time. For the magnitude to sink in. Either you (can comes to terms with yourself) live by a belief or not. Does life have a meaning? The show seemingly asks .And I like it. There is no comic relief but rather borderline jittery over zealous high with the Arrowheads. And New Truth, what a name for the religion, as whoever grab on to the headline in social media controls the conversation.At first everything is neat and tidy. Until the first prophet died. Then the baby dilemma throws a wrench to really complicates things. Of course the central question is waiting for us in season 2(maybe 3). What are those creatures and where do they come from? And Why are they doing thisThis is a fairly straightforward simple show. Because of the hefty theme. But it's setup is in the mold of a thriller."
179,Hellbound,"More than 53% of people in the world are believers in a religion. We have the freedom to be good or bad, but fear controls and directs the world. Fear of jail fines, of being persecuted or attacked, tortured, etc. But if fear comes from a god, to improve people it changes things and this series is proposed, both by the script and by the director. All series and movies do not teach something to learn because this is one of them, with a great job of interpreting the voodoo man, and the leader of the sect."
180,Hellbound,"More than 53% of people in the world are believers in a religion. We have the freedom to be good or bad, but fear controls and directs the world. Fear of jail , persecuted or attacked, tortured, etc. But if fear comes from a ""God"", to improve people, things change and this series teaches yo. Very good work both through the script and the film director. All series and movies do not teach something to learn because this is one of them, with a great interpretation of the voodoo man as the leader of the sect."
181,Hellbound,"I really don't understand modern tastes in film and tv. Just because it's a fad to like Korean content, doesn't mean it's all actually good.The premise is ridiculous, and the CGI is just so bad for content released in 2021. I've seen films from the 90's with better CGI.The acting? Atrocious, how can people possibly say this is good?I hope this ""fad"" dies quickly."
182,Hellbound,"Finished watching all 6 episodes in one night. It reminds me a lot of ""Death Note"" if you've ever watched that series but the idea of divine punishment for sinners and how it's received by the world is a lot different in this series or course. There isn't any explanation for the phenomena the people are experiencing...only that they must have done something to deserve their fates. The series drags you through 6 episodes (so far) that get more bleak and depressing as they carry on and then the series ends on a wtf moment. Hellbound is just not a satisfying experience to watch. There really are no redeeming characters and everyone seems to make deliberate bad decisions for the sake of plot progression.On a side note... Korean movies are also funny sometimes because only the police have guns so a majority of the ""violence"" involves groups of people or a person hitting someone with a bat or club. There is a lot of that in this movie and after a while those scenes get tiring to watch because it's almost like the people they're beating are made of rubber or something. After getting beaten nearly fatally by pipes and bats they just get up and start running like nothing happened. Not just in this series but in just about every Korean movie or series. It's kind of comedic after a while."
183,Hellbound,"This was a major disappointment for me, as the premise and promise of Yoo Ah In was very exciting and enticing. The story ended up being just okay, it was certainly interesting to see how humans strive to put meaning to unfathomable occurrences, and we see this reflected in real life too. Unfortunately after episode 3 the show grew boring, and it was just the same thing over and over again. The show ended with an interesting twist, I wish they had put that twist in episode 4 and used it to flesh out the rest of the show. Unfortunately this show turned out to be a violent, chaotic mess with no real reasoning or answers provided. I think a season 2 is highly unlikely, so as an audience we will probably never receive answers, which is annoying and disappointing. I would definitely pass on this one."
184,Hellbound,"Overall it was pretty good. Liked the concept, although at times the speech was a tad too repetitive. There were better off making 20min episodes instead in my opinion as some scenes just dragged on and on."
185,Hellbound,After seeing the cgi monsters i was like wtf it looks like some anime but that's where you gotta love these korean shows even though i hated those monsters looking kinda outta shape i expected something scarier than a golem but hey each one have their own imaginations. The character development and cult story arc was perfect .Waiting for season 2.
186,Hellbound,"The creatures are creative, new idea but directorship and story are too lacking. There are lots of nonsense no logic story especially conclusion in episode 6.Nonsense that the lady lawyer wont die and later become a super fighter stronger than man after short years. The baby video at the courtyard also did not proof to the people that he is a sinner. More over the baby did not burn is totally nonsense when the heat is so immense. Another nonsense that the guy beat at manignoring his job, while the cop also ignored his duty and arrest that man. The director is a 3rd rate and knows nothing about reality.There also lots of minor problems no logic in this drama. Although its short 6 episodes, there were too many illogical story because in 2021, dramas in Korea had improved so much but yet this one is still so problematic.I am also relieve that its only 6 episodes because it is very lacking of story points. However they will make a season 2 because they are too self-confident that they will succeed highly."
187,Hellbound,"10 outta 10? That cant be, guys. I don't see anything original in the story. And seriously even the CG is mediocre. Thriller? Na, not plenty. Jump scares? Pretty much none. The opening chasing scenes did made me laugh though (hence to me it more like a comedy). It's an average Korean series that is okay for someone to kill a boring night or two. I watched it coz my friend told me that many people have rated it 10/10. Heck, that must be a joke. That what friends are for!In the name of honesty I shall never recommend it to anyone, not a long shot."
188,Hellbound,"Hellbound is quite an interesting show. The show might say about itself that it's about demons claiming human souls and dragging them to hell. But actually the focus is on humans and their lust for power and what dogmatic thinking and power structures will do to a society.Yes there are these creatures that will kill humans in pretty horrific ways after they receive their death messages. Still this in the first season is more of a side aspect as there are groups and characters that try to use it to drive their own agendas.This is also proven by the way people speak. The death messages the victims receive are called ""decrees"" and the killing by these creatures is always named as ""demonstration"" (of god's will).Fact of the matter is though that throughout the episodes there are a lot of unanswered questions and new questions always pop up - especially at the end of episode 6.The first season is actually split into two sections (episode 1-3 and 4-6) where you can say that both sections are basically a movie on their own. Between both ""movies"" there is also a shift in terms of main characters. Episodes 1-3 have different leads compared to episodes 4-6 and some characters from the first part only play a secondary role in the later episodes.I heard some people complain that the acting is bad but I disagree. The acting is actually pretty good overall. But I've been watching the show in Korean with English subtitles. So I'm hearing the original actors voices and from what I can tell they are doing a very good job.With some of the things happening in the story I've been thinking whether or not the writers wanted to draw some parallels to what has been happening with Covid and the vaccines (""be a good citizen and get the shot or you may get god's punishment ==> covid""). But I can't say that for sure and it may only be my own interpretation.Anyway I'd recommend to give Hellbound a chance."
189,Hellbound,After a fairly slow start I started to really enjoy it and as TV series go it's one of the better ones.It's a very interesting series and had they pitched the idea of the series to me I couldn't have seen how it would work... and yet work it does!The only troubling part for me was the end of the series... as these South Korean films/series do... they tend to cross the line for me and in this instance it was with the baby.7 out of 10. Recommended.
190,Hellbound,"Netflix is back with another Korean web series as Hellbound started streaming barely a week back. The success of Squid Game must have prompted the makers to go online with the product which mostly appears to be hastily made, hurriedly edited, and forcefully given the final look without even thinking of a fitting finale. Maybe that is the reason they halted in the midway and paved the way for a sequel series as they did not have a proper plan on where to take the story.Even though the show has enough pace to sustain for six long episodes, the logic behind making such a show is barely understood. Has Netflix gone mad after minting money with Squid Game, that it forgot to even review what they are showing? Even they did not bother to lip-sync the English dubbed version and in most of the scenes, the quality of dubbing resembles those dubbed movies back in the '80s.Character portrayal is ludicrous, camera works half-hearted, editing poor and acting over the top. This is in a nutshell, the review of this odd show. In the scenes where the Arrowhead YouTuber appears, you feel like damning yourself against the TV screen. The principles of The New Truth Society are watery thin and those are annoyingly self-contradictory. The horror value is so imbecile that you may recall those cheap, poorly made zombie movies made when you were a toddler. Even they did not hesitate to hire the VIP scene from the Squid Game, so low they stooped to in the rush of making a web series just for the sake of keeping the Squid Game hype alive. Normally this type of show thrives on the CGI values which keep you glued to the screen. Unfortunately, Hellbound comes with the weakest CGI I have watched in recent times on Netflix.Avoid this nonsense joke. Spend your hard-earned time on something more meaningful on Netflix. And do not go by the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. IMDB this time is closer to the truth.My Review- 4 out of 10Available on- Netflix."
191,Hellbound,"This is really good. SK is knocking it out of the park on Netflix. Effects are good, story is intriguing...the English dubbing is much better than Squid Game, although the police lingo translation can be a bit comical. Regardless, Definitely recommend...excellent cult/supernatural drama."
192,Hellbound,"The premise is brilliant but the story was dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. It is hard to believe no police force or political leader dared to challenge Fascist gangs led by a Youtube personality in blacklight makeup. Koreans are apparently made of stone and are immune to massive head trauma.I wish it better explored backstories of people burned alive by interdimensional beings. Also, does no other country in the world exist to react to these happenings?Entertaining, but not as nuanced as Snowpiercer or Squid Game for social commentary."
193,Hellbound,"Hellbound is a dragged-about-through-the-muck, lackluster attempt at horror. While it is, at times, gory (a little too gory, really) it especially drags between the scenes in which poor souls are dragged about by those oversized, grey gorillas.None of what happens has any meaning. Whether that's classified as existential or nihilistic, either way it's always bleak in an unfulfilling way.My family bought into the reviews claiming the naysayers don't know what they're talking about. But alas, the naysayers got it right. Korea does put out more consistently good quality entertainment than Hollywood, but they spit out some duds as well. Nobody can escape it entirely.HB is watchable, but our opinion is that it's not worth the time nor the effort. This is not Squid Game, in which there's shocking violence, with some blood and the like, but no gross-out gore. Squid Game, furthermore, has no gratuitous violence: It all reinforces the horror that society creates when it's ""Every man for himself."" Kingdom is another horror offering out of Korea that's done exceptionally well, with nothing feeling out of place.HB seems to have nothing in place. The plot twists don't pack enough of a wallop. The plot pivot at the halfway mark is strange, with neither half of the show being wrapped up completely. There are some likable characters, but they drift away, rather than find any permanent resting place.HB's worst sin is that it's boring. It did not hold the interest of anybody in my family, and we're Kdrama fans. We stuck with it, as that's our habit, and we also kept hoping something would pull it all together. Abandon hope. Nothing gets pulled together. It could actually be by design, in order to underscore a nihilist theme. By saying that there is design is as generous as I can be. It's entirely possible that there's none. It's difficult to tell.Having said all the above, HB is still superior to most of Hollywood's horror offerings which depress the IQ, and heighten sadistic indifference in the viewer. HB absolutely will not do that: Your IQ is safe from being dragged down by it, and your sense of empathy will not be preyed upon by it. HB has some truly good elements that were left unreconciled in a string of missed opportunities. That's what fans of the show have likely connected with.As a piece of horror, HB's around a 7/10, but in entertainment value alone, it's in the neighborhood of 5.5 - 5.9, and definitely under a 6. My son was emphatic about that.Unfortunately for HB, after being starved of quality entertainment for too long, Kdramas shocked our systems with quality overload. Now our standards have shot up heavenward.If blood&guts is your jam, HB is gory. In fact, it's uncomfortably so. There's only a half dozen or so such scenes, however, none of the deaths are quick, and all of them are tortuous.We are new enough to K-entertainment that we haven't seen many horror pieces. As previously mentioned, Kingdom and Squid Game are far superior to HB. Tunnel is a cop show involving a serial killer, so it isn't far from horror, and Tunnel is excellent. Black is another police/fantasy drama that is quite close to horror. It's depicted on screen, but even more so, there's horror of the mind. Black is a profound work with no wasted dialogue: Almost every line connects to another element in the show, building a complex work of art. If you aren't sure what to watch next, those should not disappoint.HB is a big letdown -pun intended. Repent, turn back, and save yourself from the mediocre forces that will definitely drag your evening down, if you give in to them.Quote:~It seems that none of us have the right to make decisions for ourselves.~IMHO...

194,Hellbound,Its another freaking cop/detective show with demons maybe every blue moon yet people are praising it cause its from Korea.Yeah.. no its a joke especially considering people are claiming its by the people who made Train to Busan; more than likely its made by the people who made its sequel.
195,Hellbound,"I was mostly cold watching it and waiting for it to pick up . I managed to get to the end and i am now very curious to see what happens next. Korean dramas usually have 16 to 20 episodes so I am guessing they did with this one like they did with Kingdom and divide it in two parts. I was expecting more for the first part but I am hoping it will compensate in the second .For the rest, the show is well made, great acting ( Yoo Ah-in is just chameleonic in everything he does) . The effects are outstanding, the quality of the series is evident and the concept is very original. It just lacks pace and thrill, most of the time but we will see what happens next."
196,Hellbound,I gave this a 10 not because it's worth a 10 but it shows excellently why religion (in this case Catholicism) is a crock of s.... as performed by mankind. I don't know if the writers were aiming to show Christianity in this light. Turn the other cheek..er no not this lot. Love thy neighbour...er not this lot. Thou shall not kill er....not this lot etc etc etc. The series shows quite well the vigilantism and stupidity of people as they watch others condemned (supposedly) to hell but then go and do the exact thing that will send them to hell!! Maybe I'm thinking deeper than the writers intended. Maybe it's a yarn about monsters? Anyhoo I found it very entertaining in that respect.
197,Hellbound,"The Koreans are knocking out some great TV ATM, some better than others. First up, just want to put it out there, I hated Squid Game. Probably not a trendy thing to say, but just found it very sadistic, unlikeable characters, and no real storyline. Boring, repetative pointless. So if you enjoyed that, you might not enjoy this. Hellbound is in a whole different league. It is more of a proper horror series. It does have a fairly straightforward storyline, just throw in a handful of hellish monsters, a manipulative internet cult (aren't they all?), and some death premonitions. There are some truly horrific and gory scenes scattered throughout the series, but I think what I most enjoyed, was the gritty realism. I know when you're dealing with these sorts of topics, realism is a relative term. But in this show everyday life continues around the bizarre unfolding events."
198,Hellbound,"Really enjoyed this romp through the supernatural. Some death premonitions, hell creatures, a twisted god/death cult. People are confronted by visions that tell them when they arte going to die. There aresome twists and turns along the way. It has the usual bizarre subplots you expect from a Korean movie. But for those whos thought Squid Game was an overated piece of trash, you might enjoy this,"
199,Hellbound,"Massive plot twists, impressive set pieces, urgent pacing and a unique narrative structure. Raised by Wolves and Hellbound are the only two tv series that truly shows you how religion is the ultimate evil in our world , and the absolute disgusting stupidity and irrational behavior of humans. IF you advocate for things like Reason, Evidence and critical thinking, then this show will comfort your intellectuality."
200,Hellbound,"This series should've been much shorter, the last three episodes were the core of this series. I felt that they stretched the series too much, the first three episodes could've been much shorter and the whole series can be actually made into a movie with two and half hours run time.The series ends in a decent way telling people that there will be a season 2."
201,Hellbound,"Amazing boring probably the worst Korean series ever watched. Tasteless, meaning less, story less it was less in everything. Don't waste your time, you will be highly disappointed. Still don't know why it was in Netflix.. Netflix should watch 1st then put it.. What a crape."
202,Hellbound,"Korea is putting out more quality entertainment than Hollywood these days for the simplest of reasons, no agenda, and this offers what Hollywood movies used to, escapism.Most rational people want to watch a series or movie just to unwind and lose themselves in a good story for a few hours without being beaten over the head with wokeness, and Korea gets that.Now don't get me wrong, Hellbound, or Jiok, has it's flaws. It's very slow and meandering at times, there was an action scene where they won the shaky cam award of the year, some characters just vanish after the time jump with no explanation, but it did it's job of keeping me watching.Hopefully there will be a second season as it does end on a very interesting cliffhanger.Recommended as long as you have a good attention span."
203,Hellbound,The concept is interesting and original yet the plot is so badly executed... it feels like 3 episodes would be enough... when things started to be interesting again it was over.... CGI are just good... in some cases they are really bad!. Still waiting for the 2nd season maybe they will do a better job!
204,Hellbound,"There is speciality in K-drama is its always have something that suprised and kind of new .the supernatural part in story is small but reaction of humans in it is amazing , its a must watch series,action scenes are missing otherwise its must watch series."
205,Hellbound,"Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 1/2.Desenvolvimento: 0/2.Estética: 0/2.Personagens: 1/2.Entretenimento: 0/2."
206,Hellbound,"The trailer and all the hype created by media on this made it a definitely watch for me. The 1st episode didn't disappoint and it peaked my interest.However things fell flat after 2nd episode. The story completely stopped making sense and the way it was progresses was just boring and not enjoyable at all. I finished it anyways since it was only 6 episodes but this was just bad, very bad experience."
207,Hellbound,"One of the original and thought-provoking shows I have ever seen. It is dark, brutal, sensitive, engaging, religious, and philosophical. It talks about how humans can be so worst when it comes to being successful. Though some may find it boring as it is not for everyone. The climax blows your mind with 'WTF?'. Can not wait for season 2. Highly recommended! ❤"
208,Hellbound,"When you think of the billions of people in the world and how they all came to believe the same religions based quite often on books and hear say from prophets both old and new. Its quite astounding the investment in money, time and space in their thoughts that people give over to something that technically isn't provable. Christianity etc. This show looks at what happens if events in the modern age were to occur, supernatural/relgious and with the wide use of photography and video, how would the world react. Should people with proof via video and proof from their own eyes simply bow down to new religious orders that pop up? Or should they ignore their doctrines and stand against any religion or supernatural entities judgement on their lives? This questions asks a lot of interesting hypotheticals and plays with them in an amazing fashion. Not to give much away of the plot, apart from saying that 3 creatures start coming into the world and bringing death upon apparent sinners who have been warned of their death prior to it occuring via the prophecies of supposed angels. It stirs up amazing questions of free will, the god question, separation of church and state and how the media should be neutral to hardline religious values and doctrineThe show has a great pace over 6 episodes and it feels longer than it was, but in a good sense as nothing felt rushed and there were excellent payoffs. I would recommend it for anyone who likes science fiction or perhaps a bit of philosophy in their shows. The acting was very good as was the special effects. Another great show from Netflix so soon after Squid Game from South Korea. 10/10. Couldn't recommend it any higher."
209,Hellbound,"I like slow burners for psycological thrillers, but a sci-fi fantasy like this needs better pace. It is still worth the watch though. The acting was good, and Korean films and shows in gemeral have really been picking up the last couple of years."
210,Hellbound,The execution is slow & boring. The first 10 minutes of episode one started of very good but then there is just talk talk talk & a 10 min scene you've been waiting for to happen. Still the idea was interesting & the acting is pretty good that give you a reason to watch another episode. But the Arrowhead guy was so annoying af man!.. And Stop comparing this to Squid Game this is nowhere near.
211,Hellbound,Very entertaining original story. Shame only 6 episodes. What happened to the detective from the first part of the series? Good to see a female in a strong lead role. Really enjoyed have no idea what is going especially with the ending I mean WTf! Can't wait for S2.
212,Hellbound,"Hellbound was re-released on the comics platform Webtoon as the show aired on Netflix. I didn't know neither the comic nor the show, and it didn't seem like what I'd usually read on the platform.I gave the show a try, and it made me curious about the comic.The comic is way darker than the show so far, but the show is not as bad as what some reviews suggest. Yes, the execution might seem a bit flat and slow at times, but it also depends whether you watch the show in Korean with subtitles, or dubbed. The Korean version is much better. They also have many characters to introduce in just a few episodes, so the storyline might lack speed in the first two episodes.The story is about us, humans, paying for our sins, and mystical creatures descending on Earth to make us atone for our sins. It criticizes the inefficiency of our judicial systems, and whether humans can truly just other humans for their crimes and sins. It makes me wonder whether all sins should be judged the same: to be sentenced to Hell, as the story may suggest.Watch out for the acting of who plays Jeong Jin-soo, that I find terrifying. 😱 He seems to be able to show such a twisted mind. Who is the real evil?One giant miss: the creatures (grim reapers?) seem to have a much more twisted and sadistic personality in the comic."
213,Hellbound,"So take Warrior Nun tv, Death Note manga, and Save Me kdrama; then combine them together. And you have Jiok/Hellbound.The concept is really interesting. Especially when it is combined with the character building, drama, and handling of death. It honestly feels like a extended metaphor on how humans in the past, used to sacrifice virgins. In order to please the ocean gods from Tsunami's and other natural disasters.However, its GREATEST weakness. Which many shows suffer from now in days (I'm looking at you Jupiter's Legacy). Is being way too long and drawn out for the story they are trying to tell. 6 of one hour episodes did not suit this. Instead, 3 OVAs/Movies would be better. 1st ending on the death of the original chairman of the religious cult. 2nd ending with the parents protecting their baby from being hell bound. 3rd OVA/Movie can then close the cliffhanger.Speaking of which-another knock against Hellbound-it ends on a cliffhanger. By bringing one of the hellbound-victims back from the supposed hell. They would have been better off leaving it open ended. With the lawyer and baby driving off with the Taxi man, saying that ""man should determine their own fate and how they live/die."" Because I don't see how this gets green-lite another season.If it did, I could see it turn into some sort of alien vs human battle, and that would be pretty cool."
214,Hellbound,"It's very interesting I wanted answers and that kept me going. After 6 episodes I have even more questions and my mood is ruined.So many tragedies and brutal scenes, it was literally awful to watch, I hated watching it, but curiosity kept me going.It was a beautiful day today. Sunny. I should have went outside, bake a cake or something! Instead, I wasted my Sunday, and I feel bad."
215,Hellbound,"I won't lie, episode 1-3 are boring because in my opinion the writers failed in introducing the story, be as it may I myself wouldn't pull it in 2 episodes given that you have to introduceReligion, politics & conspiracy in 60mins and on top of that you have to bake us with developing characters so we know who is who and why we hate or like them.Episode 1-4 &6 summarise 80% of the whole season if you don't care about character development.If ever there will be a 2nd season, I urge the writers to go deeper & hard on the subjects.In this season they played over the surface and we had no time to even think deep but to agree or disagree here & there."
216,Hellbound,"There's quite a lot to say about Hellbound and it requires me to both watch my language and to hit the spoilers tag.Because dang it if this didn't do a lot. Little of it brilliantly, quite a bit lacking and a lot badly.Let's get things out of the way, what we can expect to happen in the next few years (written Dec 21) is to have what appear to be demons randomly attacking people for no apparent reason and killing them. That sort of makes perfect sense when you think of how things have been going, it's a ""yeah that might as well happen.""But to be serious, we have an intriguing plot ""things appear, say people are going to hell, other things appear and burn them to death."" and a single incident ensues that sends the world into a tailspin of nightmarish overreaching religious zealotry where people will throw their own families to the dogs just because they ""think"" they are ""sinners"".It's an excellent premise and it's what kept me hooked for the full run.BUT.Oh lord did this series go all over the place, from the first set of episodes where everything is set up, from Jin Kyung-hun trying to solve the case to his eventual fall and defeat to watch as Jung Jin-su is killed so he can save his daughter.Or the secondary plot where it's jumped forwards 5 years and it's now about a newborn baby about to be killed and the world is under the control of the New Truth.Or the side plot about Min Hye-jin at first being a lawyer (with apparent unlimited resources) that somehow survives a brutal gangland beating to become an underground leader of a subversive army that works against the New Truth to hide the deaths.This story could've been done better being stretched out, season 1's 6 episode run for the build up of the reveal that Jung Jin-su is just another victim and is clinically insane but has built a cult around that insanity.Leading into season 2 where everything's gone to heck and a handbasket and everything is worse, leading to the reveal stinger for a season 3.Add to this quickly boiled over plot that doesn't give the viewer time to breathe and add the all over there plots that either don't go anywhere or are useless to the narrative.This failed terribly to do a decent job.Is it a good series? No, not really, I didn't find myself enjoying anything, the dub is - as always - horrendous, the story makes zero sense in context, Jung Jin-su was the first ever chosen for this, and it was 20 years? Why? What is the face and why is it doing what its doing, the demons aren't bothered with collateral damage but they'll burn innocents if they are in the way of geting their actual target?Nope, not good.I give it just over 5 stars for the premise, the decent enough effects for a Korean show, the acting for SOME of the cast and the commentary of how cults are built.But this was a mistake, I'll never watch this series again."
217,Hellbound,"It's a decent show, I liked it. It was pretty darn brutal though, which got tiring (for me) at times, never boring though. Then, by the end, what I thought would, or might, happen, didn't, and I'm really looking forward to season 2 now. It's a bit cheesy in the very beginning but that passes, and you can really tell that they put a lot of money into the effects.It's definitely not for everyone but it does have a good payoff for those that stick with the 6 episodes."
218,Hellbound,"I really like a lot of the movies the director has made, but can't say I really enjoyed this show. First off, there's no mystery as to the supernatural phenomenon that's happening, we get told about it straight away in the first episode and that's it. It would have been more compelling to frame it in a way where we as the audience are also not sure of whether they are real or not. Also, the message of the show seems to be a verryyyy heavy-handed ""Cults and/or groupthink is bad"", which sure, I get it, that's pretty dang obvious.The villains are also just so one-dimensionally evil, like the main deacon who seems to have no character arc other than following the cult leader despite abuse. Then you have the arrowhead punk members who believe the demons go after sinners so they, uh, beat and kill people? Yeah, logic is also not this show's strong suite. In the third episode, the main cult leader gives a long speech to the detective about how people interpret the phenomenon that was honestly so hard to follow that I wondered if someone had messed up the subtitles/translation.It's a shame, because the premise is really interesting, but the execution is just so bland it just comes off as a very surface level condemnation of blindly believe in corrupt authority figures, without bringing us any closer to understanding the phenomenon."
219,Hellbound,"I have only a mild interest in K-dramas. My usual reservations are artificially extended running time, inconsistencies, and soap opera-like abundance of romance, usually because of the studio executives meddling.Hellbound seems to have allowed Yeon Sang-ho (the director) run with his concept, and implement it just the way he wanted.Hellbound is mesmerizing on several levels. It paints an unflattering picture how ideologies and organised religions rise to power, but also does not scrimp on action (mostly brutal and disturbing). People complaining about the slow pacing probably just wanted to see a horror flick about monsters. Hellbound is more than that, and the pacing is just right: enough to tell the story, but not long enough to bore the viewer.The acting is great as expected, and the way the story is broken in two arcs, also works very well. The violence is over the top at times, but it does not detract from the story, and enhances it.The twists are really unexpected, and so far, keep making sense. I do hope more will be explained in Season 2."
220,Hellbound,"For me it was okay as a short series; good CGI and the acting was fair.If ""God"" is selecting ""sinners"" why weren't any of the current Cult leaders and staff called for demonstration? The original head-honcho had 20 years to get his death in order, but the rest...nada. Also, wouldn't there be millions of ""sinners"" torched across the globe?It was an entertaining, although repetitive series, predictable and six episodes was enough."
221,Hellbound,"First of all the concept is really intriguing and I think it could have been executed well. This is a massive disappointment especially considering the hype and promotion it had. The plot is just so idiotic and most of the times the characters decisions don't make any sense. If you're going into this expecting some train to busan type thriller, you'll be in for great disappointment. The acting and CGI is also very shoddy. The backdrop somewhat makes it bearable but overall, it's a no from me. Only plus point is that you can binge watch it fast since only 6 episodes."
222,Hellbound,"...it gets slow and (for me) much less exciting. Pity actually.The killing scenes are very violent again, as often found in films from S. Korea. Lots of (endless) talk about God, hell, punishments, sins etc. But after the promising intro in episode one very little action afterwards.Sorry, but after the intro in the first episode and the wild chase, I expected much much more. Turned it off during episode 03, season 01."
223,Hellbound,"You start out watching the show thinking 'this is what it is and what it will be'...but...then things change...and change.Really, really well written show and can't wait for more seasons."
224,Hellbound,The korea fanboys and girl are celebrating everything that is korean. Dont listen to them. Its not that good and overrated. Not like squid game (squid game was awesome) but this is a big F.
225,Hellbound,"My expectation was a little bit high manly because of the trailer, but the show is very well-scripted and well-paced, so it didn't disappoint me much. You would be surprised to find that there's no any ""fat"" in this show. Even when the pace is slow, it doesn't drag. It shows the right amount of what viewers need to see from one another which also proves that the show is very well-edited. I watched all 6 episodes in one sitting. The last episode is truly a masterpiece.Now cons, the biggest problem I've had was that actors and actresses look too generic. I don't watch many korean shows, but I don't think this is usual thing by korean shows standard. Maybe the show's creator intended to hire everyday people looking actors who I can see them on the public transportation or grocery stores. I don't mind that if I watch documentary, but this show is for the entertainment. They should have employed actors who could enhance the characters by their own characteristic looks. The casting is the weakest one in this show. Also the cinematography is mediocre, and 6 episodes on 1 season is way too short. It feels like they took my dish away even though I only finished a half.P. S. I'm posting my review again because it was deleted somehow? I didn't break any rules, but it was deleted. The only thing I noticed is that it was getting a lot of attention since I left an early review. I assume some people reported my review because I gave a good review on this show?"
226,Hellbound,"The series is excellent; the way the events are presented is good; and I have to commend the work's writing, which is flawless; and the characters are amazing; and I liked that the latest is divided into two chapters, the first three episodes and the last three episodes; however, the first episode is not very interesting, which is to be expected because it introduces the events, story, characters, and so on; but you must continue watching because after the first ep the events will become more exciting and intresting and I am very surprised because this work is not famous and it is underrated. And the end of it of course lead us to second season."
227,Hellbound,"This is honestly one of the best shows. It has great acting, a great plot and story. The philosophical side to it and the meaning behind it is just phenomenal. The ending was very good too. A must watch."
228,Hellbound,"The initial concept is interesting--these people are ""selected"" to go to hell and told exactly what date and time that will happen. So then these 3 huge behemoths (hell creatures) appear out of nowhere and beat the crap out of the overly-conscious victims (I mean seriously, one bash in the head from those creatures and they would be knocked out). In fact, it was gratuitous, because if people know these creatures are coming, why don't they take heroin or some drug that makes them immune to pain? Because these creatures don't just send you to hell; they torture you first. But any human would quickly get knocked out by one punch, but instead, it shows them screaming until the very end. Gratuitous.OK, so then there's this cult called ""Arrowhead"" that builds up, that believes these Hell creatures were sent by GOD and the message is to live ""more righteously"" (obviously, right?). I mean, if God revealed himself today, and started sending people to hell in the most graphic way, wouldn't we all start turning into Christians overnight? You'd think so. But not this ""Arrowhead"" group! Their idea of ""living rightously"" apparently means to beat the crap out of (even to death) anyone who is...not like them! That's right? They beat to death this old lady, only because she was with a lawyer woman whom was simply trying to do her job to protect some person (she never prevented the hell monsters). So they just go after the cop, too, and end up kicking him, like they're full of hate. WHY?? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If they were Christians, they would be doing the EXACT OPPOSITE and trying to be good, peaceful, meek people waiting for Judgment. But no, they listen to this Gilbert-Godfried-voiced annoying streamer guy with war-paint on his face, and it's all about find out who the ""infidels"" (unbelievers are) and....beating them to a pulp! This happens so often, esp. In the 2nd and 3rd episode, I shut it off. I mean what's the point?Besides this, the show was boring and missed opportunities. For example, the woman with 2 kids who was sent to hell--we never found out what her sins were! She's just a working mom, so I was hoping the show would question our perceptions and show us how evil she was. But nobody figures out anything, yet the Arrowhead group are so convinced that she MUST have been an evil sinner regardless! The daughter of the cop gets roped in by the charm of the Arrowhead leader (the ""chairman""), but then he convinces her to find and then jointly KILL the suspect in her mother's murder? I was hoping they would show us that the old drunk man was innocent, but again, that plot point went nowhere. They just incinerate his body, and dump him into some field, I guess, as propaganda (why would they need it??). And why would she so willingly go along with murder? Stupid.Finally, we are to believe that a local police department is supposed to deal with these astounding incidents of hell monsters (on video!) beating and burning to death citizens? The feds never get involved? Just a local
police precinct? And those in that precinct are targeted and beaten up by the ""believers""? The show thinks we are IDIOTS.This show is no Squid Game, that's for sure."
229,Hellbound,"It's an overhyped series.1. It makes no sense. We've no idea what these monsters are or why they send people to hell until the very end.It's implied that many of the hellbound people didn't commit major SINS. What exactly are SINS in this context? Why are these poor people being thrashed & tortured? Even if they return at the end, the fact that they suffered greatly remains. So it's clear that the supernatural force at work here isn't righteous.2. People keep saying that this isn't about monsters at all, but about society & human nature. I'm sorry, are we supposed to be astounded by the discovery that humans can be terrible? WE ARE ALREADY AWARE. This has been seen in everyday situations. The only new concept here is these massive yeti monsters. So don't tell me it's not about monsters transporting people to hell when the show is literally titled HELLBOUND & it's very much about the freaking monsters.3. It's heartbreaking & upsetting. When I say this, I don't mean that I can't deal with sadness. SQUID GAME had some heartbreaking scenes. TRAIN TO BUSAN did as well. Those two were absolute masterpieces. Hellbound shouldn't be compared to them at all. I'm surprised at how many people say this is superior to SQUID GAME. In my opinion, No, it doesn't. I feel mentally exhausted after watching this series.4. Now, let's talk about the last episode. How exactly did the baby manage to survive? I was relieved that it was still alive, but come on. These monsters have huge rods for claws & a variety of contraptions ready to attack humans. You're saying that these ruthless monsters couldn't tear apart two fragile tiny people? What a farce.Overall, I've seen some bad shows, but this is one of the very few that I regret watching. I believe it has passed its redeeming value, & they will no longer be able to adequately explain it. But I'd be delighted to be proven wrong. Was it frightening? Yes, & it's upsetting. What's scarier is that it has a perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes.I'm done. I just had to say all this."
230,Hellbound,"So, waiting for the newborn to get kicked around by damnations fraternity team, otherwise, this is a pretty stupid concept for a show.There's no logic to the story."
231,Hellbound,This show is hell. The concept is bizarre and should never have been put on screen. Watching each painfully drawn episode is worse than being incinerated by the demons.
232,Hellbound,This show is boring and poorly acted. Netflix canceled a awesome show The last kingdom for crap like this. Netflix has lost their minds. They need to stop putting this crap out.
233,Hellbound,"For Me Hell Bound is such different show, and yet another fantastic series from Korea. But this time it's not as engaging as they made. Only 6 episodes but we can not connect with each & every character aside from that Lawyer. The way they present is all about God and the New Truth who is working for God who punished only bad people it's okay but they stretched all this in every episode. There areany questions which are unanswerable that how the god choose the perticular person for punishment? Is there any way to fight with Monsters? I don't know, I think it's all will be revel in season 2. Yes there are many thrilling moments. 1st live demonstration and the last one which was in last 30 mins that was quite thrilling and it's shocking. For me it's good watch!"
234,Hellbound,"The first 3 eps were good, but when act two started I lost interest. I endured to watch, but at the end of the sixth eps, I realized that eps 4, 5, and 6 could have been cut down to one eps and save the audience some pain. I'm sure there will be a series two, but I pray that they make it with less filler."
235,Hellbound,"I'm not a huge fan of Korean TV shows. I've taken a look at a couple before end passed on them. But Hellhound is a different show by any standards. I'll give you a waring though it is stressful to watch, it goes to place and put is characters through experiences and forces them into decisions that are uncomfortable to watch. It's compelling and fast moving, perplexing and exhausting. Very original and quite violent. The violence though bloody is more shocking because of who it is being visited on and how rather then the violence itself. You won't see a show like this anywhere else."
236,Hellbound,"The first episode, as in everything, tends to be slow as characters are introduced, but...
This requires an attention span and once given and applying critical thinking you can easily see that this is a searing black satire on the state of the world, the power of the internet, people's disinterest in the suffering of others as shown when a man when being torn apart everyone is more interested in filming the event on their phone.Some characterisation is a bit flat but that's not the end of the world for this series.A compelling, thoughtful series that deserves a watch.It does make you wonder if this based around the Orange Peril no longer in office. Vigilante groups whipped up by the internet...."
237,Hellbound,"The story of the film uses a subject that, although repetitive, can always be interesting, but the slow process of the story and deviating from the main path in many parts of the film causes the viewer to become frustrated with the series too soon and to be boring. The use of poor special effects and incomplete criminal process are other weaknesses of the film. In general, despite the good subject, the film has not been able to expand the subject well, and it is surprising why such a large amount of publicity has been done on such a low-quality series."
238,Hellbound,"I loved Midnight Mass. Here the premise is same as Midnight Mass but there are no preachy monologues and horror setting. But Hellbound is more violent than the former and is surprisingly bingeworthy. Other than the average VFX, all other departments are a big plus. Don't expect this to be a yet another Squid Game and watch it without any expectations. You'd definitely like it."
239,Hellbound,"Watched four episodes and nearly went into a coma... Very slow boring show with very little ""hell"" action and it's the same 3 bad CGI demons that appear... The image and trailers make it look very interesting and watchable! Don't be fooled by this."
240,Hellbound,"This show received some positive reviews, so I decided to watch. Unfortunately, I couldn't go beyond episode 2. BORING!I admit that the show started off cool in the very beginning, with the monsters and the police who seek to investigate. But thereafter, the show starts swerving and weaving in so many directions: there is focus on some religion cult, there are random scenes of some weird guy with a goat-mask on his head, there is some material concerning a detective's relationship with his daughter etc. The characters just start talking and talking and talking, and I found myself losing interest.I don't know what the show was aiming for, and I have no interest in sticking around to find out. Avoid this show, trust me."
241,Hellbound,This show deaserves atleast 9 giving 10 to balance negative reviews everything in this show was thrilling and exciting dont know why people don't like this.Just watch it and decide for yourself.
242,Hellbound,"I really don't understand the negative reviews about this.I thought it was a great series - visually impressive with good acting from the main cast. There were enough interesting concepts to keep up the intrigue and whilst the direction of some of the plot points were fairly obvious it was still done in an engaging way.Some people have mentioned characters and settings not being realistic, but apart from the suspense of disbelief that has to occur regarding the main premise of the show, I think that's part of the style. Whether it's representative of South Korean film making or not I am in no position to say - however, those saying it's boring must have the attention span of a gnat.It was an interesting move splitting the story into two parts and overall I think it worked well. I particularly liked the link between the nutty Arrowhead guy who did the live streaming and the final episode.The ending suggests that there may be the potential for a second season. I hope so, as I'd like to see where this goes."
243,Hellbound,"We all know it's an interesting concept, but they failed to give us something to hold on to. Basically, you have no positive or good characters/deeds to carry our attention, nothing to care for. At episode 3 i am watching this show with zero attachments just to see if anything interesting happens . And It doesn't! Sure, you see just how easy it is to scare people into submission when something they can't explain appears. And they all go into stupid mode. But we see that every day now. And that's something this show failed to deliver, a good positive balance to the story. This was just depressing throughout, with just a little bit of ""positive"" at the very end, but that wasn't enough to save this series. I will not waste my time with season 2, at best, i am going to look for explanations online and be done with it, just satisfy my curiosity."
244,Hellbound,"Despite some weak points, this show addresses many social, political, religious, media and moral issues quite brilliantly.The most obvious one is the religious theme - angels, demons, god, hell, etc. I thought some of the terminologies and concepts could be more abstract, otherwise it's too close to some of the existing religions, as a result, it may confine people to think about issues such as existentialism and morality through the lens of this or that religion, instead of thinking about them in a more open manner. The show is also a study on the frequently recurring contradictions between what people believe they're supposed to do and their ultimate deeds.I'm surprised few reviewers - even professional ones - mention references to the dictators in North Korea. Some nods to dictators - such as the giant murals in the New Truth building - are painfully obvious. Dictators and cult leaders are kind of two sides of the same coin, they bend the narrative, manipulate the public viewpoints, and filter what gets out to people. The show also reflects how some of the dictators could be immensely flawed - to say the least - and sometimes even dumb, yet they still have numerous followers, many of whom are intelligent, at their command. Human psychology is fascinating.Another interesting aspect of the show is about determinism and punishment. We often think we have free will, but how often do we have control over what happens to us, what we're thinking, and how much our actions will influence what will unfold. And if we don't have control over such matters, do we have free will? And who and how should someone gets be punished? Who gets to be the judge?The Arrowheads and social media are obvious reflections of our contemporary issues - addiction to screens, fake news, overconsumption, etc. I thought much more context could be given to the Arrowhead hooligans - how did they get to be so radicalized? It's an opportunity to draw ideas from extreme nationalist/supremacist/far-right ideologies. I'm not sure if it's a commentary on how our society has become passively complicit in crimes or just bad scriptwriting, but the scenes where bystanders are doing nothing when someone's trying to harm a baby or beating up an old man are, sad yes, but also inexplicably bizarre.It's my opinion that the artistic direction could be much less pedestrian, everything from when the snow falls, the soundtrack, how people interact with technology... could be much more imaginative. I know maybe they want the show to be rooted in realism, but when you already have CGI demons... you can veer away from exact carbon copy of our reality a little more.In short, Hellhound is one of the few mainstream shows that has the audacity to tackle many hard problems that plague our contemporary world head-on. However, I wish it would act more than just a mirror of our problems and present the underlying and often not-so-obvious causes. Also, alas, it suffers a little from overambition, there's only that much you can show in 6 episodes. Any one of the themes that they touch on can be the basis of a whole separate series. But it's perhaps great news for anyone with a short attention span - they can consume a maximum amount of materials within a minimum amount of time."
245,Hellbound,"I'm not sure I would call this show a horror, unless you consider organised religion a horror. Actually, come to think of it, I kinda do.Anyway, this show wasn't to my taste as it was about how religious zealots try to control people, rather than a supernatural horror. It was moderately interesting but just felt like a cheap network TV show. Oh, and the annoying YouTuber really grated. I literally had to mute the volume when he appeared and stick with subtitles only."
246,Hellbound,"This series makes a hell of a lot of sense if you clearly open your eyes to the world we live in today. Religion and Government play a big part of lives as well as social media.Script was absolute genius to include so much of religious and political drama going on nowadays.To me, this is a masterpiece series and best in 2021."
247,Hellbound,"This is a strange one. A philosophical 'horror' series which takes enough time (slow burn) to give us fleshed out characters, a brilliant storyline with incredible brutal intermezzos (and hopefully a second season)Not for everyone. For some it could be too bloody (and I would definitely don't recommend it for children !) , for some it could be too slow with not enough flashy things every single second, for some it will be not 'diverse' and 'woke' enough. But I loved it. A thought provoking horror.Another winner from Korea. Hollywoke has deserted us so other countries are filling the void and Korea is probably the frontrunner at the moment."
248,Hellbound,"One of the mixed bag things about Korean dramas is that they often are a big allegory. While not necessarily a bad thing, sometimes, like in this one, it gets too caught up in the analogy and forgets it still needs a vessel in which to carry its message. This vessel unfortunately sprung a leak and ran dry. As a result, and perhaps because it has themes clearly not intended for a US audience it loses both relevance and impact. Basically, its boring. It's hella boring. The first episode is ok. And frankly that's all you really needed. Nothing else really meaningful happens. Like a lot of Netflix content, a movie would've worked better than a series. Brevity is the soul of wit. It's not horrible, it's well produced after all but it's also a clear coat tail rider on the recent popularity of Korean dramas and one we absolutely could've done without."
249,Hellbound,For such a graphic and imaginative subject the script writers have managed to create absolutely no tension or characters with an degree of depth. Sorry I really wanted to enjoy another quality S Korean series but this is certainly not one of them.
250,Hellbound,"My first Asian show. I watched it and I enjoyed it. You have to look at it as if you're Korean, not American to enjoy it.The death angels were badass I was surprised at those who died."
251,Hellbound,"Yeon Sang-ho had a good premis here from hies original webtoon that he created a while ago. And so many peoplw liled it to the idea of him making it into a full 6episodes show.But the thing is...the show didnt ...hit anything..its as if its aiming at 10 different targets and not hitting each one spot on...
and in the end leaves more questions opned then answered and truthfully doesnt even answer any question...its like it has a tiny present of elements of suspense ...but nothing like train to bussan or other tv shoes where ur at the age of your seat...
the show is mostly.dialogs and the suspense moments are one or two short scenes an episodeits like it has horror elements..but really there is literely very littpe to none scarry monents here where i said i couldnt sleep after...it was suppose (based on webtoons video) to be this detective finding the ""truth"" about this beings...and sinners and whats actually going on...are they real ? Technology ? Is someone controlling them ?But no...no one is investigating that... no one is trying to answer that and even the show dont show any...""real"" reason for all of thisfinally they could also go to direction of action packed like..how would they go ahead hunting this same three creatures appearing...
and even though there is usualy a handfull of officers / guns... when they appear...literely no one is looking to how to destroy or kill them...lastly the thing korean shows have best is drama...
thats the last strew that i said ok maybe its a drama show. But again
i didnt care too much of any of this charechters enough..with all that cult / charechter / etc... you dont have enough time to invest enough in this charechters to have touching moments...
no love theme between any of them...no emotions that is like...you sinply dont get attached..train to bussan also directed by same guy was a masterpiece...
of emotions...drama..action..and suspensebut in here...mostly i think becaouse its hies project he was so excited he tried to hit 100 ideas that popped in hies headand in movies when you try to show too much stuff..ot never gives a good moviein the end episode there is some more open questions ..which i didnt care for really at that point ...
i dont know if this will recieve a season twoi hope it will and in next season just focus more twards 2 or so targets...back to basics of story telling."
252,Hellbound,"This is a great short series and done very well. Interesting characters and plot and well worth a look if you liked Squid Game. Reading some of the negative reviews in here, it would seem there are a lot of religious folk who have become very triggered by the series. The incredible irony is that they've completely missed the point of the entire show! 😂😂😂"
253,Hellbound,"I was truly looking forward to the latest work by director Yeon Sang-ho. I enjoyed Train to Busan very much and his drama ""The Cursed"" is one of my favorite from the past couple of years. Mr. Yeon certainly has his own world of zombies and the paranormal, and as with some of his work, many have been thrilled to go along with the ride. Unfortunately, this isn't one of his best. The convoluted storyline, frenzied action scenes, and poorly developed character backgrounds make this a very turbulent ride. There's no point in giving any summary of the story. Unlike some of his finer works, where you didn't want to get off the train even after it had arrived at the final destination, this made you want to jump off the train midway through. There was no denying the feeling that I had gotten on the wrong train after the first couple of episodes. It's a shame."
254,Hellbound,"All the lead characters are miserable -- not bad actors, but miserable characters.The story, unlike most K-dramas, is utterly lacking in charm. It's dismal, sanctimonious, preachy, melodramatic, and worst of all, extremely difficult to believe. Not the monsters -- if you've seen the previews, then you'll know whether you like them or not. I thought they were fine. It's the REST of the show that's hard to believe. Everything is completely over the top: crowds of people suddenly turning on the main characters, main leads getting roped into the story in multiple ways, etc. It's just bad, lazy writing.The monologues seem like they will never end. In four episodes, they never _did_ end. I assume the final two eps have more of the same.My wife and I really like Korean dramas. We've watched dozens of them, including crazy fantastical stuff like Strangers from Hell, Kingdom, Park Il DOH, and also more standard police procedurals like Beyond Evil. K-dramas are great. We love K-dramas.But we just couldn't finish this. It wasn't abysmally awful, but it was definitely a turn-off."
255,Hellbound,"The trailer looked cool. Nervous guy is in a coffee shop, the time changes to 1:20 and three huge smoke monsters crash through the windows, chase this guy down, beat the crap out of him and send him to hell. Great special effects & acting, so what could go wrong? Well, for the first 4 episodes (which are all I made it through), the smoke monsters rarely make an appearance. Instead the focus is on this doomsday cult and it's leader. Everybody just talks and talks and talks. The guy who said it picks up after episode 3, no it does not. I finally had enough of the boredom after episode 4. Maybe 5 and 6 are the best ever but good luck making it there."
256,Hellbound,"Unique story , different taste to series universe.6no.s of eps first 4great going and the end of series 5&6eps story got Tangled. But one time okay to watch .Unearthly beings deliver condemnations, sending individuals to hell and giving rise to a religious group founded on the idea of divine justice."
257,Hellbound,The scariest aspect of this show is how terrible it is. The horror scenes are ludicrous and and the convoluted agenda makes no sense. There is absolutely no justification for how this movie received a 6.7 rating.
258,Hellbound,"Although Christians, especially Catholics are one of the most persecuted groups throughout history, people still feel the need to demonize them and twist Christian belief. This has nothing to do with Christianity. If this were to happen we'd know this is now works of God. For Hell is not just physical damnation and hurt. Hell is the absence of God. The absence of anything good. Of love. No one can say for sure what it is really like, but we have an idea because it has been written throughout the ages. Nothing has waivered and all the prophecies of old have come true. We are told that we are not ones to judge others, unless we ourselves be judged first. To not cast a stone, unless we ourselves have never sinned. Christianity isn't about damning others. It's about loving others and forgiving. About true repentance of our own sins. Before acting like you know anything about Christianity and Theology, Apologetics, etc...Please try doing a little research. Please read St. Thomas Aquinas who is one of the worlds's greatest philosophers and theologians. He was wrestling with the simple minded new Atheist movement's dumb questions centuries ago. Please look up Jay Dyer on Youtube. You are some atheist who thinks your world view is locked and you know all the right answers, that shows how naive you are. You are not intelligent. You don't know anything. You will someday though.The most ludicrous part of this show is the fact that they made the one woman character who is a lawyer just magically be able to start to beat up dozens of huge guys at a time. Like a super ninja. I find that more insane than the CGI and big creatures. She just throws around guys 3 times her size like nothing. It's so stupid it hurts to even watch or think about. Feminism is a cancer. Look what it's done to the West. Good job Korea in letting that cancer take hold in your country. Your fall will eventually come as well."
259,Hellbound,"Excellent! The Korean film industry has proven once again that they far outstrip anywhere else for new and original stories. A bigger budget would have been nice. But frankly, it's not necessary with good storey telling and excellent acting. The rest of the world could learn a thing or two from this rather than redoing the whole thing over again and pretending their version is the original. Loved the ensemble approach. It was absolutely necessary to tell this kind of storey."
260,Hellbound,Basically is a boring movie.. What Jinsu do when 20 years he can life.. make people become afraid.. Arrowhead clown very annoyed but he died haha.. hye jin mom die hmm.. police do nothing.. the detective see her daughter after seen jinsu death also hang story.. a priest become stupid at this drama.. at the end 1 of those rise from grave 😆
261,Hellbound,The premise was good and the effects of these so called monsters/demons were stunning. But then the plot just becomes far too over complicated and muddy and really let's the series down. Could have been excellent but really let down by a complicated plot.
262,Hellbound,Hello guys I'm watched this full series all episodes and then I'm wrote the review this web series is full illogical nonsense do not acceptable. All things in this series is very badly present I'm unable understand what's going on in every scene.
263,Hellbound,"Boy, was this a miss for me. Even the concept was off. Three giant gorilla-looking monsters come and literally beat to death 'sinners', incinerate their remains, then jump in the air or through a wall and just disappear. That's it, episode after episode. You don't even really know WHY these people are singled out for 'hell'.Here we go with another recent Korean drama that's bathed in violence (graphic, graphic violence) just for the sake of it. Korea puts out fabulous, well-written productions 9 times out of 10 so why this sudden penchant for over the top blood and gore Netflix programming eludes me.On top of it all, everything was badly done-the CGI monsters, the amateur acting, clunky dialogue, and repetitive storyline was so boring amid all that bashing and blood that I gave up after 3 episodes. I won't watch violence just for the sake of it which is really what this series goal seems to be."
264,Hellbound,"I don't get the negativity for this show, I suspect the Squid Game effect is causing this as people are tuning in to expect more of the same.Hellbound probably shares the same DNA as the superb Midnight Mass without giving away too much spoilers.From the initial outset, as the show is from the director of Train to Busan, it might give the impression that it's an action packed limited series. Once that's over it's replaced with a slow burn of a plot that's never boring but I found to be highly engaging once I understood the subtext of it.I've watched many Korean drama's prior to this, and this didn't disappoint with it's gory and often horrific scenes, and thought provoking plot that demands attention."
265,Hellbound,This series shows us how humans can be easily manipulated by religious leaders. What really got me excited for the next season is that shocking twist though. The plot thickens! You'd have to see it for yourself because I don't want to spoil it.
266,Hellbound,"After watching the best series of the year ""Squid game"", I gave this Korean show a chance since people were claiming that I would like this since I loved Squid game.NOT true. I regret that I spent so much time watching this show, even if it was just 6 episodes. It is so silly, irritating at times and boring at times.The ""monsters"" are so stupid looking that I don't know who could think this is scary.There is no logic in the plot and the show is just a big waste of time. Do not bother to watch. There is so much out there to stream that is much more worth spending your time on."
267,Hellbound,"I am on episode 4, and I am not sure I will finish. There is WAY too much violence. The computer guy with the glowing makeup is stupid and annoying. I have just watched where a newborn is prophesied to not only die in 3 days, but, will go to hell. A newborn. WTF?"
268,Hellbound,"At first I started it with eagerness , about the idea and to get to understand why it's happening, but at the end there's still something missing, after the episode 3 i started looking for answers but I ended up with nothing and the end confused me a little more."
269,Hellbound,"I literally suffered through the hell this series was thinking it would amount to something- nope. Nothing. Slow, overdrawn dialog from very poorly acted and written scripts. Could've been a great premise if they actually focused on the ""hell"" aspect- but nope, just the same thing episode after episode. You will never find out what the demons are or what the angel is- i hung in there to find out- never found out. A big flat ZERO!"
270,Hellbound,The CGI with the angels of death are very well done.The rest is just plain bad and stupid.The story is no good and there is 3/4 talking in every episode and the dialogues are not the best.The actors don't pull it up anymore and only play mediocre.
271,Hellbound,"At no point does anyone in the entire series does anyone try and figure out what is going on. Everyone just accepts the events and the New Truth as if they have no minds of their own. In one episode, one character says half the world supports the New Truth. So 3.5 billion people don't even question what's going on? What about the other 3.5 billion? If you are hoping for a basic explanation of what's going on, you are not going to get it this season. This season really is in 2 parts. The events that happen at the beginning and then what happens 4 years later.The effects are decent. The last episode of the season is perhaps the best episode which bumped up my rating from a 5 to a 6. The show is entertaining but the writing needs to be better. The events may be supernatural but human beings are naturally curious. We want to solve the mystery but no one on the show asks how is any of this possible. Plus, there are roving gangs of believers that just assault and kill people openly and the police do nothing. One annoying video blogger is all but calling for violence and yet the police don't even investigate him. The roving gang even assaults the police and the cops don't go after them. None of these are really spoilers of the main story but it just shows the problems with the show. The writers need to do a much better job in the second season."
272,Hellbound,"It would have been better had the director handled character development better. Then again any character development entails reducing the pace of the narrative. Considering the number of reviews I read nowadays complaining of ""slow burn"", I guess makers traded off. It takes a chunk out of the series. There are virtually no characters you can root for, while the story provides no space for its actors to shine. So we are left with just one thing to keep us hooked: the premise. It is intriguing, no doubt. It is rich in its depth and vast in its scope. The first season ends with the series teetering on the edge. It could either go forth to claim greatness or retreat into the morass of also - rans.The Direction passable, while acting is competent. The production values are high, photography is good, and CGIs are good. The story moves forth in stops and starts. The script is riddled with plot-holes and takes far too many liberties with logic.But like I said, so much depends on here forth. A competent artist can take this and make something worthwhile, another .... well he would render it intolerable. After all even some of the best series had serious problems with their script but it was the man behind the scene who made us love them all.Watch it for the possibilities. Else wait for more episodes (if it gets a second season) to make your mind. It's good enough but just barely."
273,Hellbound,"Wow. At first I thought the show was trying to use monsters and religious gimmicks.to comment on the gullibility of humans.Amazingly, this show posed a series of questions that we don't have answers for in real life.Is goodness still good if it was motivated by a fear of punishment/desire for rewards? Is the justice system providing justice or just judgement?The characters were rather flat, but it didn't matter to me. The philosophical dilemma behind the storyline outshined everything. I highly recommend you to watch it but based on reviews I understand that it is not for everyone."
274,Hellbound,"I'll start with a question. Is it suidgame? No. Does that mean it is not as good? Also no. This is a different and unique genre of show. It almost plays out like an anime. The pace can be a little slow at times, but it is shrouded in mystery and I found myself watching all 6 episodes thanksgiving day. And can I just say; arrow head, to me is a completely realistic response to what would happen if such things as the ""angels"" were brought to the real world. Of course a crazy religious fanatic group would rise up and start targeting alleged sinners, would they live stream it to inspire fear but also to promote their group? Absolutely. Hell, (no pun intended) it happens now in the real world. We just don't have the demons chasing after us in between. I like the acting, the special effects, the drama, and plot. I just wish some more questions could have been answered."
275,Hellbound,"Like others have mentioned this just drags and drags. The idea was good, the effects were good, and the fight scenes were good too, but then you have the remaining 50 minutes of each episode and it just is soooo boring. I get that they are making a statement on society as is wont for Korean films to do, but at least make it interesting. I spent most of the time hitting the fast forward button."
276,Hellbound,"I'm being generous with the five simply because in the first three episodes you sort of feel the plot fleshing out, characters being developed, story advancing in an excitingly dark manner. But, by episode four the series does a complete 180. It gets super boring, no character has any meaning at all, or impacts the story at all. Some characters are completely removed from the show without valid reasoning.You can tell the director used his same schtick from Train to Busan because no one does anything at all to protect themselves or to negatively impact the villain in anyway; simply just do the exact opposite of what a person with half a mind would do. In that case, it makes it hard to feel sympathy for these ""stupid supposed protagonists"".By episode four it turns into a religious nut job overly zealous overly righteous freak show and loses anything of value. Whatever of the story is left gets completely tossed aside as these freaks seemingly, and without resistance from anyone or anything existing, take control over everything, to the point their beliefs go exactly opposite of what the story is trying to portray.Nothing is explained, nothing is solved, nothing really happens at all that's beneficial to the series. The CGI is atrocious, including the baby, and for the amount of time they show the baby, the producers should be ashamed.This isn't a horror series, it's a philosophical series about humans either succumbing to or defying god's will. The director/writer must have had a mid life crisis coming up with this one, and the final twist at the end doesn't help in the slightest, or make it interesting, since nothing was explained at all over six episodes."
277,Hellbound,"Well, I can't seem to get those ""monsters"" out of my head. I am not a fan of fantasy, superpower stuff, or horror. However, as I got into it, I began to view them not as actual demons, but more as a metaphor for the unknown, for catastrophic events or metaphysical chaos (for lack of a better word), over which we have no control. Live one day, die the next. If you make it several episodes in, you'll recognize the one where I drew this conclusion. I believe it's humanity's insufferable need to ""know"" that fuels religion, along with egotism, money and power. Stick with it and you'll see what I mean. You have to watch beyond the first two episodes to get what's going on. I would never let children watch, though. I am a grown adult, and it almost gave me nightmares."
278,Hellbound,"I don't understand the hatred and negative reviews this show is getting. I guess it's not for everyone (in a good way). Give it a try, it's definitely worth a while."
279,Hellbound,"Whoa what a series.. Korean series will not disappoint you *#Hellbound* ending messeges though
can't wait for Season 2
Worth to watch many times. Go and watch it definitely ull like it."
280,Hellbound,"Interesting watch. I liked the performances, premise and exploration of power. I also enjoyed the decision to not have a protagonist, it pulled the focus to the phenomenon rather than the characters."
281,Hellbound,"Another excellent and original k-drama series. The only negative I have found is that it's short! Hopefully there will be a second season as the ending of this season is the opening of a whole new era.!Of course the negative reviews are for those that came here to find another squid game...
If you liked Hellbound I recommend you ""Sweet Home"""
282,Hellbound,"I don't understand the negative reviews on here at all. I thought this was gripping from start to finish, and raised some great questions about how it's dangerous to follow without question. I really liked how it was split into 2 acts.I'm looking forward to see where they go with this in a season 2, because it has the potential to shape into something really exciting."
283,Hellbound,"This series is great, i watched all episodes on 2 days. It is also very well crafted and has a high-quality look. It is full of social criticism. Wanting something good can also turn out to be the opposite."
284,Hellbound,"I binge watched this yesterday.Very good series. Seems to be two parts. 1-3 and 4-6. Kept me engaged.Very unique and engaging subject. Kept me intrigued as to where it could end up. Admittedly, come episode 4, by changing main characters, tended to lose the focus a touch.My ONLY issue was the child not being taken. There was absolutely no reason for this to not happen. Those demons would NOT leave the child, as their only task is to take it. The parents being tied together would not stop them.I loved the uniqueness of the story and the take on the righteous - moreso the fact that there was randomness to those selected - so the human perception of hell was incorrect all along.Cinematography, like most South Korean shows, was first class.Reading the 'reviews' here - I need to state the following.1. CGI is bad. Then YOU go and create the CGI that YOU believe is acceptable.2. Story is bad. Then YOU become a screenwriter, get it funded, approved and make it workable in a series.3. Actors can't act. Then YOU become an actor and see what sort of range you have.So many people here must be exceptional in their own lives to pick apart content so easier and readily. Go into the world, create something that is universally loved, not as easy as it sounds."
285,Hellbound,Started well but somewhere script derailed. As the name suggest nothing like hellbound. Same thing happening again and again.Missed opportunity from the director.
286,Hellbound,The concept of the supernatural punishing evildoers resulting in a massive cult and mass hysteria was amazing! The actual product... not so much. The creatures were corny and the story was a mess.
287,Hellbound,"This is actually quite a surprising and good story. And, unlike Squid Game, it doesn't rely solely on violence, but actually depicts a realistic painting of how the world reacts to a horrifying incident.In fact, the show is more about society and how humans react to something horrible, than about the violence itself.And for that alone the show deserves praise. Because it criticizes society and possibly even silently criticizes what is going on right now in the world.But there's more.The show has good acting, characters boast a real development arch and the story has many surprising twists and turns that make you think. And, if that's not enough for you yet, it is simply exciting and the CGI is great!After having watched Squid Game partially (and giving that piece of trash a 1 star rating) I was very very pleasantly surprised by how good ""Hellbound"" is, in fact.Sure, there are a few minor annoyances. The change in behavior of the female lawyer? Hm. Not very believable. But that's about the only thing I have against it.Generall a very good show to watch, one of the best available on NEtflix currently."
288,Hellbound,No spoilers. Not what you'd expect. Worth watching. The show will make you think and is well done and we'll acted. Watch with subtitles as the voice acting dub stinks. Most bad reviews here sound like people didn't even watch the show.
289,Hellbound,This show is just awesome. All low ratings are here in imdb are fake. These ratings are by those people who thinks that this show is against Chrstinaty. But no this show is about spread fake propaganda using religion. Awesome show awesome details .
290,Hellbound,"It starts off with cool yet compelling supernatural events.There is a cult leader, emotionally burdened police officer and it gets really good with twists.But then somehow everything goes awry and feels like a completely different show.Original cast and characters in the earlier episodes is great.Looking forward to season 2."
291,Hellbound,"I watched the first episode for 10 minutes and thought the CG was poorly done and the premise was stupid. I stopped watching after that. A week later, a colleague told me that Hellbound is good and I should continue beyond the 10 minutes. I figured I can handle 6 episodes of this. And after the 6 eps, I thought this show is utter nonsense. Don't waste your time with this show. Overrated, rushed narrative and a story that goes nowhere most of the time."
292,Hellbound,"This series is definitely not what I was expecting when I saw the trailer. I was expecting a ""run for your lives"" kinda movies, but what I got was a damn weird family drama that doesn't go anywhere. A LOT (and that is an understatement) of plot holes, and very stupid characters. If something like this happened in the real world, I would expect the governments, military and scientists were the forefront of defense. But NOOOOO, let's turn our defense to the minor league religious cult. I know that some movies need to be watched from a certain perspective to make sense, but not this one. Not from a religion stand point, not from a scientific one, and not from a fantasy one either. So, what the heck is this crap ? I guess the title is befitting this series, as this one is hellbound. Do NOT waste you time on this one."
293,Hellbound,"In the end the first season of the series boils down to pretty much nothing. The whole plot feels like it was made up as it went on. Drawn out scenes add suspense but leave you hoping for more. Hardly anyone really tries to fight back and people's response really makes no sense. You would think that when people know they can go to hell for their sins they wouldn't start murdering in the name of God. I hoped for some explanation what the monsters are, maybe some mythology, but there was none of that."
294,Hellbound,"Here we go....with the popularity of Squid Game we now have many new trendy viewers watching Korean media. These low reviews saying it's ""boring"" after only watching 2 episodes is typical of the average viewer in 2021. If it doesn't have grown men flying around in spandex, or some controversial woke topic at it's heart people simply are not interested."
295,Hellbound,"Interesting plot but I can't describe how annoying, unnecessary and obnoxious is the colorful live streamer guy. I almost stopped watching the show because of this one character."
296,Hellbound,"I had zero information about this story, never read the comic or webtoon, and i didn't want to watch it at first (because of the bad reviews people gave) but I'm glad that i watched, it's pretty good, a little slow at times, but shocking and great story. Don't know why some people gave a low score, it's not squid game....."
297,Hellbound,"I dont understand what the hype is all about.The actors are good, their acting is superb.But the story...Why? What are they even trying to tell?Its like watching a movie trailer, but in episodes. Pieces of random scenes put together!The plot is unclear, i cant even call it a plot twist because theres no plot!!Its so unclear. Its full of surprise, a bad surprise , its keeps surprising me ""why they suddenly bring this up?is this necessary? How on earth this people suddenly stuck together?why?why?!!""Its really is like watching a movie trailer!Watching this till the end makes me angry!"
298,Hellbound,"Enjoyed the series, Interesting concept ,I liked the pace and originality of the story. Couple twists in the plot. Looking forward to season 2.Still unanswered questions should be good when it comes out."
299,Hellbound,Don't pay attention to those haters there. Is an excellent concept of religious cults and rise of authoritarianism in a fantasy fiction with a humanist view.Each episode gets better and better. After the second you'll want to watch all episodes and the final is amazing.
300,Hellbound,"Get past the slow 1st episode then it gets real
good right riveting watch special effects are very good not for the squeamish very violent as per Korean style."
301,Hellbound,"That's a definite 10 for me. I liked the idea so much, it's really a howl new thing abd it was a big success 🔥🔥😍😍 kdrama are the best for me for the last few years, congrats for Korea end Netflix."
302,Hellbound,"I decided to watch this because it's the number 1 show on Netflix in my country and I saw articles it is the number 1 show globally right now and people are saying that it is as good as Squid Game. One thing's for sure, it is not comparable to Squid Game. Nor is it any better than Kingdom.I completed all 6 episodes in one sitting. The first 3 episodes were good and I can say for episodes 4 to 6, you'll only be watching it just for the sake of finishing the series. It gets a little slow, they could have cut some scenes out and probably the only motivation is to see whether the baby will eventually die or not. And that last scene in Episode 6 is a total WTF moment that will make you punch your hands because now you'll have to wait for a whole year for season 2 to hopefully know why everything is happening.Giving it an 8/10 because it did keep me engaged and curious. And it gave me something to reflect on personally regarding religion and the concept of heaven and hell in some other religions. Some people say that this show is mocking Christianity but I don't think so.Aside from that, I like how this show casted average looking people for most of the characters; even Yoo Ah In and Kim Hyun Joo looked like normal everyday people here, which is not typical of the usual Korean dramas where the main leads and supporting roles are super handsome or super beautiful or hot. The show is much more believable in this sense.CGI is acceptable, filmography is good and acting was decent. Just don't watch this with high expectations or you'll be disappointed. There's many unanswered questions and hopefully they will address all of them in season 2."
303,Hellbound,"The show has a progressive Rhythm , the first and the second episodes are little bit boring , but after that we gonna take a trip of mystery and thriller.The directing was good specially action scenes ,
Acting was good to , and i like how that any character can't die there is no hero, and to many shocking moments . And the ending wasn't expected.The show has a some mistakes,sgi and visual effect was bad, but still a good k show ."
304,Hellbound,"Leader 1 dies, the one that the whole world worships. Episode ends. Leader 2 is in place. Not a single second was dedicated how leader 2 ever got into place. Why!? I thought I missed an episode.And: Leader 2 and the TeenTok guy are amongst the most annoying and stupid characters ever in a show."
305,Hellbound,"This was a good science fiction show. Had some great moral overtones, that contain cautionary notes about the intersections of group thinking and religion. I do not believe one religion was a target here, as the real crux was about the perversion of deeply held beliefs by the power-hungry. Indeed, a low-level antagonist even contrasts the show's religious ideals to Christianity to differentiate the two.My biggest issue was the pacing. The plot conflicts in each episode felt way too repetitive in light of the fact that some of the series's questions were left unanswered in the end. Nonetheless, because it is hard to find more original-than-not shows, and the suspense was present, I give it a 7/10. I did find the series entertaining, if not entirely binge worthy!"
306,Hellbound,"Perfect for people who have an extremely pessimistic view about humanity, replete with despicable, hateful and ugly characters. Maybe I'm watching the wrong shows, but this seems to be a hallmark of South Korean filmmaking. Appears to be a commentary about zealotry and the slide into fascism but the story is a sledgehammer with little finesse."
307,Hellbound,"The CGI is a little goofy but once you accept the style of it the storytelling & world-building is very good quality. All the supporting actors, specifically the women, are incredible.I think this mostly worked because the creator of the webcomic was the main creator behind this project. It gives me Silent Hill vibes at times, and the cliffhanger for season 2 is really unique. Can't wait for the next season!"
308,Hellbound,"Concept is OK unique but god, every episode is just watching random people getting beat up and burn alive. Makes 0 sense, the only reason I made it to the end is I was looking for an explanation of this but got 0, nothing makes sense. I'm not sure why people compare this show to squid game at all. It's NOT even close! It's boring, non sense, just gross and making you sick in the stomach for touring people and burning people alive."
309,Hellbound,"Main elements of the series:Radical Group Arrowhead = QAnon-like with hardcore following influencing/controlling people through their messages and brutality. Dongwook, a true nutjob, is the social media personality of the group that preaches about the wrath of god, sins and living a righteous life in YouTube-like broadcasts while encouraging violence. The group go hand in hand with The New Truth.The New Truth = Religious organization, cultish and authoritative controlling people through using God, fear, sins, and a divine intervention. Gained power claiming the supernatural creatures are supposedly sending sinful people to hell and only they have the right on how ""this phenomenon should be interpreted"". Nobody knows, at this point, where these creatures come from or what they truly mean - (agree with one reviewer that probably they represent society's judgements rather than god's).Social Media/Media/instant uploads = It is quickly and drastically changing the mindsets and actions of people and not for the better. Facts/logical thinking are no longer given enough importance.The real horror of the show is not the hulk-like figures gruesomely sending sinful people to hell and the mysterious cult-like figure who started it all but the aftermath. That's why the last three episodes are different from the first three. I saw complaints about that but actually that was a smart move by the director because its not about continuing with stories of all the characters from first episodes but about showing a drastic change (from episode 4 on) that most people are now controlled and living in a completely different world after only few years. I think the director wanted to show how fast lives can change through fear, misjudgments and blind following as there are many opportunists out there that take advantage to gain power.Lastly, If you are looking for another Squid Game type show, this is not it. Nor it is right and quite ludicrous to compare the two!! Also, if you are looking for constant action, blood, gore, CGIs that impress you and easy answers maybe this is not for you either because it's all about the subject matter that is multilayered and philosophical. My only complaint about this series is that some of the acting needs improving in case of a second season so it doesn't come off as pretentious & over the top. As for the undeserving low ratings, especially the many 1-2 star ratings, who knows what's the thinking/motivation behind them (besides the Squid Game effect) but in this case really ignore them and draw your own conclusion.P. S. From the same director, highly recommend Train to Busan. A zombie horror movie with social commentary about classism & class warfare."
310,Hellbound,"Im not gonna remember a lot about this show next week, but it was fun. The idea is brilliant, the execution quite poor. Those last seconds really shocked me tho; if there is a second season I really think it would be better, I hope what happens means something good and not some dramatig crap, it was really relieven when I saw that. The las episode is the best without a doubt, but it isn excellent neither. If that lady really resurrected then I hope is her and not something different like God incarnated or something like that, I want to see her with her children."
311,Hellbound,Outstanding series that focus on people style of life and it consequences that lead to doom. I've never thought that Korean culture has this kind of ideas.. Although the idea of the series is hard to believe when you compare it with different people religions. But this series make you afraid and think about your sins and where it's going to lead you. I am really speechless....
312,Hellbound,"The CGI is decent, the soundtrack works and the acting is good. It suffers from something I'm beginning to think is very common in Asian or Asian-inspired TV shows - filler. There's a lot of it. Hellbound is an above average TV show that could've been a great 2.5 hour film. The fact it's only 6 episodes rather than the more common 8 or 10 saves it somewhat."
313,Hellbound,"Most of the low ratings for this series have the same comment on the ""slow pacing"" and ""lack of action"". I believe they were lured into series expecting a full-on action movie with lots of monster fighting sequences, and of course, they'd get disappointed.Instead, Hellbound is simply a think-piece on mob psychology and social morality. It's about humans. Those demons are just decorative.Yoo Ah In delivers a strong performance as the cult leader Jung Ji Sung, but I wish he has more screen time."
314,Hellbound,"A lesson in blind obedience and submission. Why aren't anyone angry about the truly unjustful murders? Why aren't anyone willing to pick up the fight, and try to make a difference? I was waiting the entire series for one such moment, but it never came. The best they could do was to deny DNT of being right."
315,Hellbound,I was too distressed until episode 5 especially with the newborn decree. To be honest I was confused where this was going but added a few more stars to the rating simply for saving the baby in the end. What a relief phew!I had tears when the innocent baby cried from within the burnt remains of its parents.
316,Hellbound,"Firstly, people who have posted there reviews without watching the whole of first season please...just...Sit through the first episode and you will end up binge watching till the end. The first two episodes had there moments but they were necessary to set the universe and timeline in order for the people to understand whats about to happen.Overall the acting of all of the people was great and so many questions were left unanswered (in a good way) that i can't actually wait for the next season."
317,Hellbound,This show is one big example of why audience reviews shouldn't be taken seriously or they shouldn't be allowed to leave reviews on sites like IMDB or RT because maximum people rating it low and complaining didn't even finish the show they came from watching Squid game and expected every single Korean show to be similarly entertaining this show deals with human nature and superstitions that makes you think what you would do in that situation and it's purposely slow paced because that's the tone this show is going for not that it's a flaw and the show succeeds in every aspect of it.Hellbound is emotional and mysterious it should receive as much hype as any other shows.
318,Hellbound,"I hate myself for what I'm about to do, but it has to be done. I'm really, really failing to understand what it is people are failing to understand here. This is a blatant commentary on religious zealotry and why it isn't a good thing. It should've also been patently obvious that it was about religious hypocrisy. And though it can't be stated how annoying he is or how much I dislike him, I believe the painted freak that lives for condemning every one is basically the entire point of the show. I wish people would stick to what they actually like watching and stop leaving stupid reviews that aren't fair."
319,Hellbound,Wots with all the hate I thought it was great can't wait for a second season story was great acting was good funny in parts as well Netflix done will with this program.
320,Hellbound,"Just replace it with Santa Claus and you know where this is going.Everybody in South Korea is depicted as a vacant, dogmatic imbecile.Santa Claus help us all!"
321,Hellbound,"Dark, moving and violently entertaining. Enjoyable and a little bit confusing at times but overall it has you hooked quickly enough for you to want to know more."
322,Hellbound,"Tolerated three episodes of this sick, vile series then gave up. Hated every minute of it. The writers should be ashamed of themselves in creating this nasty product."
323,Hellbound,"Meh.Before someone accuses me of being part of the 'dumb' audience, lemme assure you I understood the metaphor of the show.The metaphor itself, however, is not enough on its own to make a compelling watch. The craftsmanship behind it is mediocre at best. The 'hell-hounds' are borderline comical, the beatings are over the top and look like they were copy-pasted out of some teenage cartoon.While the meta is that the phenomenon is an un-explainable occurrence, I find it hard to believe that in-universe no one: not the government, not the military, not the police, not a single individual tried to figure out what was really happening and why? Why didn't the rest of the world react? Why did no one try to fight back? Why are the good guys always so reluctant to kill even when their lives and those of their families are in danger?Overall, interesting premise, but executed worse than poorly."
324,Hellbound,"Unfortunately this isn't really a show about hell and demons, but rather a show about a cop and an insane cult leader who talk and talk and talk, but nothing happens except for about 1 minute per episode - they're about 49 minutes too long. The worst part by far is some Tiktok reject in body paint who literally yells at you for minutes on end each episode. I can't take any more of this garbage - my eyeballs can't watch this trash, nor can my ears listen to anymore of it. Hard, hard pass."
325,Hellbound,"Best one after a long time..new concept.. i could not had my eyes off. A must watch for fun, thrill and excitement knowing its fiction. I am Indian and beleive in Destiny and Karmas."
326,Hellbound,"First two episodes were awesome and I was really invested.. Then at episode 3 it became too self indulging and not as authentic and that would continue till the end ... It really put me off I didn't continue and stopped watching .. Bummer, I was hoping for the opposite."
327,Hellbound,"After one episode, it's getting too much boring story line and cover ups, also some unexpected plot where one part explain unexpected entry of actors and poor defination concept."
328,Hellbound,"At first I wasn't taken by this series at all. Between the terrible demon design and behaviour, as well as the early reaction to the fanatical church group I thought it was weak and lazy.But something kept niggling at me. So I decided to keep watching. By the end I changed my mind and decided I did really enjoy it.It's not perfect, there are several things I would've done different (namely how the three demons work) but the human element of the story intrigued me enough to keep going and I enjoyed the build up and ending."
329,Hellbound,It may not be the worst but I find the script and the premise of the story pretty horrible. It does not happen often that you come across such a despicable plot. I guess they will find a way to make everything make sense in a second season. But I found this first season pretty gratuitous in its violence. I don't think I will give any new season a try anyway.
330,Hellbound,"6 episodes. 50 minutes each. A waste of time.Interesting concept but a nonsense development. They talk about ""the world"" and they just show a few cases in Seoul, so no scope.Bad characters and worse acting. Pointless show."
331,Hellbound,"I liked the cinematography and style of shooting, and thought the actors did a good job with what they were given. But man did it drag.There is a hell of a lot of talking and not much happening in every episode, with quick bursts of interesting action. To echo other reviewers, I have to say I found the series incredibly boring for the most part and something of a chore to sit through. It was around episode 4 that I almost didn't bother continuing, but forced myself to keep watching in the hopes of it improving.The last episode I found myself skipping forward just to get to the ending. The first 10mins and the last 10mins of this season are probably its strongest points. Everything else in the middle was downright boring.The CGI was alright, perfectly passable but aren't going to win any awards put it that way. Except for the couples CGI baby, which looked incredibly weird in every scene it was in."
332,Hellbound,I missed the episode 7. This is why I rated low the last episode. Its feels like the story is just broken before climax.Recognized people acting like in the movie was really sad.The power of religion.
333,Hellbound,"To watch this show, one has to suspend a lot of beliefs. To make the cult rise to power and human world as we know regress to the state of theocracy believable isn't that easy. Unfortunately, the show doesn't excute the concept well and most of time viewers have to accept the status quo as it is.There's no other voice to counter the cult's theory from the experts or the public. Police or military don't seem to care to investigate the crime and supress the violent acts against the cult and Red arrow. The media, which is supposed to hold a great power to expose the truth, doesn't do its job. And last but not the least, scientists don't exist.This is like a half-baked project trying to get viewers discuss deep meaning of any of these scenarios, but with the reasons mentioned above, I can't take this show seriously."
334,Hellbound,"The story had real potential.The special effects were anything but special.The story had real potential, unfortunately the CGI ruined it. It would've been better if the demons were invisible, Anything would've been better than what they used."
335,Hellbound,"The 1st 3min of episode 1 had me sold on the show. I was like DAMN the show looks crazy! I tried to get my gf to watch the show but she couldn't because it was too bloody. Every time the demons showed up you knew things were about to get ugly.The actors did a good job. The story was okay. The slow parts are expected to build up characters, I can't expect the whole show to be a rollercoaster and have good characters.The ONLY part I didn't like... This is just a PERSONAL thing that gets my eyes rolling. The strong woman trope. This woman up to this point in the show as cool normal chick, but all of a sudden she turns into RAMBO. She beats up 20+ dudes with weapons at the same time with her bare hands, kneeing dudes in the head, 1 punching knocking dudes outs, flipping 200 pound dudes over her head. She falls off the 4th floor onto the ground below and gets up and just runs off like its nothing. She will have to walk down a hallway and 6 guys are in her way... no problem. She beats them all up and continues on her way to beat up more people and escape with dozens of more dudes behind her. This woman went from at the start of the show getting beat half to death by 5 guys while begging for her life on her knees, to RAMBO and James Bond put together. I'm cool with women kicking butt, but damn."
336,Hellbound,"I love shows like this, and I am a Christian. Because... This has NOTHING to do with God or Christians. Just like Midnight Mass. It's about people. People who want power and use a higher power to gain FEAR to gain power. This is an extreme over exaggeration of cults. Religion is just an easy door to show it through. And considering this is Korean doesn't surprise me considering Asian culture try to prevent their people from Christianity. Cough cough China. This is a great way to gain control in showing ""those new truth freaks"" in a horrid light.But don't you love seeing these reviews bashing Christians? Like... Somehow... This is real life. But.. what they don't realize is they're probably the same people screaming at some stranger for not getting the shot or wearing a mask...for the....greater good??? Hmm..... Thought provoking...."
337,Hellbound,"I guess.. ""they can go to hell"" if they don't like it?Keep an open mind and watch it.Good acting, not what I thought it to be at the beginning but it still delivers quiet well the message about how dangerous religi0us fanatics and how easily they can believe in unfounded causes."
338,Hellbound,"Apparently shows with a plot, that dont depend on explosions every 5 minutes and glib comments are boring? If you like shows that dive a little deeper and take time to build up the story then Hellbound is for you."
339,Hellbound,"Some parts of this series were very well done, that need that we Humans have to find some meaning in the meaninglessness of the cruelty and death that unfortunately visits us all and how that need can expose us to the manipulation of the cynical is explored in a subtle and interesting way. As American and British TV offerings continue to descend into unwatchable woke nonsense I'm thankful that at least Asia is still producing good and interesting TV and Movies."
340,Hellbound,I still have no clue what I have watched. The show is a mess and doesn't come with a Chinese dubbed track so the only choice for us is to enable Netflix Chinese subtitles which notoriously known as lenghty translation and often fading out in less than a second which make me hard to follow the plot.
341,Hellbound,Stop hate k-drama we are all same asian and this is another masterpiece from director as a korean he is really good critics about Koreans culture like you guys doing in online like a here's arrowheads.
342,Hellbound,"Not sure how this is somehow the new most watched show on Netflix, it's ridiculously slow, the pay off is awful for the amount of time you spend watching it, honestly give this tripe a miss, Squid Game is so much better, it's ridiculous."
343,Hellbound,"It's a very profound show. I don't really know how to describe it, I loved it , for the message, for the screenplay, for the depth.+ it's definitely more like a cinema masterpiece like Old Boy or all of the best cult coreans movies than a netflix show. Must watch if you like those movies, must watch if you miss great movies in general.Oh my, I just finished it, best thing I've seen in a long time. Corea is definitely the new eldorado for creativity. Keep this going please."
344,Hellbound,"Anyone who would rate this series with less than 8 stars i'm sure that they haven't understood the message of this series at all, it is a wonderful dark masterpiece."
345,Hellbound,The show starts with in promising way but then get very slow. I had to increase the speed 1.25 and then have to skip many scenes. After watching the whole show you will not understand where it ends and how it started. It is very confusing and doesn't give any explanation....
346,Hellbound,"The series is an analysis on religion, why it exists, the flaws, how different people cope with it. Often it harshly/clearly shines a light on reality of what actually is so obviously true when you think about it, which is interesting and deserves a high rating. Think widely misunderstood programme for thinking people."
347,Hellbound,Worth watching very good story and acting give it a try don't trust ratings i find many great rated series absurd and boring go for it must watch thrilling series i did all eps in a day.
348,Hellbound,"A finale that leaves more questions than answers. But yeah, it's another good Korean show. Not as good as Squid Game, but it's definitely entertaining! Some amazing fight scenes and CGI. Worth spend some time to check this out!"
349,Hellbound,"I was very excited to watch this series, as I read it took down the squid game on Netflix!! So I expected to watch an interesting idea!!The series was awful, and I decided to give it a try till the end, but unfortunately I wasted my day for nothing, it's an idiot series and I do not recommend it at all."
350,Hellbound,"It's ok to watch it 1 time. But what I can't stand I'd when a series give you more questions as answers. And if Netflix allow a second season is not sure.The storytelling is slow. The attack of the ""monsters"" is always the same.But it's ok for one time watching. Don't expect action or a fantasy overkill. It's a drama with a small Fantasie setting."
351,Hellbound,"Scenes were too slow, too much violence in every episode,Too much characters killed to prolong the season without any benefits, fed up from the dark scenes as it was so boring and slow , i feel like i wasted my time watching it, hope Netflix won't renew for a second season."
352,Hellbound,"Enjoyed the show immensely, found it well written. I would have given it a 10 but we never find out much about the reasons why people receive the decree, nor much about the ""demons"". Great, surprise ending for the baby and for Park Jungja, hoping season 2 will get the green light."
353,Hellbound,"Take an interesting and complex plot line involving religion, occultism, paranormal occurrences and deaths, then make it as uninteresting and cartoonish as possible. That is what I have seen so far with this series. After 6 episodes that felt like a pain to get through as the story progressed, I will not be concerning my time with any sort of follow-up.Everything seems very forced and unnatural. Regarding the material I can see how that would possibly be the norm, but as things progressed o just felt like I was watching a bad cartoon."
354,Hellbound,I'm not one for jumping on hyped band wagons - I watched squid game and rate it a measly 5. Now this... this is entertainment.You need to go with the fantastical premise for the first 30 mins and let the story develop.I'm amazed by some reviews which score low but admit 'switching off'. Eh?This show us philosophical issues and moral ones that vastly outweigh Squid Game and almost every other show.Stick with it to the finale and you'll agree. Series 2 will be revealing. Resurrection anyone?
355,Hellbound,"Outstanding movie

356,Hellbound,The idea behind it was great and that's all. Didn't even get through the fourth episode where the show gets a bit too stupid for my liking. A waste of my data is what it was.
357,Hellbound,"I was expecting a lot for this series but underwhelming. What the hell is the ending?season 2? Ohhh and, it hurts me when youngjae hug his wife to save their child before the demonstration."
358,Hellbound,"Another great Korean drama, well thought, well scripted of showing how humans are stupid, how can we be stripped out of basic sanity, how cruel we are. Leaves a lot of reckoning to do, but I am afraid, we are already in that state and there is no going back. Very sad."
359,Hellbound,Is this show perfect?NoBut damned It makes you think.It has mediocre acting and mediocre dialogues but the whole premise of the show Is so interesting.I guess all the negative reviews are due to the fact that this show has such a wasted potential.The writing could be a little bit better.There is one major plot hole which is very disturbing.This are not spoilers. It basic story.God is punishing people for their sins and the radical wing of the religion is beating and killing people.God is literally showing to the people that when you are sinner I kill you and you go to hell and people are still doing it.That's just bad writing.But over all this show is a hidden gem.
360,Hellbound,"All in all this show is pretty good another interesting tv show from Korea, the story and the pace is good, and interesting subject to work with. Suspens is here and you really feel for them when they go through judgement .. i'll give this show a 7 but since many religious freaks put 1 i give it 9.Go see for yourself and make your oppinion, too many trolls who cannot comprehend SF .."
361,Hellbound,"The show kept popping up on Netflix, and I decided to try it. It started slow, but it holds attention, especially since you have to read subs since I don't speak Korean ;). As for the CGI, it is good, monsters look great, and I am happy that didn't overdo it, always three, no more, no less. The first surprise I got is at the begging of the fourth episode, actors changed, the pace changed, it felt like almost the beginning of the next season. After a while, you see what's going on, and it is worth it. This is the message for all of those who didn't go past the third episode, there is a cherry on top at the end of the last, sixth, episode, and it's a big cherry :D. Koreans are giving us better and better shows, I can't wait for what will I find next."
362,Hellbound,"After reading the mix of reviews I thought ""give it a go"".So glad I did.The story runs a lot deeper than at first glance.I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and cannot fathom the reviews that describe it as boring.Lots of on screen gore and an interesting theme run through this really good show.Give it a go and see for yourself.Korea can in all fairness make bloody good tv."
363,Hellbound,It's funny usually on IMDB if a show or movie has great reviews I hate it. This show is absolutely nuts and I dig it! I felt terrible for the single mom that got smoked and it shows how twisted human nature is. Don't listen to the negative Nancy reviews and give this a shot.
364,Hellbound,"The creatures are a a metaphors for things humans can't control like a natural disaster.It's really a story is about how humans react to this phenomenon and eventually create hell on Earth.It makes you ask, who gets to decide what is right or wrong, who has the authority to interpret these events and how we should address them ethically as a society? With religion, politics, or an individual's deranged thoughts?The moral here is to be sceptical of organisations that have a monopoly over interpreting information (ie. News organisations, certain religious groups, etc) that uses fear to manipulate us. Something that's quite relevant to society right now with the disinformation panic."
365,Hellbound,"Some interesting ideas, but tone, style and narrative arcs all over the place. Most disturbingly, it continues the recent Squid Game trend of glorifying violence under the guise of repudiating it."
366,Hellbound,I can tell this drama is same level with fan favorite Squid Game. I can believe Korean Drama are stepping to next level too quickly. This drama is not focused on supernatural powers and events. This drama spotlights the human nature changes when they face something they can't imagine. I am sure you will have fun from this drama.
367,Hellbound,"I started just thinking of watching one episode and perhaps leave the rest for a later time. Instead, I ended up binge watching the whole series. The story line, suspenses and gore are gripping and will leave you numb at times. Nevertheless, it's a brilliant series and can't wait for S2."
368,Hellbound,"I'm sure those who gave it one or 2 star they didn't watch it through and only watch it for a
few seconds, it's an amazing art that simply explains how religion and religious manipulate our entire life."
369,Hellbound,"This series sticks to it's genre and definitely not for all. If you're into Thriller+cult stuff with fantasy creatures then this might be just your thing. The pace could be slow for some but I get why that's required especially in this kinda Korean series. The background score was spot on.The story was great too. Definitely a short series on Netflix that I really liked. This show was dark, voilent and emotional at times. Not sure why people say it's not realistic but I think it's definitely realistic since I've myself seen people making terrible/dumb decisions for the their love of religion!I really thought that the script was well implemented except that the CGI could have been alot better!Again we cannot compare Koreans to Hollywood yet although I've seen better Korean shows/movies with better CGI.However, the acting was on point! Yoo Ah in - this man can do all kinda roles!Unsure what people were expecting but this to me was definitely a great watch and worth recommending to people. There are alot of answered questions. However, it looks like there could be a season two so that explains the cliffhanger.For those of you who liked this show can watch strangers from hell/hell is other people."
370,Hellbound,"The protagonists made way too many dumb decisions, which got me frustrated with the show many times throughout and made them unlikeable, antagonists were not likeable as well.There just was huge lack of likeable characters for most of the show, and the show left me with so many questions, but so little answers.Fortunately, character likeability picked up near the end so I'll watch the next season, but if nothing gets answered, and characters don't smarten up during season 2, I will likely stop watching.To be fair to my unhelpful review, I can and have suspended my disbelief to enjoy shows a lot, just look at my ratings, plenty of English or Korean shows I rated well with characters others would consider too dumb instead.Also, I notice with shows, Korean ones especially, imdb has too many haters that rate 1, or stans that rate 10 to offset the haters and to hopefully bring more Korean media around the world, but please it is better to be honest with you're ratings, a lot of imdb review pages seem too artificial because of these false ratings, you are not helping."
371,Hellbound,"Hellbound has a really solid start and a good concept. The opening scene is captivating, suspenseful and exciting. However, I feel like the whole execution could have been better.The 3 creatures that come to punish people really don't look scary and are actually really funny looking. So it's hard to take the scenes where they appear seriously. They probably tried to stay faithful to their original design but they should have thought of designing them differently given the CGI results.Also, it became a little too much when they showed that the creatures could bring back someone to life and beat them up if they ended their life before their execution date. I literally rolled my eyes.One thing that makes it hard for the show to really give you an immersive experience is that people really don't seem that amazed by this strange phenomenon. I mean sure, we see people screaming and running but after that, it seems like no big deal? The world would literally be going mad in real life.Also it doesn't make much sense for a group of people to be going around beating people up if they truly believe that they should live a super righteous life in order to be closer to God and be spared from those creatures.All in all, it's entertaining and I would still recommend to watch. But there are definitely a lot of point to work on or that could have been better."
372,Hellbound,I was waiting untill last if there is any things secret behind all thise cgi things monsters where coming but no there was nothing and those whole 6 episodes was just a waste of time and nothing else maybe this would be my one of the worst series of kdrama I've ever watched.....
373,Hellbound,"I watch it, as I watch every movie or show, in the original language. Just more fun that way, though having to read subtitles all the time can get annoying. Nonetheless I watched through the first 6 episodes in just one day.Tbh, after episode 3 I thought it was over. The story concept to me seemed like one of those ""What if?"" storylines that stop after telling a short story and leave the viewer wandering what the hell (ha) just happened. Having watched through the end of the season now, I'm happy it didn't end there. I would not agree that it is boring or lengthy, that seems to me like quite the opposite of it, just sometimes the story-telling takes the form of Korean drama, I don't mind that at all, but I do realize how that can seem boring to some viewers.I have no idea how well the translations to English (or my native language, German) are. Sometimes the subtitles are not quite correct (to translate a grunting noise with ""Yes, sir"" seems a little far-fetched to me), but it was always clear what's meant.So I give it a 10, because it's enjoyable, original, and quite capable in making the viewer - me - question his own values and how he would react in such a situation. Might not be everyone's tea though. Thanks for reading."
374,Hellbound,I liked watching this. It was dubbed but that didnt seem to to detract. It was pretty violent when the hell creatures turned up. But what really detracted was the God awful acting of some of the characters. The arrowhead guy on the radio / podcast and the one who played the Chairman in the last 4 episodes. I know they were trying to be manic but it was too much. They need lessons from Nick Cage on how to do manic. Squid game had similar issue with over acting by some actors.
375,Hellbound,... because I dont want to make the actors cry. But this shameful peace of anti-cinema just goes nowhere and takes you like there is somewhere great youre going.Jigs up. Hard fail.
376,Hellbound,"Interesting concepts explored in this series, but scenes were quite repetitive. Plot is interesting, but not fully developed. Same for the characters -- they do not seem well developed. This series has the potential to be much better. Hopefully, the cliffhanger at the end signals that there will be a second season. To be honest, the cliffhanger was probably the most exciting/climactic/interesting segment of the show, so I would rather the producers use this as the climax for the series."
377,Hellbound,"I hesitated to watch the show due to low ratings on IMBD. I decided to watch it anyway and I absolutely love the show. Currently on Ep5 and can't wait to see what happens next.Very intriguing storyline, great music, great characters. Excellent portrayal of human psyche and how people react when scared. Reminds me of life in the USSR and people ratting each other to the government. Very scary to see how human behaviour never changes."
378,Hellbound,I was looking forward to this one for a while and the special effects were great along with the idea for the series.... However the plot was almost non existent and made very little sense. Characters actions and events made little to no sense and in the end you have a series with a great concept and great special effects that fails to deliver anything compelling for the viewer that will keep them interested in watching!Give this one a miss!
379,Hellbound,"This is a really good drama, the cast did a great job .. if you are into fictional themes yet realistic stories and plot this is a really good one that shows the darkness of humans."
380,Hellbound,"SoumikBanerjee25 review is just spot on. When is hollywood going to learn that remake stuff is not the way to go; when is hollywood going to learn not to pander to some indiidual or ideologies. Second korean show that went to top on netflix, and I am sorry people don't know about crashlanding on your or my mister among others that really good. All of them may deal with social issues BUT never really fist you in the face over and over and over."
381,Hellbound,"I'll just quote Queen Gorgo from 300;
This will not be over quickly. You will not enjoy this.Still, gave it a 4 since something made me watch this snorefest."
382,Hellbound,"This show is great. I really don't understand the negative comments 😕. Haters they must be, that's the only logical explanation here 😂. Can't wait for this crystal generation time to be over with. I hape the new generation won't have balls made of glass."
383,Hellbound,"Well we went into this with high hopes given the early media hype of huge viewing audiences but quickly realised this was pretty terrible. A very silly plot, terrible acting, awful dialog, and the monsters looked silly. Don't bother."
384,Hellbound,The show made me think if the world that they had setup was an utopia or a dystopia. And that made me nervous. It made me keep wondering if I would want to live in that place or not.I don't like the overdramatization that many Korean shows that I have watched tend to make. The actors are always hyperbolic with their dialogues. It's probably just how Korean shows and movies are I guess.The music seemed haunting and the action scenes were high quality. Camera work seemed excellent as well. No issues with the CGI too.It's a small show with only 6 or so episodes. But it was a thrilling ride end to end. The script seemed tight.I would definitely watch out for the next season.
385,Hellbound,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. For me there aren't that many series I have to watch, but this one I had to watch. Very compelling and original. Sometimes a bit violent, but I loved it!"
386,Hellbound,"I was hooked with the opening scene where they maul the guy at the cafe, but it just got really slow after that. There was a lot of unnecessary dialogue and scenes that it didn't need. I watched the first three episodes and none of that needed to be almost 3 hours.If you have a short attention span, don't bother, you'll doze off at the acting.3/10 because the mauling was cool."
387,Hellbound,"Not your ordinary drama, this is more like What if in real life, when divine reveals itself.So how do we define good or bad (actions)? It is simply a human expression or notion right? Have you ever thought about the insects you accidentally killed while walking at the pavement or just killing the annoying mosquitos from sucking your blood, causing you annoying itchy bump? Would these insect think they deserve to die, just because you're passing-by or because you do not want to get itchy bumps? So are we the good or bad to these insects?Sorry for the long winded introduction but that is what i get from this drama, when the 3 monsters showed up and killed each with a definite time, we human assumed it is an act of god or devil? It is us human who loves justifying what is good or bad.Regardless if it's good or bad, one thing for sure is human being will always seize opportunity to gain, let it be monetary or fame, that's human!If you lived in this Hellbound world, what or where do you seek for peace?"
388,Hellbound,"Story is good, VFX and action scenes are also good but the worst thing I feel in this series is that it is very very fast and you can't get time to connect characters of series."
389,Hellbound,"The first 2 episodes blew my mind .The CGI,the acting, the setup everything was so on point. I couldn't bring myself to even skip the intro and outro in between , it was that good . The pace slowed down after that since episode 3. The initial thrill to guess what might be the reason to whatever's happening was high , but it died midway . The show failed to deliver the message it was trying to, it was very vague overall . Not worth the hype."
390,Hellbound,"If you don't sin, Jesus died in vain. Seriously, who cares about these religious films? What is the point in them? Authors, what do you do this for? I'm unable to understand."
391,Hellbound,"First 3 chapters are gud and has some momentum, but it loses from 4th chapter onwards and drags a bit on 5th & 6th..certain things, need to closely see to understand the story flow, else can't understand if you miss out a scene."
392,Hellbound,"SLOW AND BORING. Unbelievably underwhelming. I was really excited but not what I was expecting. I was expecting more action and more rapid paced plot. Basically a slow final destination. I usually love Korean made shows and movies but this one was disappointing. Unfortunately not for me. Give it try though, maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did."
393,Hellbound,"I didn't write any reviews before and the only reason I wrote here is due to the number of racists comments.This show is wonderfully written, great sequence of events with amazing acting and plot twist at the end of season 1WHAT DO YOU WANT MORE????"
394,Hellbound,"The film should have made a little more sense. It is impossible for a newborn and still pure to go to hell. What a fool...!!!!Even though when he grows up the baby will commit a great crime, it is impossible for humans to know when he is born, only the devil knows. Too glorify the devil and the devil in this film."
395,Hellbound,"I made it through to the third episode and then gave up.The idea behind it is good but poorly executed, riddled with plot holes and tedious to watch due to poor acting.Don't waste your time on this."
396,Hellbound,It was fresh and fun because the drama characters believed in it as a concept of religion and the process of society falling into chaos seemed to be expressed urgently and frighteningly in the notification and demonstration of hell that was mysterious and unknown.
397,Hellbound,"I think it was a drama that shows how people accept and believe in unknown phenomena and fears, and how pseudo-religiousism occurs. The actors' acting and stories were really impressive and good. Well made drama."
398,Hellbound,"Pacing is too slow (Even if i have already hit the fast forward). I tried to watch it but it is too agonizing, its like your being punished to watch this series. Cinematography is uninteresting. Mediocre acting. Boring dialogues. My eyes hurt when i see this neon character."
399,Hellbound,"Korean web series best most expensive and after squid game is 1st number of web series watching
Pak ceractor is best actor and you Jun best Korean director most expensive web series."
400,Hellbound,"Dumb People who are upset about not knowing detail about supernatural creatures,that's what we suppose to know now with characters. I'm really looking forward to see season 2."
401,Hellbound,"True, it has some interesting themes and concepts, but there's one downside to this that makes its themes pointless. It's boring, poorly written, and has zero interesting characters.Now, I firmly believe a show can succeed if it is fun and either well-written or contains interesting characters. ""Hellbound"" has none of those. It's so painfully boring, that I only managed to make it halfway through episode two. It is poorly written, nothing that the people do in this series makes sense and are unrealistic. All of the characters are bland, with no defining trait or interesting characteristic; something that honestly shocks me, considering that the man who made this is the same man who made ""Train to Busan"".Honestly, the only reason I rated this 2/10 is that it has an interesting concept that not many shows or movies delve into. Unfortunately, that doesn't matter if you can't pay attention nor care for anything that happens in ""Hellbound""."
402,Hellbound,"I watched this over a few weekends. I was lost as to what was going on until the final 2 episodes. If you stopped after a couple of episode you will not the final understanding of what is really happing to these people being ""demonstrated"". Even at the end of the series you still wonder what's really happening. I like the series because it is really making me think about religion, doctrine and how it is used and how it can be used to control people."
403,Hellbound,Have to say after reading some of lukewarm reviews I was going to give this a miss. So glad I didn't. I just think too many people want all action and have no patience for complex story lines and plot development. Yes the plot leaves allot to be answered and you get a feeling series 1 is just setting out the premise but I was hooked from episode 1 to the end. The story and plot take time to build out the characters and so much so I watched all 6 episodes back to back. Can't wait for series 2.
404,Hellbound,"Wow... Wat a roller coaster season it was.... mixed feelings of emotion,belief and superstition....start a bit slow but then... it was a roller coaster ride. Everyone was crazy about the trailer with first scene.. But the last scene was beyond this world, wat an ending, I literary crying in the end. Eagerly waiting for 2nd season..... I don't know why people is giving low rating in imdb, I think they don't understand the real reason behind all this. Sad to see low rating... Go for it guys."
405,Hellbound,Not sure why with the bad reviews here but it seems mostly on watched the first 2 eps. The story picked up starting from the 3rd eps. To me it is worth watching.
406,Hellbound,"Reveling the time and date of death by unexplained phenomena is a great idea that could build a lot for the story and the drama. But this series took it to the most boring, shallow way.The rise of religious waves based on that phenomena without a proper explanation, in addition to unprofessional actors gave the worst impression and watching experience was so boring.The dramatic change in the community behaviour according to these religious waves was unbelievable."
407,Hellbound,"I'm not Korean and I've been watching American TV shows for more than 10 years and this is the first south Korean TV series I've watched recently. I don't know why it's rating is 6.7 in IMDb, Because I believe it deserves far more! Acting is really good, Music is beyond fantastic and really fits the position in which it's being played. They did a really good job on special effects. It tells us a really unique and exciting story that draws your attention from the beginning to the end! Maybe those who've watched the show should give it a second chance!"
408,Hellbound,"By far this show is ok for me until this webcam guy shows up. Besides his weird neon makeup, His charactor is so annoying as hell. All he does is shouting about his conspiracy thought which i can't believe there is someone stupid enough to believe that bullsh** As we can see many followers attacking people like they didnt scare that this will led them to be beaten up by the three black mud gorillas that will ask them to pay for thier sins too."
409,Hellbound,"Idk how ppl rate this less then 5
Interesting, intense had me on the edge.I think people that rate this show low are the people that only watch Hollywood production's.I watch alot of movies and shows , never seen this concept. Worth a watch in my book ."
410,Hellbound,"I think I am masochist cause I have watched all the six episodes and it was boring, really boring. In the end no explanation and all the characters were really dumb and very predictive in their stupidity."
411,Hellbound,"Superb after watching all 6 episodes.and after you watching all episodes please watch all episodes without skipping and then you like this series 👍.........................
..................."
412,Hellbound,"**Vague summary spoilers- nothing to ruin the story**I gave it a 10 to try to help with the low score, but honestly, Hellbound is a solid 8. It's not perfect, but so few show are.I don't understand the people saying it's slow or boring. The first 3 episodes they establish a world learning about a terrifying supernatural phenomenon. It focuses on the religious interpretations people are creating from this and the cultism surrounding that.Then the last 3 episodes are taking place when everything that was set up in the beginning is 'accepted' and common place.The story doesn't move slow at all, and it does well to set up the main premise. It's purposefully uncomfortable and drawn out in parts but that helps with the tension and frustration (in a good way). Plus there are several twists that really push the story. Also, some pretty great fight scenes in eps 4-6.The only thing I think people could have a problem with is the brutal and emotional violence scattered throughout every episode. It's quite intense and it might not be comfortable for everyone, so defiantly for a mature audience only."
413,Hellbound,"What could have been a powerful critical painting of fascism, sectarism, human violence, greed and stupidity, with this powerful description of a society becoming the passively terrified slave to a mix of Taliban-Moonish (we're in Korea, not Afghanistan) cult born from horrific (and never expained) monster manifestations and giving birth to a pervert Christian schism peppered with all the bells and whistles of modern consumerism, TV, media, social network, videos and nerdy hooliganish followers, this clever (and philosophically provocative) master script is (sadly) absolutely ruined in the last five minutes by a cheesy Disneyian redemptive happy ending (there's even some snow to add a touch of Xmassy nativity): the infant meant to die burnt alive in public and then bear proof of the naked absurditiy of the notion of sin and more generally of all divine ""law"" is finally spared (in total contradiction with the previously almost existentialist original tone) to become de facto a sort of new Messiah... Cherry on the cake, an ultimate twist (obvious teaser for a second season) reveals the ressuscitation of one of the first victims of those ceremonial pyres. Sort of heavy cliffhanger a la Supernatural..."
414,Hellbound,"A movie name called Aparichitudu telugu movie or Anyan tamil movie , Hindu book of Hell called Garuda Purina, hero has multisplit issue, man one of those 3 slpits is deadly, called as AParatichitudu or anyan. Kills sinners as per the book of hell."
415,Hellbound,"Seriously question sanity of people who enjoy this its 6 hours of innocent people getting savagely beaten by wanna be christian zealots and cult members where you are left questioning the behavior of the everyone. Like how do you storm a police station and not get shot? Or knowing you condemn the world to hysteria by not recording the cult leaders sin death because your daughter committed murder? When you know she probably gotten off due to brain washing. No real resistance to the cult. And seriously no spokes man for saying that freaky face is a demon? Just stupid brutality for sick people too enjoy hell green lantern had better story structure and graphics. Point is if you have time to waste and like watching car crashes, slaughter and train wrecks. This is for you."
416,Hellbound,"I very much enjoy many Korean dramas and films; I have been watching them for well over a decade (also many Japanese and some Taiwanese selections, and started with now older HK films). Netflix somehow manages to select the worst (this is not their first poor choice) -- no doubt catering cynically to a faction of the US audience who have little cultural taste, no apparent appreciation for good character dramas or depth and variety in human-oriented stories, and who love hyperviolence (such as in recent video games and lots of US films that feature endless tedious action, violence, sometimes sex, and little compelling or meaningful plot). I won't waste too much time here. Made it through three episodes of this series (won't bother with the rest), and though I like the main actors/actresses (and have seen them in other shows), this show is one of the worst and most undeserving of praise that I have seen amid many, many good to excellent shows (series and films) from Korea. I can like simple entertainment such as Train to Busan, but not this nightmare. Sad choice, Netflix. You really could do much better, and you could use your choices to advertise numerous demonstrations of storytelling excellence that have driven Korean TV, cable, and film entertainment to its current heights of praise. This is not a watchable example (it is in fact nauseating on many levels and may even be insulting as a representation of typical K-Dramas); it ought to be trashed; and this is (again) why I do not subscribe to your service. I can find and have found many far better Asian shows (by all measures) on my own, and will continue to do so."
417,Hellbound,"After watching first episode, thought its going to be incredible. But, with more episodes it becomes very slow and boring. I really had to increase frame speed to 1.5 times to complete the final episode. It's no where close to Squid games."
418,Hellbound,"I'm suprised by the amount of negativity in the reviews of people giving it up after 2 episodes.Yes it's slow at start, but it just gets better and better with each episode and starts to really all nit together from episode 3+. The characters and actors are fantastic, the human nature and the whole story explanation of why things are happening is great and somewhat thought provoking, gets you a bit out of your comfort zone thinking how you might act/feel.I rather have sth like this instead of the common trend of great 1-3 episodes with meh dragging out stories with no point.So yea I'm not gonna say much to what's actully happening, because it's easy to spoiler since it all ties together, but it's one of the few series I genuinely really enjoyed in the last months."
419,Hellbound,"Vfx are good...story is completely on point....and i am totally waiting for season 2Idk what people here are typing that acting
was bad..clearly the don't know what acting is...actors did a fantastic job especially the arrowhead stream guy...the energy with which he captivated retention it was brilliant...way more better than any other actor who played some psychotic teen streamerInfact i'd say its even better than squid game when it comes to story , visuals ,lines and directionsYES,i said it."
420,Hellbound,The start is slow but the story build up & suspense are too good. Just ignore the negative review & watch the full season with patience. Season 02 will be juicy if the team crack it right.
421,Hellbound,"Awful acting, terrible script, too many flaws, stupid story which leaves you with nothing at the end! I don't understand how people gave a higher rating than 2 ? For what ? Intro music ? Such a boring and was painful to go thru with it hoping it would give me something at the end....... Nothing!"
422,Hellbound,Hella good. Loved the actors. Good storyline. Good show to binge watch. I am super excited to see more of these actors. I am sll for this. Super great.
423,Hellbound,"When I saw the CG monsters in the trailer, I thought, ""Director Yeon has come up with something strange again"" and I didn't have much expectations for this show. Fortunately, the focus of this show was not on the supernatural phenomenon itself, but on the human reaction to it, and the overwhelming insight and originality of the work offsets other technical shortcomings.While ""Squid Game"" by Hwang Dong-hyuk or ""Train to Busan""(2016) by Yeon himself were entertainers for many people, this show seems to be a work for the audience who put more weight on the subject matter of the work. In terms of originality, it can be compared to ""The Wailing""(2016) by Na Hong-jin, and the ending of the last eposode is reminiscent of ""Children of Men""(2006) by Alfonso Cuarón.As a Korean director, Yeon Sang-ho is not yet at the level of masters like Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho. But he has proven within the mainstream that he is an original storyteller that will continue to be noticed."
424,Hellbound,"First episode was so-so, but after is just a nonsense. If we were living during Spanish Inquisition it will have some meaning, but in XXI century to produce such a pseudo-religious garbage doesn't speak good for Netflix."
425,Hellbound,"This series is very very slow. This makes it difficult to watch. I felt like I was screaming at the TV most of the time, as no one seemed to have a backbone in the series. The acting was a bit touch and go with some characters. The ending was frustrating as now we clearly need to wait forever to get any answers."
426,Hellbound,This show is extremely slow in moving the plot. From Episode 2 to 5 it's the same thing over and over again. Episode 6 is good just because of the cliffhanger.Bad acting by side cast. The only good actor was Kim Hyun-joo who plays a character of a lawyer. I watched this show just because of her believable acting throughout the show.This show would've been better if it was a 4 episode series.Personally i would suggest that if you've time watch it or wait to see if it gets renewed for season 2 because if it doesn't it's a pure time passer/waster.
427,Hellbound,"This is no where near squid game ( which is awesome and more realistic).Maybe the idea was good, but when it came into making, it has lost all the gist...I didn't feel like continuing after 3rd episode."
428,Hellbound,"A series starts with a lot of question that was difficult to bind later I was so wonder how ? By reach third episodes I was ensure the will be bad , I was right (unfortunately) Just plot twist for second season, another thing was focused on but then they just skip it !!! One of them was when police manager said ""it is not organic "" for honest I expect more ."
429,Hellbound,"Some dumb people watched this with English dubbing and posted poor reviews. Always watch foreign language movies or series in original language with subtitles of your native language. English dubbing of Hellbound is pathetic, voices and dialogues (way different from intended) sucks. Just watch it it is slow at start but picks up well in the end. Deep messages given as usual by Korean cinema."
430,Hellbound,"Although it has been touted as ""dystopian"", I believe Hellbound is a amplified depiction of modern day Korean life, as seen from the perspective of the writer (and probably many of its citizens). The younger generations call Korea ""Hell Joseon"" because of the deep caste system which prevents many from advancing or achieving, where some of the wealthy look down harshly on the middle-class and poor, where things much of the world sees as nothing, many Koreans have been raised to see as ""flaws""- from where you live, where you went to school, to what your parents do, to not having living parents... anything that can be used to put one down is used. Art imitates life, and the writer expounded on it.In this series, I believe the ""New Truth"" represents certain media outlets and corporations who distort truth, cover up, spread unverified rumors, and manipulate public opinion to their advantage. Godly living is clearly not their mission, so I'm not sure why so many people didn't get that.The ""Arrowheads"" represent Korea's toxic cancel culture. For years, individuals who live to bring down others have taken to the internet on seek and destroy missions as soon as some ""scandal"" breaks out. They often cite they are ""upholding the country's conservative values"" as their excuse- while mercilessly harassing and bullying and threatening others into submission, even encouraging suicides. (The irony being that these behaviors are not valuable or conservative) The message here: Lies spread like a disease, words have the power to kill.The monsters are NOT sent by God; they represent peoples' unjustified judging of others; hence the fact that no one knew how the hellbound had ""sinned"" or how a nicu newborn was ""judged"" as a sinner. When the original leader killed the man who had murdered the girls mother, it served to confirm that the ""hellbound"" were just people who had been judged indiscriminately, something that happens daily in our world.The lawyer, Song So Hyun, represents the average citizen, taking on and fighting back against these evils. In Korean culture and others, a man who is sent to prison can also see his wife, children, and family persecuted for his crime. She not only seeks to expose the cult, but to protect families from that condemnation.I believe it speaks to several social, political, and religious ills that plague this country and the world at large. I think it makes a powerful statement, and one that most will only really understand if they understand where the writer was writing from. It could be possible that some reject, put down, and ridicule this piece because they see their own behaviors in one of these entities. This work is too thought provoking to be subjected to unjustified judgement.I however, am looking forward to the next installment."
431,Hellbound,"First of all, I would say to ignore the people who have given this show low ratings because this was never made for them. They probably watched it assuming it was one type of show, and it turned out to be a different show, and they are bitter about it. I don't like drama period pieces, but you don't see me going on the Bridgerton's page and giving it low ratings just because the show wasn't for me.I would highly recommend watching this show if you like animes like Death Note. It is quite different from Death Note, but does have the same flavor in the whole supernatural judgement against sinners thing. Overall, the show was fast paced and intriguing enough for me to be hooked. They had nice cliff hangers at the end of the episodes which made you want to watch the next episode right away. I do think the first 3 episodes were better than the last 3 episodes because the pacing was faster in the first 3 episodes. The CGI for the monsters wasn't the greatest. It was good enough, and frankly wasn't the main focus of the show. The monster scenes were merely catalysts for the rest of the show's plot. That being said, I do believe they will dive deeper into the supernatural phenomenon and the monsters' origins if they come out with a 2nd season.The show wasn't perfect. I thought the characters did stupid things sometimes that made no sense. There was a vigilante group that would go around kidnapping and beating people up in name of God, made of mostly young kids. The fact they could do that with the police almost never catching them was quite ludicrous, especially since these were low level thugs, not smart enough to hide or escape effectively. And it was just plain stupid that the good guys who were opposing the bad guys did the bare minimum to protect themselves or fight back. I mean these vigilantes were beating people with bats and pipes; maybe get some weapons of your own to fight back? Or gather with a group of like-minded people who may have been victims of the vigilantes before and band together to fight back? Just felt the good guys were portrayed as lame ducks and let the bad guys just wail on them, barely fighting back.If you like drama stories with supernatural elements, then watch this show. If you are looking for a straight horror show, then this is not that show. I love horror shows, but this is not a straight horror show. The supernatural element is only there to push the drama along."
432,Hellbound,"Get ready to give that fast-forward button a workout unless you're a fan of boring dialogues and a stupid story. The only reason to watch this is maybe some innate curiosity as to what the three monsters are all about and where they come from, but you should just do yourself a favor and google the answer instead of sitting through this ""watching paint dry-simulator""."
433,Hellbound,"Concept Kafi uniqe H 1st season se pata chalta h ki andhvishwas Kese kam karta h or log kese isse paisa or khoff paida karte h
Like Islamic Terrorism
But jo iski high light chij h Ye sab naraz jane wali chij q or kisne khene p kam karti h kese suru hui iska jawab season 2 m cahiye."
434,Hellbound,I watched all 6 episodes something would apart from those beings killing humans on some prophecy. There is absolutely no story line in the series apart from random killings. It made no sense.
435,Hellbound,I was exited to watch this show but now I am regretting about my decision. The show is completely boring and the plot is very confusing. I mean why the three demonic creatures or whatever those were from hell killed those people and sent them to hell. I mean only God has the power to do it. But it was unclear as innocent people were also punished. And also in the end one of the people( Park Jeong-ja) was sent back to the world as her body was regenerating. So mystery is totally unsolved. I got the message that the new truth was misleading people about it and it maybe similar to some of the religious group and other groups in the real world but again the origin of those creatures is unrevealed so it's so confusing. Maybe they'll solve the mystery in the next season but overall it was disappointing to watch season one. I was way to boring. I watched the total six episodes very patiently thinking when it'll end.So am very disappointed.
436,Hellbound,Perhaps its my age (mid 50s) I don't know but recently movies and series coming ot of South Korea are becoming exceptional. I likes Squid games even though I didn't think I would. The plot even though a bit thin at first grew in my opinion. Like most movies these days has political and religious undercurrents and morals. Cut under the thin ice of all that tatt.it is quite enjoyable. It still leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I want to know where the hell pardon the pun these things come from. So I hope they make a second series.
437,Hellbound,"Hellbound is a new type of dark fantasy. Director Yeon Sang-ho of ""Train to Busan Final Express"" has succeeded in drawing the ultimate human drama by mixing religious themes and violence in a well-balanced manner.It's an abstract story that doesn't solve the mystery, so it's a drama where you can clearly see what you like and dislike, but the idea is novel. The tempo is good and there are unexpected events, so I never get bored from episodes 1 to 6.This time it was Season 1, but I'm looking forward to the sequel to be made on Webtoon in 2022 and Season 2 will be released in a few years."
438,Hellbound,To the people who are giving it lower then a 4. You aernt a movie critic. Stop acting like one. Good show overall and I liked the mystery's that were being uncovered each episode. Really left us with something to ponder in the final episode though so that's why I'll be coming back to season 2.
439,Hellbound,"This show can't simply live out to the topic at hand, but must important of all, their characters are incredibly forgettable as well, as the creatures seen as angels.Poor designs overall, some good convos, too fast-paced and boring sometimes, unnecesary long beatings and action, many undeveloped situations.There are a few good thoughtful payoffs, but as a show is kinda bad, works better on book, if there's one."
440,Hellbound,"Ep 1, good start, intense, big plot, lots to explore
Ep 2 eh?Ep 3, what?Ep 4 ridiculous
EP.5 quit ? Or maybe some miracle to savage this drama
Ep 6 nothing but garbage, 6 hours totally wasted
not only wasted, so regret watching it."
441,Hellbound,"Very boring and worst series ever. It showcases wrong and negative about God but in reality it's exactly the opposite. Believing in the name of Jesus closes the doors to hell. It's that simple. Salvation is free, repentance done in the name of Jesus opens doors to heaven. God never want to throw people to hell. It's for Satan and this series portray exactly the opposite of what God wants. Stop making such series!"
442,Hellbound,"The webseries is basically all about existence of god or not the episodes show some unusual things which people commit as message of god. We can't deny to the fact that even at today's world this question is extremely arguably so, a movie creating a impact to the people negatively or positively on god should not be recommended to the people maintaining health lifestyle."
443,Hellbound,"Don't waste your time, I'm a big fan of KDrama but this series isn't even close to good. I recommend you to watch Save Me to save your time.I heard it will be a second season!!!! Netflix are crazy but they know a lot of teenagers and some of the crazy KDrama fans will watch it no matter how the plot and the graphics are bad."
444,Hellbound,"A partially slightly bit stereotypical content, and from time to time rigid characters. In principle it makes you ask outright contemporary questions beyond kdrama, cultures, and time. The authors give you some answers, and a preview for new questions."
445,Hellbound,"Netflix should cut of relationship with this director who keeps making terrible show. Its absolutely terrible direction, poor editing. Show like this will ruin korean production reputation so I hope netflix korea just cut relationship with this director."
446,Hellbound,"Starts slow and builds fast up to the end, a series haven't made me feel this anxious in awhile. Humanity is scary and brutal as are the monsters.Had to write something for countering the low reviews. Deffinetly not under 5 star show.If you want a show that explodes in a big bang first of episode one, this is not for you."
447,Hellbound,"I am not sure why so many people are upset at this show for not fully exploring where these creatures come from or why they're here. The ending is clearly a cliffhanger for another season. We don't know YET. That doesn't mean we never will - be patient!I thought this series was great - I binged it, so that says something. I, like others, also like that it shows how religion or any belief system can be radicalized so that it is dangerous. You would think we're out of the Middle Ages, but so many of us still hold superstitions and mythical thinking. Angels and devils? Really? You think? Or maybe some very primitive humans tried to find meaning to something they couldn't at the time?Remember Arthur C. Clarke's own words? ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."""
448,Hellbound,"This isn't worth your time in my opinion! It's absurdly confusing, laggy, and the plot is like Swiss cheese: full of holes. The first couple episodes intrigued me and then it totally runs out of gas and sputters out of control. I don't even care that it's violent and gory, I'm not a wimp but I just want a competent storyline that makes sense and something that grips me and this show has none of that. The one redeeming quality is that the acting is mostly good, but that can't save the flailing plot."
449,Hellbound,"WHAT I LIKED:
Pretty much everything. Despite the fantastical nature of events depicted in the show, one can easily draw a parallel between those events and reality. Pretty much every authoritarian system out there, which includes religion and the current environment of shoving everything down your throat for ""your safety"" because ""they"" know better, is succinctly and brutally demonstrated in the show. To me, the show is about death and the randomness of it, and how certain despicable opportunists have taken advantage of that phenomenon and contorted it to suit their mythical narrative and amass untold influence and wealth.However, the best part of the show was the end. It's the most beautiful thing I've seen in a show/movie in a very very long time. That one thing balances out the nihilism and overall bleakness of human nature the show is spilling over with.It's just six episodes long, as opposed to the meandering and repetitive 16 episodes that most Korean shows tend to be. I suppose we have Netflix to thank for it, as they impose that condition, and have managed to get some really good shows produced, e.g., Squid Game, D. P., and the entertaining My Name.There's no point talking about the making of the show and other technical accomplishments. And those don't matter to me much. If a show can pull me in into its world. Regardless of the nature of that world, and keep me invested in the characters and the events, then that show has done pretty much everything right. So was the case with this one as well.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:
The show suggests there will be another season. In and of itself, the show is complete. It reaches its conclusion, and there are plenty of answers one can extract from it. The last-minute ""twist"" was unwarranted and made me go, ""Oh, come on. Not you, too"", a reaction identical to the one I had after watching another amazing show, ""Squid Game"". To me, the ""twist"" just overcomplicates the narrative, which clearly wasn't required. I guess the financials took precedence over art here, yet again. Or, maybe, the story was conceived this way from the beginning. Regardless, I don't like it. Too many shows and their impacts have been ruined because of this stupidity.Another complaint, although this is just me nitpicking, is that one of the main characters in the first half of the show is abruptly dropped, never to be seen again in the latter part. He was a prominent character, and no reference was made of him in the second half. That just stuck out like a sore thumb for me.BOTTOMLINE:
After a bit of world-building, the show gets going, and is relentless in its bleakness and just the overall human a$$holery. As mentioned, the beautiful end is the only moment you get some respite from all the doom and gloom. If you can digest all of this, then the show should be an unforgettable experience for me, just as it was for me."
450,Hellbound,"This series got terrible reviews then somehow there was a rash of 9s and 10s. How strange!The first 6 minutes and 30 seconds was good. Then all downhill! The acting is terrible. The script is worse. I usually only write reviews for exceptionally great movies or series. The bad ones I don't want to waste any more time even thinking about it. But this was so extremely bad, I had to warn people: Stay Away!"
451,Hellbound,"The tree monsters look ridiculous and unbelievable, despite that, the show turns out to be very interesting in the way it explores the human reaction and plot twist along the way. It's a good show with a slow start (episode 2 was very boring), but after that, you could become invested in the story. Looking forward for season 2 and the web comic it's based on."
452,Hellbound,I would love to have given it 6 or 7 stars but the fact that there was literally no ending really sucks. They are obviously setting up for a season two but these shows have got to learn how to close out one season before moving onto the next one. I feel like I just wasted six hours of my life.
453,Hellbound,"Its beginning is unrealistic. But all the things come after are very real. All the religious frenzies reflect the dark side of South Korea. On religious issues, director Yeon may be none to next (at least in South Korea)."
454,Hellbound,"Such and enticing and very in the now show to watch, please don't let others reviews spoil your open mind.2 episodes in and I'm really into it! You should be excited about the story as well as I am!(I actually applauded on the couch at the end of the second episode, with cheering and all)"
455,Hellbound,I was expecting a horror fantasy kinda series from such a director. But this is utterly waste show ever created by korean with no sense or logic or story itself.Don't waste your time on this.
456,Hellbound,"I've thought a few days about this show and come to the conclusion that apart from some relatively good 3D animation and after effects it is just pointless. The story does simply not unfold to the viewer, there are not even clues to why humanity is facing such unjustified raw violence. To all that point towards the next season and argument with a standard (or major) cliffhanger I just can't agree. As the show does not even give a single explanation or at least a hint to why all of this is happening it just feels like a random sequence of mediocre dialogues and raw violence. Maybe I'll give a second season another try but the first season was a waste of time."
457,Hellbound,"The people giving one star reviews to this seem to lack any kind of perspective beyond a binary system. I thought it was absolutely amazing, and it is unquestionably original. But I can understand if others found it a bit slow or dark for their liking and gave it a 5 star rating or similar. A one star rating on something that isn't a complete and utter screw-up of a production is just people trying to leverage the ratings down for their own agendas and should be ignored. Give it a go."
458,Hellbound,"Not sure what Netflix is thinking pushing these new Korean shows. Between this and squid games over-hype with pretty CGI, horrible character development, and lackluster resolution maybe they should go back to renting out DVD's."
459,Hellbound,"I didnt have high hopes for this show, I actually stopped for a couple weeks after the first episode. The first scene was great, then it goes into the slow part, finding out what is what and why it's happening.But as I stated it again, it was just nonstop craziness. It's you'd get emotionally attached to a character, something will happen. I've shed some tears, it's actually a bit of a frightening concept of the show. Religious or not. I haven't even finished it completely yet, but, as much as I've seen, it a greatly written show and the actors were amazing. They acted their parts better than expected.I loved the different rolls you'll follow. It is a more complex story line so I can see why people Do get lost, but it didn't hinder the show, it made it more addicting for me. Just because soe people Couldn't follow it, doesnt make this show boring or bad, they just have small brains."
460,Hellbound,"Anything with subtitles has to be exceptional. I understand that we get the benefit of watching movies, series, from around the world but it had to be great to keep someone interested long enough to want to read to be able to follow a show."
461,Hellbound,"Pros
i personally think the acting is good. Premise is unique it could lead to a very interesting series
this 1st season focus more on human's selfishness, the 1st chairman of the real truth, after receiving his decree, wants everyone to live in fear as he does.Yet its human's greed and selfishneed to exploit the situation and use religion to gain power.It shows the viewers blind faith could lead to being deceived.Which was tbh a good touch.Cons
however, none of the supernatural phenomenon was explained up to the end of season1. At the end of it, the only revelation was that obvious throughout the series. Who will be sent to hell wasn't based on sins. Thanks captain obvious. If it was sins, all those violent arrowheads would be long gone by then. What are these angels? Sending a newborn to hell? Really?In the end i was left perplexed and with more questions than answers, leaving me quite dissatisfied."
462,Hellbound,"I have no idea how I managed to finish this one, it took me 2 weeks to do so. This is great show to watch before sleep if you have insomnia. You'll sleep like a baby in matter of minutes. At least I haven't managed to go through one episode without falling asleep twice.It just makes no sense and it's absurdely boring. Where are those giants coming from? Why are they killing people? Major plotholes all around and so many unanswered questions.As major korean production fan, this was a huge dissapointment for me."
463,Hellbound,"I am so sick cause medium have the good review on this drama! It's fake! They got the money to cheat the audience. Every pieces of this drama is extremely terrible, too waste of my time for watching it!"
464,Hellbound,"I usually never make a review, but i choose to make my wasted time on this mini-series to have a purpose. So here we go..and i try to make it short as possible.Hellbound introduce itselfs with a young guy, suddenly being attacked, molested and killed by some hulk-alike monsters/demons from hell, in open daylight and in front of audiences. Then after this ritual, which this boys soul is being pulled down to the underground/underworld, the monsters quickly disappears again as they showed up.A shockwave is now started and everyone starts asking; ""who are they and where are they from etc."", and now they got your attention and you start asking for coffee and telling your girlfriend ""Hey baby, come and check this out"".Hopefully she doesn't care, but if she unfortunately comes and sits by you, then she will fall asleep very quickly...and that saturday night is gone forever m8, so keep that in mind :-)Cuz Hellound is very tricky, it catches your attention, but offers nothing valuable in return. Its all about dialog between uninteresting people, who dies, which you don't care about. The story itself is moving nowhere. Some (dull)demons are molesting, obviously only sinners, before they go to hell. Thats it. The story make you believe there is something interesting going on. Bu there isn't.All this mainplot entrance is just an excuse to put you into a sideplot story about cultists who are against each other. You start getting bored because everyone and everything is getting more and more careless. You want to get back to the mainplot and want more explanation. Instead your being pulled into part 4 by force and manipulation and just when the company realizes your about to shut down on everything, they come up with a ""BANG"" shock-effect...and there you go, now they got your attention again. Oh boy. Now you have to watch another 3 parts until the grand-finale...that must be something, you think.But instead you get the finger again, sorry to say dude. You have to wait to season 2.Thats what Hellbound is all about. Something you will not return to, not after this insultment.Its dull, boring, a global evolution that matters all religions but moves only around a handfull of these same people, like they where the only men or women around. This is how stupid it is. No media, coverage, no politics, no science. No answers. And the road to the finale can ONLY disappoint even further. You would never recognize the actors on the streets if you saw them afterwards, trust me.So avoid it, and save your time for your girlfriend...before she becomes your ex by seeing this s... :-))"
465,Hellbound,"Don't even know what they want to talk about. But also dont want to know what is happening. The only interesting episode was first episode. 3 bully monsters came down to punch a person. Lol. What do they even need 3? One would've been enough. And their plot twist is cringe.As a korean review, 1 star is only for 3d designers."
466,Hellbound,"Poor plot lines, tedious, boring, main character changes all of sudden, it only has 6 episodes but you will feel bored from episode 3. In short, do not watch or you will regret."
467,Hellbound,"It's a sad indictment on society. It stimulates violence and aggression. To top it all off, It's too stupid for words. It cannot be categorized as horror or even crime. It is prejudice against humanity and all religions."
468,Hellbound,"I finished this tv shows season, and for me its ok, not amazing and strong pshycological story telling, first 3 episode was good, and 4/5/6 episode was mediocre, not telling about this creators, not showing hell, and just people's phanatism side shows and dat's all..."
469,Hellbound,"I really wanted to give this a go, but in the middle of episode 3 I could not watch any more. There are stuff that are so bland and things happening just for the sake of chaos with no realistic motive or reason.At least try to paint the show and the random humans there in a way in may happen. Not just because of chaos. It seems like the answer for so many actions was: ""Ahhh yes, chaos""."
470,Hellbound,"So, how to start i really don't know cos i really loved this web series, this web series is really sooo good i swear to god. The character of min, bae and his wife including others was so awesome i really had goosebumps in my whole body while watching. K-dramas is lovesss mayn. The cgi, concept of this series was so nice too as we had witnessed everything. Its like all in one pack. Till the end we never got to know who the real villains was. This web series has pure content and everyone's gonna love this for sure. Also, I'm happy for the part where a baby became the super hero to the world as he saved other ppl for committing further sins so that they won't get the decree. O God! I must mention this too when the bae and his wife protected the baby and saved him risking their life mom and dad are the real superheroes and i love the character of bae. In future i will be like him for my family too. Now, I'm waiting for the hellbound season 2 where the baby will grow big and strong with the training and help of her new guardian Min. O wait the ppl who got burned by the hell monsters got their lives back too. So, bae and his wife can take care of the baby now. Oh mayn! Finally I'm totally happy.Lastly, I'm concluding by saying please hellbound productions release the season 2 asap."
471,Hellbound,I like the concept Of this Overall Drama.I don't know who gives them these Ideas to the S.koreans.They are just awesome at making new stuff.But it still needs Improvement.I am Giving Full stars for the Idea.
472,Hellbound,"When I first watch the trailer, I thought the plot will be like the monsters were some kind of robots controlled by the cult in order to gain attraction from the world. But when I start watching this, the director doesn't even try to let us know where does them came from, but It doesn't even matters anymore. What matters is, is how scary this series is. It is scary not because of how scary those monster or execution scenes, but how realistic it is.For the first 3 episodes, the only thing that carved inside my mind is how realistic it describes about the modern world: How internet can make a crazy and dangerous idea spread out like a virus, nibbling our mind with horror. But no one realized how absurd is this and no one tried to stop it at all, instead, they use this theory giving mental pressures to the ones that doesn't believe this. Soon, media and internet became a dystopian world that doesn't allow any one to speak out their ideas.In the end of the series, it seems like we have a ""happy ending"" to show the wake of the freedom mind in people. But how many ""happy endings"" for those people with autonomy mind will happen in the world?Somebody, just want to watch the world burns.But most of the people, just want to believe to the fire that burns down the world and prohibited any one to save it."
473,Hellbound,"At first I was hesitant to watch it because of the negative comments about the series. But I still tried to watch and I didn't regret it.New and Strange concept, if you'll compare it to other series Netflix produces. When you the 6 episodes, You will have a questions that are not answered and you will really want to know what's next and have a part 2.CG is not that good but you will be taken to the acting of the artists. Special mention to the actress who acted as a lawyer. I must say this is one of the best female actress "" in korea "" doing action genre in a korean series.( I loved watching foreign movie/series and this is one of a hundred that a female Korean actress can portray an action scene well)"
474,Hellbound,"I felt everything as it was real, it gave me the chills every time ,I have read some of the reviews and people says it was boring I don't think that's true , because with every episode something else it's revealed. The final episode made me want more ... because it's becoming more and more interesting ... at specialty the ending. Yeah it's pretty hard to watch it because of the sever violence ... but the extrem violence that people do in this series is very realistic ... in a true way... if this was true (not S. F.), this violence would be exactly the same in real life. The extreme violence meaby will make a lot of people to stop watching the whole 6 episodes.But as I said, the ending will make u want to see another 6 episodes."
475,Hellbound,It's just boring and too much violence. I strongly prefer Netflix should not encourage this kind of shows. It should encourage one can sit with his family and enjoy the show. The story line poorly written and contains strong violence.
476,Hellbound,"Waste of time, it only shows how stupid the people are in the show.So people are just watching and being panic when there're monsters killing people?Nobody is trying to figure out where those monsters come from and why they do it?Government is not even trying to protect the people from the monsters?Why the citizens are so stupid that could get brainwashed so easily? Seriously?And the Korean gangstas don't even use a gun?And wtf is the last scene?This show is just ridiculous and stupid, a waste of time even there are some good actors, most of the parts are just not making sense!"
477,Hellbound,Madly waiting for next season. I had expected more better end and i think this lackness will be fulfilled by next season.😅👿😈 Really good storyline and character and of course mother father love is beyond all.
478,Hellbound,"Disappointing waste of time......
I couldn't wait for this nonsense to end.Pathetic point and very bad image and impression for the younger audience.I can't understand how this can be even mantioned as ""worth seeing"" tv series...."
479,Hellbound,"Ugly, dumb & poorly written plot. I've strong doubts that the writer & the entire team members doesn't even know what they want to tell!!! Such a watse of my eyesight🙄"
480,Hellbound,"Don't wait for a horror movie of a blood-filled kind, it's actually a psychological film.Tells us about unconditional imitation and without people's thoughts
The power of the media and the power of lies and fear are far more terrifying than those three giants and hell.I loved the end of the story so much, what it shows us, never to judge too soon."
481,Hellbound,"So this isn't a show you are going to like if you think this is an action show. The first EP makes you feel like that but it isn't.This is somewhat of what I would call a philosophical/drama show with 5 minutes of action.So don't watch it with the mindset that this one is seat gripping, you will be bored some times but overall it is good. Also the story makes you think what is the future of the story because the situation is plainly helpless."
482,Hellbound,"A must watch series. Acting is up to the mark...this season has lots of cliffhanger. I'm eagerly waiting for the next season !! Episode 4, 5, and 6 better than 2nd and third."
483,Hellbound,"This show is a must watch! Action, the suspense, and the storyline is great. There is plot twists and I loved it. Not a single episode disappointed. Korean shows are on the rise!"
484,Hellbound,"It will be watched because of netflix korean series are new trend of the world.. It is using deep wawe of the Squid Game, nothing more.. I wont recommend it .Dont make your self sufferer. Use your time on better things.cya.Aga izleme agah."
485,Hellbound,"The concept is really fresh, the plot always keeps you on edge as it's very unpredictable what's going to happen next, and the VFX is like never seen before."
486,Hellbound,"I don't give a shiiiit what people say, for me this is great. CGI is good, story line is good. I just complain how short it is because is just 6 episode, so i hope Season 2 will be have more episode."
487,Hellbound,I personally ask people to watch K-dramas because it is justified & entertaining. But after watching this I will never suggest anyone to watch it rather I will tell them not to waste their time and disturb mental peace by watching this.
488,Hellbound,"Here I am at 5am hooked on this show. I don't want to turn it off!!! The storyline, gore, everything is exactly what I needed. Very entertaining. Imagine knowing when your gonna die. And how. Just wow. Lol."
489,Hellbound,"Really great in every way
In terms of story, filming and ...
Especially the last part which was great.I hope that the next seasons will be made and aired soon."
490,Hellbound,Not sure why there are so many bad reviews but I found the show really interesting. I'd been waiting for this since the trailer dropped and I was not dissapointed at all!There might be some plot holes but nothing that takes away from the show. The acting and storytelling and leading up to the scenes is all fantastic.
491,Hellbound,"Just finished watching Hellbound, and wow, loved it, brutal and original, interesting deployment of the narrative like the split in 2x3 episodes, the twist at the end, great paranormal thriller ambiance, worth trying if you were hesitating!"
492,Hellbound,"This show will only like by immature audience (mentally).It is very unrealistic and disturbing!There is so much non scene things in this series and very hurtful to watch, there is so much violence that will effect your brain.Production is good but concept is stupid."
493,Hellbound,Such a boring show.The story is meaningless and complete waste of time.I started to watch Korean series recently but this one is changing the concept.
494,Hellbound,"South Korean streaming television series directed by Yeon Sang-ho, based on his own webtoon of the same title. The first work in the Jiok was an 11 minutes short animation directed by Yeon Sang-ho in 2002."
495,Hellbound,"I've never seen a genre before. It was very fresh.I watched it with excitement, and although part 3 may be boring, part 4 is very fun.The squid game was more fun than the hellbound, but I think it'll be a hit."
496,Hellbound,"Stopped watching after they included ""VIP's"" like they did in squid games.They stole from midnight mass, used koreans as a trend and ripped from squid games.This is entertainment in 2021. Humans vs humans, nihilistic violence and greed."
497,Hellbound,"So serials... looking forward to season 2.Why did the child survive?Does hell really exist in the worldview?What is the conclusion of Saejinri Church?There are still too many questions leftLooking forward to the next episode.The action scenes are a bit lacking.I think Yoo Ah-in will also come out in season 2If you're a religious person, it's fun enough.However, this drama is not recommended for non-religious people."
498,Hellbound,"I didn't expect it, but I think it's a work with a sense of immersion and depth than I thought. It is a different genre from squid game. I don't think I'll enjoy this work just for killing time, but I think it's a new genre and has revealed a new quality of work."
499,Hellbound,"Especially in the last episode, I felt thrilled.I wonder how the ordinary public will accept it,but people who know how to think will raise their thumbs."
500,Hellbound,I coudn't understand when talking streamer.And why this drama has dark mood?I don't like this dramaplease make good drama like Squid game.I coudn't understand when talking streamer.And why this drama has dark mood?I don't like this dramaplease make good drama like Squid game.
501,Hellbound,"This movie is a karma, even a helpless baby couldn't escape it. Very dark, gore, violent, cult with black mirror style. Really question about humanity. Can't wait for season 2. 10/10."
502,Hellbound,"I am seeing many comments and reviews making some kind of comparison to 'Train to Busan'. This is a very different story telling.There are some people making connection to other films such as final destinations and midnight mass (which is bonkers given this series is based on a webtoon series which began in 2019). This is based on a misunderstanding of the premise of this film.A lot of people are finding trouble how to interpret this series and are frustrated with character arcs that seem to end nowhere.Well that's the point. All the characters are completely mediocre, selfish, boring, and don't really have amazing character growth that people are used to in a character propelled story. This is not that and if you want to watch something like that, steer clear of this one.If you want the characters to discover the source of the angels and rules behind the burning/sending to hell? Don't bother watching the series because you will not get satisfaction.This is about how do mundane public react to extraprdinary circumstances that cannot be explained by anything we've normally used to explain things. People are at a loss. Nobody knows what in the hell is going on. And there seems to be absolutely no way to fix the situation and the whole world knows about it (Not like final destinations where it's a journey of few individuals to attempt to escape their fate while everybody else lives not knowing a thing about it). How will the world react? What choices will be made and how do those choices change when more information is revealed which contradicts the earlier choices. It's about us. What will you do?We don't know what's behind the angels/god. And we likely will never know but it's not something we can easily ignore as people are being burned alive by monsters on a daily basis. What do we do? What would you do? The final scene in the taxi, that's the message the author throws at your face in case you didn't bother to give it a thought."
503,Hellbound,"Whoever watched the whole episodes and was able to catch the messages would rate it high.People who just want to chill and watch TV without digesting deep messages would rate it low.It was a great movie as I liked the sarcasm on human beliefs and those twists, but I was sad that there are some places that could make many people turn off the show."
504,Hellbound,"Having been an avid fan of Korean dramas for a while now, I can safely say this is a great little series. Reading the other reviews, there's a notable theme going on, and it seems that most of the people rating it very low are also the people that stopped watching after 2 or 3 episodes. I mean, if you're going to rate a show, at least watch the full thing.Very much enjoyed this show, because of course the trailer sucked me straight into wanting to watch it. It's Korean, it has supernatural elements, it's dark, it's gritty and yes it's brutal. I went into it thinking I knew what to expect, where it was going to go and assumed it was going to be action packed with monsters running around tearing people to shreds. It very much delivers A LOT more than that, so expect a bit more of a slow burner bit with good character story development.However, when it's time and the hellbound monsters do show up, the scenes deliver the anticipation, fear and bloody gore you've been waiting for.I'm not really sure why some people have rated it so low, either you haven't invested in the full 6 epsiodes, or you just assumed it was going to be lots of bloody monster killings like Sweet Home. I'd say, give it a watch regardless of the reviews your read, because if you invest into the story AND actually watch it to the very end, you'll probably understand a lot more of what story they are trying to tell....plus the last episode is awesome!"
505,Hellbound,"If you do not want to watch confusing and mysterious shows, don't watch it. This is for people who likes slow phase and well written stories. Gotta read the webtoon just to get a glimpse on what will happen on season 2."
506,Hellbound,"The story is fantastic, if someone says they saw the plot coming or that is similar to something else, they are lying. True, it was made to have a second season, but this is not a series to watch and forget, specially in the world we are currently living, for anyone thinking a bit about how humans are reacting and polarizing now a days, how crazy cults, politics and beliefs are ""the thing"" today, this drama is absolutely a masterpiece, no laughs, no lightness, is just a mirror to the absolute disgusting behavior of humans. I question all those who hated it and said is was boring which side they will be if the events of the series happened in real life? It's perfect to start a conversation and see with someone else, to question our beliefs and what makes us good or bad... and how we justify our actions. Simply beautiful."
507,Hellbound,I thought this is gonna be fun and thrilling but the stupid show ever. Please don't waste your valuable time on this stupid show. Some People have vote 10/10 I can't believe them. Ewww... i am about to vomit after seen this show.
508,Hellbound,I love series plot awesome storytelling unbeatable i like so much all the camera angles and screenshot fabulous acting to the all actors very beautiful Hindi dubbing.
509,Hellbound,"With Season 1 only being 6 Episodes - there was alot to cram in and alot to share with us the viewers. All I can say is, I enjoyed EVERY Episode and hope that there is a Season 2! Absolutely Loved ALL the characters. Well worth binge watching! It gets 2 Thumps Up from me!!"
510,Hellbound,"What's the point about this movie? Uncleared ending. So wasting my valuable time. Very bad story line not make sense 👎🏻
I prefer watch other korean movie. This one is very sucks."
511,Hellbound,"This series is on a different path from the squid game, which led the story with rich narrative and attractions every time.The Hellbound is slow but persistent and profound.In the reality of hell, we fight the hell of human beings."
512,Hellbound,"This is one of the best Neflix series I ever seen.This movie is reflecting our society.I believe we are living it the hell.Hell is not far from us.God save us.Oh, We save us, not god.That's all."
513,Hellbound,"I will keep this short and simple.All these bad reviews come from people that did no finish more than half the show, are not used to this pace (Came thinking it would be a fast pace action movie because of the trailer) or, maybe, are very religious.The show gets better and better as it goes on till it reaches an insane climax making you beg for another season.With that in mind, make the decision to watch it fully or skip it."
514,Hellbound,"I watched all six episodes over the weekend.After watching it all, I was still left with lingering feelings. It's rare for season 2 to be successful but it makes me look forward season 2."
515,Hellbound,"First off all, anybody rating this at 4 or less has a small mind and no intelligence, fact. It's an original idea which makes you question life after death, the concept of sin and the balance between good and evil. Some people complain it's slow and depressing which is stupid as it's a horror show so it's not likely to have sunshine, lollipops and tap dancing featuring in it. Its not slow, it's bringing out the narrative. If you want fast, watch a film, not a 6 part TV series. As a true fan of horror my entire life, it's great to see an original Horror Concept amid the same old formulas of most new horror films. Looking forward to season 2."
516,Hellbound,"It's a move that all religious will hate. The movie has everything any religious hates. So I don't like this movie although I was shocked about the idea and the flow. Do not expect high ratings, the movie shows they work harder than we think."
517,Hellbound,"At first I thought the story will be interesting, but damn...I am dissapointed. Is just a sad movie with some exaggerate parts. Life for real...at some point I was really pissed off. I'm just sorry for anyone who will waste time on this."
518,Hellbound,"To start off, Hellbound is nothing like Squid Game. And that's a good thing because it's 'insanely' brilliant in its own way. I just finished watching it, and needless to say, I am completely shaken up. Overwhelmingly riveting, had me questioning my entire life and the world by the end of Ep 2. I literally *cannot* wait for S2, and pretty sure this show is going to be a huge huge hit on Netflix.The way this show delivers its message about society, and the mentality of people, is fantastic. Look deeply, and you'll find the scariest parts are actually the ones with people, not the demons. Talks about many of today's problems including religious fanaticism, manipulation of the masses by religious authorities, preying on the fragile mindset and innate fear of most of the world's population.A true must-watch, if you're okay with some blood and semi-graphic violence."
519,Hellbound,Yes indeed I hate the lack of creativity and imagination its ok for those that do not watch anime however if u do go watch death note is why better...
520,Hellbound,Rough watch... how society conforms to these self proclaiming prophets is completely unbelievable. I found myself rolling my eyes more than anything. This looks like a show that will continue to leave more loose ends and end up being cancelled before there are any answers.The finale doesn't leave any satisfaction and made me scoff at actually wasting my time with it.
521,Hellbound,"I am currently 4 episodes in and the acting is bad, dialogue is super bad in general everything about this series is bad. Weak story, weak actor performance. I quite like korean movies and series but this here is boring bad one just ridning the ""korean wave"" we currently are undergoing. Some people say it has deeper mening etc, but theese ""subtle"" messages have been spun off in so many different ways in so many much better series and movies allredy. YAAAWN."
522,Hellbound,"This show is amazing, I think people are hell-bound on the religious aspect of it. This show portrays the morality and philosphical ways of man explored in the concept of fear. I personally enjoyed it, to the extent it got me questioning life. The show uses religion as a factor which could be subtitiuted with anything else, but because there are people out there who still have faith of high begin it has a impact on them. The show develops quite late but express a need of change within society."
523,Hellbound,"I felt compelled to write a review based on the negative comments. I watched this over the course of a day and a half and thought it was very good. Now I understand that not everyone will enjoy the same types of shows but in no sane world is this show a 1-4.For the reviewers that only made it through 2-3 episodes you missed the jump in the timeline. For the reviewers complaining about a lack of closure after six episodes, well thats because there will be a second season. It's a cliffhanger pretty standard.I would recommend giving it a go. In my opinion it is better than most of what Hollywood has been putting out for years."
524,Hellbound,"This movie story is not just completely disjointed, it is also completely unrespectful for people sensitivity without any reason of story. It is for sure the result of a movie business espionage, it try to steal some characters and distopia from the successful Squid game, like the VIPs and some other pipelines, in perfect Chinese business style ""copy and paste"" or like the American action movies, overall this is what is made of South Korea, it's a copy of something which is not, always researching its own personality after the destruction of too many colonies, last USA. But let's be back on the movie, not just the story is a complete mess, the Special effects are worth of a 90's low budget movie, the gorillas sucks, and the shooting... It seems to be a school work made by a bad taste and low score student.I'm sorry for who paid to make this movie."
525,Hellbound,"I gave it a high 9 because it is a type of series that will let you think and might want to absorb the message more. As you progress with it, you will slowly realize how the storyline will is almost always true for most countries that are led by fanatics of religious groups. You will realize how religion play in societal problems and how they can manipulate facts and tailor them according to their OWN standards.I really like how factual some of the scenes are and how it reflects humans while experiencing crisis. The story reflects despair, agony, and hardships and how a certain belief can be unfair for some. Again don't watch this if you are not a type of cinephile who doesn't want to think and loves to consume the message of a series/movie in a silver platter.Lastly, I gave this a 9 because although I love the plot, some of it, I think was patterned in a pre-existing movie/series and then constructed together. CGI wise, I think they could've done better and that goes the same with the fighting scenes.I personally believe that a season 2 will give more it more justice."
526,Hellbound,The idea is greatI am still looking where this series will lead toIt can be a great show if they can provide some logical background.If not then i just waste my time.
527,Hellbound,"Okay, I've never reviewed movies/series here. But I can't resist this one.*very mild spoilers beneath but it's worth saving your time*1. It doesn't make sense.I have watched bad series, horrible ones. But they all had an explanation, some story, whether that was sensible or not. Hellbound does not have that. Till the end, we have no freaking clue as to what these monsters are and why they send people to hell.It was implied that a lot of the people who were hellbound did not majorly ""sin"". What even is ""sin"" here? Why are these poor people thrashed around and tortured? Even if they come back at the end, it doesn't get rid of the fact that they suffered badly. So it's clear that the supernatural force behind this is not righteous itself.2. It's all about social commentary?People keep commenting that this is not about the monsters, but about society and human nature. I'm sorry, are we supposed to be blown away by this revelation that humans can be terrible?? *gasp* I never considered that.WE ALREADY KNOW. We've seen this repeated in countless TV series, movies, and everyday life. The only new concept here is these big yeti monsters and they couldn't explain them. So, don't tell me it's not about the monsters taking people to hell when the show is literally named HellBound and it very much is about the freaking monsters.Was I horrified by the actions of the Arrowhead folks and the cult? Yes. Surprised? No. That's what mobs are like and it is highly likely something like that would happen.Does that mean you skimp on the storyline and pass it off as some clever angle??3. It is deeply saddening and disturbing.Now, when I say this, I don't mean I can't handle sadness. Squid Game had heartbreaking moments. So did Train to Busan. But those two were absolute masterpieces. Hellbound should not even be compared with them. I'm surprised at how many people are saying this is better than Squid Game. In my opinion, no. No it is not.This series may leave you feeling mentally exhausted.My overall review- I've watched some pretty bad series but this is one of the very few that I actually regret watching. I think it is past the redeeming point and they won't be able to explain it properly anymore. But I'd be happy to be proved wrong.Was it scary? Yes, and disturbing. But what's scarier is that it's rated 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.The acting was stellar, it was a little entertaining, it was like a wreck that I watched till the end just to find out why this was happening. I got no answers.-MAJOR SPOILER ALERT-Don't read beyond this if you're yet to watch the series^^^^^^Let's talk about that last episode.How could the baby have survived? Seriously, how? I was glad that it was alive, but come on. These monsters have huge rods as claws and they have all sorts of contraptions ready to tackle humans. You're telling me that these ruthless monsters could not take apart two fragile tiny(relatively) people. What a joke.Keep in mind that they scorch bones and organs to ashes, but they couldn't scorch a little extra and get to the baby? No sense.Oh, the big bad monsters suddenly got confused? I have no idea. The supernatural force was wrong? Yea, about LITERALLY EVERYTHING.~~~~~~I'm done. I just had to say all this at freaking 3 AM."
528,Hellbound,"A pretty good series, super fast paced and mingled with lots of plot twists.However the show really didn't have a proper explanation for a lot of things that were happening especially since it dealt with the concept of hell and angels of death but also condemned cults and concept of A Just God. There are talks about the second season so I'm assuming a lot of answers will be revealed then.Would suggest watching it if you're looking for something offbeat and fast paced."
529,Hellbound,The stark number of critical user reviews here explains why there is still such a high demand for superficial cgi infested American action shows with absolutely no innovation or meaningful message except the completely oversaturated 'hero always prevails' along with 'superstar actor-wreslters?' like The Rock.
530,Hellbound,"I watched this movie on the request of my wife , she told me that its review is great on netflix. When i saw a movie i dont like like this story. Whole move based on one thing that three giant black creatures came and destroy the sinner. The concept of angel ,hell ,God are all twisted. The angel appearing and telling the date of death , the angel appearing and taking the lives and then God make mistakes ??? I wasted more than 120 minutes on this series ! A big No to Series."
531,Hellbound,"I have watched the whole thing out of curiosity, ending was bad, many things were left unexplained, I thought it would have more of an interesting storyline, vfx was great but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
532,Hellbound,"This one seemed to be another promising Korean series after Squid Game with decent trialers and 1st episode. However, the story gradually became illogical and frustrating over time, such as the minimal interfering of authority over such disastrous events happening in the country, Arrowhead acted like a terrorism organisation while they should also be afraid of committing crime/sin, the stupid actions and reasoning of characters and society, slow and repetitive dialogues, etc.In short, it was a disappointment although last plot can lead to a more interesting story if the show continues."
533,Hellbound,"The first episodes, I thought I was wasting my time, but after watching episode six, I was eager to see the new season of this series. I would like to know what is the reason for these monsters to send humans to hell and bring them back?"
534,Hellbound,"Not a regular storyline. Clearly I don't understand why a lot of people hate this series. Hellbound is great about a lot of things. It's very scary! Especially when the monsters are about to come. There is a lot of blood and gore which I think is appropriate if a demon is about to drag you to hell. Well, that's definitely not for everyone but for me its very well done. Look how many haters on the review because they think it's too much."
535,Hellbound,"Very slow and boring. It is not good. I gave up 20 minutes in. Scenes last long. Not good scenes. Slow, boring - working my way up to 150 characters now."
536,Hellbound,"""I don't know much about God and I don't even care. But I know one thing and that is that the world belongs to us humans and we should settle our matters ourselves. Don't you agree Miss Min"""" Upholding justice and righteousness in fear of damnation. Is it truly righteous and just?"""" We don't know if it is God, it is the interpretation of some for what they think that God has said""What I thought of, in the first ten minutes, to be a silly horror show turned out to be a remarkable dissection of organized religion. It just shredded the religious dogmas to pieces. From the concept of original sin to Messiah complex to false or for that matter any prophethood, gullibility of common men, bigotry, exploitation, papacy, religious texts and their reality, and even specific incidents in religious history like Abrahamic Sacrifise and the crucifixion and one so called miracle after the other, all were put to sword. It addresses the extremism, fundamentalism and cult mentality in a new fashion. Once you peel the superficial violence and look deeper, don't be surprised to see your own image.And all of this is done subtlety but not so subtlety with a supernatural theme. It left clues along with some unanswered questions but made sure for the audience to know that an unexplained phenomena does not mean only one answer.The show has layers and layers and then some. It is portrayed as horror/sci Fi but it's pure philosophy. Watch it for deeper meanings and you will love it, if your mind is still open; well, I know that being a rarity these days.A brilliant show with a last minute twist to make room for a sequel. After the horribly idiotic Squid Games, this was just a breath of fresh air. See, no matter what you believe in. It is bound to make you think, if nothing else. What could be better than that."
537,Hellbound,"This series took so many twists and turns I hadn't expected. I was on the edge of my seat, especially towards the end. There better be a season 2! Hellbound explores so many elements of human nature. If you enjoy cult or religious thrillers, watch this now. You won't be disappointed."
538,Hellbound,"I love this series so muchhh. I'm happy its not like a kid movie (marvel ) ,great concept with this series .Bae youngjae was sssoooooo goodddd we need him backkkkk."
539,Hellbound,I'm so glad netflix invest in korean series much more thrilling than hollywood kid shows and also im laughing at people who are complaining about it .Like yall know what thriller is ? We are supposed to feel the characters but guess what you can go back and watch your marvel movies .We needdd bae youngjae and chairman back together in season 2.
540,Hellbound,"Let me tell you when i tell you i am addicted to series ,that's mean i can't stop thinking about this . Glad i find korean series its the besttt. Yall have done great job."
541,Hellbound,I watched the trailer and thought this would be a good show but instead it's not. The whole cult theory is to not be a sinner and be a better person so you don't go to hell but the extremist arrowheads are literally killing people and harassing them for not having the same beliefs... how tf are you going to condemn people for sinning when you're dinner as well. It's just a show that shows how dumb people are and how easily they get pursued.
542,Hellbound,Where do I even begin?Pointless? Yes.Acting? Forgettable.Draggy? Absolutely.CGI? Laughable.I desperately would like the time back that I spent watching this show.
543,Hellbound,I love the series interesting story many reviews are racist because of some of the people are based on Hollywood movies but thought I'm not an American nor Korean but the story is very interesting I loved the idea of the religion and the formation of cults in the series that can lead a society mob and how the writer hasn't pour all details to makes us feel of needing the season 2.
544,Hellbound,"Ok, I really enjoyed the Squid Game. However, I still tried to watch the 1st episode as objectively as I can. All I can say is that the first season made up of only 6 episodes was a 🎢 ride. There were some really unnecessary slow moments, with too much character building, etc. Overall, however, I thought the 1st season was very entertaining. On a separate note, why do the South Korean police officers only carry revolvers?!? For a country that gave us Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and Kimchi, you'd think they would have some pretty cool guns by now... Looking forward to the 2nd season soon!"
545,Hellbound,"Hellbound is a unique show that takes a lot of risks - and for me they pay off. It's only 6 episodes, but spans 5 years and follows two distinct sets of characters. While the individual characters aren't quite as fleshed out as they could be because of this, it's the only way to tell a story this big, and they manage to pack a ton of plot into a really tight 6-episode run by focusing the story around two pivotal moments. Each episode further complicates the narrative and subverts expectations in an exciting way, all while remaining true to the characters and the decisions they have to make.The first episode isn't designed to ""hook"" you with huge cliffhangers and the truth and scope of what's going on is revealed slowly - the show really takes some risks here and trusts it's audience a lot to not lose interest in this age of short attention spans, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded.I should also note that Hellbound explores questions of faith and examines how different people choose to find meaning in the supernatural. These are complicated things to discuss in subtitles and some of the shorthand and idioms used in these conversations doesn't translate 1:1. Also, some of the social issues the show is interested in are uniquely Korean - it's hard to imagine police behaving the way they do in the show here in America.If you're looking for a challenging show that's well-written though, it'd be hard to do better than Hellbound. If you're the kind of person who doesn't want to think about religion and its role in society, you probably shouldn't watch this show, as you'll likely find it too challenging, like many of the reviewers here.I'm sorry it doesn't have enough explosions or car chases for you Chad, but it's weird that you feel so triggered that you have to go online and tell everyone how much you don't care."
546,Hellbound,"I watched this cause it's highly overrated, but it turns out very disappointing, not like what I expected. The plot is too slow until it becomes BoRiNg! I gave 2 star to appreciate Yoo Ah In's role, he's the only one cast that played well. Sadly, he played only half of the season. None of the cases amazed me, yet it's just confusing. All the questions that've been on my mind got no answer as the film goes by. I love watching fantasy thriller, but this is just too much of a dissapointment."
547,Hellbound,"A tired policeman Jin Kenghun gets into the center of a mysterious religious phenomenon. He not only begins to be interested in the activities of the dangerous sect ""New Truth"", which is gaining weight and gradually driving the public crazy, but also puts up with the fact that his daughter is involved in communication with the charismatic leader of the movement. The hero investigates the cases of ""sinners"" and understands that it is pointless to fight media hysteria and collective anathema, and law enforcement agencies are unable to do anything - members of the growing sect are taking root in social networks and media platforms, turning their sermons into radical anti-social actions."
548,Hellbound,"Literally made an account to say how frustrating this show was, and it's so sad because it's an original concept with incredible potential but horrible execution. My largest gripe is the lack of good people in the show, and how it makes people look like a bunch of lunatics with the IQ of a brick."
549,Hellbound,Oldboy is human nature this is social nature. What is difference between jejus's miracle and hellbound show to make people trust god. I agree with jeung jinsu's saying.
550,Hellbound,Each episode of boring 50 minutes which has complete nonsense concept.You need to wait till the end of the whole series to see something should happen but at the end nothing happens.
551,Hellbound,This is just a clusterfuck of everything and nothing. Netflix needs to up its game. What a horrible storyline which makes no sense whatsoever.I feel I wasted 6 hours just to be like tf just happened..
552,Hellbound,"Great show, compelling drama mixed with brutal violence that may turn some viewers away. But for those willing to see this through it pays off emotionally and cinematically. The twists and turns keep you glued to the screen."
553,Hellbound,"As an antheist, everything looked liked medieval fantasy, with whimsical, sick, twisted God of old testament doing whatever the f God wants to do like, taking life whenever God wants.Don't give a f if some crooked religious leader is abusing his power, but would happily beat and tore the life out of ordinary single mom who raises two kids by herself.Don't give a f if large gang beats and kills people, but have no problem telling a teenage girl that she will go to hell within few seconds and again beat and tore the life out of her.It is twisted show, showing the sick face of God (or supernatural being), and also those living in society who would use that God or supernatural situation for their advantage.Loved it, and cannot wait for second season."
554,Hellbound,"Very slow and dragged on without any substance. Couldn't get past episode 3. Why are people comparing this to squid game? Weird plot, bad acting and none of the motives made sense."
555,Hellbound,"You can really tell the reviewers who didn't actually finish the series... It's told in 2 acts of 3 episodes each. So there's a sort of reset at episode 4 in the format of a time jump. All of the ""slowness"" or ""boring dialogue"" is part of the story that leads into what was to me a very good finale. This isn't a non stop action or horror thriller. Think more religious event drama like The Leftovers, but with more violence. Can't wait for season 2."
556,Hellbound,"First the show.Well paced, slow start and creating a base for the narrative, so it has Dept something many people are not used to any more, and after that is goes in to a crescendo of violence, emotions, doubt and mystery.Watch pass the first couple of episodes, which are undoubtably slow.Second, the reviews.If you are a religious fanatic, don't watch it. If you are a ""marvel"" fanatic, don't watch it. If you are neither, give it a try it's a great show."
557,Hellbound,"The one clunky part of this is the CGI demons, which are almost laughably bad, but the acting is decent, there are some twists in the plot, and I'm hoping to see a second season."
558,Hellbound,"I really enjoyed the show. Although it is a bit slow-paced, but the way the team built up the story is amazing. The show is overall entertaining. Many reviewers gave it 1 star, which is humiliating. I respect their opinion but don't mislead others. The concept is new. It is highly recommended."
559,Hellbound,"Summary::
Phenomenon: An apparition face appears suddenly, and tells a person that he/she will die in after X time(Here X could be as low as 10 seconds to as high as 20 years).After X time passes, three monsters appear, brutally beatdown, burn the person and disappear. Happens publicly; can be recorded, played on TV and the monsters are pretty much invincible.Suicide doesn't change anything, at set time monsters appear, pull the soul out of dead body and do the same.The series focuses mainly on the repercussions of said phenomenon, with characters being sort of disposable assets for forwarding the events. Is there a main character? Not absolutely sure even after season end.Series explores religious opportunism, weakness of human law, morality, character, psyche and the helplessness of the individual to stand up for personal rights and freedom.The series is boring though.You never get to know a character deeply enough to find them relatable.Certain aspects are never explored.Is the phenomenon global? How are governments tackling this issue.Any alternative theories to what is happening and why?How many people face this everyday? Are the no. Of cases rising or stable?No one has tried to take an experiment based approach to avoid the monsters? Go underground, go sky diving, go high speed biking. How far long has one been able to avoid getting killed by running, How invulnerable are the monsters? High caliber guns, bombs, missiles, Acid, Lava, Poison gas, holy water. Anything works?For a series this slow and long. The number of questions avoided makes the slow pace increasingly frustrating.The cliffhanger ending of season 1 will bring me back for season 2, but this series figures near the bottom of the list of series that I have watched so far."
560,Hellbound,"It's a different concept ,,perfect way to describe, superstition of religion and motivate to develop critical thinking of thoughts . In first few episodes it may seems boring but at end you will enjoy it . Waiting for second season kudo's to team."
561,Hellbound,"I've just finished the series and come for the review section. I'm shocked but not surprised with the negative reaction towards this series.Of course the audience that live in secular countries might can't relate for what happen through the story. In most of Asian countries that a lot of them still devoted with religions and any superstitious occurence. When majority of the has been really skeptical with law enforcer, whose made really poor publicity with their arrogance and injustice. While the skepticism grows, they turned their believes with God's and capital punishment. Everything's just get into grey area, where blind fanaticism just getting tense. This series is actually hard to watch, bleak and depressing. And what makes me feel unsettled that this most likely happen in my country. This series has really multi-layered social commentary that are really happening in our society.Hellbound is just not another Final Destination, One Missed Call or Death Note as most reviewer compared. This is brutal, satire and saddening."
562,Hellbound,A lot of nonsense characters. Waste time to watch. Seems like try to make an interesting plot with out any reason. Feeling like watch Grade B movie. Okay to watch if no serious.
563,Hellbound,"I must admit the first few episodes did put me off but I went in a little deeper and I was quite happy what I came out with. I'd say from the 4th episode it gets a lot better. Unfortunately ends on the 6th. The first three episodes will pull out of people off with it's poor acting chops and really shoddy CG. But if you like fantastical stories like youd find in animes or comics, you'll feel right at home with this."
564,Hellbound,"This is underrated. Should be 8 and above. The series picks up pretty quickly, tries to expose the bad parts of humanity and keeps you equally interesting with unexpected scenes and outcomes. Waiting for season 2."
565,Hellbound,"Apart from the question, what is really going on? The rest of the show is outright bad and I'm someone who loves this genre. The acting is ok but I've seen much better. There is some cgi effects that come in the form of the monsters but that's also kinda basic for today's standards. The major issue however is the plot which is totally and completely boring for me. You just watch and watch and watch expecting something cool and amazing to happen but that's unfortunately never comes to pass. 1/10."
566,Hellbound,"I think negative ratings comes from offended white christians (who also happens to be racists for some reason, and treat Asian cinema as something subpar) or from people that expected plain action and offended by drama and feelings.Its great series, very brutal too, it is based on webtoon and you can see it. Some moments were even too brutal for me even though I used to it."
567,Hellbound,"The story is about broadening your outlook about things that can't be explained scientifically and considered supernatural. Instead of labelling every supernatural event as an act of God or an act of cleansing the sins of humans ,we should consider alternate versions as well , instead of suppressing the voice of people who try to decipher it. Asking questions doesn't make anyone against any religion . The story is about not having blind faith in the name of God ."
568,Hellbound,"The worst TV series I've ever watched... The story was bad, and twisted. I thought it would be entertaining when watched the trailer but at the end I just fast forward most of scenes."
569,Hellbound,"I don't get all the bad reviews to be honest, I was engaged from scene one, and I couldn't keep myself from watching all of it at once, an amazing show and I advise all sci-fi fans to watch it, you will enjoy it a lot kept me feeling bad for sometime though."
570,Hellbound,"It is NOT a sci-fi thriler, it is NOT a ghost story, it is NOT a horror movieIt is an allegory of modern organized religion.The story goes like this. There is an explained magical phenomenon happening in a modern society. Nobody can explain it. People are dying. People get panicked. Then some self-proclaimed deacons enter the scene and assure that they are the God's messenger. This is exactly how religion is formed.Now lets go back 2000 years ago. People then thought that they were the most modern society. They saw a new unexplained phenomenon that then-science could not explain (consider plague, consider some guy went into a coma and came to life 3 days later). Some self proclaimed deacons told everyone to follow their orders because God told them so. Does it sound familiar? This is the story of all organized religions in every era of human history in every corner of the earth.Please, please, do not watch this masterpiece as a horror/thriller/sci-fi movie. You will be disappointed. Rather consider the monsters as an unexplained phenomenon that the science of a modern society can't explain. Rest of the story is self-evident. Initially, people saw that sinners were dying. Then some followers started dying. Then a baby died. Clearly, past/present sins had nothing to do with it. On the other hand, the deacons were quite clearly conspiring to keep themselves in power without thinking of sins. What does the situation resemble? Religion.I doubt if the creators will ever confess to it, because the religious fanatics still exist."
571,Hellbound,"I wanna take my time back and have a big question, how can it be on top??? Bad plot, ridiculous situations. The ""angels"" are more like evils. All of messages you can conclude are negative.Avoid this film!!!!!!!!!"
572,Hellbound,"This one is so annoying and disturbing. No cohesion, random things, stupid characters. Mainly I felt so disturbed about the existence of this masked guy yelling at tv. Worst thing I have ever seen."
573,Hellbound,"I usually don't leave reviews here, but I had to for this one. There is so much injustice in this show with very little to no resolution at all that will leave you angry and frustrated by the end of it. Every character on this show is stupid and make decisions that make no sense. Don't waste your time and go watch something else."
574,Hellbound,"People complaining about having no explanation on why the supernatural events are happening just don't understand what the show is about. The show is way more a critic of human behaviors and philosophical dilemmas than a serie about supernatural stuff or an action serie.Just like The Squid Game, it is NOT a serie for everyone. Don't watch it because you see it in the Top 10 or because it's trendy. You need to have the stomach for it, and it could make you very depressed so if you are not in an happy place in your life, my advice would be to wait before you get better before watching this. Watch it because you want and/or love something that is not like other american series and movies. If despite that you watch it then come on IMDb to give it a low score because ""it's boring"", ""dialogue are stupid /acting is bad"" (but not watching it in original language), ""CGI is just average"" (yeah, they MIGHT not have the budget of a Marvel movie; it was still fine IMO), or because they dont tell enough about what's going on (it's just season 1, and again, not the main point the creators are trying to make there).People in a nutshell: ""we want different movies/series, not the rehashed remakes or dumb action stuff"". Filmmaker creates try to make new IPs, with fresher ideas, Netflix export int'l series so we can discover more styles. Same people: ""wth is going on! Boring! Confusing! Gimme back my remakes""."
575,Hellbound,I am giving 1 star because they show waste my 6 hours of time. First 2 episodes were OK but after episode 2 i thought i was watching another show. No story line.
576,Hellbound,"God, intention, interpretation, salvation, human world.Unrealistic, All too unrealistic events
Philosophical, All too philosophical stories
Realistic, All too realistically articulated masterpiece!!!"
577,Hellbound,"I really enjoyed watching the full 6 episodes. I felt this TV Show deserves better reviews than Squid Game. The first 2-3 episodes could be a bit boring, but be patient and watch till the end."
578,Hellbound,"If you expected a time killing series from trailer, I warn you that this is a much heavier series to digest.The series is divided into two sections. You may find first episode of each section a little slow, but if you are immersed into the story, you won't notice that too much.Story-wise, never seen anything like this and it keeps on driving. Great acting from main characters."
579,Hellbound,Concept is good but it failed in overall execution and turn out to be a slow and boring !! Even the characters are so bored to act !! Not at all recommended.
580,Hellbound,"The plot is highly illogical, people's actions are illogical, elite team of fighters losing to a delusional man with a knife. Baby not getting incinerated. The show just doesn't make any sense."
581,Hellbound,"You can watch this if you haven't watched the trailer I guess, wish I hadn't as it revealed alot of the series. Wasn't too impressed with this one. Almost all episodes are kind of similar with an unexplained ending."
582,Hellbound,Honest review. Its an extremely intriguing drama. It does get a little tedious at some parts bt i feel that the level of kdramas has jz been increasing. First squid games nd then this. Plus the actors have done an excellent job. U wont regret watching this drama so give it a shot nd plz plz i request everyone to watch this without comparing it to others or being racist abt it.🙏🏻

1010,Juvenile Justice,"The series is about the cases of a judge in a juvenile court who detests young offenders due to events in her past. It is well acted with the background to each case and then the procedures where justice is supposedly served. It has interesting cases but I found it a depressing watch as there was no levity in any of the episodes just poor parents, abused children and horrible events. An interesting series with a strong central character but very little development on the histories of the rest of the cast and lots of information about the workings of the juvenile justice system."
1011,Juvenile Justice,"It is such laziness that raises the counter argument. One must not let it be, let your guard down, let it slide. Because justice is not only about fairness to the offender, especially the young, but more importantly fairness to the victim.This is a heavy drama. No relief at all. If you don't like that skip it. All cases are supposedly based on real cases. There are some moments of lingering sentimentality. But those can be forgiven for completing the arch of emotions.Recall there were 5 cases, one sidetracked involving a half way house of sorts. Beside the concluding case, I find the school cheating scandal most interesting. Because the show explained how the rich kid cheaters can benefit (and hurt others) even more by dropping out of school. The law have it's limits. This cases also lead to the main backstory and also onto other brutal and organized crimes by the same defenders.Obviously the underage murder is also shocking as to how they thought about deceiving the system.The main lead is tremendously restraint. I especially like how slow, weighted and the preciseness (seemingly as I don't know Korean) of her enounciations. From the get go you know there must be a back story to 'I detest juvenile offenders'Two points taken off for the over righteous concluding speech during the discipline hearing. And heavy focus on the main character. But still excellent."
1012,Juvenile Justice,"Ignore the paid-for, planted raves in the reviews here. Watch it for yourself. This is a big step down from other South Korean shows that have graced Netflix lately. It's pure lowest common denominator TV fare with outsized characters, silly situations and bad acting."
1013,Juvenile Justice,"I found this series to be very touching, bringing lots of emotions to the fore. It has an important social message concerning the delicacies of raising children in the correct manner. Superb acting with excellent scripts and filmography. All in all it is a very intelligent series well worth watching."
1014,Juvenile Justice,"This is a serious drama that seeks to look carefully at the good and bad of juvenile justice in Korea. As usual for Korean drama that is achieved via a highly engaging story line that entertains as well as informs.Just occasionally the travails of Judge Sim, the key protagonist, lurch beyond credibility. But the propulsive plot and powerful acting keep you glued and almost succeed in cloaking these moments.Overall a highly rewarding watch that I recommend to everyone who has yet to discover the great strengths of Korean dramas."
1015,Juvenile Justice,"Brief and unique is all I can say, it all based on real life crime. As a real life crime obsessed I approve that this really is happening to kids that lack of attention from parents/guardian but not all because in some case they're just psycho. I love how director just give 10 episode instead of 16 that make this even more interesting. Good job on this such a fresh ideas on k-drama content!"
1016,Juvenile Justice,"Good, but i think it's overrated. I would rate it 6/10. I thought it would be better especially after viewing the rating and reading reviews. Good story. Medium acting. Good background music. Season 1 contains 10 episodes."
1017,Juvenile Justice,"I stumbled upon this series while scrolling through Netflix, looked into the first episode and it hit me like a truck. Juvenile Justice really came out of left field for me, and in retrospect I'm really thankful for the experience.The story revolves around Shim Eun Seok (Kim Hye-su), a juvenile court judge who appears stone cold and lays down the law with an iron fist on young offenders, while also battling her own demons of the past deep inside. The juvenile justice system is highly divisive, conflicting and heavily overloaded, laying not only the sentencing and punishment of juvenile offenders on the court but even the aftercare and oversight on the judges themselves. While the law treats them as children who are scarcely accountable for their own actions, often it doesn't defend victims or take their circumstances into account, what lead them down this path. Domestic violence, neglect, mistreatment, bullying, often very hard to properly prosecute. On the other hand, many young criminals straight up expect to get off with nothing but probation and a slap on the wrist while committing very real crimes, theft, robbery, blackmail, prostitution, grievous violence and even murder, fully aware of their actions. Judge Shim sails the muddy waters of this tattered legal embroglio to try and truly punish young criminals and bring absolution to the victims of the system.Honestly, I was truly surprised by this series! I half expected a confusing and boring TV schlock, filled with incessant jargon and theatrical melodrama. But what I got was a very intense, high quality, easily digestible (for a legal series), very binge-worthy story and some of the best acting I've seen in a while! Kim Hye-su completely dominates the role of Judge Shim. Coming off as a stone cold, no-nonsense inquisitor who absolutely throws the book at young criminals trying to slip through the cracks, while she slowly learns that the juvenile court is not only there to punish but also to teach, reform and protect those fallen by the wayside and wronged by the system.The production quality is excellent! The camera work, direction and even the few special effects are way higher quality than one would expect from a TV series of this kind. This far excuses some of the plotholes and the sometimes wooden acting by some of the support cast. I usually don't like kids in series and movies, but I have to say, the young cast brings their A-game and believable acting throughout the series, which was really refreshing. The story goes at breakneck speeds, filled with lots of detail, action, intrigue, investigations and hard choices which makes the series feel a lot longer than 10 episodes. There's never a dull moment watching Judge Shim and co going above and beyond their line of duty to get to the truth and render a truly just verdict in the end.All in all, I highly recommend Juvenile Justice to anyone looking for an intense court drama with a flair for complexity and some action on the side!"
1018,Juvenile Justice,"I don't personally understand all the 10 star reviews, but maybe they understand Korean drama better than me. I really like the premise and the main character, Judge Sim, is intense in a unique way (but almost too much so). The actors, when not screaming or crying, are really engaging. But I'm not a fan of the yelling and over-the-top wailing that permeates each episode. Nor do I enjoy watching young girls constantly getting their hair pulled while being slapped/kicked around- it's almost torture porn-ish. Other than that, interesting storylines, good writing, good production value, and insight into Korean culture are a plus. I also appreciate the messaging that parents need to step up and take care of their children."
1019,Juvenile Justice,"ANOTHER UPDATE: I want to make sure someone unfamiliar with Korea is not deceived by this show or some of the information on this board. It seems I also have to define what ""dramatized"" means. The Korean legal system has a special set of laws for kids under 14. That is the main issue the show is trying to tackle. Some of the crimes depicted in the show did happen. However, the show has purposely lowered the age of the criminals to make it more shocking and fit the narrative of ""under the age of 14."" Lastly, ""NO,"" judges in Korea do not go chasing after suspects. When you take an actual event and embellish it with outrageous details, that's dramatization.UPDATED REVIEW: I've managed to watch a few more episodes. Unfortunately, I am lowering my rating from an 8 to a 6. While the subject matter is interesting and the acting remains strong, the show fails to deliver on many ends.The drama attempts to tackle a very serious issue that has been at the center of controversy in Korea for a while. The show is stacked with a solid lineup of veteran actors who have demonstrated their acting skills in dozens of works and I have no doubt that they will not disappoint here. Having viewed the first couple of episodes, I do find that the story is somewhat over dramatized. Perhaps the show runners felt that taking a more realistic approach may lessen the entertainment value. I think a more subtle approach may have been more effective in bringing the issue to the forefront of discussion."
1020,Juvenile Justice,"This series provides a freshness from the court or law series because it provides a new perspective on child crime. Unfortunately, the main character of the judge is too investigative and crossed the line that should be the domain of the police."
1021,Juvenile Justice,"This series has become one of my favorites, without any effort. I have always appreciated the detective, detective and investigative series, but above all series that take place in court. This series amazed me, the best I've seen.The protagonist, Judge Shim (played by Kim Hye-soo) is simply perfect, she has a very interesting approach to dealing with ""young criminals"" and gives them the right lesson to grow at their best. The backstories of the various characters are treated very well and manage to make you empathize with each of them, from the protagonists to the tertiary characters.I highly recommend this series, it is very interesting and is perfect for a marathon."
1022,Juvenile Justice,"""The law can't protect all victims."" The bitter truth, no matter how much I think unfair it is, but it happens in our reality and this series just depicts the tip of the iceberg on how truly intricate the law is. From the officials to everyone involved in that. Juvenile justice is just so brilliant series that unlike any other legal series, it has that depth of their characters and also talks about young offenders in a way that not only entertain us but also give us some understanding how vulnerable children are that our actions, whether it's good or bad, would affect them greatly."
1023,Juvenile Justice,"Surprisingly good! For me it was a roller coaster of emotions and even had me shed some tears in some episodes. All the cast did wonderful job acting 👏 👏👏.I saw other comments that said ""bad acting"" and ""medium acting"" and I'm asking myself, are they tone-death or did they watch the same show OR did they watch it with English dubbing? Never watch anything with dubbing unless you're doing two things at once. It's never the same!"
1024,Juvenile Justice,"Really fun for the first 2 episodes, after that the level of fun gradually decreases. A series that plays a big story, but when told, there is only water. There is no sharpness of the hot topic of the story left at the end."
1025,Juvenile Justice,"The best thing about this drama is that they are not ""overly-dramatizing"" the crimes as many are suggesting.On the contrary, these crimes are based on real life incidents that shook Korean society to the core. I still remember about the case where a teenage girl chopped up a young kid and then laughed in the court. This was a real case that happened in South Korea.As this is cinema, it's certainly dramatized but almost all cases are real including the one with throwing up the brick.Kim Hye-soo is at her absolute best."
1026,Juvenile Justice,It's very dramatic and emotional series but I like it. The acting is good and it has solid story line. Not boring at all. I'm happy that Netflix Korea has brought another good Korean series.
1027,Juvenile Justice,"Damn what a strong (first) season of a show.Let me start by praising the acting within this series. Everybody does such an amazing job, from the court helpers to the victims. Sometimes you'll forget you're watching actors, and the drama hits even harder because of it. Whoever did the casting for 'Juvenile Justice' should get a raise.Considering the subject matter is juvenile criminality, and this series does not hold back the punches at all, prepare to get a bit depressed at times. There aren't always happy endings. Or as the main actress so eloquently put it: ""The law doesn't protect every single victim"". The main characters do their best to put things right though.That everything isn't tied with a bow at the end of every episode makes it more realistic though. Even when they get the bad guys, as one of the court helpers rightly reminds us, the victim is still scarred for life because of what happened. This is not a happy show.It's thrilling though, and emotional, and shocking. It makes you angry, sad and hopefull. It's *beeping* amazing television. This show is totally worth your free time."
1028,Juvenile Justice,"This show touch all part of case the criminal, the victim, the families. You will see each side of emotions its not just court room darma its journal of emotions. In last episode in few last mints my heart exploded.. the pain of a mother. Kim did a fantastic job ..love her."
1029,Juvenile Justice,The series is fast moving although it is only 10 episodes in total. All the casts are excellent in their portrayal of the characters - including the perpetrators and victims. I am impressed with Judge Sim for standing her grounds on her believes in the way the juveniles should be treated to correct their behaviours for the future.
1030,Juvenile Justice,"I heard Korean dramas are very popular all over south east Asia and especially in China. I'm starting to see why, as all k-dramas I have watched were great (move to heaven, squid game, my name).The characters are shown very well and I could relate quickly. The cases made me think about law and justice. The pace is just right, the story thrilling and touching.Sometimes I'm not sure whether something is Korean culture or individual character e.g. Bosses seem to yell a lot, and there is a strong hierarchy of respect between people, whereas in western culture everyone is more equal, irrespective of age and position (at least compared to as it's shown in juvenile justice). One case is about the education system where I also think some background info would be helpful to research upfront.This left me a tiny bit confused at times.9/10PS: im not criticizing the show for showing Korean culture, just stating it may make some situations seem weird for westerners."
1031,Juvenile Justice,Kim Hye Su delivers her lines with so much conviction and mental prowess her persona alone influences those around her that are morally feeble and need proper cultivation but also rectifies on behalf of those quiet unheard defeated voices at large.
1032,Juvenile Justice,"When people talk about a show being over dramatized as they call it, they forget that this is not a documentary. This is show business therefore it is supposed to deliver some sort of entertainment. You complaining about the drama shows that they have done a good job. It's not a true crime docu-series. While some aspects of the show could be based on real events (which I don't know and don't seem to care) the fact still stands that this is not supposed to be a real life depiction of anything.Now let's get down to the review:This show is a great catch. It is raw and VERY realistic. For example if you've watched Devil Judge you know how the main judge Kang was? Vigilante. Basically green arrow without the arrows. This show didn't have any of that nonsense. No rich judge background. No hidden agenda. She didn't go on a wild chase after the kids who murdered her child. She just did her job. She made sure every sentence was just and victims felt the ""justice""
It was great, the way they walked through the emotions of every character and I can see the show having more than one season because the characters have character.One thing I wish they would have done was give their characters a better backstory and a better ending.So what happened to Kang ? He resigned and then what? He was in so many episodes for them to just eliminate him and give him a cameo in the last episode.The other judge from Busan was great (sorry forgot his name) he had a good backstory BUT what was his ending? When you almost make certain characters the main characters (by giving them so much screen time) they should have a climax. All he said was that he was disappointed but he understood. Then what? What is his ending? If you dont pay close attention you will not find out why he even went to Juvey when he was young.Anyway, these are minor things. A plot can't always be 100% complete. We always miss out certain things as scriptwriters but the script is strong enough to survive the little things."
1033,Juvenile Justice,Parents are the GURU not just a teacher for a child. In Bengali parenting is called ' manus kora' which means making of a human being. This series shows us the effect of neglecting the children and also the effect of too much care. This also shows how bad judgment can bring more crimes.Overall this series gives a very good social message.
1034,Juvenile Justice,"First time I wrote a review because how good this drama really is. The lead actress acting is really great. Also my first time finishing a K-Drama series. I watched a lot of K-Drama but never actually finish it off because usually they are expected and somewhat slow pacing so I got bored easily. But this series really got me hooked bad. Finished it in a week. Not sure about the popularity of the actor and actresses but I don't they are that popular? Compare to other drama series that at least have one popular lead. Anyway, definitely must watch!"
1035,Juvenile Justice,"This Netflix original series is the saddest and one of the best show i have ever seen. Juvenile Justice is so well-written and it deserves more recognition! It depicts so many social issues about young offenders, mirroring someone's reality in a heartbreaking way. The plot, characters, acting, and every aspects are just remarkable."
1036,Juvenile Justice,"Well, it is a shame but it was a real case in Korea few years ago that two juveniles have butchered a little kid. Also it is a serious issue in Korea that the laws and punishments are very weak including juvenile justice. All the episodes were based on real cases in Korea that were major juvenile issues in recent few years. This drama has shown serious issues in Korea and dealt some cases to help people realize that juvenile crimes are not minor crimes anymore but they have become serious crimes. I really wanna say that the actors have done great jobs.And before you judge ""Asian"" dramas for different cultures that you don't understand, I really recommend you to look up their cultures before, after or while you watch them because that's what most Asian people would do when they watch ""Non-Asian"" dramas."
1037,Juvenile Justice,"Nothing to say, just watch it :)All episodes are based on true crimes.It is just by far my favorite law related Korean TV-series.It is just epic. I finished all episodes in one day."
1038,Juvenile Justice,10 episodes is just not long enough.Watched the whole series in one day.The acting and the raw emotions it brought out is superb.Just watch it.you will be hooked as well.
1039,Juvenile Justice,"The main actress has a stunning interpretation on this kdrama! She is fierce on her acting as she does on other kdramas as Signal and Hyena! This one caught me and saw all 10episodes in 2 days, each episode captures your attention and many cases were inspired in true crimes commited in Korea. Totally worth watching."
1040,Juvenile Justice,"I don't understand why people here complain about a drama being a drama.I mean, the series are created to warn us what happens if we, adults, fail in parenting juvenile. The director perhaps has his/her intention in doing so. The important this is what comes in your mind after watching this. The great series always leave spaces for its audience to think.Each character has their own storyline and this is very well-delivered by actors. All actors have magnificent skills in delivering lines that could be cringe in a clear and effective way. There is no right or wrong answers in reality, so as the characters' belief. It is all about discussing and finding the best answer of what WE could do for a juvenile. By caring and paying attention on social issues or by funding childcare centres? This is the message that the series demonstrate and, I think it is our responsibility to make an action.""It takes a village to raise a child.""
I would say, this is the best series that could ever describe the true meaning of this phrase."
1041,Juvenile Justice,Juvenile Justice will have you on the edge of your seat on every episode because of the many unexpected turns. I hope that there will be more seasons because there are plenty of shocking stories to tell.
1042,Juvenile Justice,"Presented the roots of the problems our juveniles face today. The consequences of the parents not being involved in their lives. The need for more community support and resources for parents and families. The legal system is overwhelmed and backlogged with juvenile cases. Corruption in the government. What money can buy. These are true circumstances for modern day society.I though there was just too much profanity in the English translation. Personally, I don't think it represents the Korean people. I'm sure they have profanity, not the one the western world has, nor the way it was used in this series. I hope they tone it down if they plan to make further episodes."

1076,Law School,A group of students at a law school excel in learning the law and performing mock trials. All the students have issues which come to light and they become involved in cases of corruption and murder. The series is well acted and in parts absorbing and interesting but it does seem disjointed. There are parts of the story which just come to an abrupt end and there are too many subplots which have no real development and with less going on and more focus this series would have been better.
1077,Law School,"Only was able to watch 3 episodes. And had to give up. Since I needed subtitles, the back and forth time lines(more than 2) is making me dizzy. This and the complexity of the law arguments that is needed to show off the students and their personalities, and the murky relationship setups.Now my mind is almost out of it. Not to mentioned the school politics. I get it, it's homage to Rashomon. But execution is a bit clunky, not focused. Complexity is not always about the number of items, can be about depth of a few.Or maybe is the styling of the show that's just not up my alley. Lighting is too bright, too even, camera works sometimes too tricky. Any everyone delivering their lines at the same pace.I don't doubt that this is a good series but better luck next time."
1078,Law School,"The following is my brief with respect to this series. LS is, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of being a supreme legal drama.Fantasy shows don't appeal to everybody: Some prefer realistic dramas. There are many more that hate procedure, or predictability: They want to be surprised by a last minute, reluctant witness. This show should only satisfy one of these groups......perhaps it will of neither of them will favor it.This could almost be labeled a law school ""fantasy"" series, as unviable as that sounds. The web of lives, the condensed degrees of separation, and the tangle of grudges and motivations wouldn't be admissible in a true-to-life drama. It is a strain to think of professors at an ivy league level school being as caring as the profs in this drama are. Identifying the right suspect is not as predictable as it is slightly erroneous. Astute viewers may still be able to pinpoint the killer with ease and declare it too predictable.... To which I say: ""Quash all of that. Who cares?""LS is not guilty of contempt. They've put together a winning case.So, suspend your skepticism and examine all the evidence yourself. The jury most watch the whole show prior to deliberations, so we are remanded to get on the roller-coaster and enjoy LS.This show is written, directed, and edited, with a habile hand (I just looked ""habile"" up and decided to use it....pretty cool word, right? I hope it impresses the judge and jury).LS follows the lives of law school students and some of the professors, as well: Their struggles and triumphs, families, friends, and foes, and their growth as they navigate through the fraught chambers of their lauded institution.Prof Yang and Kang Sol A are fabulous characters. I could listen to Kim Myung-Min (Prof Yang) talk all day. His voice is divinely masculine and deep. It would have been tossed out if he couldn't act, or take command of the courtroom, but he can, and very well ar that.The director sustains the tension throughout the series. It's high mystery in classic form. The taut editing and soundtrack sequester the audience in a state of suspense. If you reason that you know who the culprit is in EP 3, you might waiver by EP 8. The evidence keeps our minds in motion, turning like a bottle being spun on a table.We should overrule some of their arguments, though. There are things that seem judiciously obvious to the court at large, that elude their brilliant minds. That always weighs a case down.I strongly object to the last moments of the show, which are remitted as way too brief. We get very little discovery pertaining to what the characters went on to do or what the relationship is of the three that are walking together at the end. It resounded like a cracked gavel. That may be heresay, however, the prosecution will argue that it's pure negligence to wrap up a 16+ hour series with a 10 second consultation. Would that we could depose the director about that decision.However, we can easily dismiss any such torts committed by the director. Indubitably, the director's curriculum vitae (resume) shows he's had a solid run, and has high likeability factor. The overall quality of the piece is a mitigating factor taken into account in the sentencing phase: LS gets all the credit for time served, and remains released for all if us to enjoy.I originally postponed the hearing on LS as I wasn't convinced that it would sway me. The worth of its collateral was evident once its docket came up on the calendar (my Netflix queue), and I sat in judgment. While I wasn't confident of its appeal, now that all the exhibits have been examined, Res Ipsa Loquitor: The thing speaks for itself.In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this drama has acquitted itself laudably. The ratings prove what broad appeal it has. The preponderance of the evidence is that this show has prevailed in it's effort to convince us of its credibility. So don't waiver: Watch as an interested party. I'm sure you will agree to stipulate the worthiness of the production.IMHO...

1079,Law School,If you doubt the unproven facts. Would you show the injustice to exonerate someone?This comes to mind when I see this serie. It is indeed a shame about the timelines that are in it. Making everything too chaotic for me. So i watch this serie from time to time. Because it's a good storyline.
1080,Law School,"I was waiting something great when I saw the first two episodes. However, I was wrong. I was only bored after every single episode. Too much legal terminology, unrealistic characters , predictable plot twists and so many flashbacks with no reason.The only positive was the soundtrack and of course its ability to make me sleep like a little bird."
1081,Law School,"At first, i thought that this would just be like any other thriller drama where the first episode presents the characters and what this series is about. And finally, episode 2&3 will show a major secret villain. But nope, it got me wrong. Each episode will just make the viewer feeling gawk even more. And then when the OST ""it's driving me crazy"" hits you'll just go along because that is what this drama is.Only a small minus, the characters speak and subtitles, sometimes, are too fast. Great series overall."
1082,Law School,"I would've loved to have been locked in with the storyliners when they decided how they were going to take the plot lines and weave them all together. Each of the characters' stories are relatively linear individually, but they are told in an interwoven and complex way due to people's lies and the hiding of truth.The viewer is asked consider their own perspective on things like copying other people's intellectual property, permissions granted or taken, the simple rules we break and the possible consequences of those, and whether or not we can ever truly know the world that generations outside of our own, live in. A number of the subplots ask you to consider the very human cost of judicial papertrails and decisions.The parallel premise of the teaching of what law means and how it ought to be used, and the way it actually exists in the real world, is masterfully presented by the lead actors. I recommend you watch the first two episodes together before you decide whether or not you're going to continue. I quite often waited until there were three episodes in a row available before I watched, as it was just too frustrating to have to wait for the next one!"
1083,Law School,Law school is arguably one of the best K dramas I have watched for this year The first episode has you gripped immediately and every episode after that gets better and better I don't think I've watched a drama where the ending was also as good as the whole show it was definitely a satisfying watch every episode had me gripped at the edge of my seat with anticipation.
1084,Law School,"For now it is very good I hope all episodes are good as first 3, music in this is also amazing."
1085,Law School,One of the best shows yet. Please have another season.
1086,Law School,An incredible series: 16 hours long that just flew by in a whirl of brilliant acting and direction. There are times when you laugh out loud and times when you cry. I just hope they think of doing a second series.........please?!
1087,Law School,"Typical of KDramas, this one started slow on the first 3 episodes but rolled fast starting the 4th.If you're a lover of courtroom drama, you will not be disappointed at all with this.I binged and did not want it to end when I realized I was already on the 15th episode.I definitely will re-watch a few months from now."
1088,Law School,"Netflix has pretty well single-handedly zombiefied us with binge programming. They have lured us into a huge dependency, so now they expect us to settle for a show that comes slow drip after slow drip.It's a killer and makes a very good series a chore.Give it up, N'Fix. It's not big and it's not clever!!!"
1089,Law School,"The timeline is really complicated. I also didn't really like Kang sol A's character. Because i don't understand the plot, i feel bored and then i stopped watching this."
1090,Law School,"This is just What I expect from a Low based drama. Explaining Low issues, along with showing the character's emotions clearly during a powerful crime script, all in an attractive storyline is the drama's best option."
1091,Law School,"Can't get enough of watching it once so I watch it twice😍 I can say that LAW SCHOOL is one of the BEST Korean drama and legal drama of all time. This is the very first time I write a review on a drama because I find it worthy of my review. It's quite confusing at first because of the law jargons, but if you give attention to it you will be hooked and keep asking for more because every episode gets better and leave a hanging and intense ending. I think all questions and cases from the start to end has been solved but they don't show it on detailed because they think of it unnecessary and can make the series more complex. And it is also a nature of Korean drama that they end the drama hanging. So, it's just perfect for me! The storyline was quite amazing and mind-blowing because you can't guess what will happen next. All actors did a great job in portraying their roles. Kim Bum's acting is so lit! His so charming and natural.👏Of course the OST is also amazing because it fits well to the mood of the drama, kudos to the music team it give chills and goosebumps to the drama. Han Joon Hwi and Kang Sol A's chemistry? Just perfect! Korean drama cliche? LAW SCHOOL doesn't have it! It is more on ""new side of Korean drama"". This drama did a great job in giving and showing the viewers knowledge on law and justice. Another is, it gives a lesson to every student especially college students that no matter how you struggle in your course, you even think on quiting and giving up because you think you are not capable to it, don't lose hope. Even though many people are dragging you down, there are also people who are willing to be on your side and help you until you succeed. Kudos to the whole law school team! A job well done! I am not asking for SEASON 2 because season 1 is just perfect for me, but if there is another season I will be rooting for it.🤞 I highly recommend this exceptional Korean drama! If you haven't watch it, you're missing a great masterpiece! 💚💚💚😇"
1092,Law School,"As a person who loves law related shows, i loved this drama, i binge watched all of it in a day. I think you will either love this drama or hate it, depending on your preference of plots. The storyline follows a professor of a popular law school being suspected of a murder of another professor, and his students help him get proven innocent. Of course there are side plots as well more little details, but i think it's better to watch the drama rather than reading about the side plots. Overall, i loved this drama and it's definitely in my top 10 kdramas list."
1093,Law School,"Firstly i would like to state that this series is not a masterpiece in anyway however, it still keeps you hooked to it. After watching the first few episodes it gave me the vibe of the ""How to Get Away with Murder"" series which it heavily inspires from (this statement in no way claims that the series is a rip-off).The twist and turns in the episodes may sometime make u scratch your head as in ""what the hell is going on"" but trust me it is still watchable."
1094,Law School,"Fast paced with interesting characters. Kept me watching, guessing and wanting more."
1095,Law School,LAW SCHOOL is now become my favorite kdrama of all time. Omg this story is so interesting. Like everyone has a secret and I like how every episode ends with a cliffhanger. So basically this drama is about a murder of a person which takes place at a law school. Like everyone is a suspect the main point of the story is finding out who is the murder. I like every single character here prof yang junghoon gotta to be my fav character at first I had mixed feelings about him but as the episodes went on I started loving him more and more he is such a great character. I am telling u will enjoy it. Its still airing as of now I can't wait for the next few episodes to come out I am still in ep 8 but still so far I absolutely love it. Its my summer vacation as of now and this drama just made my vacation better. I will give u my review after I finished watching it fully.Now like what are u waiting for go watch it.
1096,Law School,1 star because han joon hwi did not confess to kang sol A :( I was expecting something between them.
1097,Law School,"To start with the less than ideal bits, there are moments in the show when the plot feels farfetched and a bit too convenient, and it certainly has its fair share of cliches. But towards the end, I found myself empathetic for the characters and was happy to see their lives turned out well. This was a pleasant surprise for me since I rarely get this invested in characters in a ""warm"" show like this.This brings me to the next point. There are great show/movies these days with deep/intriguing plots that make you invested, and shows/movies that are warm and just give you a good time. But these two categories are too often mutually exclusive of each other. In my opinion this show is a healthy blend of the two.Overall I'd recommend it if you enjoy good acting and entertaining plot and are okay with the few shortcomings I've mentioned above."
1098,Law School,"This drama gradually builds up excitement in every episode as it progresses. The ost of this drama adds even more excitement and meaning to the drama. Unlike other typical law dramas, Law School is unique. The drama represents real cases that actually happens in people's lives. There is a lot to learn from this drama."
1099,Law School,"I also had similar this feels like how to get away with murder vibes and was already starting to get a headache if it did turn out that way. But the way they turned one crime and went to intricaies of it and all it's connection had me blown away. Some episodes got me all whoaaaa what!! All the suspicion and the way the story has been delivered has expanded my very own imagination.I know the first episode was not delivered that well but beyond that has been a quite a enjoyable ride. And it is not as slow as it seems, your mind will be constantly engaged . And if you would be willing to cross the barrier of subtitles and biases against korean production then it will be a gem that you will find. I'm currently on the 13th episode and impatiently waiting for more."
1100,Law School,Every episodes tend to bring new stories and backstories of characters. Every characters are unique. Each episodes ends with a twist.
1101,Law School,"Honestly, this is the best among all similar genre I've watched before ! Many said it has the How To Get Away With Murder vibes but for me, this one is more light and less complicated. I love the feeling of fully anticipating for the next episode to come as it leaves us with more questions, rather than being confused. The OSTs and background music are no joke too. However, Law School is really underrated maybe because some thinks that it would be complicated as hell - which is actually not. Try watching until the 2nd episode and you will not get enough of this drama as it makes the 1st episode finally realistic. Trust me, I've watched until 9 and here I am craving for more 🙃"
1102,Law School,If you are interested in law the this drama is an ace.
1103,Law School,"After a long time, I've witnessed one of the most naturalistic shows on Television! ""Law School"" went beyond my expectation level. It has this amazing quality of making the audience stick to their seats the entire time. The cast, their dialogue delivery and expression - everything is top-notch. The lead roles - Kim Bum, Ryu Hye-young and Kim Myung-min are outstanding, and the way they wrapped up the show is what I call a ""PURE CLASS""! And you'll get the vibe ever time the OST hits. It's addictive!This series speaks about the law, the justice and the judiciary system...as well as its ups and downs and complexity. There will be always multiple strings within the system, and it is inevitable. But at the end of the day, justice should be served at any cost no matter how long it takes - and Law School does not hesitate to imply that fact.For me the most intriguing part is, despite being a high-school drama, Law School does not deliver any extra sugarcoating romance or cheesy scenes like the other Netflix shows. You will come across the regular student life, the pressure and struggle that we all have gone through in our lives. That's where it connects the dots with us.Now that it has ended, I hate to acknowledge that I will miss this show terribly. I loved every one of them, and maybe I will take this memory to my grave too."
1104,Law School,"This drama 'law school ' its everything I reallly love this drama the story line the cast most especially professor, sol a and Han joon hwi."
1105,Law School,"Well, I watched many kinds of dramas of different genre. Many hyped dramas didn't reach my expectation. But surprisingly though this drama wasn't very much hyped but I truly enjoyed while watching. The acting was okay and also liked the twist in every episode of this drama. After watching each episode I was eagerly waiting for the next episode to see what actually happened or what the plot of the next episode holding. But what I loved the most is the message that was given to the audience! Yeah, ""Law shouldn't be unjust"" and ""One shouldn't use the law for his/her selfish motives and obviously we shouldn't allow to use law for self gain"" 👏👍"
1106,Law School,"Solid acting performance. What a screenplay, very good. I just love this drama.Overall it's a MASTERPIECE!!"
1107,Law School,Such a great series! It's a new favorite and i dont think anything can top it at the moment. I love everything abt it especially the characters and even the cast. The plot is also really interesting and it just keeps u hooked. Hoping for a season 2 ^^
1108,Law School,"Incredible plot twist with small detail, these detail are driving me crazy."
1109,Law School,"Omg y'all must watch this drama, although you don't like law genre just give it a try okay. This is my number one law drama!! What an excellent works!! I'm so thankful but hard to move on hehe!!"
1110,Law School,"The series is beautiful in terms of photography and in terms of story, but in some flash back scenes need a clarification for it . The series would have been wonderful if the scenes could be clarified with phrases or some effects."
1111,Law School,"If you're not familiar with law terms, the pause button is the answer. The timeline will make you confuse. The actor talk too fast and you'll hardly cacth up. Plus they spoke korean. You are likely missing the point of the show if you're not rewind or pause the episode. But overall it's a good show. I could've give 9 stars, but the music is annoying. You'll get it when you saw the show."
1112,Law School,"I loved this series. Many of the law school bits are accurate to legal studies. I do think the series could have ended after 11 episodes and been very strong. It dragged on for a bit. But I did enjoy how the episodes looked back in time at the histories of the characters, who I grew to love."
1113,Law School,"I was beginning to lose interest in this nearly halfway through ep4, because - thanks to the absolute brilliant editing - it was starting to feel too obvious, the 'whodunnit', for what is supposed to be a 16-episode law-school-based mystery. But that sucker punch of a twist that is -(again, brilliant editing)- juxtaposed with certain reasoning exposition, JUST WOW.Will I revisit this review when I'm done with this series to rewrite it into a complete comprehensive one to the best of my ability? Dunno. Maybe. We'll see. 😁"
1114,Law School,"I really liked the drama and the writers desire to compels you to see the next episode. Liked the way Kim Bum tried to make himself understated but prominent character. Each character has their own story blending in with the events of story being prominent. My only disappointment is that when Netflix handling of the ending. They originally stated that the next episode would be in ""X"" amount of days and then all of a sudden there were no more episodes. WTF Netflix?"
1115,Law School,Love this show! Keeps you on your toes in suspense on what's going to happen next.

1156,Voice,A team based at a emergency call centre called the golden time team are tasked with solving emergencies in the optimum time period before tragedy. Luckily the team is headed by a lady with exceptional hearing and contains a brilliant but loose cannon detective. Running through the series is the search for a clever serial killer who has murdered people in both their pasts. Has some good parts but overall disappointing in that the characters are mostly unlikeable or stupid. Plenty of needless blood and gore and repetitive scenes also marr the story
1157,Voice,"I thought the series got off to a sluggish start-the wife of a police officer is stalked and killed by a smooth-talking, elegant killer armed with a sort of ball peen hammer and the story drags while the officer grieves. Then, the authorities think they have the culprit, but another (female) officer-a call centre operative-claims the voice of the suspect does NOT match her recollection. Thus, we encounter the unique 'hitch' of this show: this girl has amazing hearing, a skill she has developed diligently. As work begins on other cases, this 'gift' plays a big part, and we suspect one day, she will identify the voice of our mysterious serial killer with the 'slugging device'.The series contains forensic errors, and some unexplained plot elements, which savvy viewers in the Western Hemisphere will detect easily, but the gifted call Center Officer & the cop with the murdered wife, and their new team, combine for suspenseful episodes, if you stick with it. This 'gifted faculty' thing is catching on: we have Monk with his obsessive-compulsive attention to details; Sniffer, a Russian crime series with a human bloodhound; and the defunct LIE To ME about a human lie detector. It all makes for fun if you suspend your belief a bit. It all started with Sherlock Holmes, you know, in Victorian England, and his gift of observation & deduction.So, despite its faults, and some grisly moments when the mysterious killer strikes, we are going to wait this one out TIL our gifted girl nails the bad guy."
1158,Voice,"The season 1 was an ordinary detective drama with little intense only. However it still has some illogical moments. I wish the director learn how police force worksand procedures because they made it rubbish.I can say its nothing exciting on this Season 1, while Season 2 is worse than this and Season is the worst. Season 4 is better than all its predessors."
1159,Voice,Stupid finish and stupid acting by the main guy. Overactinguch. Non of this is clos to realistic. The female is pathetic even when she runs she runs like a pathetic person who says things that try to sound smart but because they are Korean they get it all wrong. Disappointing show as I have watched 60 plus Korean shows and most are great.
1160,Voice,Review is based on season 1 & 2 available on Nexflix. There is no continuation though its a cliffhanger! The drama is ok. Season 1 is better than 2. There are 4 seasons in the drama. Too much betrayal.
1161,Voice,"This show is laughably bad. Starting with the writing, the dialogue is terrible, and the situations unlikely in the real world. The outcome is it's just not believable at all."
1162,Voice,"Not up to other Korean crime shows. Kang Kwon Joo has someone enter her room in the first season, and the team takes no precaution from experience. And not immediately following up on the last place Na Hong-Soo was seem. Both lead male characters just were not that believable. Korean cop shows non Netflix seem to generally pretty good but this one is just so frustrating stupid."
1163,Voice,I really really appreciate and enjoy this drama because it was kept me at edge of my sit any time I watch each Season. I and 15 friends really love it. I hope to watch more Season of it❤❤💯💯
1164,Voice,"Just goes to show how important a script is. You can have good actors, and a good story with appropriate twists and cliffhangers. But the captions have got to go. I understand that it's incredibly complicated to try and convey the depth of what is happening in bite-size captions, especially with cultural and linguistical differences. But...really ? Almost every interaction between characters goes something like this: Character 1-""The suspect is in the alley""...Character 2-""So...what you're saying is that the suspect is in the alley?"" I'm 5 episodes in and it just continues and continues. Quite maddening. Decently entertaining otherwise."
1165,Voice,"If you are an American living in the USA it's really hard to watch because the police procedures are so imbecillic compared to what we expect them to be. Officers physically abuse suspects and each other, subordinates yell at their superiors, rich people physically abuse poor people, and when unhappy kick their employees in the knees, and officers are allowed a lot of leeway without being suspended for bad behavior. Also, the cops are very hesitant about using their firearms to end a conflict with criminals; even in life and death situations. Come on guys, shoot him...in the head, the arm, the leg, something. Sometimes the head of the Center responds immediately to information or situations. Other times she stands frozen like a deer in the headlights prompting the viewer to scream, ""Do something!"""
1166,Voice,"I like Jang Hyuk as an actor, but I didn't even feel a little guilt or sadness from him when his wife died. He was just busy trying to be the cool guy like he always has in every other show. And why is the one-look-throughout-the-entire-show female lead always whispering?! Seriously, even the supporting actors and actresses show more emotions than both male and female MCs.In episode 3, the drug Midazolam doesn't work like this... You don't need to swallow it for it to take effect. All you need to do is drip it in your mouth. He had it in his mouth for like a minute before he spat it out. It would've taken effect.Exactly how inefficient are the cops in Korea? 15 mins on a smartphone with names and you still can't pinpoint the person's location? Even my friend locator app does better than that.And how can she tell which direction a sound is coming from through a mono walkie talkie? She doesn't even know which direction the walkie talkie is facing. Even god can't do that. ""It's on your left"" my bottom!"
1167,Voice,"I wonder whether they consulted someone from police before writting the script. A lot of things will stress you out and everyone who watched at least one series of CSI would be a better detective than those in Voice. On the other hand, the crimes are scary and very intense and I can only hope nothing like that actually goes on in Korea and if so, i hope those investigating them, are more competent..
What i liked.. hmm when it comes to Jang Hyuk i am a modest person, his martial arts skills made up for the lousy script and narrative. It isnt terrible, it is still watchable, but prepare to be forgiving ;-)"
1168,Voice,"Ridiculous, meaningless, lousy performances, poor script. Underestimates the intelligence and judgment of those who watch this crap."
1169,Voice,A good idea spoiled by bad acting and direction and the worst continuity goofs I have ever seen. I haven't got time or room to list them all but what about this? The cop fights with the criminal on the roof of a building in the middle of the night. The back up arrives to see the cop bringing the criminal out of the door of the building in the bright sunny daylight!!! Need I say more?
1170,Voice,"Knowing how dark and thrilling Korean dramas can be, I must say that I'm disappointed by this show.
I watched the first season only.
Kim Jay-wook was amazing I could feal how scary he is and at the same time I did feel bad for him at the end of the show. So he gave his character its fair representation.
For other characters... I'm not so sure.. And the over all series is weak too.
It would have been better if they only focused on following the main serial killer only and little by little filling up the story holes.
So... Is it recommended!
I would say... No, there are better, but if you are a fan of Kim Jay wook then it's a must even though sadly he didn't appear for a large portion of the series"
1171,Voice,"Yes , although like some programs or movies there were some flaws ... But Damn , Hyuk Jang portrayed his character superbly . Although the other actors & actresses did a great job also , to me , it seemed as though the series centered on Hyuk Jang's character . Hey which I loved . We need more honest , moralistic , no fear , kinda people like that not only in every cop station but just in general population. I'm now getting ready to watch season 2 on Netflix & I sure hope I don't have to wait to long for Netflix to pick up 3 & 4"
1172,Voice,"The trailer was promising but at the end I must say it was a disappointment. So many things that are unrealistic: Emergency call center, code zero, everybody would know what their job is but they wait to get orders from the female main character to track a mobile or a car? - One person drives within a few minutes from one crime scene, to a press conference to a 2nd crime scene and the local forces arrive at the same time or even later - one gets within three minutes to a crime scene, the other detective hasn't even left the police station in the same time - sometimes they need to press on the micro to talk and sometimes not - very slow reaction time, they wait at their desk for all the information and then run to their car, or they discuss instead of trying to find the victim, really? - and who would only walk around a corner or go into the interrogation room to make a confidential phone call? etc.
I know it's TV but serious it's annyoing when they make such unrealistic scenes."
1173,Voice,You know im just 3 episodes in.1 major flaw: all crime suspect didnt bother to kill the phone call to the police while continue to do whatever they want with the victims? Which moron does that?And that woman is able to listen to miniscule sounds coming from a normal headset.No doubt the drama could be suspenseful. But then again. Im not watching superman or supergirl.Totally unrealistic.
1174,Voice,I started watching Korean movies tv shows my sister told me about some. I loved the drama even though I'm late for when it came out. I've watched it a total of 6 times or more. Netflix didn't have season 3 but I was determined to find it on a Korean site and I did. Wished it ended differently. Good actors and actresses. A really good twist on cop show
1175,Voice,The cases the team investigates are interesting. The lead female character is unusual for a police officer. She hyperventilates a lot. The main female support charachter is more believable
1176,Voice,"The police make the keystone cops look like the FBI, and that's being generous. I'm wondering why they lean so heavily on corruption with police connivance in Korean cop shows. Their incompetence is enough to make you consider moving to Korea to become a criminal."
1177,Voice,"When you have transvertist in high heel running faster than police on hilly street, you know that you are in for a nonsense police drama. The police in the drama is so inefficient that you thought the only police working in Korea is the one in a call center. Avoid, unless you are dead bored."
1178,Voice,"This show had potential and an interesting, semi-Sherlock-ian premise. It quickly turned into a collection of every B-movie cliche and the worst, most unbelievably bad police work.
We are burdened with:
the troubled, live-outside-the-lines detective with a vengeance;cops who apparently have never heard of handcuffs;thugs who conveniently attack 1 at a time so our hero can defeat everyone ever;a 10 to 30 second discussion before doing ANYTHING - including chasing a bad guy;the showdown- where our hero tells everyone to back off because ""this one's personal.""Yes, it's that bad. At one point a detective stops mid- foot pursuit to take a phone call. Bad guy (dressed in standard, obvious Hitman uniform) gains another 100 yards in distance. Cop then says ""let me catch this guy and I'll get back to you,"" and starts running again.I could go on but why?"
1179,Voice,"Deep into my kdrama obsession, I recently watched the romantic comedy Her Private Life and this account immediately became a KJU stan account lol. I decided to watch all of his past work that I could find, and saw a lot of praise for his portrayal of Mo Tae Gu in The Voice. I watched the first season, and the ONLY reason I made it to the end was KJU's magnetic portrayal of the deranged serial killer. He gets 10/10 stars for his performance.Having watched dozens of kdramas, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to the differences between Korean and Western TV shows, but this particular drama was terrible as a police procedural. I would 1000000% have rather watched a 16 episode season of the police tracking MTG as he toyed with the leads. The extraneous stories were just not interesting, and I found myself fast forwarding to only watch when KJU was onscreen or being investigated.The female lead who plays Kang Kwon Joo just didn't do it for me at all. Her character strains credulity in the way she uses her extreme sense of hearing, and it seems like her facial expression hardly ever changes. While I really enjoyed the male lead when he was Yi Bang Won in My Country: The New Age, his portrayal of Moo Jin Hyeok doesn't have the same charisma as I've seen from him before.KJU was the only redeeming quality of this drama. His incredible acting and presence brings depth to a character that might otherwise have been a boring cliche. I'm in awe of the way he uses his facial expressions and subtle movements to convey emotion, sometimes with only the slightest flicker in his eyes, or a hint of a smile or snarl.The only problem with him in this role is that he oozes sexuality out of every pore, and I kept having to remind myself he's a really bad guy, because he somehow becomes more attractive the more unhinged he becomes. The way he fully embodies his roles, no matter how different they might be, really shows his range as an actor.So in summary, season 1 is watchable solely for Kim Jae Uk. I will not be watching further seasons, and will instead move onto to more of KJU's old work."
1180,Voice,"She can hear every useless sound but she can't hear the footsteps and keyboard of Mo tae goo in the first floor. But when they go up to the second floor, she can hear his cannonball in his hand. The first half of the series is good but there are too many logic errors made me crazy."
1181,Voice,"Maybe I'm being a little unfair, but I started watching this coming off the back of Stranger (Bimilui Soop) which is really very good and fancied watching another Korean series.I like the cast and some of the stories within the main arc are pretty cool. But as others have said, the decisions made by the Golden Time Team can be really dumb. They seem to spend a crazy amount of time listening, watching, before actually doing! They display the time onscreen since the calls came in, which seems redundant when they are so slow to respond.Also, unlike Stranger, the cops seem to carry guns more often (in Stranger they always seemed to have tasers) yet seem like they really don't want to use them at all, as they would rather wave them around than actually shoot them.And yet......I must admit I'm enjoying it and its cheesiness. The cast are good enough to keep me watching, as are some of the contained stories."
1182,Voice,"It's clear from this drama that the CSI and forensic evidence programs so common in the US and UK etc. haven't yet made it to Korea. There is constant snap diagnoses at a crime scene, often by detectives and without, for instance, a medical examination of a cause of feath, that for some reason is thought to be irrefutable. A prisoner is strangled leaving ligature marks amd dosed with gas and set on fire with a lighter afyer which the perp escapes out an open window and when the cops finally bust the door open theg immediately call it suicide. So... in a locked bathroom the now dead guy somehow manages to dose himself with gasoline and, without lighter or mstch burn himself up and it erases all signs of ligature marks... Just stupid. Other than pre-SCI bumbling and a woman who hears everything but only sectively (the basis of the show), this is entertaining."
1183,Voice,"So my cousin recommended this. From the start, it just increased my blood pressure because of how stupid all the officers are. If all police officers are just like in this drama , then don't rely on them anymore. The talent of the female lead is amazing but the way they solve a crime really sucks. It's just like they don't really care about the victims who are calling for help because they act slow, move slow and they have no sense of urgency. This is not how you respond to an emergency. The crimes are so intense but the way these leads try to respond or solve these crimes is so laughable and it just makes you angry."
1184,Voice,"I have watched the series twice in order to have a clear perspective. I find it is not thrilling as it was supposed to be.Main actress
Her performance in this series was not as good as I expected. The acting is neither expressive nor appropriate for this type of series. To declare, the acting has not changed dramatically and accordingly to the features of different situations. It was questionable to me when she is angry, sad, doubtful etc., her face is not changed at all. Her tone of voice is low across two seasons, and there is no such clear emphasization while talking. It makes the series mostly likely are unexpectedly low-key even when there are (various) climaxes.Contents
After I watched them the 2nd time, I figured out that, without the special ability of the main actress, it is extremely difficult to persuade viewers on how the cases are solved. Hence, the whole series exposed to heavily rely on the ability of the character in order to solve crimes.Due to the dependance on the main actress, the other actors and actresses are not able to be highlighted adequately. Sometimes they even seem desultory in the big picture.Positive points
The improvement in content development in season 2: more thrilling, more logic and more persuasive despite the unreasonable ending.There are many famous and talented actors and actresses that joined the series, which adds more colours for the whole series.A variety of cases, 1 case per episode - that makes it clear and easier to follow."
1185,Voice,"If you can ignore the stupidity of the police, bad writing and plot holes, AND you have a very low IQ, you will enjoy this.I don't know why Koreans can't write a good procedural, but this one is the worst of the worst. It's so infuriatingly stupid, I almost smashed my TV.The lead female has a cute hearing but can't hear somebody sneaking up behind her, when we can. She can't fight or use a gun yet she's out in the field being mostly useless.Watch CSI."
1186,Voice,"I tried to ignore some of these things, but it's been 5 episodes and I can't help but cringe at them.1- Response of the emergency call centres. Their actions make no sense - calling back a victim, not being able to trace the phone, slow responses to activate a team to investigate, etc.2- MC's hearing is great, until someone walks loudly behind her - then suddenly she can't hear them at all3- Main detective's shooting is all over the place and does not make sense. He makes sure suspects are out of reach, then shoots at chest level to kill instead of incapacitate4- Dialogue doesn't make a lot of sense - eg. at one point they knew where the suspect and victim was, and was already on the way. Then they ""figured out"" the background between the suspect and the victim, and acted like it was a game-changer (it was not)I could go into more details, but this feels like reason enough not to watch.I'll still continue this series a little longer, and will come back and change this review if it gets better"
1187,Voice,Where to start? Has got to be one of the stupidest crime dramas I have seen. And I have seen a lot. The 911 center is hopeless. They can't make any decision and have to refer everything to the boss lady. How will they ever learn! Also explains why they never send response teams out in time.She's also quite irritating. She keeps asking stupid questions when cops are on the ground. Plus her magical hearing is just crazy. Shouldn't she be driven mad by incessant sound already? Perhaps that explains why she only has one perpetual look on her face.Police seem to be trained at the kindergarten level. Every thing is taken at face value. There seems to be no need to conduct an autopsy before determining cause of death. And that by the me too. Was he also trained in play school?The response teams also seem to be unable to do anything until they are told. I could go on and on but I only have this piece of advice if you are intending to watch it. If you have a brain and common sense avoid this show like the plague.
1188,Voice,"Tried to watch the whole thing but had to stop because the script is just too stupid.Spoiler:
Too much cliche talking when someone is about to be killed or about to die.Police takes ages to track down a phone by GPS but the stupid killer will just keep talking to the police until he/she gets caught.When the police found the victim who's about to die, the first thing he did was to let him speak on the phone rather than calling the ambulance.When the policewoman heard his dad getting killed, the only thing she did was to stand there and listen rather than trying to get someone to save him.Sorry this is too stupid."
1189,Voice,"The show isn't perfect but it's really entertaining. I think that's the main idea of every show.
Don't compare the show to CSI or anything like that, because this is different.
Season 1 has some really good episodes.
Don't focus on the details and just enjoy the show."

1226,Extracurricular,"This twisty thriller is quite engrossing - ended up binge watching in 2 days. Some of it seems quite clever - some of it too unrealistic. Is is plausbile there can be so much unchecked school violence and crime in South Korea? For those who want a change of pace from the usual romantic fantasy or comedy, this is a different K drama. Instead of love and emotion there is violence and prostitutioin. The characters are rather one dimensional. Kim Dong Hee plays the main character a high schooler who pimps secretly. He acts well enough and reminds a bit of the Parasite young actor Choi. Although there is some sympathy for the main character who is a student trying to make some money for college, the 2 female leads behave irritatingly. I didn't like Park Joo Hyun in A Piece of Your Mind but here she looks better as a student. The big fight scene in the 2nd last episode is quite hilarious. The cliff hanger ending could be frustrating especially if there is no definite announcement of season 2."
1227,Extracurricular,""" Extracurricular "" had an interesting story, but there were many flaws for this drama that lessen the enjoyment.Though the issues that extracurricular is dealing with are not the typical korean school drama presents, even though the angst, drama and having the character hit a low point is part of the korean drama repertoire, the drama did a good job with dealing with them, keeping the pace fast and the cinematography dark and moody. So, the idea was there and so were the elements to make a good psychological thriller, however, the drama didn't succeed in doing so.First of all, the characters, not all of them, but the main ones, were annoying. Actually, the leading lady was unlikable and not easy to root for, in a drama were you have to like the criminals. The main character was a bit too toned down, with the title of genius being only a tag that followed him, but in reality, or, at least as far as the drama showed us, he was just a boy with a good idea, but lonely and in a desperate situation. The characters overall were acting way too mature for their age and it was difficult to be believable.Second of all, the drama had its boring moments. The whole action thing got tiring to watch after it followed one twist after the other and the frustrating moments were too much. And yet, somehow, they managed to get the interest hit low beats towards the end. However, the ending was nicely managed. The performances, also, were brilliant from everyone in the cast, even though most of them are young actors.So, overall, six out of ten."
1228,Extracurricular,"And sick, but not in a good way. Any further letter would be a waste of time and energy."
1229,Extracurricular,Young poor student tries to pay his way through school with illegal activity. All is going well until he teams up with a rich girl and suddenly they find themselves contending with serious gangsters. Without disclosing it I will add I enjoyed the ending as it seems to have annoyed a lot of people. Overall an enjoyable series and at ten episodes well paced.
1230,Extracurricular,"Its good very good story and seems to have a lot to build on from both personalities, just two episodes in but nice change.Never seen the girl actress before she's good.
Finished it it was good until the ending which wasn't that bad, lets face it Korean series can have some foolish final episodes.
i would like to see a season 2 but I'm done with this cry baby pussy lead character wish someone would have capped his ass."
1231,Extracurricular,"The emotions of this show exists on various levels. The obvious teenage angst where what you show is to hide how you feel. That is if a teenage can workout what they really feeling.The premise is intriguing but the characters are more so, especially the main 2 leads. There is obvious chemistry and feelings they are hiding from each other.The story does rely on a few coincidence and accidents. But it also glance over alot of social concerns. How to make a living, bullying, class differences, family pressure, family problems, teenage prostitution.The most poignant relationship is got to be between the girl and the x solider. While the comic relief surprised goes to the mouthy mob boss.Episodes are well constructed, tense, lingering, thoughtful and just long enough. Korean shows are so unique and well crafted. And a tad .... fatalistic."
1232,Extracurricular,"Allowing fictional characters doing illegal/immoral things in a fictional story should not and cannot be rewarded for their actions and allowed to be happy, right? It is wrong to do that. It is politically wrong to do that. That is what this show I found out to be about.I am extremely upset. It does not deserve a second season because it would be more of the same: punishment of your favorite characters.I am so sick and so fed up with writers writing shows about protagonist characters that do something bad, I.e. Sell drugs (Breaking Bad) and prostitution (Extracurricular 2020), and giving these characters a politically correct outcome. I hope that I do not have to add Money Heist to this list, which is about robbing banks, a very illegal and immoral thing to do.Oh no, such terrible things cannot be rewarded so the protagonists must meet the worst possible outcome, right?I am extremely upset with the writers of this show.What is wrong with writing a FICTIONAL story about characters doing illegal things and actually letting them win and be happy? It is because of political correctness.Stop writing politically correct shows. I am so sick of it. It is a coward way of writing stories.Oh and by the way, the sad dramatic aspect of the show were good at first, but got old after awhile and ultimately was unnecessary and ineffective since it just became too depressing and ridiculous to watch.And another by the way, why could there not be even a nanogram of romance?If you want to feel extreme disappointment and regret, then watch this show.Pros: I watched this whole show in two days - it was that good. In my head i was thinking of giving it a 9/10. The premise was strong. The protagonists grew on me overtime. There was mystery, danger, thrill, success, failure, action, disappointment, depression, and much more. However, failure trumped all.Verdict: had there been a non-politically-correct outcome and even a microgram of romance, I would have given this show a 9/10; however, due to the writers going the other direction, I downgraded my rating from 9 to 6."
1233,Extracurricular,"This is the story of a group of classmates who do murder together. The story is innovative. The story has elements of horror and crime. The story is happening mostly in the school where the teenagers plan the murder. The murder scenes are very simple without that much resistance from the victims. In my opinion, those scenes could be more complicated. I liked the background music in the movie. I liked the ending. In summary, I recommend this movie to horror and thriller fans."
1234,Extracurricular,First impression was quite positive but then it kinda bored me in the second half.
1235,Extracurricular,"Jisoo is a model school student who does well in his studies and is also well behaved, but he has a dark side that nobody knows. Chaos starts arising in his life when another student Gyuri becomes interested in him.Well first of all the bgm was so good as if it was the soul of this drama. It is very interesting to watch as the concept is quite new but I didn't like the ending that much. It is quite ok to watch, but if you want a clear distinction between good and bad, then this is not a drama for you."

1237,Extracurricular,"#Extracurricular
Rating - 8.1/10
Review -
This is such a good story about the struggle of teenagers, but i think this is more realistic as this is a story of a young adults. Teenagers are wild.
With a lot of swearing, violence, adult themes and references to things like sex trafficking of minors, it won't be for everybody.
It's one of those dramas that leave you with tons of questions right at the end.
#Netflix"
1238,Extracurricular,"I am a guy 29ys old but I've watched a lot of American series till I get tired of it...since the silly end of game of thrones..but I really want to change faces and language of English and see something different , what I found is that Korean series and these las two years they have a lot of great series , and this one was top and great in everything's I don't know what last time I did care about character but this show I really screamed ,cried,laughed in any charactes and decision he make .
This is just amazing Netflix renewed for many garbage series but still waiting news from this and (Alice in borderland / sweet home)Thank u Korean team for this epic journey.My next watch is :
Flowers of evil
Stranger
Uncanny counters"
1239,Extracurricular,"I didn't watch it diligently the first time around. But once I watched if again, I realized just how good it is! As every Kim Jin Min drama,it is full of blood,gangs,great action sequences and more blood. The story was good enough and kept me on the edge.A second season is definitely warranted."
1240,Extracurricular,"Hmm, so what's going on ? is K-Drama finally growing up & joining the Noughties ?
I've noticed a series with two gay male leads, some shows are now 12 hours ( this one is less than 10 ) instead of the 16 which was the norm, & the massive success of ""Parasite"" may have initiated a new movement : a Korean ""BleakWave"" perhaps ?
This remarkable, well-named series reminded me a lot of the Oscar-winner in its tone. That large gap between the rich & the rest seems a huge problem & it permeates Korean society at all levels. And it obviously generates enormous stress/anxiety for the have-nots who strive even just to stay afloat in an extremely competitive, dog-eat-dog environment.
A high school is the setting, & watch out if you don't fit in for whatever reason because the bullies will sniff you out as predators do ( in fact, one of them boasts of having hounded a weaker boy to suicide ). Jisoo ( Kim Dong Hee ) is a top student but very poor, so he hits on a lucrative scheme involving young women & ""compensated dates"" in order to fund his tertiary education ( and Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business"" would get eaten alive here ). Crossing his path to telling effect are Gyuri ( Park Joo Hyun ), a savvy girl in his class whose parents are loaded, and the class bully ( Nam Yoon Soo ), who doles out violence along with his arrogant crew.
What stands out here is a script which really keeps you wondering what the two leads are going to do next. Calamities & unexpected events affect Jisoo's business in various ways, so how will he cope ? Most of the characters are complex, grey-area types, as in real life, so we quickly get invested in Jisoo's adventures. There's copious profanity & a fair bit of violence in the second half though it never seems gratuitous, while matters pertaining to the ""S"" word are as coy as the best romantic K-Drama. I also appreciated periodic bursts of black humour/fantasy to lighten the mood.
As I'd expect from Korea, the cast are top quality with KDH especially impressive. It's important that we at least identify with him despite his deeds, & his face convincingly conveys the pressures assailing him ( and an occasional grin is all the more affecting considering the ongoing situation ). Also good is PJH as the ostensibly cold-hearted Gyuri, Jung Da Bin is effective as the bully's pathetic girlfriend & NYS is comprehensively loathesome as her ""man"". Ugh.
And what of the director ? The relentless tension is nicely modulated so that we get quiet interludes amidst the mayhem while the generally dark colour scheme is often enhanced with interesting shot choices. On one occasion, a teacher asks Gyuri some questions; rather than the standard reverse to/fro close-ups as they converse, the camera wisely stays on her the whole time.
Complaints ? Just some minor ones : the home-room teacher could've had more personality and also the cops; the male one ( you've seen him in many shows ) might have a crush on the female cop, for example. As to the ending, it's ""good"" in terms of being an apt conclusion, yet I'd have used a different shot to conclude : I'd prefer to have the female cop confront the two people in that stairwell, then use a close-up of her face as she closes her eyes, then freeze-frame it.
Like ""Parasite"", a basically depressing story is galvanised with suspense, violence & sheer film-making talent into something you can't look away from."
1241,Extracurricular,"So here we go:
Main character is a wimp and has zero development throughout the series. Oh wait, none of the characters show any development.None of the characters show any sign of being able to reflect on their own behaviour. The main character gets flack for everything, despite no-one else being even a hair better.Dialogue consists of characters not finishing their sentences, and then walking out.Not one character is consistent in his or her actions!Plot twists hinge on dumb luck so many times, or instances where a character immediately does the required action.Editing is really poor with only ugly functional shots.It's just a mess, a big mess where it feels like the writers just kept writing and no-one told them to stop."
1242,Extracurricular,"Throughly enjoyable series that had me constantly pumped and didn't rely on cliffhangers alone for me to watch the next episode. I'm someone who doesn't enjoy films and series because I don't find them interesting but this was different. It was so well done, I'm afraid if there is a 2nd season it wouldn't beat the first. I watched the series twice that's how good it was. I wish I could watch it again for the first time. I watched this show on a whim, and I'm so glad I watched it. It couldn't have been any better! Hands down the best drama on netflix. This is the only drama I managed to finish without skipping. (and I skip everything or leave it unfinished like money heist? That was boring as af! I couldn't finish episode 1. And ozark? Ya, couldn'the finish the first 10 mins. Idk ya I just don't enjoy dramas. But this was enjoyable.) Totally recommend it!"
1243,Extracurricular,Concept was goood but so many flaws... specially boring conversations.
1244,Extracurricular,"I'm reading some other reviews and people are calling it a masterpiece? The best k drama they've ever seen? Hardly. Must not have seen many.Sure there is a lot of story, plot, and action. But it's all negative. It's just a downward spiral of negative energy/action/plot with no breath of air to ease the unhappiness. All I got was more and more depressed with every episode. I kept WISHING for like one positive thing to happen to the main characters but it's just a constant negative spiral like I almost didn't finish the show cause it was so depressing.I'll give it a 6 for good acting and characters, but the plot was just exhausting I'm so glad it's over. There are MANY KDramas I'll watch over and over and trust me this will not be one of them."
1245,Extracurricular,"Saw this on Netflix in the US. Considering this K-Drama is about Highschool students I would say the subject matter is a little too adult and violent and unrealistic, but it was still captivating to watch. The main character played by Kim Dong-Hee, Jisoo, is a really nice studious nerd who is one of the smartest and a top student in the school. His main aspiration in life is to graduate and to live a normal life and to get a job that makes enough money to start his own family. His dream is driven by the fact that he is living completely on his own due to his loser parents who left him alone to fend for himself and also some of his choice not to be around his father as well. Somewhat street smart from his father's activities, he starts his own business in which he brokers ""security"" for compensated dates that he also sets up. He has his financial goal all figured out on how much he will need to pay his tuition, and to complete his dream, pay housing etc. It is only when he allows girls into his life at the prompting of a counselor because he had no friends that things start to take a turn for the worse. The business gets him in deeper than he ever expected. The ending of the show can be interpreted more than one way I think and am wondering if there was thoughts of a second season or not, or if my interpretation to the ending was was I was thinking. I would love to see a second season though."
1246,Extracurricular,I was sooo impressed by the actors. This series is worth so much more than the usual hollywood nonesense we're given. Bravo !
1247,Extracurricular,"Attention grappling. Sometimes a little unrealistic.
Just a warning here...this is a Netflix drama, so if you are the type to marathon then know what I mean.The main actress is new, am surprised to find her good at acting. Looking forward to her future projects."
1248,Extracurricular,"Storyline: Every episode are excellent. What you expect to happen, other circumstances happen. The main characters brilliantly play their role that we can feel their emotion.Binge on watching: Yes, one episode lead to another."
1249,Extracurricular,"Extracurricular is a korean drama that talks about minor persecution issues.
The idea of the story is brilliant, you would not find a 100% good man in this drama, all of them just being a true human.
There are lot of implicit messages, such as Oji's pet crab.
The ending left us with a lot of questions, so I'm hoping for season 2 ASAP!"
1250,Extracurricular,"Sometimes it seem when you've seen one high school romance dramedy, you've seen the all. This is the one that will break all clichés and banal formulas. Even the social phobic, nerdy lead is uniquely awesome. Be prepared to sit on the edge of your seat with each episode."
1251,Extracurricular,"Fave kdrama series so far. No dull moments, no filler scenes, unique and good story, great actors, and nice cinematography. It was my first time seeing Park Ju Hyun (Bae Gyuri) here, and I became a fan right away. Every episode is worth watching and will hook you from the very beginning until the end. The students here are criminals but it's easy to empathize with them. I'm looking forward to season 2..."
1252,Extracurricular,"I don't feel the lead man role, no development at all."
1253,Extracurricular,"You may think that there is a limitation of unreal, but this movie has brought it to another level just slight above idoitc. The story brings about how unbelievably dumb, or stubborn or even how unreal it can happen in real life. They just hard to create a story, but unfortunately all they did was create a real mess. Totally dumb movie."
1254,Extracurricular,"Just starting out with this series and the English subtitling is laced with swearing. Korea strikes me as a very correct society and I really wonder if young people would be so coarse in their language. Perhaps a Korean viewer who is familiar with the English subtitling might care to comment. I suspect, as with so much Netflix subtitling the only market they aim for is America and the subtitles unnecessarily ape the American teen patois. I'm not being censorious, but to hear it some much is a distortion and a distraction."
1255,Extracurricular,"The story is a special one to begin with, and seems attractive at least in the beginning. Director Kim Jin-min did well, as with ""My Name"", keeping the audience engaged with a team of good actors. However, the story doesn't make sense in too many ways. The ends do not justify the means, it feels like the writer has the end set in stone, and simply makes up ridiculous plots to fit the preset ending. Character development is also seriously lacking, little background on the lead or the supporting leads, why they do the things they do, much of which didn't make sense and often contradicting.I watched this drama thinking it would be like ""My Name"", but the story writing are worlds apart.Excellent performance by Park Ju-hyun, well deserved Baeksang ""Best New Actress"" award. She was also good in ""Mouse"" (supporting role), great potential in this young actress."
1256,Extracurricular,Enyoyed it a lot and skipped local (German) TV shows for these school kids with great ease
1257,Extracurricular,I don't know if it's something cultural but the characters seem unrealistic and act weird. The acting was kind of off too. I found it to be tough to get through.
1258,Extracurricular,"How is this rating in the 7's??? This series was freaking amazing. I stayed up all night binging it because I couldn't stop watching. The writers of this series are genius. The characters were so well written and the actors cast were perfect for their parts. I was so on edge watching this, it was amazing!!!"
1259,Extracurricular,"The series is very beautiful. The actor who played Ji Soo is awesome. You can feel everything that he feels inside the series. The story is great, but he is a bit flawed."
1260,Extracurricular,I absolutely loved this. Very Tense. Great action. Great chemistry between characters. Can't wait for season 2. Hopefully there will be one.
1261,Extracurricular,"I've watched it all in one day because everytime I finished an episode, I kept wanting more... it's very catchy! It's also interesting the way things turn out... I definitely recommend it"
1262,Extracurricular,"The movie described the human nature deeply and reminded audience of school days with friendships , pure love and impulse etc... although I thought it was a little spent due to open-ending, it still worth watching."
1263,Extracurricular,"Generally a pretty good show but I was disappointed by the ending. I don't think there was any need for a cliffhanger, nor is there any need for a season two. The show reached a its climax in episode nine and I was already exicted about an interesting (bad) ending that I would've found to be very fitting.Like it is now, it leaves you with an unfinished feeling behind and a bit of a bad taste. If there will be a season 2, I highly doubt it makes any sense or will be as good as the inital seasons, since everything was pretty much over.For christ sake, just let them either go to the police and be arrested or run away to Australia or whatever but make a decision and give the show an end. I hate tv-shows that are already made for the precule. Nothing is better than just a great show with 10 episodes and a great ending. Then it would've been 8-9/10."
1264,Extracurricular,"I have some issues with the story line , like everyone is bad? No credits for the good stuff he did through the entire series and what is the point of making them , save each other OVER and Over and fight all this time just to get them arrested in the end? It's just no point it seems to me he went from a bad life no family kid to > father steal his money> lose his business > get involved deeper for "" no gain "" no girl friend and get jail i mean seriously WHERE IS THE HOPE."
1265,Extracurricular,Until episode 6 it was exciting with new developments but afterwards it was meh. The main male character was just annoying as each episode goes by crying crying .. crying .. crying . The romance they try to create between the leading roles was dragged so much Its totally forgotable In the last episodes. It could have ended in episode 8 or maybe 9 with a good cliffhanger important for second season but it was exausting
1266,Extracurricular,"Once you get past the slightly confusing first episode, this turns out to be a really enjoyable show. morally questionable but hella entertaining"
1267,Extracurricular,"I was here to watch Min-so choi, but thanks to annoying characters i skipped most of the show. I wonder what is wrong Netflix? How it turns everything into 🤢 while they cast top stars."
1268,Extracurricular,"Buildup was good till episode 9 but main characters cannot think two steps ahead, especially Jisoo and it all turns bad in last episode, pretty lame ending left a sour taste, I would've given this show an 8 but that last episode and ending was terrible"
1269,Extracurricular,"I want to provide a little bit of background of how I score films/series that I've watched. For me there are three important factors that they should excel on: Acting, Script, Technicality. Script as being the highest followed by film technicalities and acting. This three are the main factors that revolve around my review for Extracurricular.I want to discuss first about its script and how it epitomized today's mental health issues. The message of the series is very clear, it is how youth nowadays are being put the test and into pressure from today's perfectionist society, and how these pressures resulted into rebellious actions. Jisoo, the main character, is just one of the victims of this society. At an early age he was already left by his parents to live on his own thus limiting his chances of graduating from school and limiting his living needs due to financial reasons. The pressure of providing for himself and getting a good job in the future are what make him create his own illegal business. This right here is a one action that a young person is bound to do when left alone with tremendous pressure. In comparison, Gyuri's character despite having a stable provision of needs from her parents, still experienced this pressure by having her future decided by her parents into becoming the CEO of their company. That pressure right there of becoming a perfect and mature woman for her parents took a toll of her mind thus becoming a self-determined, aggressive woman towards Jisoo. The opportunity of being someone without her parents' influence is what makes her so determine to be in business with Jisoo. You see there are just two actions that a young person can do against this perfectionist society, one is to survive it by doing whats neccessary even if it is illegal or by rebelling against it and veering away from what's expected from him/her. What I like about this is that both of the main leads encapsulate these decisions into their own personalities while the story move forward with consequences it brought to them. The series realistically made us, the audience, understand the struggles of the youth but also capture the consequences it can bring if they do these actions. There are no solutions given by this series, it just wanted to show the true horror that the youth can experience if they continue to be in this perfectionist society. This is a message for both the youth and the adults who are responsible of guiding them. All in all, the message was perfectly delivered but in terms of the progression of the story and characters it kinda falls flat during the latter episodes as they were so focused on showcasing the struggles of the characters leaving an opportunity to showcase the effect of these into their personalities and character development.As for the acting, hands down to all of the actors who portrayed their characters so well. Kim Dong Hee is a rising star in the making and can be the actor that can ignite a different genre of kdrama. Park Ju Hyun on the other hand is a versatile actress as she made you want to kill her in the first few episodes but ended up loving her because of her charisma and angst that she brings into the character. I feel like the second leads could have been better but for me this is not the actors' fault but rather on the script's side. I hope that they can provide a good character devlopemen for these characters if they decided to do a second season.The series itself is a beautiul art that mastered the techniques of filmmaking. The angles and frames are perfect for the mood that they want to establish in the scene. The hallway fights and rooftop brawl in the penultimate episode was a perfect shot brought out from a camera, kinda reminds me of Oldboy and The Raid Redemption. The series had well-balanced shots as it also bring that lovely romantic vibe between the leads in a non-cringey way. Netflix surely has provided another avenue for korean filmmakers to expand and hone their craft away from the norm.All in all, this series is not your typical romantic kdrama as it brought a different vibe and genre into it. It is very timely as it portrays the current mental health issue that the youth is mostly sufffering nowadays. A crime drama that has grounded motivation from the characters and a realistic portrayal of the comsequences from the characters' actions and motivations."

1271,Extracurricular,"I like thrillers, dramas, and creative flicks.If you like psychological series with unexpected twists and turns, watch this. It's like breaking bad intensity, and the best show I've seen since breaking bad.Also the english dub is actually good."
1272,Extracurricular,"I'm reading a lot of comments complaining about the lack of character development, but in my opinion it was a good protrayal of how high school kids act. They where reckless, stubborn and immature. It was really stressful to watch their reaction (or lack of) in certain scenes.
Nevertheless, what turned me off was both the main characters. The boy seemed to be some kind of mastermind but ended up being quite clumsy and dumb. As for the girl, she was really smart but her abusive behaviour and stubbornness gave me anxiety, I just wanted to stop her all the time...
All in all, good story, but was expecting more."
1273,Extracurricular,Nice drama each episode keeps interesting they will keep you till the end of each episode and those who are going to watch let me give you piece of advice tha first episode will not keep you entertained may be it will keep u from watching second episode so don't back up it will be interesting from second episode mark my word. and first episode u won't understand anything untill you watch next episode ...so go for it watch it
1274,Extracurricular,"This review is from the perspective of someone who is not a huge KDrama viewer.
Each episode has a great sense of drama and tension to it, along with some slick cinematography, editing and background music changing up the format each time. Really funny at times too.
However there are some flaws, an irritating side-cop character that never changes throughout the series and a few retcons here and there but overall a great watch and I really enjoyed it"
1275,Extracurricular,"Season was going good, but the ending was not upto mark. Not happy with the ending."
1276,Extracurricular,I can say that this series one of the best k drama netflix series
1277,Extracurricular,"The main male lead is so confusing. He seems to be in some first episode until the main girl really takes (like almost of them) all the role. Also theres so many confusing pointless action . To be honest, the main girl acted really well, which is approved by me. She is the reason i continue watching the episodes"
1278,Extracurricular,"This is an epic drama, the plot is very different from Korean dramas which usually smell romantic. Each episode raises and lowers the emotions of the audience, making the audience always decide to continue, continue, and continue.From this drama we can take the message, that everyone has a secret. And watch out for the quiet man, for he may be very dangerous.I'm actually interested in the character of Kwak Kitae, no matter how bad he is, he never hurts his girlfriend or women, he is also very loyal to Minhee :) .I really hope the love story of gyuri and oji exists, but unfortunately, I'm expecting too much :V. Ah, even though they almost kissed hahahaha.The ending didn't live up to expectations, however, I think we can speculate ourselves about what happened to oji and gyuri.Actually, this drama doesn't need a second season :V."
1279,Extracurricular,"Engaging characters, gripping plot line and good acting. A wonky ending but nothing show ruining. I really liked the subtlety in all of the characters' friendships/relationships."
1280,Extracurricular,"Twists, turns, unintended consequences, all spiralling out of control. Brilliant. We need a second season. I really feel for our protagonists!"
1281,Extracurricular,"Fantastic, every episode is full of entertainment!
The cinematography is brilliant it truly set the mood too!
The way the storyline plays iut gives such a great sense of realism."
1282,Extracurricular,"IT'S JUST PERFECT!!!one of best k-dramas, u never get boring, the principals characters deserves a lot more, they are ""just unlucky"""
1283,Extracurricular,"The impressive performances of the young cast, alone, is enough reason to watch this. Kim Dong Hee is amazing. Binge worthy."
1284,Extracurricular,"The show starts off very strong but slowly loses it touch. The main character who first seems like a problem solverand a borderline genius turns out to be close to a bumbling idiot. The show seems like it is going to be about a student who lives a double life as a student and a pimp, struggling to balance and excel at the two while only using his intelligence to solve problems in both aspects of his life as he not physically tough but slowly forgets about both aspects. The show is good at raising the steaks and introducing new challenges but is rarely good at solving these.The show Is a decent watch and will entertain you enough so that you'll want to finish it but it will not blow you away."
1285,Extracurricular,"This show surprised me. The protagonist repeatedly disappointed me with the choices he made, but I kept believing he could be redeemed, and could succeed. I was on his side the whole time, even though I knew it was wrong, and he was wrong. His relationship with the second lead, the young woman, was complex, confusing, and believable. Her choices were also surprising, going from selfishness and apparent psychopathy one minute, to genuinely caring in her actions the next.An hour or so less wouldn't have done any harm."
1286,Extracurricular,"Where do I begin...? Towards the end of the season I was literally YELLING at the screen! I had to pause this show so many times because I was just worried about what was going to happen next.If you like shows with twists and turns around every corner, THIS IS YOUR SHOW! Ignore the haters."
1287,Extracurricular,You should change it's name to Cowardness. Even in real life cowardness has limitation but writer have driven it to next level..
1288,Extracurricular,"Great story none less no more, enjoyed much. Worth of your time. Peace out"
1289,Extracurricular,"It's not perfect but I have fun time watching it, occasionally it's annoying but overall great exciting story and I want to see next season ;)"
1290,Extracurricular,This drama is sooo amazing you will not feel bore episode by episode it getting more interesting...i just loved this drama definitely worth watching 💯
1291,Extracurricular,The drama was good. each episode keep you wanting more and more. But i still sense some plot hole on the drama. they didn't explain much on who Mr. Lee and Bae Gyuri as a daughter. The ending is okay but it make me mad.
1292,Extracurricular,"Great performances by actors an actress..good story although to short (10 episodes) to build deeper background story into each characters.
Will wait for 2nd season."
1293,Extracurricular,"Finished it now and i must say it was very entertaining. I never felt bored in the first 6 episodes. 7-9 were not bad but the pacing could have been a little bit quicker. I know why people dont liked the ending but it was ok for me. Still, very good show. Even with only 10 Eps, i felt with the characters. Hope there will be a season 2."
1294,Extracurricular,All characters are stupid and annoying. There is no plot twist and so boring.
1295,Extracurricular,What can I say? Just really good. I think second season will be even better
1296,Extracurricular,First 7 episodes were good and ruined up later episodes
1297,Extracurricular,"Good plot
awesome acting
good character development
btw still cant distinguish one girl from another in the show lmao
Awesome writing."
1298,Extracurricular,"Watching this right after finishing Itaewon Class was like eating cold pizza after a wagyu beef steak. 45 minutes and 20 seconds, that's how long I lasted. Let me tell you, It's been a long-long time since a TV Show miffed me that bad. First - the atmosphere - there is this darkness and uneasiness that's shadowing every single effing scene, a constant depressing mood that just makes you uncomfortable to the point that you need to press the skip button. But what really got me fired up is this galling, almost pathological shy, continually crying, coward of a school kid character that is not just completely socially disjointed, but we're suppose to believe that this troubled protagonist was able to somehow set up, organize and run an illegal under-aged sex workers nest? WHO writes this? He's then soon bullied, blackmailed, humiliated, beaten up and betrayed by the first girl he, in spite of all his issues, manages to build a connection with. One of the worst, messed up first episodes ever. And there were still 10 minutes left."
1299,Extracurricular,"I'm so impressed by this series. It's unlike any K-drama or any episodic TV I've seen. At first it's bouyant, transgressive -- in regimented S. Korea high school, these kids get away with so much & do it in style. But as the episodes click by, the real gravity & sadness of things they do to & with each other emerge starkly. This is a fun with a real edge: kids playing at crime & getting badly hurt.There are memorable characters here. My favorites are the teen prostitute (Da-bin Jung) who at first seems trivial, then deepens into a vulnerable, wounded young woman (she acts w/eyes & face as well as any actor alive); and Mr. Lee, the enforcer (Min-su Choi) who combines menace with zen-like directness & an aura of personal mystery. The relationship/non-relationship of these 2 characters is a central mystery of the plot.I can't recommend this one highly enough."
1300,Extracurricular,"As someone of Korean descent who's watched K-dramas for many years, this is one of the worst ones I've seen. The only upside to watching this drama was it made me appreciate my parents more b/c there really are many deadbeat parents these days like Jisoo's father. Oh, and maybe seeing Choi Min-soo in a new role (he used to be one of Korea's leading heartthrobs back in the day). But that's it. There was wayyy too much cussing (the English subs actually don't include half of the cussing that goes on in the show--and many of the actual Korean cuss words are more vulgar than the English translations!--so imagine what it's like if you understand Korean and are trying to watch it). I know that many high school and college students in Korea cuss these days, but this show definitely goes overboard w/ unnecessary cussing (it was like Good Will Hunting on steroids). And the series makes it seem like the crimes that are depicted in the show are common in Korea, and while those sorts of things do happen, they are definitely nowhere near as common as what the drama would lead you to believe. Also, it's like the writer wanted to depict all Korean students as foul-mouthed troublemakers who spend all their time dating, having sex, playing sports and whiling away their time at a PC bang (internet cafe), which is definitely NOT the case for most high schoolers in Korea. The episodes weren't engrossing either, and the cussing was just too distracting for me--the whole story could've probably be summed up in just 3 or 4 episodes if you deleted all the cussing and unnecessary scenes. I get that Korean writers are encouraged and even pressured to come up with original, darker stories these days, but this one was poorly written and is a misleading portrayal of South Korea. I don't know why this series received so many positive reviews, but I'm sure most of them came from non-Koreans with little to no previous exposure to Korean culture or other K-dramas. Everyone has their own taste, so I won't stop you from watching it if you still want to, but just know that this drama is very different from 99% of K-dramas out there, the writing is bad (really bad if you understand Korean), there are a lot of plot holes and things that don't make any sense, and it paints an overly bleak and deceptive portrait of South Korean society."
1301,Extracurricular,3rd class story writer . so many plot hole ... nothing logical or understanding .
1302,Extracurricular,"These korean shows always hook me (romance shows aside). Seeing some familiar faces from other shows is enjoyable to see. Great acting as usual. I want to give it an 8, but it's just missing something I can't put my finger on. Something to make it rememberal or thought provoking.. Seems like these shows never have a second season. Anyways, the main guy is basically like mob psycho without psychic powers.. but with his own secret powers of sorts! I would love to see him in some sort of live action mob psycho show! He's got the vibe on lock down."
1303,Extracurricular,"I must start off by saying this drama had a very unique feel to it, very different from a typical k-drama, and don't be mistaken this is no rom-com! There where no cliché's and no fillers in this drama. Episode 1 made me think that this was gonna be set on only a high school, but this was not the case. Specialty of this drama was the taboo-breaking subjects. The drama felt very grounded and raw, as to concepts like sex, drugs, pressure, friendships, love. I found the plot quite original as well, which on paper would not sound realistic at all, but this drama made it work like a gem. As for the casting and acting, I loved the chemistry, and also the tension between the main characters. The main lead was outstanding, showing every bit of emotion as well as possible. I feel like there was a lot of dept into his personality, as to being a socially awkward person, an emotional wrack, but also having a really reactive and strong side to him. Overall I really enjoyed this drama, only downside is that its short :("
1304,Extracurricular,"After watching the first episode I was amazed by the potential of the series. It's an unusual narrative that just makes you crave for more. The incredible acting of the whole cast allows long one-shot scenes which were braided magnificently in this whole drama. It's similar to parasite in the sense that you witness a train wreck that you just can't look away from and in this case it even makes you cheer for it. The only downsides of this show would be the missing logic at some points and the unsatisfactory relationship (and unused potential) of some character development, especially with the behavior of the main protagonist. I won't get into detail to keep this spoiler free but I believe most of the negative reviews result from that issue. Nevertheless, this drama had me avid and I just had to know what happens next. So if you want to watch this make sure to plan some time for binging, because this mature drama is an absolute recommendation to watch even if it gets you really annoyed at some points. Hopefully there will be a second season to build up on the potential of the story (and to cure my curiosity)."
1305,Extracurricular,That is not that amazing actually first 5 episode was great but 5-10 episodes was bad but i wanna watch 2.season
1306,Extracurricular,"Recently been losing interest in kdramas but extracurricular brought back with shocking story, unexpected turns. You can see a lot of inspired shots from different crime films and dramas. Couldn't predict what was going to be next which was good. Maybe they overdid at some scenes trying really hard not to be predictable, ended up nearly difficult to believe."
1307,Extracurricular,"The drama is very very interesting I love it so much, Wish they will make season 2 and more soon. #FavBaeGyuri"
1308,Extracurricular,"The concept of the movie is very good and unique (like Korea webtoon), but the way of execution and the script is too confusing. The character's development goes downhill after the middle of the film, when the characters constantly make confused and stupid choices. The film's message brigs about a dark society makes the characters have to do everything to survive, but the things the characters make in the series are so stupid that I personally cannot understand and sympathize for them. The plot is not difficult to predict when most other Korean dramas have exploited. The only highlight of the movie is the acting of the two main actors. 5 star for the first half of the series. Too bad for such a potential plot."
1309,Extracurricular,"It covers heavy topic, but it's a fun drama even if you watch it lightly.
A popular TV Series comes to mind, but Extraccurricular has a completely different appeal.
The drama itself is also fantastic, but above all, It is blessing to know actor JuHyun Park, who played Bae Gyu-ri.
Thanks to her, I feel like a fan for the first time in my life.You can see her :
JuHyun Park's Instagram account : @charmgirl_1005"
1310,Extracurricular,If you want to see garbage movie and waste your life then this is the movie for you
1311,Extracurricular,Fantastic! Season 2...when?! I look forward to see it!
1312,Extracurricular,"The story is so dark and heavy. for some reason i felt so depressing and stressful bcz of cowardness and stubbornness of the actors ..
i've watched some dark movies before , but i think i don't enjoyed this movie"
1313,Extracurricular,"Normally I will get a TV series out of my head the moment the end credits roll in, but Extracurricular has been lingering in my mind for days now. With Korean dramas you don't need very complicated moral compass - you have the bad guys, the good guys, some bad guys going good or vice versa, but very rarely something in between. Not in Extracurricular. The characters are neither bad nor good. They are not immediately likeable, they swear, smoke, ride the subway, make you scratch your head with questions. Yes, not your regular Kdrama. Original screenplay, beautiful cinematography, great acting, especially Park Joo-Hyun in the role of Bae Gyuri. A TV series that is respecting its viewers, finally."
1314,Extracurricular,"The show starts off strong with a compelling premise that falls apart all too quickly with all the plot holes introduced in every single episode that follows. The characters behave erratically and often without reason, leading to a storyline that leaves you wondering how things ended up the way they did. From comical and lighthearted to somber and dark the show bounces back and forth in a cadence akin to that of a one legged man; in other words, there is no real flow to the show, it just likes to jump around as it sees fit without a care for the audience. Sometimes I wonder if a different writer wrote each episode in an attempt to screw over the writer for the previous episode. When it comes to the finale, it is a Game of Thrones level of botchery. It truly left me filled with regret for following through the whole series. I advise any future viewers to steer clear as the jarring plot holes will literally leave you screaming in mental agony."
1315,Extracurricular,"This is such a good story about the struggle of teenagers. It might not be the best drama if you are looking for a pure crime drama, but I think this is more realistic as this is a story about the young adults. Teenagers are wild, they don't know what to do, they make mistakes. This is what teenagers do. Big shout out to the actors and actresses, very strong acting from them. Enjoyed this from the start to the end"
1316,Extracurricular,"Overall, I recommend to watch this drama if you want to something that is not a typical kind of k-drama that you've seen. It gives a fresh look and shows the limitless possibilities in a k-drama where you won't be able to predict what will happen in it.The casts were awesome, they depicted the emotions and characters very well. This drama describes the consequences when teenagers decided on something that is irreversible. You will see how the teenagers will react where they have a quite an unstable emotion which gives them an uniqueness for each of the casts. It can give you some insights about adolescent nowadays as well.The plot has a great setup and developed very well in the first half. but I think it can be further developed especially in the second half of the season. The cinematography of this drama is also amazing. The visualization of the story is spot on. Furthermore, the intro and the theme song really gives an earworm to its viewers."
1317,Extracurricular,"This was a masterpiece. I loved the scenarios, directing, acting, and character development. I am sure Season 2 would reveal more on other characters. I really loved this show. It deprived my 2 nights' sleep but story wise Soooooooo refreshing."
1318,Extracurricular,"I watched this series a few weeks ago. As soon as I watched it, I was shocked. Because this experience that I experienced at this drama was the first I've ever seen before. The first reason that I shocked is the naked swearing. Actually, in K-drama, it's uncommon that characters use swear words. However, in this drama, even adolescents say the naked swearing. So, frankly speaking, I felt uncomfortable at first time, because I've ever seen kinds of that drama before. But, because of the brilliant acting of characters, the uncomfortable feeling was gone and I could be rapt in this drama. The second reason is that I couldn't cheer on the main characters. As I was watching, I wanted the revenge of Jisoo and Gyuree that can make me thrilling. But, honestly, because they are committing a serious crime in the story, if I support them, it seems that I advocate the crime of adolescents. Thus, I couldn't cheer on them too, and it was also impressive thing for me.
This drama is dealing with the problem of adolescent that we've been ignoring meantime. Actually, I'm also adolescent in Korea, but I didn't know that until before watching this drama. It makes me realize the reality. In addition, Unlike other common K-dramas which became off topic as they went on, the ending of this story was also clear. For these reasons, I love this drama and I really recommend this, and more especially if you are Korean."
1319,Extracurricular,This show is very different from other K-Drama/Shows. I cannot wait for season 2. I was so sad when I got to the last episode.
1320,Extracurricular,"I've never watched any 'K-Drama's before. This is my first one, and most likely my last since nothing will ever live up to this...Character development, sensational acting, great cinematography with unique angles at plot-decisive scenes. The plot is one-of-a-kind.All in all, a must watch. I'm hoping they get a Season 2."
1321,Extracurricular,"A really different Korean dramas from what i usually watch, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Hope they will make the season 2, I definitely will watch it. Ps kitae is definitely a FINEEEE MEN"
1322,Extracurricular,"This kdrsma is neatly perfect, from cast to storyline, everything is displayed in a nice manner
I loved how it's not any other cliche romantic drama. It aldo focuses on the dark sides of the teenage life. All the actors were incredibly talented. I'm eagerly waiting for season 2, it's a request 💕"
1323,Extracurricular,"My mistake to expect this to be in certain way, i hooked at ep 1 and then i see that the MC got fooled and played at ep 2 and stop watching. What a dumb character"
1324,Extracurricular,When I finished watching the ending of the movie I don't know if it will be the opening ending for the second season but I hope it will have a second part.
1325,Extracurricular,"Don't know about others but i really like the show, it doesn't get boring from the first episode till the end, also really impressed by the actor acting skill."
1326,Extracurricular,I honestly don't know why people like this. It's just trash and so boring.
1327,Extracurricular,"Bad movie, waste of time not worth to watch especially the episode 10. I don't know what wrong with the writer? The movie started with a nice pace but the ending sucks."
1328,Extracurricular,"Drama has quite unrealistic logic .male actor who pimps secretly can't be a dumb person who is in this line of work.female actor seems like over acting .storyline is very unrealistic and just to make the drama keep flowing it has some logic can't be digestive at many point ...ex. Male actor losses his phone and got to know after couple of hours ..even a normal persons checks on their phone couple of times in an hour ..again female actress suddenly stole the phone from male actor and that too she gets up early just to check on male actor after first meet ..even the DOGO app which is voice activated ,female actress makes it works just unlocking the phone ..
So people who are more into logic and realistic scenario ,they can avoid it or just for fun can watch it ..."
1329,Extracurricular,This is too good. I really want session 2. I really love this drama. Kim Dong hee is very talented. He is very good actor. This drama story is very different and likeable.My Rating 10/10💝💝💝💝💝
1330,Extracurricular,"I loved the bold directing, smooth camera angles, the characters and story were exciting and interesting. The acting was top notch and the chemistry of the main cast was a pleasure to watch. I can't recommend this show enough, you just have to see it if you love movies."
1331,Extracurricular,This is one of the best drama in Netflix. Just watch and feel the joy!!
1332,Extracurricular,"The one who enslaved by money, the one who mentally broken, the one who sell their own body, The one who do bully. The movie not focus in trying to make you feel good but to realize at some circumstances society could screwed them, the young people. So it makes sense everything always going downhill from the start, instead of mastermind protagonist or character development, they just give us more cowardice, endless conflict and more problematic solutions. Bad review come from people can't handle depressing feeling that comes with this movie."
1333,Extracurricular,"Are they good,are they bad..? Do they deserve all that is happening? Should we root for them ,or no? Even if they are neglected children should they ""play"" without consequences.,and last question do they know how to stop this madnes and would they be able/willing to do so,or this is a point with no return...?
All in all amazing show I realy liked it , young actors did an fantastic job,loved all 4 of them,they are definietly one of the main reasons for show to be this good.
Waiting for next season ..."
1334,Extracurricular,The story was captivating from episode 1. within 10 episodes the depth the characters develop is amazing.
1335,Extracurricular,What a drama and entertainment! Actors were great and story line amazing!
1336,Extracurricular,"Watching it makes you feel angry and helpless. The main theme was interesting at the beginning, then it gets to be a festival of deus ex machinas aimed at making the main characters suffer. Unbelievable choices of all characters, lack of character development, a big banner saying 'this is wrong and will be punished' while other wrongdoings are fine and we won't explore them too much. Even the school bully gets his moment of glory like if bullying made him a hero somehow.Girl character's acting is believable, main protagonist is either keeping a totally straight face with no feelings or crying helplessly. Partially not his fault - his story is just totally weak and unbelievable.And yes, as it's a Korean production, I was expecting a bad ending. But not badly written bad ending."
1337,Extracurricular,"The writing is okay, similar vibe with parasite but it's more teeny"
1338,Extracurricular,"The reviews on this drive me mad- 'the main girl was annoying, the main guy was a coward' YES. DUH. You aren't supposed to like them! They're a bunch of selfish, emotional teenagers. Fabulously written, nuanced, and compelling characters. Their flaws are damning, their motivations are complicated. Genuinely fabulous. The performances aren't anything to scoff at either, but the rest of the show could be an unmitigated dumpster fire and the writing would still be worth watching for. But it isn't.It's an intense, engrossing thriller that very quickly unravels, and does not stop unravelling. A bit hectic, but rarely loses focus.The series is at it's strongest when it takes the more aggressive, stylistic angle it seems to want to- humorous and dark, with some flashes of cinematographic (?) brilliance. The more traditional K-drama formula holds it back, and forces you through a lot of boring B-plot.The soundtrack is easily the weakest link. It's either absolutely perfect (the Warpaint, Kim Sawol tracks) or it sounds like cheap stock music.I've watched this through 4x now, and at one point Netflix changed the English subtitle translation (if you're watching dub idk how to help you) and it was awful. It's since changed back, so if you didn't care for it the first round, it might be better on rewatch."
1339,Extracurricular,"Is not really exciting what I expected, for Korea drama"
1340,Extracurricular,"Very stupid and coward main character, i thought its a good series in the beginning but in the end its very anticlimax, make me mad in the end of episode"
1341,Extracurricular,"I was waiting for MC to snap and pull a Walter White or some anime heroic. Instead, he snapped the other way and drooled all over my screen.
I guess that was to be expected though, as being raised the way MC had raised himself surely leaves you mentally broken even for most mundane of challenges.Nevertheless, kept me glued for two days and in the end I guess that's all that matters (when it comes to wasting your time in a quality fashion).In the end I just want to say that these Korean shows really are a breath of fresh air."
1342,Extracurricular,"This series is truly amazing, but the main reason I really like this series and spend it in one day is Gyuri. Park Joo-Hyun with her charming beauty but plays a very badass character perfectly!
I just hope that even if there is no Season 2, just provide certainty whether they are still alive or not. Because I can't sleep well thinking about it :(("

1460,Stranger,"The first season of this Korean drama opens with Prosecutor Hwang Shi Mok discovering the body of a murdered man. The case will see him working with policewoman Lieutenant Han Yeo Jin. They are very different characters; thanks to an operation when he was a teenager Shi Mok has reduced emotions. There is an early suspect but questions are soon raised about his guilt as evidence emerges suggesting the victim had been involved in corruption. The case draws attention to tensions between the police and the prosecution service.The second season opens with two students drowning at a beach where the closure notices had been taken down. Those who took the notices down are quickly apprehended but they have contacts in high places and are soon released; Shi Mok is on the case. Once again he finds himself working with Han Yeo Jin as both are seconded to a group examining the relative powers of the police and prosecution service. Both sides are keen to show the other in a poor light so look into wrong doing in the other service. Tensions further mount when a prosecutor disappears; evidence suggests kidnapping or worse.I really enjoyed this series. It doesn't waste time with needless exposition concerning the rivalry between police and prosecution; it treats the viewers as intelligent enough to pick it up as the story progresses. The cases in both seasons are interesting and the main characters are fun to watch. Cho Seung-woo does an outstanding job as Hwang Shi Mok but Bae Doona steals just about every scene she appears in, as she manages to produce laughs with the subtlest of gestures, without every becoming a comedy character. The rest of the cast are impressive too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
1461,Stranger,"The thickness of the plot and the fullness of the characters are impressive. In the plot, the murder case is the beginning, actually speaking of the secular, is the collusion between the government and the businessmen. Get rid of the sensation and love that make people drowsy, very refined. In characters, the main characters all have background, desire, motivation, and each action can make people feel reasonable. Dialogue, every sentence seems to have been deliberated, especially a few rival plays, dialogue makes people think deeply ah, kill the murderer in the middle of the night."
1462,Stranger,"Enjoyed this a lot Doona is a favorite of mine and the male actor was fantastic, i like the slow mythical pace of this and that it was a drama/thriller without the relationship issues, its very good which is why i gave it a 8, its not a 10 like some have rated it."
1463,Stranger,"I am still 1/2 an episode away from the ending of the show, yet I'm lamenting, savouring the demise of this very, very good show.No, the show is not perfect, but darn close. Here, I will neither lead off nor delve into what I see are the minor short comings but instead try to elaborate on the secret of this show's success.The story revolves around how a prosecutor unearths the details and convoluted dealings that is behind an initial murder of a shady character. One of the key element of the story is that this prosecutor has a unique physical (and thus related emotional) flaw. This flaw allows him to be almost devoid of emotions, but brilliant (almost to a fault) at deductive reasoning, theories correlation, and stone-cold, unrelenting, unapologetic, and unflinching resolve. This character flaw also provide the storyline with one of the most explosive yet unusual, non- action based climax (1 of 2 near the ending). For this, the audience is the scapegoat in soaking up all the tension in between. This character trait, I believe is absolutely necessary, to serve both the seriousness of the subject matter, and the 'burden' of the plot.This leads to another great component of the show and that is the overall tone. The constant pressure, mystery, event after event (constructed in great detail) that unfolds seemingly backs the 'good' guys into a tight corner. All this done in a serious, nonchalant, no extra fat, point to point, manner. While there is only just a small, right amount,of understated comic relief. This goes against most other formulaic Korean detective show of over the top funny characters.A third key of success is the balance of characters. The balance of the female lead oppose to the male lead. Officer Han is just as tough, physically and mentally, has a sense of justice that pairs along with a sense of doubt. This does not mean she is weaker in any sense, but instead more human. A fine touch is how she likes to sketch and scribbles with a pencil. Also must be noted is subtle variation of characters in both the prosecution and police staff. The writing provides its characters with varying level of moral, ethical, and conscientious standards. Some people change, some don't.Other elements that are not so common in K dramas. No clearly stated development of romantic relationships for the main leads. No prolong, repetition of pop-song heavy based, unnecessary flashbacks. No over sentimental gratuitous tug of the heart strings. No over stylized cinematography. No must see next episode ending to every episode. And there is no over the top, fantastic human feats, or earth shattering twist of the plot. Lastly, but to a lesser extend is the reduced dependence on dialogue. But instead through use the camera angles and movement, specific thoughts and facial expressions of the characters to move the storyline along. This is especially so in the first few episodes. That means some information are not from given through the exchange of dialogue, not a directly feeding of the plot line to the viewer, but instead implied or visually taken care of.And as the mystery slowly reveal itself, the audience is not taken for a ride but instead is going along for the ride, side by side with the task force. What a pleasure for us the audience to have this quality writing and what eyes for director and producer to trust the strength of this writing, too."
1464,Stranger,"There is nothing so beautiful as an intricate plot so deftly woven that it is literally a work of art. And there is nothing that compliments a masterful plot like deep and intelligent characters.""Stranger"" is one of the best series I've ever seen. And I've been watching shows for over 45 years. When I began Season 1, I was instantly hooked, and I found myself binge-watching the series.The story has so many plot twists and turns that I doubt that even the most savy viewer will be able to figure it all out. It centers around what seems to be, a fairly standard murder. Hwang Shi Mok is, what would be our equivalent of an assistand district attorney, knows the victim, and takes it upon himself to investigate.Shi Mok is like watching a master detective at work. He's like a Korean Sherlock Holmes. He is not only able to piece together events, but he does so in a way that makes you think of a master jigsaw puzzler who is able to put the 3000 pieces together within a short span of time. Shi Mok is smart, intelligent, and also calm and cool under fire. Why? Because he has a unique characteristic: he lacks empathy. Due to violent outbursts as a child, he had a surgical procedure done that literally prevents him from having such outbursts anymore. Therefore, to most of his colleagues and even strangers, he appears cold and aloof.Shi Mok's sole partner in his investigation is Lieutenant Han Yeo Jin (Bae Doona). Bae Doona quickly became one of my favorite Korean actresses. She also successfully brings us a very intelligent and driven detective who is as determined to get to the truth as Shi Mok is. Of course, she has trouble figuring out why Shi Mok comes across as such a quirky fellow, but she soon develops tremendous respect for him and his ability to speak his mind (which he always does!).It isn't often that I bring up the theme music for a show, but this one reminds me of Hans Zimmer's Batman score a bit! It's catchy, and it seems to sum up all of the excitement and intrigue that this series provides!The plot is expertly crafted and multi-layered. Much like an onion, once one layer is exposed, there is another. This forces Shi mok and Yeo Jin to wonder just how far and how deep the conspiracy goes.The British series ""Line of Duty"" is a show about police corruption. This show not only takes it much farther, but this story is far more taut and exciting! I cannot emphasize enough just how much credit the writers should be given. It's not easy to put something like this together. ""Stranger"" is nothing short of a being an absolute masterpiece! Master mystery writers like Agatha Christie would be proud!**I was so excited when Season 2 came out, and even more excited to find out that there is a Season 3 on its way!**"
1465,Stranger,"A deeply layered crime procedural in the K-drama style. Hwang Shi-mok is a brilliant but emotionally crippled prosecutor in the Western Seoul District. A gangster is murdered then the trail starts to lead to joy girls and higher ups, maybe his boss, co-workers, the cops, government officials? Everyone has a story or two and could be a suspect, slowly, too slowly but K-Drama right? the evidence is uncovered, corruption goes high. Some twists and turns, a cliffhager of sorts each episode; a lot of short convos in office settings, similar to the Joseon era costume dramas. Similar to the palace roman-a-clefs these stories need a schemer; full of furtive looks, quick excuses and plotting. Joon-hyeok Lee gets the thankless task here as Seo Dong-Jae; his character becomes more than wearisome by Ep 8, all ""drats foiled again"" facial tics. The rest are fine pros also, Seung-woo Cho as the lead has to play it straight, Doona Bae is a perky cop."
1466,Stranger,"Wow! This show was a wild ride from start to finish. Fantastic leads and a compelling, gripping story make this an amazing show for anyone who loves a good thriller and mystery."
1467,Stranger,"This season 1 is good, very nice storyline although some minor parts not logical to common sense. The directorship is better than average and the storyline is quite ok, not that tremendous and better than average only.
Overall, a good watch for Season 1.On Season 2, its rubbish especially the last 3 episodes which were nonsenses made totally illogical in common sense. The early episodes are still watchable but as longer you watch, the worse it became. I regretted watching Season 2, wasted my precious time on not watching better movies or dramas."
1468,Stranger,"Don't trust the reviews claiming it's ""fast-paced"". Yes, most of the scenes are, but some of the scenes are completely useless too (I love crime/mystery movies and tv shows as well as slow paced Asian movies). But what makes a good storytelling is that every scene counts and add a value to the story. Each episode is 1 hour long, it could have been 40 minutes with a brillant film making and film direction/storyboard. Also, the drama aspect is over present in a bad fashioned style to me.
Also, Netflix translations are... pretty basic and sometimes lead to think that the characters are a bit dumb...
All in all, it's a good TV show, but with too many stylish intent and overdoing the drama bit, guess it's the usual Korean way nowadays."
1469,Stranger,"The preamble explaining the detective's weirdness was rushed and banal. The interaction of the detective and the old lady was weird (cultural thing?) but, most of all, the music was awful. Frantic, manic music is always a cheap and unsuccessful way to try to make a scene ""dramatic"". There's no way I could watch a film with that sort of score. Even if I could read the subtitles before they disappeared!"
1470,Stranger,"Dialogues, backdrops, main character, the chemistry and acting by the shay and side charachter, music, humble approach leave you simply amazed-Every episode is nearly a 10 in itself."
1471,Stranger,"I liked this series. And I only seen the 1st season and I don't think I will be watching the 2nd season. It's not bad at all but it has too much drama for my taste. It has some good thrills and detective moments which I liked and kept me wanting to finish the season. However, it has too much drama I kinda felt like which wasn't needed for most parts of it. If they just focused on the thrill and mystery more it would've been better. If you are in to drama and mystery you will love this."
1472,Stranger,"I keep hearing that South Korea is the emerging giant in producing great TV series in a variety of formats: comedy, fantasy, spy-intrigue or (in this case) police-mystery. Mercifully, this one ends after 16 episodes - I say that, since, once you get hooked on these series, nothing else scheduled in your life happens. You are glued to the set as the mystery deepens and unfolds (I watched a 20-parter in 2016, and after 20.9 episodes, the good guy -- on his way with a ring to marry the girl he fell in love with in episode 3-- gets picked off by a sniper. Aaaauuuughhhh!. Meantime, my car was repossessed, and my wife ran off to join the circus. But, what great series!In this case, 'Stranger' (as named on Netflix) follows the trials of Prosecutors Huo-Jin (Bae Doona, who appears to be the Sandra Bulloch of Korean miniseries) and Huang (Jo Suang-Hoo) as they investigate a few murders and attempted murders of police accomplices and 'ladies-in-waiting' - and, eventually, a pretty young prosecutor, who seems to have a bit of a crush on Huang. Higher-ups seem to be behind the crimes, and the script certainly gives the impression that the Korean culture is dominated by title, authority and political favors on the part of elitists in the Police Force and business. Huang, though, is relentless and strictly business. He has a personality defect that causes a lack of empathy or emotion. So, he shares only what he needs to, and in as few words as possible. I haven't quite finished the series, but I don't expect to see him in a passionate affair with any of the available female characters. He has the charm & appeal of a pack of tin foil--a cross between Spock and Monk. He's smart, though and the higher-ups are terrified he will finally tumble onto their nefarious secrets.Music and sets are delightful, characters are rich and continually developed, and the cinematography is brilliant and imaginative. New twists unfold every episode, keeping you compelled to keep watching.. 9/10 - Enjoy!"
1473,Stranger,"This is the best Korean crime drama mystery series I've ever seen by a country mile. In fact, I'd say it's damn near perfect. The writing, directing, editing, acting, music...It's all on point, and it's exciting throughout the whole show. You won't want to miss this, unless you can't watch crime series with no action scenes in them."
1474,Stranger,"Followed the stellar reviews and gave this a try. Had high hopes, but it's just not very good. I realize all TV requires some suspension of disbelief, but the story here is not even close to believable, The acting is good, the main characters have OK chemistry, but the dialogue is often cliched and more often silly. As the episodes went by I realized nothing really happens, the characters don't evolve, the sights don't change, there's no real twists. Gets more and more dull as you go."
1475,Stranger,"STRANGER. (Forest of Secrets/Secret Forest/Bimileui Sup) This k-drama is definitely one of the best crime shows I've watched. It seamlessly blends the genres of Procedural Crime, Mystery, Thriller, and Drama perfectly. It was a highly addictive watch, an unforgettable experience.Let me first start by saying, the cast is simply fantastic, especially our two main leads, the apathetic and stoic Prosecutor, Hwang Si-mok (played by Cho Seung-woo) and the feisty, quirky Lieutenant Han Yeo-Jin (played by Bae Doona)-who both have one thing is common-the desire for justice and to purge their departments of corruption, no matter the cost. Since there begins to look like there is corruption everywhere, the two end up forming an unspoken alliance. Their on-screen chemistry is undeniable and interesting.While the entire cast and characters are great, even side characters and antagonists are interesting and relatable. My only complaint, and it is a pretty minor one, is that I often wished for more character backstory and depth, especially in side characters. However, I grew to love and care for many of the characters regardless, even without extensive character details and history. Not many series are able to pull that off.Cho Seung-woo (Prosecutor, Hwang Si-mok) brilliantly plays an apathetic character type, and somehow manages to give him so much depth, heart and expression, again almost all in subtext and subtlety. He really stands out among all the ""cold genius"" archetypes and by Season 2, has become one of my all time favorites. He is such an odd mixture of apathy, cunning, and bluntness all the while being polite, passive and quiet. While he is certainly brilliant it never seems that his work is ever easy for him. It is always difficult and challenging-he is just stubborn and driven enough to find the truth and seek justice.On the other hand, actress Bae Doona (Lieutenant Han Yeo-Jin) manages to portray an equally interesting character. She is quirky and eccentric, lively and outgoing, that you can't help but love her. Her strong and yet compassionate persona make her the perfect counterbalance to Hwang Si-mok. The two leads really propel the series along. They are almost complete opposites but for their shared sense of justice and duty, and together make a brilliant team.I think what I really loved about this series is the realistic character portrayals. No one felt or looked like a fashion icon or typical drama idol. They were all flawed and unique and make the series highly believable.This series storyline is incredibly complex and well thought out, with a very tight, intelligent plot. There's a lot of suspense. Often, I find a common issue with procedural crime shows, in that they tend to be slower paced and drag along. Not so with this series. The pacing is quick and sharp. Also, I love how it never tries to dumb things down. You really have to follow along with it, because it wastes no time trying spelling things out for viewers and there can be quite a bit of subtext going on. This all proves the great writing and direction. I highly recommend this series if you are looking for a fast paced crime thriller. A MUST SEE.[NOTE: This Review is for Season 1 & 2]STORY: 10/10

OVERALL RATING: 9.5."
1476,Stranger,"Complex, and requires patience. Especially because the episodes are each about 75 minutes (on average) - 30 minutes more than my ideal epidsode length for any series. The major flaw in this series - if it can be called that - is that such an unemotional, unresponsive person (as the protagonist) would never be tolerated by colleagues in any work setting; but, to be fair, most film entertainment (mystery or otherwise) requires some suspension of belief. Also, in reality, anybody totally devoid of emotion could barely function - and would lack the motivation to persist in solving such a deep mystery."
1477,Stranger,"The plot just keeps getting more and more complicated, and not sure who is the bud guy. Loved Doona Bae's hair in the first season where it was quite short side, and could be a little wild. Fit the character so well. Hair just looked like she was too involved in her job to put much effort into it, and it would never get in the way. Then she goes long in season 2. Cannot quite see that it fits as well. She now has to fuss with it every so often, and it is so long and heavy, and just seems so awkward and would get in the way, and that just seems to change the whole impression of the character changes when she has to fuss with her hair. Very irritating.One of the fascinating things about watching it is how different Korean culture is and how much giving respect is considered so important, must with the bow."
1478,Stranger,"What a boring and slow paced crime drama. Acting is OK, but the ever so dramatic sound score is getting really annoying around episode 3.
Also, loft's of talking, driving, talking.... And it really does not bring anything to the story. Also the main characters mental state does not seem to be important for the serie at all!?!I quit at episode 5. And I don't really care who the murder is. The story killed my interest."
1479,Stranger,"It is an overdramatised soap opera, where the boring pace is supposed to create tension (it does not). This Korean Sherlock wannabe is just simply annoying who is supposed to be extra-super brilliant but in reality things just are keep moving in a truly convenient way for him. I cannot even make it until the end of the 'masterpiece' season one, but after reading so many reviews hailing this extra budget soap opera, just felt the need to write. How on earth can you praise acting when all the characters show their true faces in their very first scenes? And the great plot, oh my... just so many dumb 'twists' that felt embarrassing to watch. I am probably just not open to such stories, but overdoing while oversimplifying does not make a serie drama. The directing is especially horrible for me. In case the serie is shorter by half, may have been a decent sow, but the writer and the director wanted to make it epic that so much it smells sweat. Expected so much more from this"
1480,Stranger,"Great plot, great acting from all actors! Not a single moment boring."
1481,Stranger,Good crime drama that requires paying attention to detail.
1482,Stranger,"The story is really exciting and thrilling. The action doesn't get boring or predictable at any time and the actors are really good. The ending is also well thought out. I can't say much more without giving spoilers so I'll stay here.
I totally recommend this series."
1483,Stranger,"From the first episode it was an absolute intense TV show from begin till the end.
The characters played greatly, but the main character is terrific.
Looking more than forward to the second season!"
1484,Stranger,"It chronicles the journey of a prosecutor without empathy and not much liked in his department along with an emotional female police officer in solving a murder case which involves taking on the corrupt system and their own corrupt departments.It is so well written that it makes us doubt every one at one point of time or other so much that i had doubts even about the lead actor-Hwang Shi Mok at few occasions . This, i think is the biggest plus point for any suspense series or movie. The background music completely suits and lifts the series at important junctions which again plays an important role in any thriller. Last few episodes makes you emotional as well despite at initial stages(episodes) it seemed that there wont be much emotional connect.This is my First Korean drama ,and though i had little difficulty in remembering names when i started but its so well paced with characters coming in at just perfect time that the characters and the story keep seeping in very well. Though as i said it makes us doubt almost every character but my gut feeling about 2 important events or happenings that take place in last few episodes was bang on . Suspense is actually good but what i liked the most is the flow of story and how events unfolds that keeps us hooked.Performance from everyone was really good and i mean everyone . My favorites are Hwang Shi-Mok(played by Seung-woo Cho) and Lee Chang-Joon (played by Jae-myung Yoo).I am neither a K drama addict nor TV series addict but more of a movie lover but still it kept me hooked . This was recommended by a good friend of mine and i would recommend it to anyone who loves watching stories that are riveting thrilling and sucks one in . Its a MUST WATCH TV series"
1485,Stranger,"Once again, a Studio Dragon production.Story line so fluent, catch you!Sooner than you think that's the end of this season.Fortunatly they're a 2º season."
1486,Stranger,"I have to confess that I am a k-drama addict, but that said, this is by far one of the best Korean TV dramas ever - surpassing not just the usual run of Asian dramas, but also most US TV dramas.This show is from a new writer, her first TV script. I think it will not her last. The main star for me is Bae Doona, who I first came across in ""Sense 8"". The show is absent many of the far too common k-drama tropes that make so many of them seem rather silly - like dozens of totally incompetent cops, the stupid sidekick that is supposed to be funny but seldom is, and several others. A very tightly written script with almost no ""WTF?"" moments."
1487,Stranger,"An unemotional prosecutor is trying to reveal a deep-rooted mystery, involving a murder, high-up prosecutors, big money, and everything in between. He's assisted by a sharp woman detective in this endeavour.
Great script with good twists, great acting (from most of the actors), good soundtrack... all-in-all an awesome series!"
1488,Stranger,"NO SPOILER REVIEWI have to say I've watched every popular tv show, movie and anime and none have impressed me except one or two exceptions, but even they were stretched out pointlessly just to make money. It seemed like the emphasis on writing was not there. The writing is just flat out lazy and the plot is too simple and repetitive. I had to find a good show but I didn't know where to look. I have looked at all kinds of shows but I just couldn't get behind a story driven to make the main characters win through plot armour.Then Netflix recommended me Bad Guys Vile City and that was the first time in my life where I had been genuinely excited by the plot and story. Characters, good or bad would act exactly how you would expect them to act, not being lead on by plot armour. The ambitions and goals of the characters were very apparent and they had a clear and concise reason for doing things. Each characters strengths and weaknesses were expressed in a very intricate way. However season one didn't quite hit me in the same way so I started looking for new shows.After watching the best show in my life, I started looking at Korean TV series to get something similar. This show that I found straight after watching that gave me the same impression as I got from Bad Guys Vile City. The characters are detailed and rich, the plot is complex and there is no emphasis on plot armour, instead the story just flows exactly the way you would think it would, making the series very immersive. Unlike Bad Guys Vile City, this has taken the approach of using evidence and information to compile a list of evidence to find a suspect, while in Bad Guys, brute force and fighting is used to catch a suspect that is known. Both have it's merits but I feel like the story in this show can feel a bit monotonous and drawn out sometimes, especially new evidence is not coming to help find the suspect. However it is made up by constantly keeping you guessing who the suspect is.The characters I also don't find very interesting in this show, like I did in Bad Guys Vile City, except for Si-Mok, who is the single best character I've ever seen(helped by the brilliant acting). The lack of emotion and sympathy really keeps the show going, and he investigates everyone fairly and sharply no matter who they are. It's hard to explain why I like this character so much, but it's the character that fits perfectly in a detective series like this. He does not get clouded by emotion or other people's emotion, he's just there with a clear goal in mind, to catch the suspect, and he does it without any drama.SPOILER REVIEWAlright now that I have listed all the positives, I have to say, this has not taken the top spot in my best tv show/movie/anime list and here's why. The scenes can seem very drawn out at times and you can't help but want it to move on. Some characters act very out of the ordinary, seemingly to list them as a suspect. For example, it still isn't explained why Prosecutor Seo ran after Ga-Young that exact night, what exactly was he trying to achieve? Then why he went through so much trouble to get to her phone and delete contact with her when it makes him look like the killer. Especially when Ga-Young was still alive and could easily reveal him, and then he goes to the hospital expecting him to not remember him?
 
Then you also find out that who you've been guessing is the killer all this time, is not in-fact the killer. But the reason you don't know the killers identity is not because you misjudged a character, but simply because you didn't know enough about the killer in the first place and then you realise that all the evidence you had got up to that point was completely useless. The only piece of evidence that found the killer, was the tattoo and that is the only piece of evidence that was needed so it felt like the entire ordeal of finding evidence was just a waste of time as it achieved nothing for this case. It felt like they were making it too obvious that someone that Si-mok was investigating, or someone connected, but just hiding it all this time, but no a killer was just there the entire time and all the evidence and motive just dropped in all at once so you never even had time to guess it was him. It also doesn't make sense why he didn't kill Ga-Young. Ok, maybe he didn't think she saw the tattoo but there was literally no reason to keep her alive. Maybe she did see some of his features or maybe she saw what clothes he was wearing or maybe she recognises where he kept her, and there may be forensic evidence there. In any case though, enjoyed the show and I look forward to seeing more like this."
1489,Stranger,Loved every episode and it is very well written. Looked forward to each episode. I do hope Netflix pick up the second season as I am waiting.
1490,Stranger,I really enjoyed this series. The characters brought it alive. This is something I am hoping gets a second season as I was left wanting more I need to know where he goes from now.
1491,Stranger,"The drama seemed promising at the beginning then it went too slow. I watched until eps 11 and skipped to the end to find out the murderer. And realised they really had weak plot.
Spoiler : if Mr Lee already had all the recording and proofs from the begining, then the murder is really unnecessary. He just need to send them to media. The result will be the same.
And with all the powerfull men involved , isn't too convinient to let Simok took control of the investigation just like that?
It is just not make sense. However all of the actors doing good jobs in delivering their roles"
1492,Stranger,"At first i watched it dan dislike it somehow. But later tried to watch it again dan found it a very good drama. I am happy to give it a try. The casts are amazing, the story is interesting and believable with strong plot. I watched season 2 and love it again. This is a must watch drama."
1493,Stranger,"I tried to get into it...I really did. Interesting concept and dynamic between the characters, but somehow it still fell short. Maybe it's my lack of understanding of the culture and relationships between police and the legal entities, but it seemed a little odd and contrived.
I can't say it was horrible, as it wasn't, but it got a 7 from me mainly due to the fact that it seemed REALLY dragged out.One thing I did notice...is that 100% of the cars in Seoul are Hyundai's! I mean it's uncanny. Try to find one car in this show that isn't. Haha"
1494,Stranger,"I liked the cast very much. The acting was superb! The way it was shot was awesome. This is a mature Drama. Not much comedic relief at all. The dialogue are plentiful but decently well-written. The thing I didn't like was the pacing. The actual story if done in 10 episodes would have made this a smash hit in my opinion. But other than for the first 7-8 episodes and the last 2 episodes, the investigation part and a bunch of unnecessary and rather boring meetings between characters that don't immediately impact the story make some episode super drawn out and boring. I had to skip through a couple minutes here and there in episodes 10-13 just to speed it up. If you don't have patience or want something exciting to happen constantly like in the drama Vagabond this isn't it. Its a slow paced but well taken drama. There isn't much suspense either and not much action at all except for the chase scene at the very end at the airport. Also the investigation proceeds and comes to end because of a random event rather than due to logical deduction. Eun-Soo literally seed the tatoo because juice falls on the guys back. I would have liked it to be more logical than that. Otherwise I can recommend this drama if your into these type of genre or if you've watch other better dramas and want to try something new out. Hope this helps!"
1495,Stranger,"Don't ask me about season 2. I was a bit sceptical as to how they will match the mastery of season 1. There are too few main cast in season 2 with scenes full of filler conversations between them
I cannot bear to even watch beyond episode 6. What a letdown. No suspense. No tension. Just time pass."
1496,Stranger,"After watching Parasite, i had this thing to watch a Korean Tv series and guess what. I'm hooked to this one. It is really amazing, fan of breaking bad, the wire, better call saul, Mindhunter, True directives and many more like that will be hooked to this. Trust it's hidden gem on internet. The cinematography, acting, screenplay everything is amazing. I'm really happy that I'm getting to know Korean culture little little from this movie and series."
1497,Stranger,"Season 1I can count on the fingers of my one hand the series that I could consider at par or better than this. On every count it is an absolute winner. I have always believed that a true thriller is more cerebral than physical. The action happens by way of intellectual warfare than actual gunfights and muscled maniacs showing us all kind of choreographed war dances. This series is absolutely such a production, but make no mistake it neither lags nor allows your attention to waiver. Towards the end narrative could have been tighter and it could have gone in another direction. But perhaps that just comes down to personal preferences and cultural perspectives. All in all a highly recommended thriller and hands - down a shoo - in to my personal all time favourites. Kudos to the production team as well as the actors.Excellent!Season 2I have kept my review of Season 1 as is. As far as season 2 is concerned, it does not possess the intensity, the menace (yes there was nuanced menace underlying the first season that gave it such intensity), and the powerhouse performances from the supporting cast. Season 2 is slow burn and meanders a bit during the middle. But it is still good and I enjoyed it. If you compare second season to the first season it does not hold candle to it. But as a standalone it is an enjoyable watch. It has meaningful suspense, it has character development, good performances and a plot with some merit. It lacks in direction. I felt the director sat on the wall about what kind of series he wanted. He got confused and he passed on that confusion to the viewers. This gives the second season periods when we are confused WTH is the season going. Production was as usual top - notch.Good enough. Hope third season would be better!Season 1 - Rating 9 Season 2 - Rating 6"
1498,Stranger,"This is one of the best none romance kdramas.
The cast are amaaaazing I'm literally obsessed.
I think it shows completely how dark the real world is.
I liked the first season more but overall it's a fantastic drama."
1499,Stranger,The first season was great. The second season is boring and meaningless.
1500,Stranger,"I gave this a chance after seeing the rating and because Doona Bae was the best part of Sense8. It is entertaining, at least in part, due to the insight into Korean culture and deference to authority as seen in the interactions between ranks and in particular the news conferences which would have the presenter laughed off the podium in most western countries.The BIG problem with this series is the subtitling - Sometimes you have just microseconds to read before it's gone."
1501,Stranger,"I'm sure I drive others crazy by always mentioning how great Korean films are. They are at the top of their game right now pushing out quality content with themes that translate across the board. But I can't stop watching them and this one has everything: Great writing, cast, acting, music. I was enthralled and had to binge watch it while eating kimchi and now will watch Season 1 again. That is how good this is. This is a Netflix original, if they get a high volume of viewers, this series could keep going for many seasons more. X fingers."
1502,Stranger,"Season 1 review. This show has virtually zero action scenes. No romance. So don't come looking for it, it's not here. 16 episodes of non stop talking. Good. That's all it needed to be fantastic. Absolutely solid writing and pacing."
1503,Stranger,"Awesome drama. Awesome actors. Great story. I am yet to watch season 2, but season 1 was good enough. Really loved the S. Korean culture that looked extremely respectable and considerate."
1504,Stranger,"The two main characters have powerful strengths to overcome each other's weakness in very humane way, close to reality. Great actors. The plot is great to keep us watching. The ending lose the power to an easy conclusion. I waited for a big conspiracy disclosure, unfortunately that's all. 8/10 for Season 1.Update: 10/10 for S2."
1505,Stranger,"So just saw S2E216 and what can I say...the suspense was until the end and the supporting cast once again came toe-to-toe with the leads. Rarely can a show master that and still let you know who the leads are. I am really left speechless bc it managed to conjure humors, hubris, mystery, unrequited love (well we shall see), loyalty, and just so many other things. But the true beauty of this show is that EACH episode is packed nicely. Everything seen and heard is necessary so you do t get bogged down with 'the meaningless'. Please make a season 3 and 4 ...have to pause couple times to catch the names bc it's in Korean and subtitles swing by a bit fast (Netflix) but what a show. Love the leads and supporting cast is as superb. Not as contrived as Scandinavian mysteries or brutal just a good series to watch..."
1506,Stranger,"Fundamentally a legal thriller driven by deductive reasoning style of investigation and well placed surprising plot twists with sporadic emotions.
The show starts off in a little convoluted manner where you find it difficult to establish the relationships between characters and their motives. But as it progresses the thrill of investigation keeps the viewer hooked in and demands your attention to decipher the aforementioned problem.It deals with backstabs and betrayals throughout the first half of the show so that you are unable to trust most of the characters. Then it settles down and moves towards revealing all the mysteries.Even though it has a social message in the end, it doesnt preach you but rather warns (this is especially relevant for the local South Korean audience) about the danger.The acting of the whole cast is top notch. It actually elevates the writing.
Music does its job creating the environment for a thriller.The drawback is that it remains subtle in its revelation of twists and answers to some questions throughout the show which may warrant a second time viewing and it probably will irk some of the viewers.
Discalaimer: If you are new to Korean dramas, there are some antics and reactions by the actors which may seem over the top and unnecessary but it is a cultural aspect and it should not be considered as a flaw."
1507,Stranger,This is the first time that I've seen a Korean tv-Serie which was a great and memorable crime drama.It's about a prosecutor and a policewoman who work together to bring the truth of those with wealth and power into the light.The script was well written. The cast is very good. The emotionless main character was performed by Cho Seung-Woo as a prosecutor who is a very talented actor. Doona Bae suits her role perfect as a policewomen.
1508,Stranger,"Corruption, greed, and ambitions that become more sinister and damaging as you move up the social/economical/political ladder and how everyone is affected by it one way or another. This is the basis of this amazing, well-crafted and complex show. The story that gradually unfolds and the message that is conveyed is told through a series of past and present events and a series of murders and the investigations that follow.It is very well-acted and intelligently written although it definitely requires some patient viewing (especially with the fast moving subtitles) as if putting together a large puzzle with many small pieces. You have to put all the pieces together to finally see the whole picture.I am really hoping for a second season as the ending seemed to imply but we have to wait and see. A must watch especially for the ones such as myself that love and follow international TV series especially in this genre."
1509,Stranger,"I just finished watching part 2 . This whole series was just fantastic. I so hope that they just keep making more . The actors & actresses are superb , the scripts are so well written , the directors & producers did a fantastic job . I rewatched the 1st season when season 2 came out on Netflix , & now I just finished the 2nd . I enjoyed it so much , & being someone who doesn't speak any asian languages at all it was a bit difficult for me to keep track of who was who when they were talking about someone I couldn't remember the face that went with the name ... lol ... sooo even so I getting ready to rewatch the whole 2 seasons again . lol It was just that great . I hope whomever is contemplating watching it , will . Please do a season 3 😊"
1510,Stranger,"The first season I recommend to everyone and anyone, it's amazing! Don't ever start by watching the second season, it's very boring, I stopped on the second episode of it and decided to skip through a bit the third and fourth, then finally gave up. It doesn't even feel like the same series, it's just too damn boring."
1511,Stranger,This is a good series but the english closed caption is shown at the speed of light and I'll sometimes need to rewind to see what was said. I like the charachters but their names can be difficult to remember so get your phone camera and takee pics of the characters and their names. When you get confused pause the show and get your pics out to see who is who. Is it Lee or She or Si or Soo ???
1512,Stranger,"Stranger it's a mystery, thriller, deeply crime series. The plot is compelling, it keeps you interested with numerous twists and turns, keeping you guessing until the end. Throughout the series you will stay intrigued with how each character develops, changing your mind throughout as to the truth of each character. Cho Seung-woo is outstanding in his role as Prosecutor Hwang Shi-mok, as is Bae Doona in her role as Officer Han Yeo Jin. The relationship between Shi-mok and Yeo Jin is believable, mature, and fascinating. The incredible supporting cast portraying characters are fascinating as each one is woven in the story taking it to a deeper level. As a series goes on until season two, the story is equally interesting. The characters remain compelling as does the plot. I hope we get a season three!"
1513,Stranger,"If you are searching for a perfect thriller drama with the best investigation plot, this drama is for you! An amazing drama with heavy messages and impactful morals!
The plot & acting were beyond my expectation! Too good!
While watching each episode, you will feel the thrill subconsciously. It will make you feel as if you are not only watching, YOU are a part of the drama and investigating too!
Totally recommended!"
1514,Stranger,This is a great tv show. If you like Korean drama then this will be a great one to watch .
1515,Stranger,"Just perfect. Acting, directing, script. Ignore bad reviews, this series is fantastic. I recommend this series as a must watch series, just like breaking bad, my mister (Korean series). I watched countless series in any languages, any genre, and this is one of the best series I ever watched."
1516,Stranger,"I am new to KDramas thanks to Netflix and am thrilled with the quality of (some) of them. I watched this because I was impressed with Seung-woo Cho in Life (Laipeau), where he (along with Lee Dong Wook and everyone else) was superb. I also know Doona Bae from Sense8. Its an excellent series, complex and gripping, and full of twists and turns which keep things interesting. The two leads work really well together, her warmth and humanity versus his aloofness. Brilliant characterisations and the same excellent acting I am beginning to see across many Kdramas ( in truth, the same actors too, as there seems to be a pool of actors reused across many series! - and why not, they are great). Nail-biting finish, which is an achievement after 16 long episodes. If you like serious intelligent crime series with good detective work and no silliness (which Kdramas tend towards), then this is for you. And theres lovely subtle humour too, stemming from the interaction between the two leads, who couldn't be more different."
1517,Stranger,"Really don't understand the stellar ratings. Korean detective series must be generally horrible to award this 10 stars out of 10.I've struggled all the way through season 1, barely being able to keep awake. At the end, it got a bit better, so I also started season 2. But I have given up on it after the first episode. For some reason the plot is about starting a huge murder and corruption investigation because one couple cut one of the hundreds of meters of rope with danger signs near a beach, where 2 drunk men were later found to have drowned after jumping into the sea with all their clothes on. Which is pretty strange as the drowned men must have driven past hundreds of meters of these ropes with danger signs before entering the beach. It was not sure where they entered, they could have easily slipt underneath the ropes. And for some reason the vandalists (the one's who cut some part of the rope) are now investigated for murder."
1518,Stranger,"The 1st season is excellent as a crime/political thriller. But 2nd season is boring so I had to stop watching it. However, 1st season remains highly recommended."
1519,Stranger,"The second series is about the rivalry and disputes between the police and prosecution services, continuing one theme from the first season. Always interesting and captivating.There is however a serious lack of compassion given to the kidnapped victim's family. I hope this isn't the state of Korean police services as there seems no protection from the media at all; I was as shocked by this as by anything else in the drama."
1520,Stranger,An entertaining Season 1 and Season 2 by great set of actors and a thrilling storyline. Full of surprise and delight for audiences looking for a political/ murder thrills with many mysteries inbuilt. Another bonus is the background score and timing of the same. Looking forward to Season 3 soon.
1521,Stranger,"Just finished this superb Korean drama in a three-day binge. There are many things to review to be fair, but I'll be brief...The overall story regards mass political and corporate corruption, cover-ups and backstabbing. However, the story opens with something less subtle: murder.But it is how this initial murder then spirals into a plethora of lies, greed and downright nastiness that is absorbing to watch. The plot is never still, but not rushed. The characters are always fleshed out, but most have something to hide. The cinematography is on point but seductive. And the music... wow, it is brilliant (even though parts of the main theme reminded me of The Da Vinci Code bizarrely).What we have here is not explosions and car chases. I found it to be character- and plot-driven brilliance with some fantastic acting. Enjoy the story, enjoy the twists, enjoy the red herrings. And enjoy the soju and noodles!9 out of 10. Highly recommended."
1522,Stranger,"A classic, epic, masterpiece.
Direction, Characterisation, Plot and the thrilling performances of race and every actor is out of this world. Best of the bestest, I have ever watched."
1523,Stranger,Please keep the same writers and director. There must be a continuation in the same high level. Netflix's best show.
1524,Stranger,"My family are viewers, not a reviewers. Here is our no-spoiler take of ""Bimilui Soop"" (Forest of Secrets):As viewers who enjoy the occasional k-drama, but not 'fans' of the genre, we understood Forest of Secrets had to survive in the ""k-drama"" market. Standard market treatment to avoid alienating the domestic viewer; the standard k-drama outro sting, 16-episode 'season' container, and a few 'over the top' cartoon characters are glaring examples. With that in mind we found the story treatment very good. There was about 3 episodes of eye-crossing back-and-forth shot in offices and 2 episodes of arcs with too much focus for our taste; maybe to make a 'season.' In total, there was around 2 total composite hours where the story felt like it was dragging. These were choices that might not have been made in this manner if a story of this caliber was told in the West, but again, might be market appropriate. Even the stereotypical cartoon characters were made interesting by the writers, actors and director. As a personal note: Koreans seem to communicate with less 'hand-holding,' making the translated captions a fast read. Something might be lost in the attempt to capture nuance in captions that only stay on the screen for 3~4 seconds.My family are tough raters and we still thought ""Bimilui Soop"" earned between a 7 and 8 for story and 6-7 for shooting. We loved the treatment at the end of the arc, interesting in how it diverted from the expected ending. We'll round up in consideration of rating inflation."
1525,Stranger,"Some of the best tv out there. The underlying reasons why people do things in this program puts other TV programs to shame. One of the best series ever made,"
1526,Stranger,"Subtle, complex, powerful, adaptive. This is the best tv show I have ever seen."
1527,Stranger,"The story and characters were absolutely amazing!!! Shi Mok Hwang and Yeo Jin Han have soon become among my favourite characters ever and I already miss them. I really hope there will be a follow up of their story. The series is a great chance to understand Korean culture and it can compete with the best series around the world. The whole plot and reconstruction is very realistic and all the cast is superb, all characters very detailed and true, it's one of the best series/movie I ever seen. It gives addiction! I look forward Shi Mok to come back to Seoul and to lieutenant Han!"
1528,Stranger,Just Amazing. I never seen this quality in american series. Corea do it again.
1529,Stranger,"It is not a secret, Korean cinema is on the rising for some years now and Netflix has been strugling to nourish my afterwork mind me a really good show. Gave it a try and paralized. This series impressed me even more during Season 2. The acting is good, scenario is outstanding. This Series has it all, hold through the beginning of Season 1 and try to get used to the pace of korean dialogs. A recommendation from my side."
1530,Stranger,"That serie is one of the top five this year. I reccomend you VOS. Enjoy and learn things about Korea. I can see there are a lot of good actors and actress, and also good histories to show all of us."
1531,Stranger,"I would have to say that I was amazed by this series. It gets under you skin from the very beginning. The story is great, slowly evolving into a into a real spiders nest. Acting is on the top level. Just finished Season 1 and it was fantastic and Im looking forward seeing Season 2 and hopefully it delivers the same excitement."
1532,Stranger,"First of all, I loved the background music - its gripping. It a very well written and executed how, with good story line and acting. You wont know anything until the very end, and keep doubting every character. Its a decently paced show, and you wont find one boring moment - amidst all revelations, blame games and well, causalities! Also gives you a sneakk peak into the power game in South Korea. Give it a try if you like suspense thrillers. You wont be disappointed!"
1533,Stranger,"A gratifying drama where a prosecutor finds the truth behind a possibly corrupt murder verdict.Stranger doesn't leave you with an episode to relax or breath. Just when you think you've figured out the truth, the show throws you something, a witness account, a video, and asks you how it fits into the murder. The case is ever evolving and leaves you doubtful until the final moments.The characters are alluringly corrupt and secretive. That's what the title suggests, everyone's basically a stranger. All the characters are intricate and leave you wanting to stay for their ride. Even some men who you love to hate aren't morally black or white, they can make you give your sympathy sometimes, maybe making a fool out of you. You'll just have to see."
1534,Stranger,Like to watch all the Korean Series. But all series are in very big files like above 20 GB. When it is coming in small files like less than 10 Gb then its easy to watch. Can any one upload all the Korean series in small files please?
1535,Stranger,"I have watched a few Korean movies (and am a huge fan of Korean cinema) but this was the first Kdrama for me. Originally started it because of Doona Bae but kept watching for the show itself.
It was gripping, tense, and kept me at the edge of my seat throughout.
Well developed characters, excellent music. The pace was fast but not too fast and not too slow either. Never a dull moment or an unnecessary scene. The plot unfolds bit by bit and kept me glued to the screen until the very end.
I definitely recommend watching it!"
1536,Stranger,"Love korean series. The acting is good, the plot interesting."
1537,Stranger,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this series, I have come to the conclusion that in reality the series is a giant ad in 16 episodes for Samsung's newest phones: You simply get a walk-through of all the killer features of the Samsung Edge family. The crime story simply sets the stage on which the ad takes place. Nothing more, nothing less. Still very enjoyable, though."
1538,Stranger,"I wonder how people say season 2 os boring.
They are just looking for momentary excitement and do not understand the meaning of suspension and the sublime cinema of people like Alfred Hitchcock.
A friend said why not just leave the work to the press. It's really funny! Doesn't it seem that they are people who control the media ???At the same time, they maintain their image with an alternative, and this story is about the same alternative people. Even if you make a revolution, the corrupt people of the past will still find their way to power. Let's take a closer look at Korean series."
1539,Stranger,"This amazing series doesn't allow you to look away from the screen, as every little detail means something. Almost every scene has some significance to the bigger picture which makes it an exceptional drama to watch."
1540,Stranger,"This show is a work of art, especially how the first season throws you into the mind of prosecutor Hwang Si-mok; The way the story unveils, how everything is connected, how you get easily swayed away from the true culprits and how everything starts to make sense all of a sudden, this show keeps blow after blow coming your way, the suspense and tension of the events nearly never stops. The show also reflects on the reality of the world, the duality of public servants and law employees, and how a good sense of justice eventually prevails. I truly hope the producers add more seasons to it, and take their time to keep making a masterpiece out of this show."
1541,Stranger,I really like the main character in this series. Very good acting. but for the second season in my opinion it's not as good as the first season
1542,Stranger,"I received a lot of recommendation from my friends to watch this drama but i still couldn't watch it. But when i start to watch this, in the first episode i can tell that this drama would be really good. I love the acting for every actor in this drama, especially Cho Seung Woo as Hwang Shi Mok Geomsa. You will not regret for watching this Kdrama"
1543,Stranger,Never thought that a Web Series can be so gripping without any Fight / Action Scenes. This is a must watch Thriller.
1544,Stranger,"This is simply the best moovie of this kind! Cast, scénario, music and most of all the flow of the action! There is not a moment ""de respiro"", it keeps you concentrated up to the last scene!40 out of 40."
1545,Stranger,"It's very very superb serious over all in all languages the plot and twist were the highlights of the series I loved very very much and it's engaged me more. Second season was lit more than the first one. Exceptional background score for the series, Instantly addicted to this. Awaiting for the season 3 eagerly. Overall worth watching and spending time on this."
1546,Stranger,This is the first Korean thriller series I have seen. Just finished watching first season. I am really happy that I decided to watch it. The actors did a really good job. The storytelling was fantastic. There are some times when you will see very long conversation. However they are not very boring. The series spent good amount of time building the story and the ending was satisfying too. I am definitely going to watch more korean thrillers.
1547,Stranger,"I can see how people might feel this is a solid 9 or even 10, but as I binge watched this I felt the story progressed too intense for my liking. And that's my only complaint, because the acting, camera and sound work is excellent!So many characters to like, and a unique plot and a sort of Dr. Brain character as the lead. A must watch for people enjoying police stories and don't have time to binge it all at once. Worth watching in smaller bites as each episode takes a while to digest."
1548,Stranger,"I think I have a pretty healthy detachment from the fiction I enjoy, but now that I've watched all 16 hours of ""Stranger,"" I'm experiencing separation depression! This tightly constructed drama was so much better than any of the usual American police procedurals, that I couldn't stop watching. Doona Bae's Lieutenant Han is a model of the wise woman professional in a career dominated by knuckleheaded males, but not so cliche since many of the male characters were portrayed as comfortable with her authority and respectful of her superior sleuthing. Seung-Woo Cho's junior prosecutor has a fascinating mental quirk that Cho plays with subtlety. You can't help but sympathize with him even when he's at his least empathetic. The unbelievable becomes believable as the motives and methods behind the crimes are revealed, and the overarching theme of pervasive corruption in democratic capitalist society is relatable to an American audience. It's going to be a while before I get over the end of this series, but there was a suggestion in episode 15 of Seung-Woo Cho's character getting a 10-month assignment in the USA, travelling from state to state. That's a series I really want to see, provided the writers of Stranger make the trip with him."
1549,Stranger,"Thank you ""Stranger"" writers for that last scene!The series started out slow, then got very confusing (probably because I'm reading subtitles), but not in a bad way. By then I was committed to the story and the characters and decided to let myself be confused. Both the main and supporting characters were well crafted, beautifully acted and directed. Oh, and that last scene? It made reading, pausing and rewinding to reread English subtitles, worth the trouble. I hope the way the writers finished the series guarantees a second season - at least. Bravo!"
1550,Stranger,He searches something in a dirty place but at home he slips directly into bed...
1551,Stranger,"....but one kiss, one hug... something for europeans!"
1552,Stranger,"The high reviews got me to try this and I am disappointed. The reviews seem to be all extremely high but it wasn't what I received, There's major lack of substance in the story. Towards mid point of the series, I started to not pay attention As the plot dragged. Sure the production value is good but I expected more to the plot"
1553,Stranger,"Everything about this was great: the acting, screenplay, writing.
Nothing has gripped me as much as this. There wasn't a single dull moment that made me feel bored. The show would always make you doubt every person. It would make you think, ""maybe it's this person instead of this person?"" Then you'd suddenly change your mind after a scene, becoming sceptical of everyone.Hwang Shi-Mok (Seung-woo Cho) was great. He executed his role amazingly.
As well as Han Yeo-Jin (Donna Bae).I feel that keeping romance away from this show was a good course of action. Romance can become annoying in shows, especially if it isn't the main focus. It ruins it all an all. (At least to me anyway)Conclusion:
Good lengthy drama to watch over the course of a couple weeks. Highly recommend to anyone who is new in the Korean drama crime show scene.
You're sure to have a jolly good time watching this."
1554,Stranger,"Wow. Atmosphere, setting, characters, OST and everything is unexpectedly at a high level. Nothing to add."
1555,Stranger,It's highlight of this drama that dead of the female prosecutors.
1556,Stranger,"I've been watching Korean dramas for about three years now and this is literally the best drama I've ever watched. The dialogue, cinematography, characters and etc were fantastic. The two main characters actually paired really well together and it didn't felt forced like what some shows does. They would have meaningful conversations and Si-Mok actions were realistic. Even though he doesn't really have the ability to feel emotions, he wasn't like super mean or problematic. He acted really smart and planned well ahead including the Lieutenant.There was little to no cliches and it's perfect to watch if you're tryna get into the whole K drama scene.One thing that was a little bit weird was the villain reveal. I thought it was reasonable but I expected someone else than the person that was right in front of you.And I know that their relationship is Plutonic but if they mention in the second season, they have some connections here or there, I wouldn't be mad.But still a great drama"
1557,Stranger,"I used to watch lots of crime thrillers. But I assure you this one by far one of the best I have seen. Most of the directors of crime thrillers will underestimate the viewers capacity and irritate us with their screenplay. The director of series didn't made that mistake. Till the very end, we could not able to guess the murderer or the motive behind it. Acting is outstanding. Hats off to the entire team for such brilliant production."
1558,Stranger,I don't speak Korean and the subtitles aren't that great but that doesn't matter.I was hooked during Season 1. The characters are interesting and intelligent. The people portrayed in the show are so realistic. I am learning some Korean and am learning a little bit about the culture. Seoul is certainly clean.....Except for the bad guys. They are really dirty. I am interested to know what the Koreans think about this show.
1559,Stranger,"They kept ignoring her and then killed her. She was so innocent. If it was any other character, I wouldn't mind. I am not gonna watch the 2nd season."
1560,Stranger,"Spectacular cinematography, brilliant acting, great original scenario - a Must-watch. Once you start watching it, you'll be literally 'hooked'! Every single episode is a real jewel!"
1561,Stranger,"I have never such an intense TV show ever, specially Korean. I really wish they come with a new season soon."
1562,Stranger,One of the best series I have ever seen - truly addictive!!!
1563,Stranger,"I have more than hope for all the best in the future for the writer of this drama! My favorite was Bae Doona, but that is a personal reference, all of the acting cast did splendidly, they delivered their roles magnificently and the script was majestic! I watch at least 3 k-dramas per month, and this is... one of the best, if not the best drama I've seen so far! I kept wondering throughout the series if the script was made by a Korean person, because it lacks all of the washed out clichés, the story is excellently thought through, characters are deep and the point itself explores the corruption, and the bad deeds done by very influential people who occupy high places within a country. Forest of Secrets set a new bar for dramas, and I really hope we'll get the chance to see something else from the author soon!"
1564,Stranger,"Its very rare that a Korean TV Drama would compel me to write a review in India .This one did. I will try to be brief in my reasons why.. (Kindly bear with me in my Korean names; all based on English translation)The Plot : Its really not out of the world. South Korea is under the grip of rampant political corruption. This one borrows from that and adds a murder mystery to solve. Add a few twists/ turns and you get a regular pot boiler.The Cast: The lead Simhok :Stoic , Brilliant Detective Han: Lively , emotional , Humane Chang Jun Lee: The guy who nods his head into your approval Chairman Lee of Hanjo group: The calculative villain Chang Jun Lee's wife: Almost your vamp. A lot of other characters which fill their positions wellStereotypes: All phones are Samsung , All cars Hyundai LG , Kia motors also exist !!Korean Life: Asian country like us. Mannerisms , gentle bowing , traditional practices , emotional outbursts blended with a much more adaptation of life in Seoul portrayed with lovely details. Detective Han's place over looked a bridge , brilliant cinematography. Neat , minimalist offices .Chemistry : The Main highlight of this series. The scenes between protagonist /Chang jun lee/ Chairman Lee are amazing. Special reference to scenes at funeral of Eyun so, Detective Han and son of Mr Park(murdered) , Detective Han and Mr Joon(The murderer) , Mr Joon at his confession ....Brilliant ! , Outstanding !!...The way the photo of Chang Jun Lee falls soon after his suicide. Cinematic Excellence.Background Score : The music director has created a heart wrenching score with underlying mystery theme. It is so Korean , yet so universal. The crescendo in most scenes as they climax is breathtakingly complemented to say the least.The Directors: Its always easy to make a story , however it takes a vision to make History. This series will easily go down as one of the best ever made , just because of the vision and Character portrayal.Loved this show. Hope to see something similar in future!!!P.S: Can you explain why Korean Won is devalued so much? and why Korean folks speak so little English :)"
1565,Stranger,"I was not familiar with Korean drama until I watched ""Stranger."" It quickly became my favorite foreign language series. The characters are complicated, intense and ""real."" The story has so many twists and turns that one never knows what to expect next. This is a high quality production that rivals any show for writing, acting and filmmaking. I highly recommend."
1566,Stranger,"Rarely do some creative content come that deliver a truly gratifying experience and I wouldn't be wrong to say that Stranger/Forest of Secrets is part of that consortium. Writing/Cinematography/Editing: These three form a fragile pyramid that some dramas aren't able to fully comprehend and implement but Stranger isn't like that. The composition of the above three is such that the story progresses seamlessly. The only thing abrupt would be your own heartbeat, ha ha. The screenplay pools you in, like a magnet, from the first episode itself, binding you inside its sly labyrinth of deft writing. Characters: aren't fictitious, and by that I mean the characters are portrayed in such a crude fashion wherein you wouldn't fully like or dislike either one, they are in a sense, truly human like and not far-fetched. They all have their faults and strengths, they're not necessarily bad or good. I'm not saying you won't form favorites, of course, we all love our protagonist Hwang Si-mog, he is someone who's so elemental, you can't forget him. Every actor has traveled so deep into their characters, watching their work unfold is really engaging. Personally, after first seeing Jo Seung-woo in Inside Men, I have grown such a liking to him, I can't explain. He's just brilliant.Music: the composition is such that it is subtle yet striking at the same time, complementing the arrangement of scenes in the drama in an aesthetically satisfying manner. The music sets the mood so perfectly, it really is pleasurable.I have never written reviews about a drama/film/song and whatnot before but upon completion of this Drama, I felt compelled to say a little, at least something about it. I want more and more people to appreciate what has been given to us in the form of this Drama. A political, psychological, legal thriller that is bound to be memorable. Needless to say, Stranger has now become my utmost favorite Korean-drama I have ever watched. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT HESITATE TO WATCH THIS. I wanted to write an essay on this but I guess I'll stick to a precis, I hope my words were enough to impel you to start watching this.Lastly, be prepared to question morals, motives, ethics and torment your brain contemplating what will get thrown at you in the next episode, brace for heart-wrenching, nerve-racking moments, because this drama will, most certainly, take you on a ride, you won't forget. Enjoy!My rating: 9.5 out of 10."
1567,Stranger,"It was my very first experience with a Korean title, I know not much about the country, about the language, about the people living there. Thus I kept googling all the time the amounts, to have a grasp about how much x million won is in euros, and I decided to learn some Korean. Beautiful language! I think the subtitling is not really to the point, but still, the acting takes everything with it, so it is really not hard to understand what is happening, what are the subtle details (which might be lost due to the subtitles).
All actors and all the events are excellent, the arc of the story is really well done. I hope further seasons will come, soon."
1568,Stranger,I could not stop thinking about it for a week after I've finished watching.
1569,Stranger,"This is mind blowing
details, character, art, beauty, background, scenes, thriller, coverup, bombshell you name it it has all. I can imagine as I have seen this happen live in my life and it so much so relates the fine line between truth and lies.God I wish we have more prosecutors like Si-mok that have the courage and audacity to see through the mere cover ups of our surrounding especially in peoples and places of higher authority.Cant wait to see the 3 series and what can be done righteously in this most darkened and unrighteous world we live in."
1570,Stranger,Perfect drama story and nice connection between the cases but sometimes you feel it's getting too slow and events are changing very slowly but still awesome and amazing series.
1571,Stranger,Started watching and couldnt stop watching. Great acting.
1572,Stranger,"The poster of this show caught my eye on Netflix as it had Doona Bae in it. Excellent story-telling techniques combined with the background score makes it a must-watch show, even if you do not understand the language (Netflix has excellent subtitles for this).The plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The only other show I've watched which is comparable to this one is Death Note, which was an anime."
1573,Stranger,"I'll start from the end : i dropped this show 2 episodes from the end. The series is well acted, looks polished, has a great soundtrack. Early on you think that it has substance, that it's going to spin a web of issues and then tie them up at the end. But the longer you watch, the more you realize that there is nothing here. This sorry excuse of a ""story"" is so vapid, usual, unimaginative. There's no surprises, no twists, no depth. If you watch a single episode of Columbo, you would get a similar plot complexity, however it would be resolved in 2 hours instead of 20. With what does Stranger fill the gap? Frankly i don't even remember. Most of the time my attention was taken to another activity because NOTHING HAPPENS. And then there is nothing else. Flat, unlovable two dimensional characters. No humor, no personal growth, no emotions, good or bad, barely any cute girls. Just your typical rich dudes doing misdeeds and your typical cops extremely slowly solving the case. Don't waste your time like I wasted mine."

1690,Signal,"The overall plot is very smooth, and there are not too many mother-in-law plots, especially not injected too much water into the emotional drama. Every case transitions are natural. Of course, the last few episodes are inevitably seditious. Fortunately, they can be saved at the end. The biggest groove is Men I. Close-up is basically to stare at and turn around and reason out. Taizhong No. 2"
1691,Signal,"Stellar cast, script, direction, and OST in a great series."
1692,Signal,"This emotionally rich drama chronicles the life of three individuals whose lives are intertwined. The screenplay which realistically beautiful,especially how the characters interact,allows a smooth flow for the narration. Lonely melancholic characters which are perfectly written and easily relatable is one of the aspects that upholds my emotional connection with the film. Sad to see that it is criminally underrated."
1693,Signal,"This series was much touted here at IMDB and I am here to add my endorsement. It is a nifty police drama with the sci-fi mix of time travel-well, not travel, per se, but characters exchanging vital info from present day to the past. Current events alter in real-time, based on changed incidents in the past. (If space-time continuum isn't your thing, try a different Korean series).However, there are other embellishments & twists in the unfolding action that make the episodes a unique offering. I want to discuss an unusual CULTURAL shift in the series: our team of detectives, flush from solving a cold case involving a pretty, stylish perpetrator, find themselves seconded to a new Cold Case unit. The thing is: they are disappointed. If they fail to get results, they fear being pushed out entirely. There is also the stigma of exposing errors or shortcomings of previous detective teams, a no-no in Oriental culture. By contrast, Westerners watch Cold Case documentary shows feeling that the old guys who dig for fresh results are heroes. So, you need to keep the difference in mind. Success is vital for these guys & the ability to pass info back to contemporary sleuths is key to their careers (although by episode 4, only the two leads are 'in' on the process.).Another attractive feature of the show: no foul language, skin, or sexual scenes (not up to Episode 4 anyway)--so, strictly PG. You need to read sub-titles (no English soundtrack)--so, PAY ATTENTION! Enjoy. Best 'crime-sci-fi' series yet!
10/10"
1694,Signal,"A newbie detective/profiler, Park Hae Young (Lee Je Hoon), finds a walkie talkie that is broadcasting through time from Hae Young's time of 2015 from 2000. Hae Young has been assigned to a cold case unit who is tasked with solving crimes where the trail of evidence has gone cold. It is more of a political move than any real attempt to solve the crimes in terms of the ""higher ups."" On the other end of the line is Lee Jae Han (Jo Jin Woong) who is able to get clues from Hae Young about crimes that ""occurred"" and change or prevent the events. Cha Soo Hyun (Kim Hye Soo) is a female dectective who leads the cold case team. She knows Jae Han well as she was once a rookie on his team.I liked this but what slightly ruined it for me was it ended very nebulously. Some like it when it ""leaves you to wonder"" - I am not one of them. I understand there MAY be a second season but without that being a certainty the ending just didn't do it for me. I liked all the characters, the suspense and cases, but the ending is what really determined how I felt about this overall. Many really liked this - it rates very high. A lot of folks rate this higher than Tunnel. I preferred Tunnel. That had similar intrigue and was based on some of the same real murder cases. However, that story for me was more logically flowing and the ending felt complete. Worth the watch but be aware the ending is not neatly tied up."
1695,Signal,"So far my biggest criticizem is that peaople speak in a somwhat faster rate then usual from what i've seen in korean series
obviously my korean isn't great and for the target audiance in korea i assume everything should be perfectly clear but i found it to be a bit annoying u know
so if korean isn't you'r strongest lenguage.... i woulden't say avoid this but focuse on getting good subtitles (u know some times the subs can be pretty bad and well... treat it as if you don't know the lenguage at all)(i mean it's not that fast but at times.... just a bit unsual compared to the many other korean series i've watched where the speach is usually much slower and easier to understand.... obviously i'm still trying to watch with subs becuse i can often miss a word or 2 but you get the point... when lazzily looking for subs they can often fall out of sync and so on....switch to english or korean mistakes in size/spelling and well u get the point)"
1696,Signal,"This is an exciting and fast paced thriller. Any loss of impetus caused by the plot contrivance setting up interweaving times lines is swiftly compensated for by the deft plotting and fine performances. The whole thing is propulsive, carrying you along willingly for the ride.I was going to award the series a 9, but found the final episode disappointing. Everything was left in the air, perhaps for a second series, but this was not the problem. It was the loss of pace as the characters resorted to lengthy exposition to tidy up plot loose ends. Still an 8 though, so don't let this reservation put you off!"
1697,Signal,"Excellent drama. Although for me it could have been cut by an episode or two. I just felt it dragged a little bit around episode 15. But it picked up around the time of what I will term The WAKE UP sequence. As for the acting, There are 3 performances which I considered excellent. But It wasn't the the three leads. It was two of the leads. Kim Hye Soo and Jo Jin Woong. Although I would give him the nod over her. The the third excellent performance is a cameo. But an important role. It's Son Hyun Joo who exudes menace. As for the the third lead Lee Je Hoon. Hmm. I'm not sure. He just seems to have the same expression on his face for most of the drama, kind of like sad and dazed. Also why did he not play the younger version of himself, as Kim Hye Soo did. Did the makers feel he hadn't got the range? I also appreciate that the drama doesn't forsake the humour element. Although by an large it's a serious drama, there are some very funny sequences. There are some moments i really enjoyed eg the finding of the picture sequence, the cooking sequence. But my favourite was a sequence where Kim Hye Soo gives a handkerchief to a victim of a Casanova type. But she has a present (can't remember what) for the guy she loves. I think it falls out of her pocket, and the look on her face as she checks to see that nobody has seen it is priceless."
1698,Signal,"Ransom is paid but the girls is still missing. after 15 yrs the case is to be classified by law. the boy i mentioned is a cop and he talks with the past 15 yrs ago. to a cop. he opens the case and a suspect is found.
the naive storytelling and weels of time make rhis show under average (?).
nothing memorable. the dialog is plain, without witts. it says what we see, so there s a confusion most tv shows do.
small tricks about revealing the culprit are easy and not believable.
not worth the time"
1699,Signal,"I really love korean movies, but this was my 1st korean series. I was blown away by the amazing story, the incredible acting and the pace that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish.
It has everything, love story, drama, thriller, comedy and even some sci fi element. I promise it's impossible not to love."
1700,Signal,"Yikes. The one plot device everyone raves about is the one thing that bored me silly with this: Present day detectives are communicating through time & space with a counterpart from their past. Oh Lord. I'm sure there's all sorts of metaphors & mysticism I'm missing here, but the bottom line is it just wasn't believable to me and I quickly lost interest.I dunno, if you enjoy the Marvel/DC world where characters have some kind of superhuman power that you & me will never have, then this contemporary Korean police series may be right up your alley. I was trying to compare this our with Law & Order SVU, but it's apples & oranges - Benson & her squad figure stuff out, in Signal Cha and her staff wait for the supernatural to tell the what to do."
1701,Signal,"SIGNAL (Sigeuneol) was such an interesting premise. I really enjoyed this crime series. I'm not sure how to best describe it though. It was such a unique experience. While it was a investigative crime drama series there were also definite amounts of science fiction or possibly even paranormal elements which makes it a very unusual watch for me. I really enjoyed that aspect however, especially blended with criminal investigation aspects. Although a strange mix of genres, it really worked here.I loved Lee Jehoon (as Park Hae-Young). At first I really didn't think I would like him but he ended up being phenomenal in this. He is far from being a stereotypical lead character. I love the emotional connection he gets with cases. Given his background it really endears viewers to him. I love Kim Hye-su (as Detective Cha Soon-hyeon) and Cho Jin-woong (as Detective Lee Jae-han). They are both great actors and their characters are really cool and likable.I also really enjoyed the two timelines. I think they did a great job portraying two different eras and overlapping story and cases. The concept is fascinating. Visually and aesthetically it was appealing and very original series. The acting was great, the story was great, the music was great, I loved the three main characters. Everything was really well done.The main reason I hesitate giving this 10 stars is for a few small reasons. Mainly because of the way it ended. Without giving away any spoilers I will only say the ending felt very open-ended, and hopefully it is open-ended intentionally for the purpose of sequel seasons. Until then, I hesitate in rating it too highly because it felt incomplete and needed so much more. Secondly, while I loved the three main characters so much, many of the other side characters felt a bit flat to me. I felt there could have been more depth and character building. Otherwise this show was so unique and worthwhile.While Signal is very intriguing and full of heart, it also has a very dark and dreary feeling, with a lot of very sad themes (i.e. murder, corruption, suicide, rape, etc.) and not a lot of happy moments to balance it. The overall mood of the show is very heavy. A lot of the story revolves around some very depressing, tragic themes and is quite hard to handle at times. Even still, this is one of my all time favorites.[EDIT: There are rumors there will be a season 2!]STORY: 10/10
CINEMATOGRAPHY: 10/10
ART/DESIGN/VISUALS: 10/10
MUSIC: 10/10
OVERALL RATING: 9/10"
1702,Signal,"The Good: much like the TV show Frequency, it uses the future contacting past concept that is always interesting,the use of lighting, kid actors and unpredictability elements are worth noting.The Bad: The first episode was so rushed and jammed packed that it lost all sense of suspense. Better if they spent the first episode setting up a cliffhanger in a whodunnit type scenario, but instead they packed almost the entire premise into the first episode. A couple moments in this show felt really fake due to overacting and overcompensation of drama, which was unnecessary -loud sob crying for example.The ugly: ok, ugly is an ugly word but I have to point out there are many moments where the show lacked in subtly. The golden element of what makes for a great story/TV/movie is don't be ""too on the nose', don't tell the audience how they need to feel and don't explain everything. I found myself losing interest as after watching a scene and the scene is then reiterated in dialogue in case you didn't understand what the visual was telling you.I am surprised at all the high ratings...has anyone ever seen Sopranos? or Breaking Bad? or Line of Duty? or Doctor Who? Those are a master piece in storytelling, visual and acting."
1703,Signal,"SPOILER: This was an insanely amazing show. From the plot, to the cinematography, to the characters, it was all top-notch. I was hooked and at the edge of my seat throughout all the episodes. The way they weaved the plots from past and present, and used the right amount of suspense to keep us wondering and speculating, were masterful. This is my top series of 2016! (along with Broadchurch, which I only watched in 2016 when it came out on Netflix lol)I'm glad it ended the way it did too - ambiguous and with the promise of more to come. Even if they don't have a series 2, it's perfect the way it is."
1704,Signal,"This is nothing similar to what we see from typical korean television. This is easily became my favorite TV show of all time. Everything is so well written and executed on point , no complaints in any department. Awesome direction and actors did phenomenal job. The the subtle supernatural element made the already amazing story even more better."
1705,Signal,The reviewers giving 9/10 ratings to this are suspicious to me. This police procedural has many plot holes and loose ends and implausible events. Mostly has rude characters yelling at each other and hitting each other and going into hysterics over small things. The character Cha is pretty but has zero personality. Might as well be a mannequin. No one seems to ever search for the body of the girl kidnapped in ep1 .
1706,Signal,"This seemed like a pretty good show, but the subtitles are so bad that whole conversations don't rate a single word. Impossible for the non-Korean to follow."
1707,Signal,"This is definitely a series I would recommend to anyone. The story is very well thought out and it has the perfect balance between investigation/action, drama and fiction. The end is a little vague but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall a thumbs up."
1708,Signal,"A unique spin to time travel. Solid drama with detectives solving crimes in two time periods. With each episode, you learn a little more why it is that those two detectives are the ones communicating through this magic walkie-talkie. When this series ended, I was left wanting so much more!"
1709,Signal,"Fantasy stories give the writers the chance to be creative and imaginative and to think outside the box....This story is different from other time travels or parallel universe stories...The many different murder cases made the series interesting and they incorporated all these cases in one story....There's not much thinking because each episode is very clear....just got confused a bit in the final episode... There are no beautiful faces or cute love stories in these show except crime, drama, mystery and a bit of crush......over-all the stars played their parts well and its recommended for KDrama fanatics for a change."
1710,Signal,"A really fast paced drama which i really like, with a really interesting plots that feels like a whole rollercoaster from start to finish. sometimes it can get confusing and also frustrating but still really well executed. it wasn't explained how the whole ""communication"" started so it remains a mystery. it also has an open ending but so im hoping for a season 2 even if it's very unlikely."
1711,Signal,"Couldn't finish the show beyond episode 8, and read the synopsis afterwards. I really wanted to like it, so I powered through some absolutely dull episodes, but it was just too slow. Biggest problem is the acting by the main character in the present. He is just a bad actor. Can't make more or less of it, it's painful to watch. The way he talks, the way he moves, it's cringe inducing. It's especially obvious when some of the other actors are putting in good performances.Ultimately the slow pacing and very obvious plot twists killed it for me. Can't sit through another 8 hours of the same."
1712,Signal,"Signal is another truly excellent TV series made in South Korea that I fully enjoyed watching.The acting of Lee Jehoon, Kim Hye-su and Cho Jin-woong is phenomenal which makes the scenes between the characters they play magical. The overall directing is magnificent regarding for instance letting us feel the emotions of the characters using excellent camera work and magically transforming an - at first sight - absurd almost not doable idea for filming into a wonder of cinematography and tackling the leaps in time in a totally credible and acceptable way. All the scenes are magnificently supported by well-chosen music.Every episode builds to make the series stronger and binds you as a viewer more and more to the roll out of the intertwined lives of Park Hae-yeong, Cha Soo-hyeon and Lee Jae-han. In short this is a gem of Korean film making and I strongly recommend you to see it. For myself I can't remember that I ever watched a series twice, but I'm sure I want to see this one again.There's action, suspense, drama, love, humour and more in Signal. The humour many a time is very subtle but can be extremely funny like for instance when Lee Jae-han is transported in an ambulance, accompanied by Cha Soo-hyeon and she starts crying her heart out in fear of his life and he doesn't know how to deal with that and asks the nurses ""What's gotten into her?""My apologies to the other cast members that I mention the main actors more, but let me emphasise that all the actors in this series and all the crew members did an extraordinarily good job in making this TV show and making my time watching it to quality time of my life. Everything falls into place in this show and the timing of acting, filming etc. Is perfect. Thank you all for a great achievement."
1713,Signal,"Perfect example of ""you can't fix stupid"" one ridiculous f up after another."
1714,Signal,It's a goddamn masterpiece. Just watch it and thank me later.
1715,Signal,The show is too boring and dead slow. Don't get carried away with fake hype.
1716,Signal,"This is no ordinary series. It demands your unwavering attention and significant exercise from your grey cells.There are multiple arcs and the underlying story is complex and multilayered. The director does excellent job in amalgamating it all into one beautiful seamless narrative. The actors are great with the exception of Lee Je - Hoon (who plays Park Have - Young), who at times seemed laboured. Cho Jin - Woong (who plays Lee Jae - Han) is exceptional, I don't believe I have seen anyone do better in a role. He is the soul of this series. The production values are really high.Yes, it is at times a slow burn and towards the end seems stretched. Liberties have been taken with logic but with a complex script perfection is exceptionally hard to attain.The shortcomings in the script are generally concealed by the director and skill of the actors.Excellent!"
1717,Signal,One of the best outstanding tv series perfect timeline for a perfect story
1718,Signal,"The story is sooo amazing.
If you like thriller and mystery dramas you should watch this.
It was a little slow for me but overall it's really good."
1719,Signal,"This is about as good as it gets. All of the main characters are extremely likable and the story is so thrilling and will get your heart racing at times. The three main characters are all explored at different times which gives us a chance to know them all. And the number one message of ""never giving up"" in the face of adversity, challenges and corruption left me in tears by the final episode. If you like drama's these days that are void of political agendas and just want a good, mysterious story - then this one is for you. I gave it 9 because I would have preferred a different ending ;) - but that is purely subjective. Almost flawless."
1720,Signal,"Great show. It's not flashy so the writing and the characters is the only thing that carries it through. Wonderful cast. Sometimes it's a bit exhausting though because practically everyone is lying episode to episode. I appreciate the gimmick of the shows isn't too abused throughout its run. Though it gets really messy at the end, as most time altering shows do, but I guess it's done in the hope of a second season 2 to fix things."
1721,Signal,"After a very long time I am penning down reviews for any series . Till date I have watched almost 1000+ movies & 50 + Series across all languages . Specifically Hollywood .I must say Korean Cinema is moving to next level at a very good speed.This series is so refreshing , innovative, and nicely crafted. Be it acting , screenplay , Direction , story all at it best . Great Job done by team of the 'Signal' . I would suggest everyone just give a try and from team come up with new Season with more spine chilling mystery and Innovation."
1722,Signal,"...One of the best Korean Series so far.Meticulous acting by everyone... Beautifully crafted ..Day by Day loving Korean Cinema .Only thing which requires to taken care off is in second season length of an one episode should be less then in season 1 & also it should have more suspense... No doubt Season 1 has all these things , just to be have more fun if they can add something extra .Its a must watch ...Once again , applause to the entire team of Stranger"
1723,Signal,"Started out really strong. In fact, up until episode 14, I'd give it an 8 or even a 9. Admirable performances by Lee Jae-hoon, Kim Hye-soo and Choo Jin-woong.But the last two episodes pulled my rating down.I get that this has a major fantasy element to it. But there were scenes that were outright impossible and illogical especially when they weren't supposed to be fantasy.Such as:
When Park Hae-young figured out where in the massive hospital Ahn Chi-soo was heading just by recalling background and ambient sounds he could hear at the other end of the line as he was talking to Chi-soo through his mobile phone.Or how Lee Jae-han figured out where Kim Bum-joo threw that red scarf - out of the many trash bins in the city - by pure deduction.These guys have got to have supernatural reasoning powers.The last two episodes were shockingly messy. For 14 episodes one can still follow the ""time travel"" sequence and logic. But on the 15th episode it felt like the writer could not figure out how to tie things together and decided to throw all sense of logic out the window. It was as if to tell the audience: ""Quit trying to make sense of the time because I'm taking all sense away from here on"".The last 15 minutes were a total, absolute, letdown. If it is meant to have a 2nd season, they could at least be more obvious. But to leave too many questions un-answered after 16 episodes was plain cruel."
1724,Signal,Really keeps you on your toes.. pay attention!Can be confusing at first until you catch the rythm of the time phasing..We love it because it doesnt go where you expect it to go..so refreshing from the usual humdrum detective mysteries..Really hope they get another season or two.. or more..
1725,Signal,"This is one of the most well thought/well executed TV-series i have ever watched and not just by k-drama standards. The premise is innovative, the characters and their relationships very well fleshed out and the suspense present from the very first to the very last scene.It just never gets boring and every episode matters. This is a story that seemingly begins in the year 2000 when a young Park Hae Young witnesses a girl getting kidnapped. The case remains unsolved as Park Hae Young's attempts to explain what really happened to the police are met with indifference.That in combination with a case very personal to Park Hae Young are enough to make him mistrust the police and the transparency of their procedures. He grows up to become a criminal profiler and one day he crosses paths with detective Cha Soo Hyun. Cha Soo Hyun has spent the last fifteen years looking for her missing partner Detective Lee Jae Han who was facing criminal charges for bribery/extortion. After 15 years of no trace we finally get a clue of what happened to Jae Han when through his old, non-functioning walkie talkie he communicates with an understandably confused Park Hae Young. Jae Han from the year 2000 reports that this will probably be his last transmission, that the past can still change and that Park Hae Young just has to convince Jae Han from 1989. And that is how a strange partnership who evolves into a caring and close friendship that transcends time begins. I cannot describe properly how much i love this show and the main characters who despite their tragic pasts never give up (which is the main teaching of the story) and continue to fight forward through a system of injustice so that other people will get to have what they themselves had been denied.All three of them were hardened by life but never lost their humanity and their ability to care. Their relationships also make me SO emotional. Especially the unusual friendship between Park Hae Young and Lee Jae Han who until the very end never meet properly and yet they grow to love each other so much.For me the most powerful and downright heartbreaking scene was when (MAJOR SPOILERS) they were both going (again seemingly) through their final moments and we had a flashback to their dialogue when each wished that the other would be happy. Ofc the romantic sl was also beautiful. Very subtle and yet so important. Cha Soo Hyun waiting/searching for the love of her life for 15 years to finally be the one who will motivate Jae Han to fight for his life. Like..kill me now, let them get married and adopt Park Hae Young...or sth. I just want them to be a family, okay? Also the evil guy!Kim Boo Joo. What an excellent casting choice for sb to play the DEVIL reincarnated (like for real, he's evil through and through). Every time i saw him on my screen, i was overwhelmed by the need to beat him to the death with a stick (the show did NOT disappoint me in that part either!). I think this review is getting somewhat incoherent but it's just because i love this so much, i have no words! So forgive me. And watch the show! Which def needs a season 2."
1726,Signal,Story about two detective from future and past connect with each other to solve the cases. It become more interesting as they can only talk at particular time. One of the cases show how Korean law is bit weak where the limit statue is 15 years. It is mind blowing how they able to tackle back the killer.If there is Lee Jae Hoon so I definitely recommended you guys to watch the drama.
1727,Signal,"I've seen better acting and directing in high school productions. The actors don't act, they emote. It's like watching an old silent film where everything is overacted horribly. The story-line itself had some promise, but it's poorly executed. Enter this pool at your own risk."
1728,Signal,Everything was so perfect for a TV series. From the beginning to the very end the story will hold your attention. Must watch drama..
1729,Signal,Everything was so perfect for a TV series. From the beginning to the very end the story will hold your attention. Must watch drama
1730,Signal,"What a great thriller Korean drama , it was the drama that would keep you on the edge of your seat .I liked the story and how there was past and present , the only thing that I didn't like was the cases ( they were great ) but i wanted only one case and everything else was leading to it ( like nobody knows or confession ) but there was almost 6 to 7 different cases and the big case .In my opinion , it was worth watching , great idea , great drama , thanks to everyone who did something to give us this great drama ."
1731,Signal,"It's been a long time since I haven't watched such a great Korean TV show .
Don't watch it with high expectations tho, so you won't be disappointed :) ."
1732,Signal,"Up until now, this is by far the best Korean Drama I have watched. It's quite sad and there are times of happiness, but it depicts a story of those who lived in the past while also carrying a story of the future. If you like the concept of the past interacting with the future to help solve crimes of the past, this is the drama for you !"
1733,Signal,"This show was in my Netflix to-watch list for the longest time, and I finally got to watch it in recent months during the year-end holidays in 2020. I am impressed with it despite seeing a time-warp / time-travel show more than half a decade of its release.Once I got past the first episode, I was hooked and intrigued, as it veers off into a crime mystery series, with each few episodes tackling a different cold case, and each of them were brilliantly crafted and acted by the cast. Some of these cases may have minor plot holes but they are never as jarring as the ones you see in Hollywood - in fact, they are all believable and keeps you excited as the team links different ideas, memories, and evidences to solve cases which were previously deemed unsolved by the police force or solved - which the team would always go on to discover to be wrongly closed after peeling the layers. These cases are all linked to one another, and also the back stories of the main characters, and explain how they all managed to get together despite differences in their backgrounds and timezones.Weave all these together with a time warp scenario comprised of police officers in the present day of 2015 and twenty years back. These might not make huge temporal sense in the time-travel genre, but plotwise, it does engage you from the time-warp fantasy genre.The pace of the story is very fast, laid with the occasional flashbacks which sometimes do get abit excessive - good thing about watching this on Netflix is you can skip through them. However, do not confuse the flashbacks with reenactments of previously-seen scenes, as the reenactments often contain important information that would have a cause on the effects of the downstream plot twists.I would highly recommend this show to anyone who has time on their holidays to binge-watch some quality shows. These are the types of drama series that make Hollywood tv shows look like a waste of time."
1734,Signal,"Perfect blend of mystery, drama, emotions and sci-fi. One of the neatest screenplay, direction with some tremendous acting."
1735,Signal,"I often have doubts about crime dramas due to alot of the unoriginal developments in storylines, but Signal could never. This was a drama that did NOT disappoint from start to finish - in fact, the heart-stopping end to every episode had me wanting more. The artistic camerawork, captivating nonlinear narrative, sophisticated direction, unique plot twists, compelling performance, highly-constructed alternate timelines, and last but not least, the suspense and anticipation was what made a drama like Signal worth watching. The drama was extremely unique and satisfying to watch in that it hinged on one specific object, and that object's ability to dictate the fates of the main characters, including every decision bound by it. Finally, the series also received widespread acclaim from audience and critics alike so what more can I say?It's only missing 1 star because I couldn't quite grasp how that walkie-talkie ended up sending radio transmissions in the first place, and felt disappointed that those mere last 3 minutes didn't allow the audience to really get a taste of satisfaction (despite the great outcome being deduced). Extending to include just some couple more scenes to see everything tie in (so I could finally exclaim with joy and satisfaction the words: ""FINALLY/YES"") would have really been the cherry on top.Storyline -- original screenplay, highly engaging, well-developed scriptCast (supporting included) -- remarkable performance by each actor's ability to convey characters emotions and thoughts through eyes and body language effortlesslyOST -- adapted from pre-2010 Korean OSTs was a daring but genius idea, and only gave the drama way more character and flavour"
1736,Signal,"While most tv from Hollywood or India increasingly relies on sex and gore to sell itself, this TV series shows that you don't need any explicit stuff to get people interested if you have an intriguing plot. The sheer complexity of the plot is handled with such finesse that it makes 'Game of Thrones' look like it's written by a bunch of juveniles. After watching this you can't go back to watching stuff like Arrow, Flash. Pure garbage. Also, worth mentioning is the emotional depth of the series. I'm the last person on earth to jerk a tear but this one made me. This TV series should be a reference guide on how humans emotions should be crafted and conveyed in cinema. It's a masterpiece!"
1737,Signal,"My first Korean thriller... At this point of the pandemic (September.2020) I can watch something else and not just comedies to cheer me up.
The cast is superb, script direction, photography...I'm following all the cast's other works. I always enjoyed good british suspense/thrillers -like The Fall, for example. Now, I'm adding Korean ones to the list. Enjoy!
(Check my list 'Favourite Korean Dramas / Comedies')"
1738,Signal,"I'm not really a fan of shows which are based on hypothetical concepts like time travel but this show was amazing. Good thing about this show was that even if it was based on time travel like stuff, it didn't overuse that concept.All cases and their investigation were top notch. Type of crimes were also unique. Actors and their emotions were also good. Couple of the stories were heavy and had a strong message. Even touched the reality of how money and power are misused.Overall, it was an amazing experience. This will go into my hall of fame and will be one of my first recommendation if someone ask."
1739,Signal,"An interesting and mostly well executed premise. However, it's held back by some silliness that is at times distracting (like how none of the cops seem to know basic first aid or the portrayal of how investigations work). If you can suspend disbelief and go with it, it's well worthwhile."
1740,Signal,If you like movies and series that talk about time travel and full of mystery this series is totally for you to watch.The writer of this series made a phenomenal job with some mind twist ideas every episode hook you up till the last minute all 16 episodes are full of excitement and you don't get bored at all 10/10 would recommend it and i hope to see season 2 for it.
1741,Signal,"The best of this drama is the acting of Jo Jin Woong and the character he plays. I would be very touched if in this world there really are people like him. Let's set aside a little less detailed storyline, we will be taken back-forward-then back again-and more backward, but that will not confuse you at all. This is precisely the point of this drama, take your concentration. This drama will also play your emotions, angry, sad, alarmed, funny, but I'll give a little leak that you have to prepare your tissue when you find the skeleton of Lee Jae Han. I really can't help it. 9/10 for him.
I planned to give point 10/10 when I was in episode 15, but the last episode was very unclear, the story hung with many questions, a poor ending."
1742,Signal,"A cool premise, a turkey of a show.Seriously, I devoured and loved the Korean shows My Mister and Stranger. This is laughable junk compared to them. To wit: it's unbearably repetitive--have never seen such over-the-top bombardment of flashbacks in my life, especially the most histrionic bits of screaming and the scenes (many many many MANY) of grieved parents having meltdowns over their dead children. The plot repeats itself too: Aha, here's the third serial killer fixated on young women victims in a single season!Starts off pretty week, gets a little stronger in the middle, falls to pieces in the end even by its own terms. Cop-out non ending, that is. NEXT."
1743,Signal,"Normally, i don't bother to write review, but I need to tell everyone how awesome this TV series is. This is the first TV series that didn't make me bored or sleepy while watching it, it's full of suspense and unpredictable plot. It also plays with your emotion, i fell happy, sad, scared, angry, desperate while watching this series.It's how good this series is, it's really draining my brain. I need to think while watching signal, even after i have finished watching it, i am still thinking about it. When I cannot move on even though i have finished watching it, then the movie is a really good one.sorry but i think SIGNAL is better than game of thrones hahaha, you should watch it. Don't miss this great series."
1744,Signal,"I don't have many words to say. Grab Frequency, Frequency series, a few other past/present/future movies, add 2-3 big cases to investigate, make them important to the main story, grab 3-4 spectacular performances, don't rush process and respect times to drama-suspense-romance development and BOOM!! Voilá, you got SIGNAL!! Outstanding."
1745,Signal,No one will regret after watching this series .it is one of the best crime series I recommend who love watching crime stories and it is full twist.
1746,Signal,"I've enjoyed the roller coaster ride that was the first season of Signal.There are some faults in the series, but I think it does it's job in making the viewer want to see how this ends. Granted, how it ends isn't that great... unless those plans of a second season actual come into fruition some day. Because the end will leave you dangling.One of my gripes was that the lead male character has a serious case of the over-acting bug. You kind of become used to it as you keep watching, but you will notice it.You also shouldn't think too much about what happens, because some things don't make sense or should't be happening, but they do to keep the plot going.The main ones being the father of the girl who dies in the bus didn't get arrested due to the info on where to look for finger prints. He got arrested due to the eye witness account. So he would have been arrested either way, so why did the timeline change?And of course in the end everything changes due to what happens with the cop in the past. But with the timeline now changed so that the main character never was in the cold cases unit, he wouldn't have been able to help with the walky talky in the earlier cases. The butterfly effect should be enormous.But again, if you don't think too much about it and take it for the entertainment it is, I liked it well enough. I do hope that 2nd season actually comes along in the near future though. Because the first season ends with a cliffhanger, with a lot of questions which need explaining."
1747,Signal,Loved it. I loved that it didn't have a conclusion. I also liked how detective cha did not have an intimate scene with Park Hae. Needs your full concentration towards the end of the season. It gets confusing and messy but definitely worth watching this masterpiece. Has some flaws but you need to see if if you're sick of the typical romantic k dramas. The beginning cases were a bit rushed and gets a little boring but keep going and it'll keep you hooked. I think there will be a season 2 I hope not though. I prefer shows which end with a cliffhanger.People who get bored easily or don't like shows which have unique storylines AND expect romance between the main leads. Don't watch it.
1748,Signal,I was utterly hooked. This is such a good crime drama and the added sci fi facet just makes it that extra special. Watch it!
1749,Signal,"I'm someone whois watched breaking bad, games of thrones, Prison Break and many great titles, but this is quite possibility the greatest dramas Ive ever watched. Superb writing, and please keep in mind, this is a Korean drama, as Koreans have their ways of making shows, etc etc, so have to keep an open mind. I've literally got emotionally attached to the 3 main actors."
1750,Signal,Unbearable and frustrating to watch the last few episodes to say the least. A very good plot let down by the need to make it extra dramatic and soapy. What a letdown!
1751,Signal,This is a masterpiece- high recommend- am learning korean and this show is so amazing to watch- it has all you need
1752,Signal,"This show is practically flawless! Seriously my favorite TV show ever. I actually learned Hangul just so I could watch it without subtitles! Yes, it's that good.Plot: 10/10
Characters: 10/10
Acting: 10/10
Feels: 10+/10"
1753,Signal,I cannot explain this show just with a few words. So i'm gonna make this short. If you are looking for a K-drama to see or just want have a little tatse. Dont go anywhere far cuz this show is perfect
1754,Signal,Wowwwwww this series is a must watch for anyone who like thriller series with exceptionally well stories plotting. I highly recommend this series. I enjoyed every episode and never got bored even for a second. Highly highly highly recommend this series.
1755,Signal,"I'm a big fan of Hye-su Kim. When it came to watching Signal, I thought I was going to immediately be hooked. Well this is one of those times when I was wrong. I made it thru 6 episodes before calling it quits. Lee Jehoon's character Park Hae-yeong, is so aggravating, i found myself yelling at my television. The character is so annoyingly written, that you just want to see him killed off. Unfortunately, he's in all 16 episodes. Not even my great admiration for Hye-su Kim could make me continue another 10 episodes to see the finale."
1756,Signal,"This has to be one of the best thriller series till now. Best thing about this show is they have picked up a fictional topic and didn't overuse it. You get hooked up in the first episode only. When the first episode ends, you think they have shown a whole film here what left to show for rest of the 15 episodes. That's why this is a one hell of a series. It has a tremendous gripe over the narration. It never allows you to move away and keeps throwing some beautifully crafted emotional scenes. Koreans are master in storytelling and keep using flashbacks to create a momentum for an emotional scene. This show will not let you down."
1757,Signal,"Don't expect this to be the masterpiece other reviews say it is. It sure is an interesting plot and its thrilling. But, it doesn't make any sense. Even the Butterfly effect 2004 movie makes more sense than this. In a 2 hour movie, you get better explanations about changes in the past affecting the future than in the 19 hour series Signal.This is my main reason to not enjoy this series as much as other people. If you are like me, and you like to think and reason a detective series you won't enjoy this series a lot.The overall quality of the series is very good. Good acting and the series look good. A lot of very obvious product placement and as other movies/series of south Korea, you hate the cops because they are just way too bad at doing their job."
1758,Signal,My first ever review here. Just go for it if you like intense and mystery.
1759,Signal,"So this series was the first ever K-series I have watched and believe me, I finished the season over a weekend plus 1st weekday. Acting, direction, detailing, everything was spot on and the only reason why I give it 9/10 is because it ended when I didn't want to end only after season 1.
Although there were some glitches and liberties have been taken to make it more interesting but that is something you would expect for a series based on time travel concept. With such powerful acting, one would easily let that go.
I would highly recommend this to everyone who loves mystery, sci-fi genre and even if you don't, do give this a try.
I am in search of something similar but I feel this could be one of the greatest seasons/movies from Korea especially in this genre."
1760,Signal,"I just loved it. Real, deep intrinsic quality. It is...something else, the characters, the story, the atmosphere, the music; the acting may seem almost childish at some point, it's different, especially if you're not used to Korean series, but this feeling quickly disappears and develops into a subtle complexity of emotions that will stay with you for a really long time."
1761,Signal,"I am from London mummy, looking after kid, Since hearing Parasite won, I am curious Korean series, now watching addicted to this magnificent Signal drama, keep wanting see next one another, actors are really good and it undoubtedly not monotonous performance , outstanding, even though this was produced year 2016..Now I am Korean addict drama fan.. bring on more Korean in Europe countries.-"
1762,Signal,"Absolutely no flaws.Hands down the best kdrama(if not the best drama).The acting,music,the plot,...everything is on point.Even though its about time travel and stuff, everything was logically written.Well done.Really hoping for season 2."
1763,Signal,"Korean series' are the best. Unlike the American series and movies which rely on heavy camera work, action sequences, and cinematography, they mainly use gripping storyline to make us glued to the screen. Hats off!"
1764,Signal,This is a must watch!! Each and every episode had some twist and it was mindblowing.
1765,Signal,"This drama makes me realize that if you have the power,higher ranks,money,fame etc. You can easily manipulate everything but thankful to have the detectives especially Detective Lee Jae-Han who did everything he can to help the people who are wrongly by the Law. And it begins with the brother of Detective Park Hae-Young that his brother wrongly accused because of people who are rich and have a name in their country. But with the walkie-talkie Detective Park Hae-Young knew everything he needs to know. But this drama makes my heart so painful because of what happened in the past. And they did everything to correct it. I really love the passion of Detective Lee Jae-Han of his work, and it is so hard to find the police who are trustworthy, have a heart and so much dedicated to his job as a police officer. And Detective Park Hae-Young too this drama is much different from the dramas I watched. The actors really did a spectacular and they act with their hearts in this drama that's why it is so beautiful to watch.And this drama makes me shiver, and emotional because of happening there. But I am happy because they knew who is the culprit of many crimes and bring justice to the people. Who are powerless because of the people who are in the high ranking officials."
1766,Signal,"I had never seen a Korean drama before ""Squid Game"", which blew me away. This was recommended by the UK newspaper ""The Guardian"", and as I like sci fi and thrillers, I decided to watch it to fill the void ""Squid Game"" left.""Signal"" has to be one of the best things I have ever watched. The plot is complex, but there are no notable plot holes. Any misalignments are quickly forgotten due to the pace, the clever acting and the fantastic character development, which spans the years between 1989 and 2015.The sci fi element of connecting past and present and creating parallel storylines is done smoothly and is intertwined into the cases the detectives from two different timelines have to solve. I found it interesting that real Korean murder cases were also included in the series.There is something gritty and refreshingly underproduced about ""Signal"" that I thoroughly enjoyed. The actors are invested in their performances, the surroundings and backgrounds are wonderful depictions of what I assume is everyday life in Korea. All the characters seem exceedingly real and very distinct from one another.This is not for fans of slick, shiny US productions, I would assume. As I am thoroughly fed up with clever camera shots, interchangeable faces, shallow characters and squeaky clean production, the grittiness of Signal really appealed to me. Crime scenes are messy and some parts of ""Signal"" are emotionally draining. Not for everyone, but absolutely perfect for me, including the optimistic open ending. Roll on Season 2."
1767,Signal,Kudos to the writers. Tightly written. Acting is good too but the aging effects are lacking. 20 years seem to have passed and actors haven't aged.
1768,Signal,"Why do people of South Korea under rate their movies, TV-series so much? Why? Believe me when I say ""If this show was made in Hollywood, It's rating would have been 9.5 or above"". The amount of thriller provided in just the first four episodes is higher than the aggregate amount of thriller provided by all five seasons of TV series like Breaking Bad. I have watched every good Hollywood movie and TV- series, but I have never reviewed anything, This is my first review and it is coming for a South Korean drama, but the irony is I just don't have words to explain how I feel after watching this show. I am Speechless. I feel so bad when I see that there are not even 500 votes here. These directors, actors and the whole production team needs to be appreciated. They are giving us so much, I can't find ways to thank them. Why the world is living in ignorance? These 18 hours are right here, which can give them a next level thrilling experience. If someone by chance is reading this review, please do yourself a favor and watch this drama."
1769,Signal,"If anyone just assumes that time travelling is done, the rest is flawless."
1770,Signal,"This is first Korean Drama i watched and i am really glad that i did.. This is my review of any thing. I have watched many English TV shows but after a while they change story or no longer are exited compare to first episodes. but this is on whole another new level..Everything is just amazing story,acting,suspense. Writer just created her own new world.. I could feel, how characters felt for each other in this show.. nothing was forced or dragged too long.. I highly recommend this who is reading this.. Even at the last episodes, last minute i couldn't guess what was going to happen this is masterpiece of thriller genre.. and also soundtracks wow just amazing every music in this was amazing.. i really wish this was longer than just only 16 episodes.."
1771,Signal,"Based on the high rating and the new Kingdom series, I started this one. Each one is over an hour long. The different timelines via a walkie-talkie was clever but cannot compare with the 3 timelines in True Detective Season 3, less supernatural. Acting was good from the 3 leads but pacing was slower due to the ""soapish"" quality, especially starting with episode 10 with college girls murder. I could see why the 3 major networks in Korea did not want to carry it. I'm sure their 1% are even more corrupt, even at the presidential or chaebol's level. Glad the independent/cable type station brought this series out. It's dark and morbid like True Detective. It would have been great with 12 episodes. Worth a watch."
1772,Signal,"I watched Signal out of curiosity due to time/science fiction element written in the synopsis but it opened up much further to the excellent acting, plot and story line signal could offer. I wonder if Hollywood would learn a thing or two from this series to produce a different new level of story telling. Will they be releasing season 2 soon? I look forward to it almost anxiously. Will they not do so? I believe with the 16 episodes they aired had made many who watched Signal to expectantly wait if the producers would decide to continue. Its like two parallel earths - one past, the other present. Both worlds connected by a doorway of time. Past changed because of the present and present changes due to the past."
1773,Signal,The filming is mesmerizing. Love all of the actors - such facial expressions! Thank you for the series. An admiring Caucasion(!) American. I enjoy Kdramas/movies and the handsome actors. Loved Clown Crown; 100 Days; **The Kings Affection.....

1858,Bad Guys: Vile City,"Well, to be honest I prefer the first Bad guys to Bad Guys 2 this annoys and heroics for so long that I pissed off myself. In terms of plot, acting, the characters are sickening except for Gang Joo's acting so cool that I have spent watching all the episodes because there is JiSoo, the only handsome and my favorite young man.
sometimes each of these episodes annoys me to the point of whining. and I'm tired of seeing Je Moon. he doesn't fit into a character in Bad Guys 2."
1859,Bad Guys: Vile City,"A depiction of greed in a lawless city, and it's not Seoul. Towering office buildings to make law and to govern at the front; plague, slum and violence at the back door.Mayor office, police system, prosecutors, gangsters, thugs are the same, they desperately threaten, betray and kill to be on top to get a piece of power with money politics or ready to die.Can't get enough of the full action and surprising turn of power in every episode. Every character is insecure.I can relate to my late father's job as prosecutor in several different provinces in a country in SEA. Scary and insecure."
1860,Bad Guys: Vile City,"Generally underwhelming. Overall, I found both the plot and the characters somewhat boring. Perhaps that's my bias, though, because I dislike storylines where the main character is asked to blindly trust someone who doesn't even try to explain the reasons for what they're doing. I find it irritating wherever I encounter it, and this series is no different.I will say, however, that I thought that it improved as the series progressed - fewer long and boring gang fight scenes, for example - although the jump from the first to the second half of the series felt a little disjointed. I also find it hard to believe that any of the evidence they produced would be admissable in a courtroom. It was an adequate watch for passing the time and improving some of my language skills, but overall I wouldn't bother rewatching it."
1861,Bad Guys: Vile City,"After watching the first episode it seemed like it would be a promising series. The acting is good and the plot interesting, but.. And there's a big but here. They're censoring parts of a scene for some unknow reason by blurring a couple of people out. This ruins the whole immersion and makes the series unwatchable.If you don't want something in your series, just don't show it instead of censoring it."
1862,Bad Guys: Vile City,"...I don't need protagonists to be great or even good. But it's terribly annoying when they come across as dumb and dumber still.On top of that it's all very Boy's Own. The female characters are either villains or victims.Despite the acting talent, one of the weaker Korean dramas I've seen."
1863,Bad Guys: Vile City," *The plot is so annoying*
"
1864,Bad Guys: Vile City," Perfect title, good action series
"
1865,Bad Guys: Vile City," Fine, I guess
"
1866,Bad Guys: Vile City," Ruined by censorship
"
1867,Bad Guys: Vile City," Great acting, shame about the script...
"
1868,Itaewon Class,"Itaewon class is a fresh and modern take on the revenge melodrama that is entertaining from start to finish. For people who have been put off by the serious heavy going revenge melodramas of the past like Money Flower and Shark and Green Rose, it's time to give the genre another chance. This has some feel good moments along the way with the building up of the business and the first take down of the villain. This is an ensemble effort with quite a lot of emphasis on the supporting cast of characters. There is a slight slow down in pace in the last 2 episodes but I understand its is to give some gravity to the climax of the show where he finds the meaning of his life. The kneeling is a bit excessive though.
There are some groundbreaking things in this drama that handled quite tastefully and well without being preachy although the message is strong. Racism and stereotypes are shown with a half Korean half African character. He is quite funny. Also an actress plays a boy who transgenders to a girl. The romance is also unconventional. The original love interest played by Kwon Nara is made to seem unlikeable but in the end pulls through for him and has a consolation prize of Park Bo Gum. This is a breakout role for Kim Da Mi as a fearless smart young woman. I like the way they fell in love after all she did for him. Those looking for a sweet romance with lots of lovey dovey scenes would be disappointed. But they would not have been in place here anyway. After all this is a revenge drama - not a rom com. Some have pointed out a lack of chemistry and it does seem they are more like good friends but this isn't an old fashioned show so it's a different kind of love story. Park Seo Joon does the principled good guy well. Wish they could have varied the silly chestnut haircut at least for some of the show. The villain is well played by Ahn Bo Hyun. Kim Dong Hee is quite good as the younger brother. The OST is good too - not intrusive."
1869,Itaewon Class,"So I basically decided to watch the whole kdrama on Netflix since I wasn't able to find the Webtoon anywhere. However I'm glad I did watch the drama since the webtoon pretty much had the blandest art I've ever seen ngl (no offence to the artist btw). The colours and the scenery man are just stunning like seeing the breathtaking views of Seoul day and night just blows you away!I was really enjoying nearly all the characters. It was even unique that it added in transgender character who really needed more screen time to be honest. Lee Joo Young did such a nice performance as the character! I really wanted to see more of her character and Ryu Kyung Soo's character together! The character I obviously couldn't stand is Jang Geun Soo who always simping over Yiseo and just turns his back on Park Saeroyi a few times. He is like a ""damsel in distress"" character like for effin sake man, wipe off from the story jeez! Btw the actor who plays him is cute tho, I'll give him that lol! To add, it's also good to see an African man join the group too, I like the fact we have a kdrama representing diversity woop woop!!I gotta admit the whole thing took the whole day to finish it so the length to finishing it is ridiculous. Fair warning to all who have busy lives! I really enjoyed it though like it is worth the binge! It's emotional, funny, gorgeous, tense, nearly everything you do or don't expect in a romance drama depending how you look at it! Just watch kg guys, it's a decent kshow to check out if you don't want to read the Webtoon!"
1870,Itaewon Class,""" Itaewon Class "" had a strong start but it didn't keep up with the momentum.The main problem with the drama was the pace. The skipping forward years in the future prevented the characters from having any character development and it just didn't help the romance at all. Especially the 14th episode was just bad, as it felt like they were trying to present the current situation of the characters in a fast and furious way, editing scene after scene and just blurting out that the main character now loves this girl, out of the blue, but that's that. No explanation was provided for their actions, no background and those four years in the future seemed like they four empty years (I mean even the flashbacks that the male lead was experiencing were from four years ago or of the same day, like nothing happened in those four years). Another factor that didn't really help with the love story was that the couple didn't have chemistry. They didn't have any solid heart-racing moment either. So, them getting together was just too random and forceful.Finally, the characters remained the same as they were presented at the beginning of the drama. We knew the bad guys were bad and that didn't really change, although, the son did have some potential to demonstrate why he was the monster he turned out to be, a potential that was never really properly explored. The big boss and enemy of the male lead felt also more like a promise of a bad character after all. He sure was mean to the main character and seriously unlikable, but, in the end, his actions were left in the behind the scenes grey area. The main character, in addition, showed zero development. He even got a bit boring after a while and felt a bit too bland in others.Now, for the good part of the drama. The beginning was just perfect. If you like melodrama, like I do, where the main character hits bottom and gets unfairly treated in order to stand up to his own two feet again and take matters into his own hands, then you are going to love the first half of the drama. The revenge plot was very satisfying as well, with a solid ending that was nicely presented. Though, it would have been nice if they showed how they actually managed to succeed, as the first part of the drama had focused on the struggles of them setting off. Another part of the drama that was pretty good was the characters. The members of the crew were unique and the drama didn't shy off from issues like racism and gender identity. So, it was refreshing to see those elements added in the plot. The female leads were delightful too. They were strong women, the one beautiful but a tragic character, and the other young, fearless, reckless and somehow, likable. Sure, she did some questionable things, but she was young and just too full of herself, so it was nice to see how the others helped her realize that her attitude wasn't always right and to grow up. I've also seen some other viewers not really liking her looks. Sure, she isn't the classic beauty, but, for her character, who was cool and interesting, I think she was just perfect. Finally, the OST was solid.So, overall, six out of ten."
1871,Itaewon Class,You have Principle? Please watch this if you believe u are one of the kind. You must echo this drama definitely. The romance line is also charming In this drama but the revenge part is the core. Sadly the ending not good enough and too many flash back to make story longer. The first 9 ep I rate 9 but last 7 drag to 5 only. But the concept of a principle young man just make me feel who will do this in reality... probably none. Interesting to watch at the beginning.
1872,Itaewon Class,"Review By Kamal KItaewon Class was an emotional ride with an especially promising start. Just after the first two episodes, I felt immensely attached to the main character, Park Saeroyi, and was looking forward to following him on his journey. Throughout the 16 episodes, I definitely learned a lot from his hardwork and values. Park Seo Joon did a phenomenal job with his character and left me in absolute awe. Whether it may be understanding the beauty of life or being reminded the importance of hardwork; I was thankful to be able to get to know and learn from Park Saeroyi.However, apart from Park Saeroyi, I did have a few complaints for the other characters. Some characters were especially annoying, and lacked development. I did like that the drama showcased imperfect characters, but it also sometimes excused the ignorant behaviour of these characters - almost making it seem that such behaviour was appropriate to viewers. Some characters were especially inconsistent, and just seemed random. This switch was really annoying to see because it didn't make sense. I think these characters had a lot of potential to really compliment the story, but the writer just changed them randomly in order to make Park Saeroyi look good. I wish the side characters had contributed a little more to the overall plot but unfortunately we were unable to see that as viewers.I was disappointed with the last two episodes as I felt that there were unnecessary additions to the plot. However, the ending was still quite nice and most questions were answered.The OSTs were beautiful, and I know I will play them countless times in the future!Overall, this was definitely a meaningful and enjoyable watch."
1873,Itaewon Class,"I was really impressed with the acting and pace until the last 2 episodes when I felt it lost its way, I have also preferred a different ending with the love triangle too. Overall worth a watch but I believe a lot of reviewers who gave it 10 wished they had watched the entire series before being so generous."
1874,Itaewon Class,"Finished with the 6 available episodes and have to say this one is different than any KD I've seen, at first it got my attention and was interesting figured it would fad out somewhat like most but it builds with every show not that predictable plenty of surprises some good humor but not a romcom.Its a 10 so far nothing more i can as for a KD,give it at least 4 episodes and the claws come out after that men and women.
Through episode 11 now and nobody can screw up a great series and a good mood like Korean writers, come on people cruel behavior from your main character isn't how you grow a audience and i see for the first time this last show
had a lower rating then the previous one.
Just finished it they actually nailed the final episode so ill say this is a great series and you should watch it.good job"
1875,Itaewon Class,"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean romantic drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.Park Sae-ro-yi (Park Seo-joon) is a person with a very strong sense of justice and moral integrity. He is an only child being raised by his widowed father and the father and son are the most important thing in each other's worlds. Sae-ro-yi is very goal driven, his dream is to become a police officer, but the dream is shattered when he inserts himself in a bully situation. As the eldest and only legitimate son if the Jangga group, Jang Geun-won (Ahn Bo-hyun) has been groomed by his father to think of those of lower socioeconomic status as beneath him. He is a bully at school, which leads to a violent conflict with Sae-ro-yi who is not the type to stand by and allow it. When the high schoolers are disciplined the school allows Jang Dae-hee (Yoo Jae-myung), Geun-won's father and CEO of Jangga group, to decide the punishment. Since Sae-ro-yi's father happens to work for Jangga group and is a favored employee Dae-hee says he will forgive what he perceives as an insult to his son and family if Sae-ro-yi will kneel and apologize. Sae-ro-yi does not feel as though he has done wrong and refuses to kneel. He is expelled at the recommendation of Dae-hee and Sae-ro-yi stands behind his son and is forced to resign. Things seem to level out when Sae-ro-yi's father utilizes savings to open a restaurant but tragedy strikes and Sae-ro-yi's father is killed in a traffic accident by, none other, than Geun-won. At first Sae-ro-yi does not know the culprit but when he chances to find out who it was, he nearly beats Dae-won to death and serves a 3 year prison sentence for attempted murder. Sae-ro-yi spends his time studying business toward the goal of opening a competing business, DanBam, and ruining Jangga group. An unlikely group of employees/friends work for Sae-ro-yi and he also has the help of a social media guru, Jo Yi-seo (Kim Da-mi) who, after several chance encounters with the affable Sae-ro-yi vows to stay by his side and help him reach his goals. Sae-ro-yi's school friend and first love, Oh Soo-ah (Kwon Nara) works for the Jangga group and Sae-ro-yi still has feelings for her. Will a school drop out and ex-con be able to pull off the take down of a well established conglomerate like the Jangga group? Will Sae-ro-yi go with his feelings for his old love or is this new woman more of his second half?Spoiler Altert** This is a great story that reminds of so many other good stories I have seen in the past. It has elements of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and some Rocky Balboa like elements as well. Like his father who the viewer got to know briefly, Sae-ro-yi is one of those rare people who lets nothing deter him from the right path. He is kind to those that deserve it and harsh on those that do harm to others. The people around him make mistakes but he never holds those types of things against them and it causes everyone in his inner circle to like and admire him. At first I was cheering for his first love, to be the FL and main love interest, but as soon as Yi-seo entered the picture I loved her spunk, energy and the way she was all in with whatever she was doing, including her pursuit of Sae-ro-yi. One of his inner circle is transgender and I was surprised that it portrayed the South Korean people as not very tolerant of different sexual identities. She was one of my favorite characters. Another person in his inner circle was black and there was a lot of prejudice about him being a black Korean. I loved how his business model was about his people and how they, as a result, respected him and loved him like family. He accepted them all for the people they were black, transgender, a little bit psycho and helped them realize their own potential. There were some characters tome that did things that did not make sense. Sae-to-hi did change and harden just a bit which is not such a bad thing but did result in him not forgiving to the same level he did in the past. I loved the friendships and the love story. There were some slow parts toward the end where an element of the story was dragged out more than necessary. Very good and I highly recommend."
1876,Itaewon Class,"Later episodes drag on and series is beset by common K-drama tropes. The age old story of the middle class authorities, cops and teachers, bowing to the wealthy class. The son of the antagonist is a bad caricature and the hero is an unbelievable stoic. Some progressive ideas like transgender and multi-racial citizens are put forward. Curious use of the Namsan Seoul Tower which is placed in almost every background shot."
1877,Itaewon Class,"I'm really surprised by how divisive this show seems to be - based on the reviews it looks like people either hated it or loved it. I fell into the love it category (obviously). Interesting characters and a revenge plot line were the heart of this show, with a subplot of romance that people also either loved or hated. I understand that people don't want to waste their time on a show they won't like, so I would probably advise ""on-the-fence"" viewers that if you don't like Yi-Seo's character from the get-go (I personally loved her), I feel like you won't like this show (based on the other reviews I feel that her character is the perfect benchmark to determine whether or not to keep watching).A small detail that I really loved and just have to point out was the symbolic use of hairstyles in this show. Also this is hella progressive for a KDrama - I loved how they brought up big issues like racism and trans-phobia. It was refreshing since most KDrama's definitely feel like they can be stuck in that awkward 90's phase of mentioning progressive issues in a way that is funny-offensive (think Friends).Itaewon Class was such a great binge-watch, you can't help but want to know how it all turns out, and it has so many ""yell at the screen moments"" that make it truly enjoyable to watch. I did think that towards the end, the choices of some characters felt a bit melodramatic, but this didn't take away from my enjoyment at all. Definitely worth a watch!"
1878,Itaewon Class,Nah it's not worse but it's just as bad. Only girls on the verge of puberty would like this
1879,Itaewon Class,"I watched the first episode, I will not continue. I don't know what will happen in the future. It felt like there was no traceable one."
1880,Itaewon Class,"Episode 1 and last episode 16 were crap and badly made.The rest of the episodes are quite nice and good to spend time on. If you want really excitement, this is not a recommendation. This is above-average quality Korean drama and deserves a 7/10 overall rating."
1881,Itaewon Class,"The first two episodes were really great, then, I stopped watching after episode 13. The story lost its focus and I just couldn't stand Yi Seo anymore, she's so childish, selfish, and disrespectul compared to the high morale of Saeyori...
Also, harassing and assaulting during sleep is not OK at all!!"
1882,Itaewon Class,"This drama started strong for me, but somehow limped to the finish. By the end, the only thing I liked was the music. The love story seemed kind of rushed. I thought the male lead was going to end up with the other girl. Instead, he ended up with the one who I thought he had sisterly vibes with the whole time. When they ended up together, it was a big eww!"
1883,Itaewon Class,"I just want to know why script writers think we want to be tortured with love triangles. This show is the worst with it as well. Everyone likes someone who doesn't like them back. I was hooked on the first episode, but it loses its charm as everyone else says and the love stories get so annoying. Idk if I'll continue watching after ep 12... want to give this a 9 for the amazing episodes it has but if I can't continue watching it it definitely doesn't deserve a 9."
1884,Itaewon Class,This series is just perfect. I liked everything about it even when things weren't going the way I wished for it. They kinda went crazy in the last episodes but I believe they did that to balance things out. I believe it was to give another purpose for a certain character. The idea of an underdog going against a big corporation is not new but this one was executed perfectly. You won't even hate the parts you are supposed to. It's just so uplifting in every part of it. Perfect revenge story with a great moral boost for those who will for sure relate which in this case pretty much most of us.
1885,Itaewon Class,Compelling story with genuinely funny moments. The larger story is deep and involving.
1886,Itaewon Class,"The songsssss in this drama are sooooo amazing !!!!
The cast is amazing... beautiful story !!
I absolutely loved it so much!! It's definitely a must watch !!"
1887,Itaewon Class,"I had to add my review after I read a few awfully negative reviews of #ItaewonClass
I decided to watch this show because I liked PSJ in What is a Wrong With Secretary Kim and I'm thrilled I did!! He was awesome in this series! He is a great actor! I loved the themes on this series, and most of all, the gutsy performance of Kim Da Mi. Her Yi-Seo is epic. She shines!! Finally! A woman who saves the day!!!! This is a great show! Watch it! And don't get distracted by those who think otherwise!!!"
1888,Itaewon Class,"The series has a great story line, competition is blended with friendship and having romance as a sweetenerThe main cast and supporting cast playing their character very well."
1889,Itaewon Class,"I thought Nara was going to play more of the lead. But soon after that she got a supporting role. I would have preferred to see her in the team as well and that the battle between the ladies came to the fore a bit more. The feelings had been smeared out for too long. I understand that the focus was more on revenge, but the makers could have divided this better. I felt a little sorry for Nara because of this. Although I would rather have given love to Nara, because their love started so strong.maybe this was done on purpose, but i thought it was a shame."
1890,Itaewon Class,I saw this kdrama cuz of the good reviews .Negatives:1. Slow progress2. Awful haircut changes in female characters (to show that years go by)3. Awful love story4. No chemistry between main roles.5. Sometimes boring.Positives:1. Catchy ost.2. Park Seo Joon (handsome and good actor)
1891,Itaewon Class,"ITAEWON CLASS has a lot of heart. The emotions elicited by the show are on a whole new level. The story is filled with love for family & friends, as well as love for oneself & others. The first two episodes are extremely heavy, but once you get past them, Park SaeRoYi & his Danbam crew will take you on a classic hero's journey.I've never seen Park Seo Joon perform with such zeal. He embraced his role as Saeroyi & poured his heart & soul into it. Though some may regard him as a softie, I admire how Saeroyi remained true to his principles, for better or worse. I's inspired by the importance he placed on integrity & his practice of putting people first. You'll notice his endearing habit of stroking his bowl-cut hair throughout the drama. The gesture humanized him & distinguished Saeroyi from the other characters Seo Joon has played to date.ITAEWON CLASS has all of the elements of a good K-drama. Because of their vulnerability, each character is well-written & realistic. I like how the romantic aspect of the drama was subtly woven into the plot. My heart was racing because the love triangle between Saeroyi, Soo Ah & Yi Seo was so unpredictable. Yi Seo's vulnerability in putting her life on the line for Saeroyi, even in the face of unrequited love, tugged at my heartstrings. Her determination to support & protect Saeroyi exemplifies what girl power is all about. She won me over & inspired me to support her because she never expected anything in return.Another aspect of the script that I liked was the ending. Although the plot spans 15 years, it concludes successfully, with elements planted early on coming into full bloom to support the outcome. For what it's worth, the time I spent in ITAEWON CLASS resulted in a memorable experience. The drama was entertaining & inspiring. It also brought the Itaewon district to life. The drama left me with two important takeaways to remember: people should be at the heart of every business & dreams are worth fighting for.(Ps- It has THE BEST OSTs of recent years. Sweet night- My favorite. It can be played on loop. Start over- Very motivating)"
1892,Itaewon Class,If this had been done in say 8 episodes there would still have been faults but the david a Goliath pot would have worked. Instead over 16 pisodes it rambles and the plot holes and unlikely coincidences become too obvious. There is an interesting sub text going on about what sort of cpitalism - peope or power - os best and some good points on loyalty and friendship.But why is the boss clearly autistic and lets his first love hang around for 15 years (without visibly ageing by the way) and then dumbs her for a girl who is close to being a stalker. Glad to see some diversity in his employees but nothing was ever really explored and were they moonks as well like the boss.I enjoyed this show except for the ridiculous last three episodes. It made some good points but went on too long. Loved the music.
1893,Itaewon Class,"I have seen the series several times and I love it
Highly recommended
One of my favorites - I am going to see it again and again"
1894,Itaewon Class,"Again i had to watch a few episodes and i have just discovered that my favourite song which i had to buy the first time i heard it
It is V from BTS who singsOOOOO MMM GGGG it is so good.Thanks for creating the perfect series amazing job."
1895,Itaewon Class,Some scenes are fantasized than real life and longy. But it was inspirational and one of my beloved korean tv series.
1896,Itaewon Class,"Even though its some points are fantasized & scenes are longy, It's cute & inspirational. One of fav. Watch later list are decreased by one."
1897,Itaewon Class,The best thing about this show is its captivating storyline. It doesn't make you feel bore at all. Cast is amazing. The subtle romance and love triangle also makes it slightly different from other regular shows.
1898,Itaewon Class,"I didn't see a single flow in the series. Every episode exceeds it's limit. Itaewon has a beautiful inspiratory story, romance and music. All casts done an excellent jobe expessialy the leading roles. If you were looking for a different tipe of korean drama it is the best choice. Not a single episode is going to disappoint you."
1899,Itaewon Class,"I understand why people like this show, but for me, I was left wanting more. The plot of the show is strong and it starts off good, with a detailed backstory. But it took me about 10 episodes to actually start getting invested in the show. Before that there wasn't much making me want to continue watching. But when I finally got into it, it was really good. The characters were likeable and the storyline was great. My biggest critique is the love story though. It felt extremely forced, with little to no chemistry between the main character and the love interest. Even with all of its flaws, this is still a well produced k drama with heartwarming moments that somewhat make up for its bad parts."
1900,Itaewon Class,"I love Park Seo Joon, he is not only good looking but he did CAN act. Not just a pretty face. The scene where he went to confront Jang Geun Won for killing his father is one of the best scene I have watched. He is excellent and he gave it his all. His acting has been steadily improving over the years. The female leads (Kim Da-mi & Nara) are average specially Nara. Another actor worth the praise is Jae-myung Yoo, I always anticipate his scene with Park Seo Joon.The story is intense and fast paced which I love. The first half is superb but it got less interesting as it gradually moves towards the end. I am most unimpressed by the ending of the story. Park Sae Ro Yi didn't get the sweet revenge by his own effort, rather it was Oh Soo Ah who got the job done, Sae Ro Yi simply take the advantage of the situation. It could have been more satisfying to have him get the revenge, I mean, he has been consumed/fuel by his hatred, and suddenly the story just ends like... what? Silent fading without any drama...I was expecting something with a bang!!The romantic aspect of the story I didn't care much who Park Sae Ro Yi chose. I mean people change, feelings change and etc... but of course it would be less controversial if he ends up with Soo Ah, it would have been more consistent with his character. Anyone can see that Jo Yi Seo is not the best match for Park, and I found myself thinking, if in real life, they could certainly split after a few years.The supporting cast and the soundtrack are both superb, BTW, I love the fashion the girls wear specially Kim Da-mi.Summary : an interesting KDrama worth the time."
1901,Itaewon Class,Really one of the best K drama I have seen. Those who did not like it was only because they did not like the girl the lead character chooses in the end. Enjoyed it from beginning to the end.
1902,Itaewon Class,"If you have time on your hands and at a loss for dramas to watch, this should be under consideration. However, it certainly is not representative of the best dramas that Korea has to offer. I could never get behind the Yi Seo character. I found her annoying and obsessive in her love for Saeyori and while she might have a genius IQ, I found it unrealistic to think she was some business genius fresh out of high school. And her callousness towards her co-workers particularly the one who loved her was unforgivable. But as it is with all Korean dramas, acting was good with a little comedy, action and romance thrown in."
1903,Itaewon Class,"Korean. Drama at its best
So good
I am addicted
And I am a kiwi"
1904,Itaewon Class,"An optimistic heartwarming revenge story that's all about the people.It's not a tragic story but a story telling of a person who is optimistic, he fought with those who wronged him without abandoning himself, his principles and his people.Itaewon Class is about fighting for what you think is right, even when everyone is against you. It shows the importance of our choices...if you make a mistake, you should take responsibility for your actions, but if you are doing what you think is right, no matter what you will not regret. Above all, it has a very clear message that there is nothing you can't do if you try hard, you just have to get up again everytime you fall.The drama tackles many social issues like injustice in the criminal system, the power of rich vs hardship of poor, discriminations in society, gender/racial issues, taking advantage of orphans and what not.Now, talking about the characters,
the best part about this drama is watching the growth of the lead and side characters. Each character changes throughout the show, completing arcs which are believable and well-earned.Park Sae Joon: Dude! He has the worst haircut of all time. Couldn't avoid mentioning that Sorry! Which was the main reason I pushed this drama till now.Talking about his character...He compels you to think about yourself and your life, he has an interesting view about the world. He loves his people no matter what.His tenacity, stubbornness, and ability to continue to persevere through all the obstacles that have been thrown at him by Jang is what eventually will win your heart. He is positive, emotional, encouraging and has guts.Yi Seo- It's so rare to see really cool female leads that are smart, mean, and likeable. I love the character of YS for not pretending to be nice, for being smart, strong and confident, and being able to fight for herself and her love. Moreover, she doesn't even feel bad for being a badass. I love the way she has no guilt in telling everyone that she is a sociopath. That's the strength of her character. I like her!Soo-Ah- You got to see a lot of character depth in her, and her inner conflicts about what was right and wrong.Jang: He has seen a lot, struggled a lot to be where he is right now and to remain on that position he can do anything to anyone. He can behead anyone also he can bend his knee infront of his enemy just to save his company. His character is cruel and has been played impressively.I find him an inspiring negative character.Geun Won- Ahn Bu Hyun delivered a superb role as a son who longed for his father's love and trying to get it desperately. He is trying enough for the girl he really liked can still love him. He should be loved but...Geun Soo- He sympathetic and loving when he is an outcast but when he decides to join his father, we can see a dark side of him which is a reflection of his dad. He betrays the very friend who accepts him. There was a ""enough is enough"" moment with him which made him what he became.OST: It has THE BEST Soundtrack of recent years!Sweet night- My favourite! It can be played on loop. Hello Army!Start over- Very motivating
Someday, the boy- emotionalThis drama is something out of the ordinary from the episode 1 itself.An edgy drama with good characters, plot and the slightest bit of romance.Highly motivating, highly emotional and satisfactory."
1905,Itaewon Class,"In another serie (my first first love) they said that if you can't do it for your lack of talent, you will, working hard."
1906,Itaewon Class,"Writing this review with tears in my eyes because I'm so sad that it had to end, the show is so refreshing it is completely layered, messy, romantic and extremely emotional it reminded me of a mixture of skins an American teen show mixed with that classic K drama essence,I found myself wanting to savour the episodes rather than binge in one go because I loved it that much it's unlike any K drama I have watched previously this one is a definite 10 out of 10."
1907,Itaewon Class,"The show follows all the characters, develops them, and teaches lessons through them. The goals of the supporting characters nicely connect to the goal of the main character. This show pushes the boundaries of pursing one's dreams no matter the challenges. Phenomenal acting and gripping story, although the awkward love triangle was a distraction."
1908,Itaewon Class,The series is a let down after episode 12.Made a fool out of main character's idealism.Dissapointing turn of things for the unsaid love story.
1909,Itaewon Class,"This show is now in my top 3. And, PLEASE, watch this, the original Korean series, before somebody decides to ""Americanize"" it. There are things that can't be converted from Korean to American, without losing too much of its heart, soul, conviction, and tradition. This series is so well-written and conceived, I just get the feeling some American producer will snatch this up.From the story, to the acting, to how beautifully, and fully-formed the characters are, make this a precious jewel. It has everything a person could want in a great series! Believe me-DO NOT MISS THIS ONE."
1910,Itaewon Class,This series is awesome because they show how was the revenge is. What is the real revenge how manage people around you how tackle fear and problems so please watch this series.
1911,Itaewon Class,"This drama revolves around Park Saeroyi, a guy who believes that he can do anything he wants and tries to beat Jangga Co. all the while sticking to his values of integrity. It made me question if there is anyone like him who falls and rises to work towards the same goal although it's pretty impossible to be achieved. I came to a conclusion that not everyone is as lucky as him. Anyway, it's good that Yi Seo and Saeroyi ended up together. Yi Seo worked so hard to make him successful and happy.I feel touched to see Yi Seo giving Geun Soo a hug when he asked for a handshake during their farewell. He was very very faithful to her but she couldn't accept his feelings. I also feel sorry for Oh Soo Ah. I like her character in this drama because i can relate to it. She is an orphan so she has to work harder to live a comfortable life. She studied hard, received financial aid from Jangga Co. and worked for them. ""I am an employee of Jangga Co. and I will always work for Jangga Co.""She is a successful manager and I like how successful she is after working her way up. She is pretty and capable. I want to be that kind of woman. She waited over 10 years for Park Saeroyi but he fell for someone else instead. I like how she doesn't harbour ill feelings towards Yi Seo and wished the couple a happy life. After being the whistle blower, she did well in running her own pub and hired an attractive chef, something which comforts me."
1912,Itaewon Class,"Korean Drama is absolutely THE BEST. Every time I watch a new one I fall in love with the leading actress and many supporting ones...they're all SO DAMNED GOOD. If Seo-joon Park's role isn't best actor quality, I'll eat a gallon of hot habanero pepper kimchi. In the first episode I fell in love with Oh Soo Ah and by the end of the third one I hated her. In the first I hated Jo Yi Seo and by the end of the third I loved her. Each episode I keep saying to myself ""This is the best effing show ever."""
1913,Itaewon Class,At first I didn't understand what this was about and didn't watch because the clips were them just running. But I watched 1 episode and was hooked until 4am 2 days in a row. The acting is superb. The story everything is intense and dramatic. Very emotional series. Highly recommend.
1914,Itaewon Class,"I just can't get over this drama, it really is something special, a must watch for sure, it's so realistic, it made me laugh, cry and cheer for the characters, they really did a great job showing what's behind the actions of each character, so that people can understand better why they act like that.Also, the character of Yi-seo is so cute and a badass at the same time, totally loved her!"
1915,Itaewon Class,Watched six episodes so far and it is very intense! The acting is top notch by ALL of the actors and actresses. Get on Netflix sit down for a bit and watch some episodes its seriously worth your time!
1916,Itaewon Class,"I just finished the season on Netflix and WOW its amazing! I say goosbumps because the actors in this show NAIL the emotions they are showing. Its so dang intense! The ups and downs in the show are very very well done and the journey doesnt feel long enough. When it ends your like PLEASE another season! It does end with everything all tied up but I want another season just because the characters were so awesome and I want too see where they all are in the future of the show, if there was one. Definitely a must watch. If your reading this do it now start watching!"
1917,Itaewon Class,"I dont like drama too much talking
Poor girl, i mean ugly actress"
1918,Itaewon Class,"Here is a story abouta guy who dumped his girl for another new annoying girl.He wants to take revenge, but the girl who got dumped by him did all the legwork and toppled the bad guy."
1919,Itaewon Class,"From staring to ending is superb , in the mid of episodes some issues but at the end superb ending . Inspirational , Love and for startups . Main actor acting superb and also main actress."
1920,Itaewon Class,"Positive things in this kdrama is : the cast and the special acting skills that all charachter have , THE SUPER OST , i liked the romance between Park Sae-ro-y and Yi -seo
BUT there are some disadvantages that cannot be ommited such as some boring episodes ,The skipping forward years in the future prevented the characters from having any character development and it just didn't help the romance at all and I would prefer to dedicated more episodes to the main couple .."
1921,Itaewon Class,"Only on episode 10/16 but WHAT A SHOW! Only started watching because Tae-hyung (V) from BTs wrote a song for one of the episodes but now I'm hooked.
Coming of the back of Crash Landing on You, I didn't think anything else could be that good (my first K Drama that I'd watched from start to finish) but this is equally brilliant in different ways.
The Netflix trailer does not elude to the twists and turns, not the solid character of the lead. It has heart, laughs, suspense and twist in spades.
Don't let the subtitles put you off - this is a great story - MUST WATCH!"
1922,Itaewon Class,"I'm like obsessed with this drama.
Everything about it is just amazing.
It is very sad sometimes but it has comedy and romance too
You should definitely watch this"
1923,Itaewon Class,"Storyline: There are more than two love stories in this series and the love stories are really amazing and somehow relate to me. The characters played their role perfectly that I can feel the emotions by watching it. Interesting !Binge on watching: Yes, can watch more than one episode in one set time."
1924,Itaewon Class,"It starts off as a great show, middle episodes are also done very well but towards the last 3-4 episodes, the show gets too predictable. Seo Jun Park as Park Saeroyi has done such a brilliant job, I'm a huge fan now! The romance between Saeroyi and Yiseo was a bit forced I felt, he looked so perfect with Sooah. Yiseo got quite annoying towards the end. The grandmother being an investor was lame and cheesy to be honest. The last few episodes were quite poorly made. Overall, its a one time watch and will keep you hooked. Also, Park Bo Gum's cameo was oh so delightful!"
1925,Itaewon Class,"I can understand the bad reviews, with such a hyped series you would expect something more ""epic"" but beside the first two episodes, it was a pretty Nomral drama, nothing special or smart about, but the story did develop naturally (for me at least). Yi seo character was really refreshing to watch.
The premise was nice and the story could have gone better? Absolutely.
I personally would've preferred if he turned to be a gangster and have a business and playing it dirty with plans and money... Because he learned that life is unfair... To basically turn into an antagonist.
Over all... It's an okay drama but don't raise your expectations."
1926,Itaewon Class,"I just finished the last episode and I don't know what to do with myself.
This was so so good.
The acting, the story, the dialogue, the emotion.... absolutely outstanding.At first I was not happy with the main two female characters at all , but boy what a character development especially for Kim DaMi's character. This is the best female character I've seen in a korean drama. So uniquely badass....The rest of the cast was amazing, I loved the Tony character and the fact that the show addressed some tabu (for conservative Korea) topics ...Congrats to everyone involved in making this, i hope it wins big"
1927,Itaewon Class,"We have two hardworking business men at the focal point of this story. One of wholesome culture and the other of brutality on the way to the top.The overarching theme is great. However, I would like to say the main male character could have a little more depth. Yes, I understand his personality is written to be stoic but at some points he, for lack of a better description, seems autistic. This is fine of course, just weird as his character is sculpted to pure but his non-verbal dialogue is sometimes just 'off'."
1928,Itaewon Class,"Revolves about revenge that makes you so tired to finish the series .
0% chemistry for the lead actor PSJ and actress.
The end is so boring and forced.
Watch with caution.
Only die hard PSJ fans will like this."
1929,Itaewon Class,"Did not like that Sae-ro-yi ended up with Yi-seo, it should have been Soo-ah. The rating on IMDb had me excited to watch this series and the hype on Swoon had me hooked not to mention Park's acting in episode 1. So disappointed 😢"
1930,Itaewon Class,I can say this show is different than other Kdrama ..script & acting well played..everything on point ..last two episodes (13&14) were a bit disappointing and as a fan for the golden first 12 episodes I'm so sad ..I hope the finale will be great
1931,Itaewon Class,"Such exciting plot but fail to satisfy in the delivery. All characters one dimensional; No development In 15yrs except hair length for the ladies. So annoying to watch the episodes after the initial IC success. What a drag.
Someone just tell me the ending!"
1932,Itaewon Class,"In the guise of a stereotyped k-drama, a brilliant bitter sweet man in search of a much cold, rational and calculated revenge, became an anthem to strong passions, friendship and love that all can win."
1933,Itaewon Class,"I don't understand why people are so disappointed with this K-drama. This is probably one of my top 10 right now with good reason. It has an amazing plot and amazing characters. It's a light hearted but also dark series, and comedic but emotional. The ending was amazing. And the best part about it is that it doesn't try to hide behind the stereotypical and standardized South Korean culture, it goes all the way to show its flaws and goods, and it breaks so many stereotypes."
1934,Itaewon Class,"This is one of the shows where I never skipped a scene even for a second.. the entire cast starting from the leads to the negative ,did a great job indeed...you will never get bored in any scene as they are perfectly acted and expressed..loved the show .. moreover there is a sweet ending,a pleasant one and not a hectic one....it could be called a perfect show..."
1935,Itaewon Class,"As for story, it starts with the protagonist Park Saeroyi
fight with son of business tycoon, lost his father because of them and put behind the bars by manipulating evidence and there he comes with a plan to take his revenge by taking down there company. His plan covers a span of 15 years including his time in jail, deep fishing and other kinds of work , opening of his pub and lastly taking down his enemy's company. If I talk about some good points, they are good cast, character development to some extent and music. It highlights that one can use modern financial institutions to there gain while many other shows portray them in negative light. There are some problems also like the time span this show covers is 15 years and there are certain gaps in portraying them for instance, a time period of 7 years is skipped altogether and the narrative feels scattered. Also , the narrative is slow in the beginning but picks the pace from last three episodes, so one might feel it boring and difficult to adjust it later. Lastly, it does not address the mental problems of both the protagonists properly but that's the case with many dramas. To conclude, overall not a bad deal."
1936,Itaewon Class,"I know some people didn't like the ending but I really enjoyed this show. Yes they could have done the last few episode a little better but I loved the cast, the story, and the ost. I give it 9/10. This was based off of a webtoon so I am wondering if they kept the same storyline. Nonetheless, it was something original and different."
1937,Itaewon Class,"Its been a while since I write any review. I am writing a review for this drama just because this is so special drama.To be honest, I was ignoring this drama from last 3-4 months just because I thought this is just an average revenge drama but few days back I decided to give it a try.In the first episode, I realized that this is not just a average drama. It is way better than that. Seriously, This drama is so colorful and cheering.If I talk about all the actors then they all have done a excellent job and direction was also so great. This drama also gave some messages regarding transgenders and black people. We really should learn to respect everyone irrespective of their caste, sex, color or religion.Lead actor ""park seroyi"", I'm so impressed with this character. He remained calm and motivated every time and this inspired me alot.In short, Everybody should watch this drama. You will definitely like this for sure and also OST ""Start Over"" becomes one of my fav. song"
1938,Itaewon Class,"I came into this drama with high expectations that were not met. I think if I had watched this without knowing how good it was supposed to be I would've been fine, but a lot of the side characters were not great in their roles (imo) and they underutilized Park Seo joon. Although I enjoyed the acting for both Yi-seo and soo-ah, I did not believe that our main characters would like either of them. The chemistry fell flat all around the cast."
1939,Itaewon Class,"This drama took me by surprise. Its very different from what Ive seen before. It reminds me of Sky Castle. This show is a satire criticism of society & capitalism. It denounces current issues and taboos such as; social injustice, inequality, competition, racism, ex-convicts, stigma and prejudice, white collar crimes, etc. Its a realistic, down to earth serie that shows the struggles of youth escalating the social ladder. Though the serious theme, it is pleasant and comic to watch. Very touching & inspiring. Solid plot, strong dialogue, great acting and chemistry, and beautiful soundtrack.
Highly recommended"
1940,Itaewon Class,"The story is typical, but the characters weren't. Even though the storyline is not something new, the way it was crafted is very good. The actors also did a great job in making the series worth watching. It was all good until episode 15 came. There was this kidnapping scene and the need for the prince charming to rescue her princess which I don't really like. As for the episode 16, there's a lot of unnecessary long stares and talking which shouldn't have took place if it's really an urgent situation. They should have also escaped already the moment they saw Yi Seo, but they chattered and made a drama. I also think that the romantic relationship between Yi Seo and Saeroyi is a bit forced (my opinion only). They could have just sticked to the romcom theme."
1941,Itaewon Class,"I enjoyed this series quite a lot. I don't usually like k-dramas because the romance is extremely slow-burn and the drama is too over the top, like in telenovelas. What's different with this one is that the focus is not on the romance. It has a captivating story that will keep you wanting to see it through to the end.Sadly, some characters are very annoying and the events get a little too ridiculous in some of the last episodes, which almost made me lose interest... but, trust me, it's worth watching till the end just because the main conflict's resolution is very satisfying. It will not disappoint.As for the main cast, Park Sae Ro Yi comes off as strong and inspiring whenever he's in an important scene; the rest of the time, he could be replaced for a wooden plank and we wouldn't notice. Oh Soo Ah's motivations and feelings are confusing and Yi Seo can be really annoying at times. It looked like they tried to make us feel some empathy for Geun Won and I thought he would receive some character depth, but they completely ruin it in the end. All of my praise goes to Yoo Jae-Myung who made a great job as Jang Dae Hee, the main villain; ruthless and dignified but with clear motivations and foreseeable weaknesses. Without him, the series would have probably been a flop.I dropped a couple points because of the problems mentioned above, but the series has just enough jaw-dropping moments to make up for it and make it watchable. Plus, the OST was the best part of it. Ha Hyun Woo's voice is amazing, and his theme ""Diamond/Stone Block"" along with Gaho's ""Start Over"" are definitely going into my playlist. Worth a watch even if you don't like K-drama."
1942,Itaewon Class,I was thinking of rating it 8/9 initially. After 11th episode it started rotting and ended to just 2. Yo Soo Ah had done nothing wrong to be faltered by Sea Roi. It would have been finished way better with a Sea Roi- Soo Ah match!
1943,Itaewon Class,"Fussy ending but all over it good.Inn the end some the best roleplaying characters like soo ha, and jang dee deserve more relevant end. Lol jang dee gives a opportunity to get his enemy on his knees then soo ha his employee did something bad to him which she can also do little earlier but whatever because of her betrayal jang dee knees down front of park sae royi.. it seemed like kids playing with each other very easily done in the end where as during all storytelling time they just tried to do this but one betrayal make it easy in the end.And Yeah, It's just like trailer I'm not revealing the whole story so it's not a spoiler at all. So, how the things happened for thia you guys have to watch it..as I told storytelling is full of fun.Must watch you'll not get disappointed but don't expect the end accordingly.8 out of 10.Story based on ""On your Knees"" battle what a bussy...
BTW the storytelling is awesomely presented by jtbc.It has emotions, fun to watch, motivation, friendship, tri love story."
1944,Itaewon Class,"Itaewon class is best characterized as a feel-good series. The earlier episodes are emotionally powerful, the last three much weaker.
Many episodes look like a fashion show and product-placement is rife (unless everybody in Korea actually drives a Mercedes?).
Overall, very satisfying to watch this series, which, along with the Kingdom series and the Parasite movie, made me as a westerner a fan of Korean cinema and TV series."
1945,Itaewon Class,"Love!
Unlike all Korean dramas, it is not one of those cliché dramas. The character Jo Yi Seo was my favorite, she fights for what she wants and doesn't let anyone bring her down.
After seeing this series it seems that none more is good enough to see next."
1946,Itaewon Class,"I have watched so many korean dramas but this one is powerful, meaningful and tells a wonderful story of a father and son journey together and how through his father beliefs the son will overcome everything and go after the things he really wants in life or at least thinks he does.
The acting is so beautiful. The music behind scenes breaks your heart.
Loved every bit of it.
One more show to see go. Oh how hard it is.
a must watch!"
1947,Itaewon Class,"It was an amazing and bumpy experience. It became my favorite Kdrama since the very 3rd episode when Kim da-mi's character was introduced. A character like that could melt anyone's heart and she just nailed in every single episode. It's coming from a guy who is only fan of park see-jeon from Korea. Have never watched a Kdrama with as much enthusiasm and fun as I watched this one. Every single episode was like a bliss until they moved towards the end. I did like the ending though however they were few episodes in the middle where they went astray.Characters were really really good especially Kim da-mi's character was badass and blunt which you wouldn't see in any other show. This show covered the dark side of the korea they delivered racism and gender discrimination on the spot.Soundtracks were the best compared to any kdrama I've watched.Overall, highly recommend and take my word that you wouldn't regret it.
9/10"
1948,Itaewon Class,It's true definition of how to be true to your righteousness and still avenge.. Good. Good performances from lead pair..
1949,Itaewon Class,"The very first episode of IC did a good job to make me cry when Sae Ro Yi's Dad was tragically died. While, Sae Ro Yi truly loves his Dad and i can feel his loss, that's the point which I really admire Park Seo Joon's natural acting. Then, i watched more episodes, i really love to watch when Jo Yi Seo comes into Sae Ro Yi's life. Then, the more episodes i watched.. i feel like the plot is quite predictable for me somehow. So, that's why i give 8/10 here. I watched this drama till the end, and help me, I ship Sae Ro Yi and Jo Yi Seo at first but in the end i feel like Oh Soo Ah is not a bad girl to be paired up with Sae Ro Yi. So, in this drama, I think Oh Soo Ah is a character that make me curious to watch this drama till the end because of her turning point on episode 15. Overall, good job!"
1950,Itaewon Class,"The fact that this show disappointed me so much actually made sad. I loved the premise of this show, the plot was set up very nicely, making the first two episodes the best in the whole show. The actors all did an absolutely amazing job and I found all of them a perfect fit for their roles.However, after episode four, everything dragged on. The plot was becoming more and more slow and it took several episodes for actual progress to be made. Something else that bothered me as well was how questionable some of the characters were becoming. Jo yi-seo was a character I never grew to like mostly because of how easily she changed her mind when it came to serious issues. She was being transphobic to Hyeon yi and all of a sudden was super friendly to her just like that. Same thing happened with her racist behaviour towards Kim Toni. Oh Soo Ah was another character that bugged me a lot. Don't get me wrong, it's always a really good thing when our characters are actual humans, they're not meant to please us in a show, it's just with her I could never understand the way she acted.Overall it's an ok show, some people will probably love it, others will hate it. It just turned out very disappointing for me."
1951,Itaewon Class,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE The story until that annoying girl with short hair entered the story.. i mean the storyline is so good! The acting from everyone is so good!! But why oh why.. WHY do they have to create this annoying little selfish character who ended up with Park Saeroyi ???? I have to skip almost the whole ep 16 because I can not stand that girl. 1 star is for the good storyline jn the first couple of episodes ...but after that it was ruined by THAT TINY ANNOYING GIRL who use people and play with other people feelings
I hope they will make season 2 where Park Saeroyi and Oh Soo Ah actually ended up together."
1952,Itaewon Class,"I don't know what it is about this show but I can't stop watching it. I find myself thinking about certain scenes a lot even long after I watched it. It's just so good. And the soundtrack is amazing. My personal favourite is 'Someday, the boy'. This song is actually like amazing I had it on repeat for like weeks after I finished it. The storyline is so good and it's not even boring. It's a good mix of romance and drama. It also talks about a lot of social issues which I thought was really good. I would 100% recommend this show to anyone."
1953,Itaewon Class,"Cast and screenplay is too good! Unlike just love story on most successful series, this one have lot more components than that. Got addicted to this series in middle of my busy days!"
1954,Itaewon Class,Falling down heavy. Make saeroyi want revenge by pursuing success.. Assisted by a genius partner so that the target can be obtained.Love the background color in place but not too glittering give a beautiful impression is seen.
1955,Itaewon Class,"Loved this drama. Was impressed with newer actors Park Seo-Joon, as male lead, and Kim Da-Mi as female lead. I thought all the cast did a great job. Was interesting plot, demonstrating that in life you just don't 'fall down' but pick yourself up and move on. Park Seo-Joon has a particularly strong presence.
Has a positive message. Was intrigued.
The music was beautiful and am impressed at the music being used in dramas in general.
Was happy that at least the bad guys get punished which is often brushed off."
1956,Itaewon Class,A wonderful kdrama. In any aspect. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
1957,Itaewon Class,"Seems to be a requirement that Korean dramas have to be 16 episodes, which makes some shows meander with drawn out scenes, overuse of slo-mo, too many flashbacks and irrelevant stories lines. This program is a perfect example as it started strongly with an intriguing storyline and featured characters types absent from K-drams (including a transgender as well as an African-Korean). But it goes bonkers by Ep 14 with a poorly constructed time jump. By the 15th episode, It totally goes off the deep end to the point where you literally ask yourself why are you even watching.The love stories seem to lack any chemistry, but the core actors are quite competent. Kim Da-Mi and Lee Joo-Young truly standout."
1958,Itaewon Class,"PSJ was the reason for the success of this drama. You could put a bunch of actors in a room, but no one would have been able to portray his character (Park Saeroyi) like PSJ did himself. This drama was released at a time when Crash Landing on You (CLOY) was becoming one of the highest-rated shows of all times, and whilst this didn't quite compare to CLOY, it did however peak my interest in other ways. For example, the supporting cast involved characters from all different walks of life and is a good affirmation of that saying: ""never judge a book by its cover"". It highlighted discrimination, gender issues, corporate power/greed, and perserverance very well. There were some scenes which were a bit lacking and the chemistry b/w the lead actors could have been stronger, but overall this drama was well written and directed.Storyline -- started off great but then overly exaggerated towards the end with unncessary back and forth revenge acts, and in particular, Jo Yi-seo's character who was just annoying, irritating and difficult to watch
/ Acting -- great execution and compelling performances by Park Seo-joon in his portrayal as Park Saeroyi, and from Yoo Jae-myung who played Jang Dae-hee (CEO of Jangga Pub)
/ Characters -- I loved that each character came from all different walks of life and was determined to put up a fight regardless of societal standards and values
/ OST -- wasn't that big of a fan of the (pop rock) OST to be honest but maybe just a few song selections here and there"
1959,Itaewon Class,"The start was good-ish: the usual; a bad guy messes up with the lead and the revenge plot begins.But what carried the story was its execution. I had expected it to be dragged like most of the other 16 episodes (1+ hour) kdramas. But it did very well in the pace department.The characters were lovable. We weren't shown a crew having exceptionally nice and caring and understanding characters. They developed into that, and still retained the part of their personality. Each of them was different and had so much to contribute to the story.The annoying thing about the show? HOW COME EVERYBODY MEET THE REQUIRED PERSON WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE? I'm sure Seoul is a big city with not just one or two streets and a building. I live in a relatively smaller city and have been living for TEN years. I've been to school, college AND university here. I know tonnes of people! How come I never see anyone I need?These co-incidental meetings and male lead dropping everywhere he's needed is one of the tropes Kdramas now need to give up now.The MOST redeeming thing about the show? MY DESIRED SHIP SAILED. YAS PEOPLE! IT SAILED! Though I wish they'd shown more moments between the two, especially flashbacks from the 4 years that were skipped. Something, just anything to make us cheer for them more. But no matter, I'M JUST SO HAPPY THEY GOT TOGETHER!"
1960,Itaewon Class,Only 4 episodes out. I watched em all and it's been amazing. It's a show I look forward to watching every weekend . It's one of the best K-Drama I have watched for sure.
1961,Itaewon Class,"I was disappointed by the love story. Other than that really a brilliant show with great characters, amazing acting skills and a very entertaining storyline!"
1962,Itaewon Class,"This show is a marketing man's dream. The cast change clothes for every episode and in some cases, for every scene. Jewelry, is heavily featured with the ladies modelling an amazing variety of earrings.. In one scene the camera suddenly switches from the faces of two protagonists, to someone's hand for a few seconds just to show a nice flashy watch.
The main character is a bit of a moron, mostly seen staring into space, with dialogue that includes many many uses of the morons' mantra ""What?""
Kim Da Mi steals the show with a charismatic performance, in spite of some of the more ridiculous outfits she has to wear."
1963,Itaewon Class,"I have seen better Kdramas than this. I skipped so many episodes but still knew what's going on... I have no idea how it got this much of rating. Well
I think it's good for the people who are new to kdramas."
1964,Itaewon Class,"Itaewon class Successfully presented a story rich in moral messages. This Korean drama is very different from dramas mostly because of the storyline What is presented is very strong and full of suspense in every episode. Itaewon class Talk about the meaning of life, business, and self-esteem. This drama Not to be missed because of its very valuable value."
1965,Itaewon Class,"Good acting, decent plot.
Too many flashbacks, the series could have ended in 12 episodes or less."
1966,Itaewon Class,Korean Drama never disappoints you. Through out the drama was interesting but the ending the hard and difficult part for each story and Korean knows how to wrap a good story. I am from Pakistan and Pakistani dramas are also good but become Korean Drama fan too.
1967,Itaewon Class,"I initially put off watching this, but am so glad I finally did! I loved this all the way through! Kim Da Mi and Ahn Bo Hyun were both brilliant in their roles! This is the best work I've seen yet from Park Seo Jun... I also loved Ryu Kyung Soo and Lee Joo Young... The actors were excellent, the story was interesting, the ost perfection! Do not miss this one!"
1968,Itaewon Class,Though it was a basic story but I felt they kept on stretching the same old thing.
1969,Itaewon Class,"This series deserves a higher rating. While some reviews mention cliche's, or unneeded filler material here or there I just don't view it that way. 16 hour+ episodes are bound to contain some basis for criticism, particularly for the hypercritical. I'm a relative newcomer to Korean dramas, but I was lucky enough to stumble across first My Mister (IMDB rating 9.1) and then in short order this Itaewon Class. My Mister was the best drama I've ever seen anywhere and Itaewon Class is just as good. Both were for me inspiring and very emotionally engaging, where the world and the characters depicted seemed real, and was sad to have to eventually leave it all behind. The writing and the acting In Itaewon Class is so good I find myself rewatching scenes and choking up. Take as an example a climactic scene involving a cooking contest. Ha-ha, doesn't sound like much? It was actually brilliant writing.I particularly loved the female lead Jo Yi Seo (Kim Da-Mi, whose acting is so good I just can't do it justice here) - such an original, indomitable, smart and savvy character, and that's what made her sudden helpless attraction and devotion to Sae Ro Yi so touching and impressive. While it was a bit unbelievable how long it took Sae Ro Yi to reciprocate (16 episodes), it seemed believable that when it happened, it hit him like the proverbial ton of bricks. I loved that.The writing, direction and the acting in this series are absolutely top notch. It's a bit disparaging to lump it into a ""KDrama"" category, as if it's all a bunch of predictable tropes, or derivative based on the real (Hollywood) thing. These dramas are originals, depicting the best and the worst within their own culture. Given the element of conservative Korean values that are typically depicted; family, hard work, loyalty, etc, these dramas have a definite resonance I can't find elsewhere."
1970,Itaewon Class,It's a must watch kdrama. Don't listen to haters. Haters gonna hate. It's a classic. Perfect in every aspect. It's a complete package. All the characters are written very well. My favourite characters are park saeroyi and of course the evil angel Jo ye seo.
1971,Itaewon Class,"My headline says it all.. the story started really great, but it lost its charm during mid series.. the love story is boring, I can't stand Yi Seo character, her personality is so ugly. How can someone so rude attact the heart of someone so considerate?The main character is also boring, I never see him solve anything in particular based on his thinking.. every problem just easily solved out of sudden.The only great character is Soo Ah, I love how strong she is despite everything she's been through. She might a little bit selfish for her own sake, but she never betray Saeroyi."
1972,Itaewon Class,"This drama had a strong plot at the beginning of the episodes. but when going to ending becomes unappealing and predictable. Especially the SRY & YS love story, their story ruined my mood. When they started together, I started to think that this story actually didn't need love story. I skipped many scenes of them, because I don't feel any spark at all. I mean, the story about revenge itself was great without the love story between two of them. its confusing, bcs I wanna see Jangga fall but don't wanna see them together.Actually, I can feel that this is the most ambitious drama that I ever watched. I can feel how ambitiously this drama want to be different, tried to be cool, gave surprising plot but can't goes without coincidence HAHHAHA."
1973,Itaewon Class,This drama just took away my heart. Literally inspired me so much. Few perspectives towards my life changed after watching Itaewon Class. Highly recommend it. It was amazing.
1974,Itaewon Class,"I finished the entire drama, so I guess it's not too bad but it's definitely overrated. I like the way how this drama touched the current social issues like racial discrimination and LGBT. However, I waited for something special until the end and didn't find any. PSJ's character doesn't have anything special (except for his determination & kindness towards his staff), other than than, he doesn't have what it takes to be super successful. I don't understand how he managed to beat a multi national company when he doesn't know about business ( no development from beginning til the end) and with his recipe which I didn't find special. You can also skip some episodes and still understand the entire story. PsJ acting is good but he doesn't have to scream every time. :) I feel like he can use different techniques to express his anger. The ending was so unrealistic as well. Anyway, I'm glad I finished it, but this is not one of those dramas I'd want to rewatch one day."
1975,Itaewon Class,Episode 1 and 2 were really great!... now im on episode 6... 🙂
1976,Itaewon Class,Disastrous ending for an Amazing start is all i cam say about this drama. Not worth watching.
1977,Itaewon Class,"This show was really good i'd say for the first ten episodes, even up until the episode where they won the cooking show. The show then started to go south when it went from that to 4 years later, it got predictable and the storyline felt old and re-used. It had been 4 years yet they were still talking about the same issues, especially the love triangle with the boss. Episode 15 in particular was a snooze fest showing flashback after flashback and too much scenes of him in heaven with his dad. Overall, i'd still give this a 7 because the ending episode wasn't bad and i was highly entertained especially at the start and middle portions of the show, i also like the values and beliefs they were showing such as discrimination and sticking to one's principles."
1978,Itaewon Class,Never regret to watch. These movie was my first Korean Series. Fallin in love at the first sight. Perfect series!
1979,Itaewon Class,This k-drama is gripping and touching. The performances of the four lead actors are excellent. Park Seo-Joon is magnetic and he effortlessly expresses a wide-array of emotions. Kim Da-Mi is totally convincing in her role. Highly recommended.
1980,Itaewon Class,"This drama was too good for me when it was started after episodes going it failed to create the same excitement where it created in the start of the show
The climax disappointed me... It ruined the whole show"
1981,Itaewon Class,"The ending was so bad
The worst kdrama i that watched ever"
1982,Itaewon Class,"The ending is so bad
Only the few 5ep were great but after them its boring after 10ep its trash
So if u didnt watch it yet i reccomend to dont watch it"
1983,Itaewon Class,"Our whole family loved it, 3 adults. Great story, actors. I must admit this may be the best television series I've ever seen. Cannot remember a show I've enjoyed more, and I've seen a lot!"
1984,Itaewon Class,"It made me think how I want to live my life
Character arcs were amazing
Park seroyi- his will and determination to not to be defined my his past or others
Jo yi seo- her confidence that's he can have both love and success and then putting in the work and patience for it
Oh soo ah- kinda like Snape in Harry Potter, I didn't liked her but last episode explained everything
Jang geun won- a villan, a victim who again chose to be the villian
Jang geun soo- a teenage boy without guidance
One other great thing was this drama won't feel you wondering what happened to that guy .. they gave proper ending to each character and relationship
Haters might be saying they don't get the shift of love story or decisions by geun won but I would like to point out the effect of time (years) on characters
Bonus point is it's great ost .. especially sweet night by V hits home."
1985,Itaewon Class,"Sad, it came to an end but Saeroyi and Yi-seo got together and achieved their goals. Everything fell into its places. After all those hardships, it got paid."
1986,Itaewon Class,One of the best character development done on TV. A drama that hits different with an engaging and satisfying plot. Awesome characters that you'll absolutely love.
1987,Itaewon Class,It's a very well written story. The characters are so strong especially Saeroyi. The ending is so happy and beautiful. I loved it.
1988,Itaewon Class,It could have been a much better ending. Saeroyi should have ended up with soo-ah
1989,Itaewon Class,"This drama makes ur heart pumped on every episode! PSJ is really perfect for the role I can feel his emotion through the screen
It's different from ur usual kdrama, and I promise u'll be hooked!"
1990,Itaewon Class,"An excellent drama where the main theme is revenge & I'm a big fan of Korean revenge films. Having lived in South Korea for a year, I know Koreans are a proud nation, and knowing their history it's understandable. Korean actors never seem to ""phone in"" their performances; they give it 110%, no matter the importance of their role.This is my third K-drama & I've noticed writers like to add a ""twist"" to the story to throw off viewers. I do understand some suspension of belief must be held in this fictional world, but I do like intelligent writing that does not insult the viewer. And most of the writing in this drama is intelligent, but I couldn't fathom how the male lead (Park Saeroyi) fell in love with his manager (Jo Yi Seo). First, she's much younger. Second, she's plain looking even with tons of make-up. Finally, and most importantly, she doesn't have a winning personality that would enhance for her looks; she's actually a complete brat. I love how in the final episode, in a tense life or death situation, she runs away like a coward brat and leaves Chairman Yang's youngest son to fend for himself. He had deep feelings about her during the whole series, unlike her boss (Park Saeroyi), who showed NO like/love interest in her until near the end of the series.To be fair, Park Saeroyi is somewhat of one note (but extremely focused), ""no-game"" dude who still hadn't kissed a girl by 34 years old.........weak! But throughout most of the series it's obvious who he has deep feelings for......his middle school crush (Oh Soo Ah). He even stated in episode 2 he likes her because she's ""very pretty"". And she is fine. So fine, that him and the Chairman Jang's oldest, rich son have the hots for her. But she is more than just a pretty face. She's intelligent, successful & driven and deeply cares about Park Saeroyi. Yes, she is a little shallow, but given her characters background it is somewhat understandable. She was abandoned by her mother to an orphanage. Nobody loved her, and she despised any pity thrown her way. Considering this scarred background, she turned out well. And she is NOT an irritating brat. The Jo Yi Seo character comes across as a nutty stalker type that will profess her love for you for many years, and will kill your pets & slash your tires if you dare go for another woman.The writers got too cute. They should have written the series as more of an obvious love match. Have Saeroyi & Oh Soo Ah be together at the end & have Jo Yi Seo slowly fall for the younger son of Chairman Yang. He was a good-looking kid & had positive traits. The reason his character changed and became more like his sinister, but smart, father was Jo Yi Seo drove him in that direction. Actually, I'm not sure what his character saw in the Jo Yi Seo character. But I guess you must put aside all realistic plotlines in the fiction world of K-drama."
1991,Itaewon Class,"Everything in this drama was just sooo good, the songs, the friendship and also the relationship was pretty good! It was most focused on their friendship but the story as well was really good! I need more korean drama's like this !"
1992,Itaewon Class,"I really wanted to like this drama but I come away feeling oddly disappointed.In what I assume is netflix's influence shining through, themes such as racism and bigotry towards the LGBTQ community are touched upon and mostly with a deft hand. A welcome change compared to the conservative ""normal"" dramas.Yet there are just so many flaws. I am glad that at several points during this show, it gets mentioned that if you get the basics right, you will succeed. Well, let's examine where Itaewon Class didn't get their basics right then.The first few episodes are great, set up the premise perfectly, make you interested and empathetic with the main characters. Sadly, starting in the middle and especially towards the end, this drama squanders all this hope and becomes a repetitive, boring revenge plot, sacrificing the emotional stakes and relationships.What is also to be lamented is the fact that Yi-seo somehow manages to be even more unlikable than Soo-ah and that is saying something. I get subverting the genre staple of having a childhood connection/ soulmate vibe/ meant to be love story and I am all here for that. But Yi-seo is so terrible from the get-go and don't even get me started on kissing/ caressing a sleeping character who has repeatedly stated he has zero interest in you romantically. That is just gag inducing.Now Soo-ah, I was intrigued by her character in the beginning. But it just does not make sense. Her ""excuse"" for dedicating her entire life to a man and a company that killed her only father figure, covered it up and had someone she considered at least a friend pay for it: ""I am not like you, I am not brave"". Huh, well then. She is smart and pretty, and Mr. Park paid her tuition, yet instead of going to university and finding a job, she ""HAS"" to work for Jang Dae-hee/ Jangga? Yeah, sorry as far as character motivation goes, that one makes no sense to me.
Also pray tell what is that nonsense that is supposed to be her relationship with Sae-ro-yi? She seems to genuinely be conflicted but how does she have any loyalty towards Jangga? make it make sense! Also it is beyond any stretch of the imagination that two people somehow are single without any ANY dating or even any interest in doing so for 20 years. Like what even... Why bother making the viewer care for their relationship? I don't even know how many episodes I spent waiting for her to come to her senses, quit Jangga and go over to Sae-ro-yi to tell him she had been an idiot all these years, loves him etc... Instead I had to watch Yi-seo stalk him and basically assault him for episode after epsiode.For the record, I stopped watching around episode 14, I just couldn't take it anymore, it started to feel like work, getting through the episodes.I am glad I watched other dramas Park Seo-joon did before this one, because I would not be interested in watching anything with him based solely on Itaewon Class. Not sure who is to blame here, but his acting is convincing and heartbreaking in the first few (2) episodes and then he becomes this mostly expressionless, boring character for almost the entire show. I guess there isn't all that much you can do when the character is what it is.So yeah, disappointed in this show that could have been so much more. Would not recommend."
1993,Itaewon Class,"It is indeed one of the best dramas. It has so many mixed emotions and strong characterizations. This story will inspire everyone to be optimistic and try hard during tough times. Direction and story write up, dialogues and screen play are excellent. Extra points go to background music and ofcourse the actors!!"
1994,Itaewon Class,"I wanted to like this show, I did. The plot is good, but it lacked character development. Also I simply couldn't stand Yi Seo. This is not my kind of Kdrama."
1995,Itaewon Class,"This Kdrama is unlike other Kdramas which don't have a good storyline but are filled with romance. This show is unique in that it doesn't revolve around romance, it will still keep you hooked with just it's great storyline, plot, twists & great passionate acting of protagonists. While the story unfolds we as audience learn very valuable life lessons so it is a very teachable series. The lack of romance doesn't mean lack of love because it depicts a very unique selfless, pure, unconditional & passionate kind of love which is not limited by romance. Love so true that a person is willing to bet their life on it on one side, while for someone it takes years to develop instead of love at first sight. It also tells us that love at first sight or first love is overrated while true love is the one that grows stronger with time by overcoming hardships together through years. This show also stands out in showing good range of diversity & unique characters - Hero with great principles, badass sociopath girl, ex convicts, transgender, good guy turned bad, half black half Korean guy, career driven modern day woman, nerd, bully, evil businessman. Overall- it's a must watch Kdrama."
1996,Itaewon Class,"The first 2 episodes are heartwarming. The rest are just dragging... aside from the revenge plot, it's supposed to be a food drama. How the hell did they became top food company in korea without even showing what food exactly they cook, how these food be at par with Janga Co? and i actually find the leading man not a business man material at all. He's just good when it comes to to talking but the whole effort was on the part of the girl. the lovestory is also awful,no spark at all.. i just think he needs the girl to keep the company successful thus he decided to love her 😅😅😅"
1997,Itaewon Class,Not your regular love story which is why i loved watching Itaewon Class so much. I loved Yi-seo's character so much and Park Seo Jun is always my favourite!
1998,Itaewon Class,"Fantastic one really so good 😊, Itewon class is unpredictable story and it is one of the finest drama"
1999,Itaewon Class,I did like this in the beginning but towards the end It got so predictable! I watched this the same time as It's okay not to be okay and I prefer this drama more! Overall Itaewon was good! Not sure what the hype was about!
2000,Itaewon Class,"This drama make me feel that I should find my goal and fight for it until I change my repetitive days to excited days full of success and happiness.I like Yi seo personality and self esteem and also Park Sae ro yi kindness ,patient, resistance for his goal.
I really enjoy it thanks to all the cast and scriptwriter'"
2001,Itaewon Class,"The best K-Drama I've watched thus far. What I particularly like about it is that it tells a story of how a person's value affect his interaction with the world, with both favourable and unfavourable outcomes, and how he influences the people around him. It pays great attention to the development of not only the lead but also supporting characters, which make the drama more alive and realistic. It's these subtle details that bring the story to a deeper level, giving it more substance.Many movie/drama that I watched before pay more attention to plot. But Itaewon Class carves more details on the characters. It's the characters' attitude and value that lead them to the events/things, making its plot well crafted.Needless to say, the art direction, cinematography and acting are all good. Overall, highly recommended."
2002,Itaewon Class,"This is one of those rare gems in kdrama series that really does have it all - amazing script, on par acting, beautiful cinematography and directing and overall great production value. This is Kdrama at it's best that's for sure.Whilst it encapsulates the theme of love it's not strictly about that, it's about one's personal strength in the face of adversity, revenge, social and personal justice paired with a generous slice of life.A beautiful, compelling and surprising series, sure to keep you thinking about it long after watching."
2003,Itaewon Class,"The series started with great character introduction and it continued for the next episodes. The Acting, Writing, Most importantly the OST was brilliant for this drama till Ep.12 and Then The writers decided to pull Game of thrones. The Ending was so bad that I cursed myself for liking this drama. Most cringe things happen from time to time you will start hating the drama. So, I guess this deserves all the hype and positive reviews for the first 12 eps and the writers made a fool out of the viewers by giving one of the worst endings."
2004,Itaewon Class,"The beginning was really good. Ending was really bad. Just link a good linkbait article. It will get you hooked in the start but turns out it's poor story at the end.Ending -
1. Wins a fistfight with gangster boss
2. He gets his revenge against janga co chairman.
3. He falls in love with the bratty manager."
2005,Itaewon Class,Every episode made you watch and longing to watch the next episode. Like you want to know what's going yo happen next. All actor and actress are soo good in their acting!! I felt bad from the beginning of the story to the middle and the most especially the ending. I love it!!
2006,Itaewon Class,"Let's go through a general and very long critique of the series.(I think it will be the longest and most detailed review in the history of the site!)Well, first we examine the problems that people reapet and then a general reveiw.
The common drawbacks are:
1. There is no personality such park sae ro yi.
2. Why didn't the sae ro yi's hairstyle change after 11 years?
3. Why get out of the car at the end of episode 14 and worse, hug each other?
4. It was a cliché hostage!
5. How did Hyun Yi become a chef?((Because these questions are very repetitive, I would like to explain my point of view in detail))1.
For example, do zombies really exist? (Kingdom 2019)
Is Gandalf in the real world? (Lord of the Rings 2001)
Do people die in reality, do they steal in their sleep, or is the food of the whole world corn? (Inception 2010 -interstellar 2015)
We have rome of Subconsciously dreams? (Stalker 1979)
In fact, can humans go back to 1700 or 1500?
(Midnight in Paris 2013)
Does in our planet We have a fish that become a monster that breathes out of sea?
(The Host 2006)Well, these are some of the most famous and highest level productions, and popular directors like Christopher Nolan, great directors like Bong Joon Ho and Woody Allen, and directors who are among the top two or three in history like Andrei tarkovsky.Surely you are saying that all of them are fantasy or science fiction, but the Itaewon class is a drama and realistic, so it doesn't suit him.Well, I have to say that we have a style that a combination of fantasy and realism is called magical realism!
But... This series is not magical realism at all!
I just wanted to say that there is such a style, and for example, kill me heal me has such a genre, that is, in the real world, with real rules, but a couple of motifes are unrealistic in it.Now that itaewon class is not magical realism, then how is it realistic ?!So is there a guarantee that there will be no person like sae ro yi in the world?
No, we don't have the Innocent people, but we do have the people that have a little negative morals and the park sae ro yi were the same.2. Well, when do people's hairstyles change when they change themselves; For example, in classic movies, whenever women cut their hair short, it means that they are tough and their personality getting cold.
Well, we see that from the beginning, the sae ro yi and Jang Deh-hee do not change, but the others change to accompany them.
For example, yi seo, which could not be changed at all, she changed because of the sae ro yi, but on the other hand soo ah, she did not change, and their destiny became that.
(You may say why the sae ro yi should not be changed and turned upside down. First of all, this could be the opposite and it could have been the opposite. Now it doesn't matter, but let's calculate that the sae ro yi was a symbol of good behavior. ...)
Or Jang Deh Hee didn't change and his son became like him to be with him.3. So tell me, what difference does it make if the car is looking for a car or a person?
You just saw that sae ro yi made Jang Gion Won's car have to go a long way and he had a plan and the time to buy... You say why they hugged each other in that sensitive moment... Well, we knew that this is just a drama, but In fact, they are close to death and sae ro yi probably want to say something that has been in his heart for a long time , and his feelings become uncontrollable, and... Incidentally, this scene, which we think is stupid, is like a real person. Foolish moment!4. First of all, tell me what is your favorite series?
If you want to try to say Kdrama's avangard, you probably say, ""My Ajusshi or Mr. Sunshine its probably the answer of 80%. ""
Do you want me to tell these clichés?
Stereotypes are not a negative in themselves; How long did it take for the hostage-taking to end?
Maybe half a episode.
Well, no matter how much you write a new product, there are similarities with something and somewhere.5. Well in ep 4:
You see, when yi seo want to show her abilities to be hired, she turns to park sae ro yi and says:
What kind of food is your specialty?
we carefully came up with every recipe, but we dont realy have a specialty.The camera in the fridge or freezer or whatever, Hyun yo and yi sro in front of the fridge.
Hyun Yi: i organized it yesterday. Its all clean.
Yi seo: we dont need many things on the menu.
Jusy have one specialty and use two or three overlapping ongredients to keep losses to a minimum.
.
.
.
Well, you see, now it makes more sense that Hyun Yi has succeeded with repetition and effort because they have limited their list.This is from this.What else can I tell you?The Park Seo Joon, Kim Da Mi, Nara, Yo Jae Myung, Anh Bo Hyun , are all currently running in Baeksang.
I mean, the whole series is almost nominated, and we have to see what happens.
Do I need to tell you more about acting?The director of the series has been nominated, but since it is difficult for you to understand the difference between a good director and others:See the first part of ep 4 the conversation between the sae ro yi and Gion Won. First, Gion Won comes with pride to make fun of the sae ro yi but...So director how show me sae ro yi's Self Confidence and geon won's stress with camera?
Exactly at the end of episode 15, when he kneels ; It slows motion and keeps that beautiful movement going, and more importantly, the camera slowly goes to sae ro yi, and somehow admires it by going to it and approaching it!End of episode 11
How effective was the silence we saw at the time of the confession?
Tell more about the script and its details?
The fact that he puts Yi Seo and Soo ah in the cafe in front of each other and marks.Sae ro yi open up his heart to yi seo in ep4...
Why did he tell yi seo what he didn't do to soo ah all the time?
Becuase he feel comfortable around her.
Should I talk about music?Music?
You mean, like, all these records aren't enough for gaho and v?
It's okay to serve you. I have to say that at the Baeksabg Festival, they have a special technical awards , and the Itaewonclass is nominated for its music.
Basically, you go and listen to the itaewon class from the album of soundtrackthe whole series will be reviewed for you.We have how many marking and motif like ""how does it taste?""
How many times have you seen such a beautiful motif in Kdrama before?Well, I typed for about 30 minutes, I think that's enough.I have nothing more to say; Of course probably !!!"
2007,Itaewon Class,"Awe-some kdrama. I laughed & cried. This show has a bit of everything, I would recommend it to everyone."
2008,Itaewon Class,"This is best korean series since reply 1988.
The dircting... the lighting and soundtracks!
Everything in drama have marking in first episodes and you cant tell they change the story suddenly!
If you didnt noticed the motifs you need to a rewatch."
2009,Itaewon Class,This is by far the best drama I've watched so far this year. Great performance by the leads!
2010,Itaewon Class,"I've watched thousands of K-drama since I was a kid.
This K-drama is phenomenal, I don't think I've seen so many GREAT actors in one show. Their emotions and rationality, the message, everything was perfect. Describing how amazing this show was is ineffable. This is unlike any K-drama with whirlpool of misunderstandings-this touches reality. Many messages and significance with Korean culture was depicted as well!
Try it for yourself."
2011,Itaewon Class,Good start but the ending is very boring there are so many best Kdrama's this is not worth it. Poor story I started to skip in the later part of the episode and still was able to guess what happens next. The bad guy and both the leading lady is good rest all are average...not worth your time and don't get fooled by the high rating.
2012,Itaewon Class,"Have you ever wondered if Korean drama could ever have a diverse plot or romance that you didn't expect. Believe it or not this is the best drama I've seen. I've watched exactly a hundred and twenty six Korean dramas, yeah I keep records. But this, this is a master piece. It even converted half of my classmates to start watching Korean drama as a whole. This is truly worth it. It's supposed to be the highest rated Korean drama. It also portrays how the contemporary Korean society is with tourists, other races, racism, and not-every-main-lead-is-a-'chaebol'(rich ass). In most k-drama, they act as though other tourists don't come to Korea or so , that is so unreal. Just watch it abeg."
2013,Itaewon Class,"Without a doubt storyline is fabulous , terrific acting by the cast but i have issues with part of the romance part. because the manager should have not becomed the main heroin as she is not that pretty looking and she dosnot deserve to become girlfriend of the hero.
if the the hero would have ended up with his childhood crush it would have been much better series . and as for the manager she could have ended up with jang Geun-soo because i felt bad for him as he loved the manager till the last and only thing he got from her is just a hug and i also felt bad for Oh Soo-ah as she used liked the hero a lot but that  manager boke them apart. otherwise it could be watched as it has a great story line"
2014,Itaewon Class,"Even though the characters are very unrealistic and out of this world and pissing you off while watching but the storyline and how the scenes and plots put together still make you addicted ans satisfy, very interesting drama and i like it, unlike any other kdrama, it is new and fun to watch. 10/10. The lead male character's acting is very convincing and impressive."
2015,Itaewon Class,"This drama doesn't only have solid acting from top notch actors/actresses and a strong script, it also covers the institutional and socioeconomic problems of South Korea such life after prison, the discrimination, sexuality, and corruption. This show is a pioneer. I don't know why some people will dislike this show other than personal agendas."
2016,Itaewon Class,"Loved this show so so much. I've seen many kdramas, but this was truly at the top of its game. Loved the principles and beliefs behind the show. All the characters were so rich and thought through. It's a show really worth watching!"
2017,Itaewon Class,This drama shows that we can never give up from our dream. Its show even the world want you down if you believe what you believe just stand up and chase it. Many lesson you can get from this drama.
2018,Itaewon Class,"This is one of my all-time favorites. Each episode is strong, until the very end. Each relationship between every main character is unique and beautifully developed. The acting is superb, from each and every one of the cast. The story is as much exciting as it is sweet and heartbreaking. Some reviewers say that the episodes get weaker by the end: That's just wrong. In fact, it's the opposite. The pace goes up a lot after the last time-skip. It's a perfect timing as, by then, all the relationships are at their beats/peaks, which is when it's time to focus on the actual premise of the series.The only thing I would have loved is if they took some more episodes to get this over with. It felt a tiny bit rushed by the end, for a show that would have totally deserved 18-20 episodes unlike some of the other more lengthy kdramas. But that's not a reason at all to skip this one. It's a kdrama through and through and easily deserves a 8+ rating for what it is and for what it is meant to be. You won't be disappointed."
2019,Itaewon Class,"I watched the series in a span of 4 days, and completed it yesterday.
The series is OK, above average than any other Korean Series I watched.Acting-wise, the lead casts did well.PSJ + the 2 girls were great, and I am OK with the outcome. His staff and their backstories and character developments were good.Chairman Jang was very effective. His eldest son is also effective. Their faces are really annoying, suited for villain roles. Kim Dong Hee, the younger son - protagonist turned villain, is just good in the start when he was a good guy. He is bad as a villain, but maybe the script requires him to remain a good boy with bad intentions, or kind-looking with bad agenda-style. He did well in Extra-curricular, though, but his acting as a villain did not help the show at all.The start is intense. I agree with others that it gets dragging at some point plus a lot of flashbacks and unnecessary conversations. I think each episode could have been 10-15 mins less.I also observe some flaws typical of drama series - why did she do this/that, how come this and that... etc. I used to this kind of flaws so it is just 'something to laugh' to me.Rewatch value if this show is high for me. Would recommend this also to others."
2020,Itaewon Class,Good but not great story..too long and a little bit lost on character development. But still nice to watch.
2021,Itaewon Class,"I don't know why so many people criticize the ending I think their problem is with the beauty of the main actress.In my point of view they have given the best ending further it's a really great drama with an absolutely unique plot .This is better even more than ""the king"" though it has more ratings.The plot was amazing & each & every character has done a great job.please don't watch it if you need to see only typical romance thing.It's a must watch if you need to watch something unpredictable inspiring & lovely.I already added it to my best KDRAMA list."
2022,Itaewon Class,"Initially the show starts strong with a great cast from different spectrums of life. The first few episodes are very emotional and till episode 12 its alright....13 and 14 gets little dragged on...but last 2 episodes are pretty good...i enjoyed it....what i loved the most about it is that it tries to bring different types of individuals together from all walks of lives, it kind of gives a lesson to how we should be tolerant and accepting of every individuals in the society....loved it!!❤"
2023,Itaewon Class,"I was skeptical but once I started it, I fell in love with this Kdrama. It single handedly addressed so many social dogma as autocratic system, racism in Korea, blending of transgenders and social barriers etc.
What I loved the most was that every character is an oddball including antagonists. They are not just black and white but contain their own humanity.
It's not those romantic comedies, and it's about sturggle and practical issues of life.
Highly recommended."
2024,Itaewon Class,"The most beautiful drama I have seen in my life, it is incredibly perfect in acting, directing and events. It is the best"
2025,Itaewon Class,"Enjoyed the story line and message and appreciated all the characters, except Yi-seo. YI-seo was not a good person and did not see how sae-ro-yi would connect with her. There was no realistic match there. Whether the director choose to portray Yi-seo's character that way or the actress did, it was a terrible decision. I almost stopped watching just because she was so awful as a person."
2026,Itaewon Class,"Got up to episode 7 and ended up bailing.Acting is okay, but a lot of long awkward silences.Couldn't really understand Saeroyi's undying loyalty to Soo-ah, especially because she treats him like an afterthought most of the time."
2027,Itaewon Class,"The show starts very strong. Then after 7 or 8 episodes I lost my interest. Why? Story drags on and on. You can skip and skip and still knows what is going on. Cliche and predictable plots. And I kinda expect more story on how the protagonist develops his business (my fault). Turn out they are more focus on his revenge, and the business parts are lost in those skipped years. Lastly, cheesy romance."
2028,Itaewon Class,Can't shake the feeling of a comic coming to life. Each screen is beautifully framed and brought to life..
2029,Itaewon Class,"Few other excellent reviews have commented the same and I am here to reiterate the views.The acting is good but the plot is very weak, there is no character development at all. Throughout the story it feels like the board was set from the beginning for the protagonist's success.We totally skip the part where the Hero did in full control try to commit murder, although punished for it. The story made it out so that it was the villian who put him in prison. Did the villain try to cover up the hit and run, yes he did but he didn't cause the car accident in the first place.I would have loved to see the hero make the choices which actually led him to success rather than just shouting at other to be righteous all the time.I would have loved to see him struggle to wake up and still go to work, handle customers who didn't behave well, actually fire an employee who wasn't able to grow up in the end(because not everyone can actually step up)"
2030,Itaewon Class,"At first, for like 12 episodes it's really entertaining to watch and interesting. but the last ~4 episodes feel a bit rushed. also it can be cheesy sometimes and other times awkward.the first episode showed great promise, it has a 10 from me, but the rest of the show is not as good, and it feels like the time jumps are forced.anyway, it's not a complete waste of time."
2031,Itaewon Class,"The story started off strong, and kept me hooked till episode 10, after that the plot was ruined altogether. The Genre says : Drama, Romance...however, there was no actual romance. The character development was very poor, almost all characters were unlikeable, Kwon Nara's acting was impeccable, no doubt about at. After episode 10, the drama was unbearable, honestly the story could have been better. The ending didn't do justice to the show."
2032,Itaewon Class,"Pretty decent show end to end, got draggy towards the end. The material was good for 13 episodes, but because they needed to stretch it out to 16 episodes, the last few episodes were filled with long drawn out unnecessary scenes.Addressed issues such as mental health, the trans community, foreigners in Korea etc, and the prejudices these different groups of people face.Almost every character was substantially developed, except for one of the main characters, Yi Seo. Which was a huge pitfall for the entire show. She, remained childish, entitled, unforgiving even till the end. EVERY OTHER main/supporting character showed development. Be it in maturity, forgiveness, self-awareness or self-improvement. She was goal driven, but her goal was a shallow one. To get Saeroyi to fall in love with her.For a show trying to cast light on social issues in Korea, romanticising sexual assault was gross. Just because the perpetrator was the young female protagonist madly in love with the male lead, doesn't make it right.The fact that in the end Saeroyi fell in love with such a shallow character who stalked him and pestered him for 4 years was a huge turn-off.Itawon Class TL:DR - Psychologically damaged male lead falls in love with his stalker who remains childish and obsessive even after becoming the CFO of a huge listed company and getting the man of her dreams."
2033,Itaewon Class,"Good actors, good story, good motivation, unic character, amd related to life's"
2034,Itaewon Class,"I think we all agree on Itaewon's insanely great start. The first few episodes are coming in like a wrecking ball. It's hard to keep that up, but after a few episodes they still took it relatively good. The ending was mixed for me as it was satisfying and frustrating at the same time. Besides that: acting is great, soundtrack is great, ending could've been better, but still worth it to watch. If you excuse me, I'm going to play Gaho's ""Start Over"" now."
2035,Itaewon Class,With this great drama you kinda know an amzing type of human that really worth knowing and learning to be like
2036,Itaewon Class,"Lovely movie. The film begins with a very interesting story. Also the plot and the ending was amazing. The movie was like watching someone's life from behind. I was with all his emotions. And from now on, Jo Yi-Seo is my crush ♥"
2037,Itaewon Class,"It is the best I've seen in a while. Refreshing and not romance centered. It keeps you hooked from the beginning till the end. I felt, I cryed and I laughed with this characters. Great development."
2038,Itaewon Class,Such an amazing show! A must watch. This show always keep you on the edge it's so entertaining. All the actors have done an awesome job. I recommend all to watch this series👍👍
2039,Itaewon Class,Fantastic acting...beautiful screenplay.. just wow..
2040,Itaewon Class,"Da mi acting is awesome, this series deserve more season because the story is so fresh"
2041,Itaewon Class,"I hate this character Jo Yi seo... Because she like gold digger ,selfish,rude thts why I am rating 1.. storyline best but ending not good."
2042,Itaewon Class,"First 2 episode deserves 10/10 rating,
after that 3-5 episodes 9.1/10,
then 6-9 episodes 7.9/10
10 episode change tha whole story and it deserves 7/10
11-13 episodes deserves 4.5/10 for i don't know.14-16 episodes highly deserves. 2.0/10
I m very repent for watching this drama. When I watch first 2 episode i was very confident this was my favourite kdrama but after that they ruins everything. Please if anyone is watching this review then please don't see that series and this is good for you. Because I'm repent (pachtaya hun ma) to watch this this drama."
2043,Itaewon Class,"Beautifully crafted by the director..
amazing acting...ultimate plot."
2044,Itaewon Class,I really liked the first few episodes and then it went straight downhill. I actually skipped through to watch the whole season still not worth the time.
2045,Itaewon Class,"I don't watch kdramas but I watched this one because I found out through twitter that the storyline touches sensitive issues like social injustice, racism, transgender issues etc.
I wanted to stop watching the show after two episodes because it was so predictable and had cliche stuff that happen in every drama but I gave it another chance and went for the third episode and I'm so happy I did so.
Yiseo made the whole thing more interesting. I loved her character development throughout the show. She was transphobic and racist in the earlier episodes but changed. Her friendship with Hyeonyi was so cute. She was a diagnosed sociopath so I hope people who hate her can take that into consideration. Also she was a badass and I'm so happy she ended up with saeroyi because she loved him and showed her love by standing by him and help him reach his dreams. The only problem with her was the fact that she kissed saeroyi when he was unconscious. That's NOT okay.
Saeroyi's determined and ambitious personality was so inspiring and Park Seojoon's acting was on point.
Although I'm happy sooah didn't end up with Saeroyi, I felt so bad for her. Her happy ending seemed so rushed and out of nowhere.
Geunsoo as well, deserved better. I wish things turned out differently for him.
Seungwon, Hyeonyi and Tony were all nice characters the only problem was that Tony was not involved in the story as much as the two others. Specially in the later episodes after finding his grandma he was less there.
Ahn Bohyun did an amazing job with portraying Geunwon. He was an a**hole and to be honest, I felt bad for him too since he was never loved.
Overall this kdrama had the potential to be one of the best out there but some of the event that took place were so stupid and not well thought out. They made the plot look so weak and childish and rushed. One of them was the whole kidnapping at the final episodes.
Despite everything I liked it. It was touching and aesthetically pleasing."
2046,Itaewon Class,"The first 5 episodes are strong and look very planned, after it i tried to watch it till end because of its great reviews. Very predictable lines and many dull scenes, it usually has 10 seconds dull scene. No chemistry and I cried only at the first and second episode."
2047,Itaewon Class,U muat watch coz this drama over Rated and so nice
2048,Itaewon Class,"Itaewon Class had a wonderful beginning, first two episodes were treat for the audiences. And it held for a pretty long time; until episode 10 it still had it's appeal. After that the plot started to become frustrating, the main character(Park Sae-ro-yi) started to lose his charm, actually no real emotion was portrayed through him. The vengeance concept was never questioned and it started to become stressful to watch.
The romance went the worst way possible. There is really no justification for this. That four years leap made the plot a mess, so, after episode 13 it became just unwatchable.Performance of the artists were great. Kim Da Mi had a powerful character(Jo Yi-seo), which if not likable was very refreshing...but became dull and annoying as the story progressed. Park Seo-joon did great, just like the plot he was wonderful at the beginning, heart rending acting but his character never really got past the revenge arch, was particularly inept in the romance part. And I don't think that's the actor's fault, the plot was very weak. Now, very few reviews appreciated Kwon Nara's(Oh Soo-ah) performance, but I found her amazing. Till episode 13, though the plot really didn't let her flourish, she was outstanding. All those complicated emotions was perfectly expressed by her...there was no way to bypass her and bring the other romantic counter part to be the final love. But that's what happened and ruined the whole tension that was built through the previous episodes. There was more chemistry between her and the main character than Kim Da Mi and him.Ending was really messy, villains lost their charisma, Kim Dong-hee's character(Jang Geun-soo) didn't receive any understandable closure and the final revenge and happy ending was totally shallow and out of the blue, not convincing at all. Kwon Nara's character was totally ignored where she had amazing potential and Park Sae Joon's character was totally lost by the end.But for the first 11 episodes it deserves applause, the views of Itaewon was eye catching at times and the music brilliant.It was that unbelievable wrecking ending which just ruined the amazing show that it could become."
2049,Itaewon Class,"The drama starts really amazingly but toward the end, i just passed the scenes and i was still able to predict anything.
to sum up: great start boring end"
2050,Itaewon Class,"Seriously you all have to watch this movie. Not only girls, any men who watch this will be not able to stop watching it. This drama has everything you need to be a better man."
2051,Itaewon Class,"Don't bother unless you have insomnia and need help falling asleep at night, then watch this before going to bed. You'll probably snooze off on your couch."
2052,Itaewon Class,"The serie is a modern ""The Count of Monte Cristo""
The serie can have bugs. But nobody can say what the audicence in the world It is unfair.The protagonists, the OST is like i'm watching a Korean movie.This only can pass in the HBO series.it is very sad what series like Money Heist have 200.000 user ratings, while this serie that clearly exceeds ""Money Heist"" in all aspects, only have 2000 user ratings, very sad.The only explanation that i found are the prejuidices and preconceptions of a culture."
2053,Itaewon Class,Da-mi Kim is doing very well. I know her from the Witch. She did a very good performance. I love the way she looks at and smile. That's really cute. I want to see more of her. She is amazing. She is very new in the industry but she is really awesome. Because of her I rate 10/10
2054,Itaewon Class,1st 2 episodes were great!Started going downhill from there with introduction of annoying characters who ended up on top.
2055,Itaewon Class,The show started off really good was loving it sooo much. Had some really good morals n all that ... Just one freaking character ruined the whole freaking series for me!!! Yi Seo!!! It's toxic to have such a person in reality too. And saeroyi started off really strong just didn't like that blockhead no response having dumbo towards the end. Should've given saeroyi and Soo ah more screentime and their romance could've been a peak of this show !! Why couldn't they give Yi Seo more of a sister or bestfriend kinda role!! Just a disappointment after 10episodes!
2056,Itaewon Class,"Typical Korean plot. Always will go according to what a standard k-drama should be. The hero will go in ups and downs situations but eventually will win at the end. All I can see is a male protagonist, Sae-ro-yi, who is posting a decent life who has morals like being proud and all, and full of enthusiasm but actually is a selfish, conceited, egocentric, insensitive and a total jerk guy, (if you come to think of it) especially to Soo-ah, who gave her a promise but to be abandoned at the end. When she was indeed the one who waited a long time and dedicated her life in helping to achieve his original goals and truly cared for him. A so-so, mediocre series and definitely not one of the best K-drama I have watched. Somehow disappointed that I wasted my time finishing this show."
2057,Itaewon Class,"It makes me cry and feel so sad on him 💔💔
This drama is amazing form first episode to the end 💜💜💜💜"
2058,Itaewon Class,"Everything was going great untill episode 13, maybe its just me..... but I really didn't like how his feelings changed like that from liking Oh Soo-ah to liking Jo Yi-seo, I know he has gone a decade liking Soo-ah and her not responding but i gotta say he never really asked her out, and, not only that but he should at least understand how she feels. That's all I got to say aside from that love triangle everything was super"
2059,Itaewon Class,"I wanted to give my views on this. I think some people mis-interpret this drama at all as there are so many ways to look at the ending of this drama. I am a big fan of K-drama and this is the first time I'll write something to make it clear if you ever going to watch this.Before anything else; I think original soundtrack is absolutely outstanding! you may not like the story but the soundtrack compliments each episodes and story, it is that good that I downloaded them!! Specially ""Still Fighting It"" awesome!! lyrics says it all about this drama!We seen from the beginning how it all started....His father death, hatred and building himself from the ground to get his revenge, but looking it back, he didn't actually had any closures of his father death. I completely forgot this because I am so into how he will get his revenge, until the final episodes! which was a relieved - he finally embrace and accepted the death of his father, and for me that's the best and outstanding ending. And to be honest! I cried my hearts out. He can finally move on be happy with the person he love. Hence, ""I will do it a million times if he have to"" because, saving the person he love is more than going through loosing someone again!On the other hand, some viewers are looking into how he will get his revenge, but at the end, it's the childhood friend Oh Soo-Ah got the final card to take Jangga Co. Never really like her in the beginning for betraying Park Sae-ro-yi, taking the scholarship and working for Jangga Co, not sticking to her principles, however, her character is outstanding; confused and selfish! I knew she had a plan or something, but why taking this long!Having said all these, although Park Sae-ro-yi lost his guard and principles, at the end it pays it all off and that is the icing on the cake!....Chairman Jang kneels down before Park Sae-ro-yi!! So, no matter how you look at the ending, for me, it sums it all up.Absolutely outstanding performance!! now, the question is, is there a season 2???....unless the youngest son became a MAN! and still have feelings for Kim Da-mi, then that's a different story, who knows! But overall this drama is one of the best and one of my favourite! Love it. Park Seo-Joon one of a kind and brilliant actor!"
2060,Itaewon Class,"Best drama I have ever seen
Best character Park Seo Ro Yi & Jo eso"
2061,Itaewon Class,"End is so disappointing..
And the revenge story again ended to the romantic one"
2062,Itaewon Class,"Okay,,, It's my first K-drama and I loved it. The only bad things about this drama is that it ends, ha ha. Every person has done a great job and the OSTs... just WOW! You can watch if you want to enjoy... ( Episode no. 10 got me nervous)
-Love,"
2063,Itaewon Class,"This movie makes me realize about many aspect... it also make me know that one little person that don't have anything perfect can do something very big. It's really impressed me, it makes me feel like if I have more patient of doing something and have a spirit to reach the goal, I can change something to be in my way and I can do something very big too. About the story, there is a lot of stressful, actually when I start watching this, I can't even know how a group of a few people will pass through all the problem they've met, because the goal is very big and it look too hard for them. I only cheer them up in my mind because I guess that there is no way to achieve their goal at all even if they try very hard. But at the end they can and that's make me feel really happy with their achievement. However, there are many scenes that I think I don't really happy with, one is the main woman character, I don't think she will be the last woman whom the main character go out with and I also don't like this kind of character as much because all she think or all she does is for the main character I think she is too adhere to the main character, I always think that ""why you have to try hard like this"" or ""there are many thing that you can do for yourself"" ...however, she is the main point and the key of this movie, if she is not here beside the main character, To reach the goal is absolutely hopeless. By the way, even if there are something I like or don't like but It's one of the best movies of my favorite. If you have time you can try once and you will understand what I really feel."
2064,Itaewon Class,The entire story was really thrilling with each episode keeping you at the edge of your seats. The revenge was perfectly planned out with a 15year plan and was perfectly executed.The reason this isn't a 9 or a 10 is because of its boring love triangle which looked too forced and would been better to focus on the revenge more. Overall a great series to watch but in the end it became a bit dragged out.Recommended ✅ Yes only if you have good patience.

2066,Itaewon Class,"I watched the series because of the recommendations from friends. The series started well. However, the personalities of the characters have not been developed through their experiences. There's no meaningful message in it.I got so upset that such a selfish, terrible person like Yi-seo who treats her friend known as Geun-soo and people around terribly is supported in this series. She ended up having everything she wants. Park Saeroyi is simply boring. He couldn't keep his promises with Soo-ah which I don't find it cool. And Oh Soo-ah is just a useless character. She can do bad things to hurt the one she likes for no reason.It's such a bad ending where chairman Jang got no lesson about life and family. His family remains broken.I just can't understand why this series has such a good rating. The story is too simple. There's no deep views into human emotions. No inspiration I could find. It's simply about boring love, hatred. As a person who has watched Korean dramas for more than 20 years. I really don't think this drama deserves this highly rating."
2067,Itaewon Class,"First of all, they did too many honor talks throughout the whole season. ""I will defeat you and surpass you.""... ""I will make you kneel and beg, you stubborn fool.""...Maybe it's a Korean culture or something. Why is the old villain so obsessed in letting a youngster kneel on his knee to beg.Secondly, they spent more than half of the season creating romantic atmosphere between Saeroyi and Soo ah, plus Saeroyi made so many promises to Soo ah in most of the episodes, but then suddenly he changed his heart and mind, suddenly fell in love with another girl that he kept saying ""I will not like you""...""don't cross the line""...??? Excuse me??? That is cheating!!!! Even though Saeroyi and Soo ah weren't really dating, but he kept confessing and making lifetime promises... I cannot accept his sudden change of heart..."
2068,Itaewon Class,Couldn't they find a better actor to play Yi-Seo? Also the love story plot is all over the place. And they could've done a better job with how he builds his business..
2069,Itaewon Class,"I finished it today, and...it might be the best piece of media I have ever consumed. I thought that early on in episode one, but now that I've seen it all??? OH MY GOODNESS. Like, I was trying to think of something to compare it to, but this show is literally So Good nothing comes close. Everything impressed me-the cinematography, the acting, the timeline, the plot line with it's intricate and perfectly woven subplots, the music. And OMG EMOTIONS. but you absolutely must watch it.
YOU.
MUST."
2070,Itaewon Class,The main character abruptly changed his love interest. It didn't make any sense. The writers appeared to rush this change in character. The tragedy is that the only reason Saeroyi won in the end was due to the work Sooh Ah was doing all along to bring down Jangga Co. She waited for him for over a decade only to be abandoned. She's the true hero in this show.
2071,Itaewon Class,I enjoy it more then Parasite. I give parasite it's due liked it for its first two acts but the violence in act three seemed gratuitous. As for Itaewon it keeps surprising me. Never crosses the line. Being a son myself you aspire to have moments with your father like that. Truly heart warming.. Love all the characters.. Love the love triangle. Cabt wait for the next episode. Hope it wont end.
2072,Itaewon Class,"It was so good up to a point. When they become a big corporation, you start losing the connection with the characters, but more importantly the love story plot was disappointing. How did he suddenly change his mind? Especially when it was revealed that Oh Soo Ah was sacrificing her own love and dedicating herself to a life goal, just like Sae Ro Yi has been all those years. Their determination and personal sacrifices were so in tune with each other, it would make so much more meaningful story, especially because it's less realistic in real life (after all it's all about the fairy tale stories, isn't it?). Well, it was a disappointing ending to a great original show with a lot of potential. Nevertheless, acting was good."
2073,Itaewon Class,"Plot is good till episode 12. But after that can't watch full episode so just fast forwarded.First I thought soo-ah is not good match for sae-ro-yi. But when he falls in love with yi-seo then I thought why not soo-ah. Soo-ah is much better than yi-seo. Yi-seo is so childish, selfish, crazy psycho."
2074,Itaewon Class,"The first couple of episodes were awesome, they really pull you into the drama. Then it simmered off a bit. I've just started Korean drama's recently and the love stories usually don't go the way I would think, but they got it right in this one, Park Sae-Roy wound up with the right girl, Yi-Seo!! Her character was awesome and the actress was perfectly cast. I did feel a little bad Soo-ah but she was selfish and always pushed Park Sae-Roy whereas Yi-Seo lived for him and gave her heart and soul for him selflessly! I hope there's a season 2!!!"
2075,Itaewon Class,What happened? Did the show just give up at the end? Weak plots and cringe worthy cliches. There were certainly a number of great episodes building up a good underlying story focusing on an underdog and a revenge story. Massive disappointment starting from episode 15.
2076,Itaewon Class,Everything is good except I really hope Seoroyi end up with Soo Ah..quite disappointing..lol
2077,Itaewon Class,"On ep5 and it's sooo interesting that i am hooked , it's ost is on repeat mode , you won't regret watching it , you won't realise when you fell for this drama , it's that intriguing."
2078,Itaewon Class,"Recommend to watch on either 1.5x or 2x if u ever decide to watch this drama.
The characters aren't so great.. except the chef maybe.. but I like dami's hair..
The reasons also aren't shown very well.. but yeah.. if u are park seo joons fan.. u can watch.."
2079,Itaewon Class,"It have great plot and story line. Each character has strong character. The interaction and dialogue in each character built very well. Everything was natural.
Until... After ep.8, everything became plain and dull. Love story overpowering everything. I thought the main theme is Young smart entrepreneurs build a startup with revenge.
Especially the last 4 episodes, super cringe."
2080,Itaewon Class,"How can a dumb-handed cook beat all the top-tier cook from around the Korea? And the coincedences. The story never goes without a coincedence. The grandmother acting as a money-lendor in bad quality area is ,in fact, super-rich and a friend of Jangga head?"
2081,Itaewon Class,"Interesting, and I love that hace a lot of Themas, and diferent caracters."
2082,Itaewon Class,A very heart rendering drama that grows on you. Park saroyis character deserves appreciation.
2083,Itaewon Class,Each episode was so moving and with every episode you get more and more close the each character
2084,Itaewon Class,"I love the main actor, so I was SUPER excited to watch him star in this show. The first episode got me sucked in. The show never lost its momentum as I continued to watch it. The plot and storyline are absolutely amazing and worth seeing unfold. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the romantic aspect of the show. I felt let down. Still a great story to watch, Park Seo Joon did was excellent! I loved it overall."
2085,Itaewon Class,"One of the best shows ive ever watched, story is amazing, lots of twists that are surprising and you truly get invested in the characters! Fashion looks so cool and it's genuinely one of my favourites, recommended to family and friends and they all like it too!😁😁"
2086,Itaewon Class,Just don't watch it you will break your device at the end.
2087,Itaewon Class,"The series introduces us to the world of 'Pak Sae Roy', the wonderful life of a young man who wants to knock down giants. A whole life user trades for big dreams. The kind that has nothing to lose Even though he didn't finish his studies, was in prison, got beaten, got out of jail, went to work in fishing. Or even the terrible labor, Saeroy has been through it all. We will see the path of growth from a young boy to a young man. With all the twists and turns Anyone who likes to watch intense drama series with plot and revenge. Or sharply slashed each other with tactics that should not be missed.And although I, as an audience member, used to insult the beauty of the world in the character of 'Park Sae Roy' (like my rival, President Jang Dae Hee, used to insult him like this), but I can tell you that as soon as I watched Ep. .8 It's over, Park Sae Roy's character has become what we love the most in the series. Thanks to Park Seo Joon for being able to convey Park Sae Roy's emotions and thoughts naturally and reliably. Small rebellion That with a determined spirit mixed with innocence is told through pure facial expressions, gestures and words. The script is so dramatic, tense, so full that you can feel the real awkwardness and pain of the characters, until you can say that the acting skills are almost flawless.Father-son duo, Jang Geun Won (played by Ahn Bo Hyun) and Chairman Jang Dae Hee (played by Yoo Jae Myung) are a great combination that can't be hated or hated. This router was made to be both Saeroy's enemy and teacher at the same time. We'll see what kind of family creates a person to become a demon. And it's so bad it's unbelievable that we will be able to understand the deep feelings of a gray and almost black character like Jang Keun Won. Or even we will give a sense of respect for awe. Of a character like President Jang Dae Hee No matter how many times these people have trampled on the characters we love. These show the success of the series' character creation very well.

2088,Itaewon Class,I have just installed IMDb to write a review about this series
2089,Itaewon Class,"First 7, 8 episodes were great. But it became really boring after that. From episode 14 I literally forced myself to watch. And the ending was too predictable. I thought it'd be great since everyone was hyping but I was wrong. Kinda disappointed."

"
2320,D.P.,"This show is primarily a scathing indictment of the institutional bullying that takes place in compulsory military service in South Korea. Told with an ironic brisk tone and occasional sardonic dark comedy, the horror is real, never exaggerated but portrayed in a matter of fact way that makes it so much more effective and powerfully moving. Some other reasons for desertion are also shown like economic reasons. But the torture is the main thing here.this show is a success because the subject matter is a universal problem in any country where men are forced into so called military service and killed or injured mentally and physically. Akin to a normal innocent person being sentenced to prison and torture for a crime they didn't commit.There is an onward momentum and a fast pace unlike many other shows because this one has only 6 episodes. No slow moments or wasted scenes and all things come together. Sometimes you need to concentrate to keep clear who is who as there are many soldiers.Jung Hae In was so good in Something in the Rain but his recent projects like a Piece of Your Mind weren't good enough for him. He is such a terrific actor showing a sympathetic dramatic side here. In D. P. the bullying he suffers is so much more painful to watch because it is him and the viewer can feel his righteous indignation under his self control. Kudos to Shin Seung Ho who is well cast and very effective as a bullying sadist.There is a lot more to tell and season 2 should be a good one. Congratulations to the cast and crew and writer."
2321,D.P.,"Korean Drama ""D. P."" is an intense drama that takes its strength from the reality that it presents.The drama follows the main character as he discovers along with the viewer the small cases that build up to the final one. That main character is presented more like a blank canvas, with few clues of who he is and what sets him apart from the rest. He is probably there to be the eyes and ears of the viewer and even his decisions are closer to the ones everyone would have opted to.The other characters were more colorful and dominated the scenes in a more powerful way. Nevertheless, the actual story was pretty intense and emotional, being tragic because it felt and probably is close to reality.Finally, the performances were all great and walked side long with a great script and well paced story.So, overall, 8 out of 10."
2322,D.P.,"Review By Kamal KPretty good show, a little on the slower side at times, but with intriguing characters and situations. The two leads in the show do an excellent job playing their roles, and their chemistry together was one of the best parts of the show in my opinion.Acting is great, story is good. This show will definitely make you angry, keep that in mind. There are so many characters who deserve severe punishment for how they treat others during service, but unfortunately not too many of them get what they deserve. Plenty of gruesome, humiliating, and downright infuriating bullying scenes with little payoff at the end in terms of change in behaviors or punishment for their actions. One of the things I hate the most in this world is when people think too highly of themselves and treat others poorly, and this show has a lot of that. This show is mostly just scenes of individuals who think they're better than others and abuse their power, only for the victim of the abuse to turn around and abuse the next person down the ladder. Almost like a domino effect.Overall, a good show with a decent story and great acting. Just prepare to be very angry."
2323,D.P.,Funny and sad=and more-shame only 6 eps pref 10/12 eps be better-not sure if a one off of if s2 will come.
2324,D.P.,A new recruit is assigned to the DP who are responsible for bringing back soldiers who have gone AWOL. A well acted drama which looks at the the unfair treatment of soldiers of all ranks and how bullying can become systematic. Each episode deals with the causes of why the soldier deserted and the efforts to return him. In a country where conscription is compulsory it will hopefully make the people look at the vicious cycle of bullying from all ranks against ordinary people carrying out service.
2325,D.P.,"This is good takes awhile for it to build its not a quick paced series and a little tough for caucasian people to recognize the characters as a lot of them look alike dressed up in the same military outfits.The military hazing in Korea is somewhat different than that in the USA they don't hit you here just physical punishment and they leave your mother out of it other than calling you a momma's boy.Episode 6 was the lest favorite they seem to be running low on ideals and than there is the ending that you won't see unless you let the credits play out, was Korean stupid."
2326,D.P.,"Six episodes that talk about bullying and the consequences of it in the Korean Army, the kind of story that you won't hear. It's dark, it's realistic and if there is truth to it, *smh* Good acting, great music and there's some decent action as well. But it's mostly a drama and if you like drama, I'd recommend this."
2327,D.P.,This drama deals with very hard and sensitive topics that most people know but we tend to ignore. Raw emotions and feelings dealing with traumatic experiences caused by human nature ( although I should be saying men) . The story speaks about mandatory military enlistment for males in South Korea and how rotten those institutions and its hierarchical society is.The struggle of those men trapped in a system that doesn't help them and silences them and the constant battle of some good individuals trying to fight against it.The performances of the cast were outstanding and all the deep feelings and emotions were spectacularly portrayed.I also enjoyed the fighting scenes with Jung Hae-in actually boxing.The ending was surprisingly explosive I really hope there's a second season.Absolutely worth the watch.
2328,D.P.,I am grateful that South Korea made this type of show as it's unimaginable to be made in my country.
2329,D.P.,"Having made my compulsory military service in Switzerland, more than
40 years ago, compared to what is shown in this serie, it was almost
a pleasant time, even though I was and still am a convinced pacifist.But the general idea was and is still the same in most of our societies.Most of the people abuse of their rank or power. That is also valid
in the civil society.I remember at the beginning of my training period, about 60 to 80 %
were against the army system. At the end of my first four monthes,
there was almost none who didn't shift their view. I did not.Most men are just sheeps going with the stronger current,
and are afraid to confront abuses. Hopefully, there are
everywhere some who are not (...so much).A few times, I was really on the verge to have bad problems,
punishments (had some), jail (could avoid it :-) and by the fact
I stood my ground, and was lucky not to have such crazy bullying
people like in this series, could avoid the problems shown in D. C.In the civil society, it works the same way.You have to develop (if you don't have it in your genes) a self
confidence to know exacty where is the green and the red line,
and at any cost, are forever decided not to cross to the
wrong direction.This Korean serie is very interesting, because it's courageous.The acting is excellent, and even though, for my taste, it had
sometimes a little too slow pace, the story unfolds very well.The end is one of the logical possible ones. Nevertheless very sad.In two words : Great serie !"
2330,D.P.,"When you say ""military drama"", we usually think of difficult missions, war, spies, or back and forth shootings and explosions. However, this drama chooses to focus on the behind the scenes of a soldier and their human aspect.What really happens inside a training base? Why do soldiers deserts their positions and go into hiding?Well, watch it. And find out. It's worth it!Great work team."
2331,D.P.,"This is such a RAW tv show that will make you shocked, appalled, and excited while watching every single episode. If you are not watching this show because you think it's only about the conscription in south korea, then you are missing out big time. This show is more about people who have gotten driven into the dark side of their own life pushed by the social system. It's not just about army dudes in south korea. It's about anyone who are in any organization wherever they are. Just because you are free to go in and out of any situation, that doesn't mean you are free from obligation. We all have to bear humiliation and desperation at some point and that is what this show is about."
2332,D.P.,"Good action serie. What bullying can do to a person. Shown very well in this serie. Really moving to see. And also the other reasons to help family. I would have loved to save him myself. I was just fighting along in my mind, very sad. Just a warning that this can cause bullying. But of course taking revenge is not good."
2333,D.P.,"D. P. (2021) has a good start and a great ending. The story, actors, music, direction, you name it, everything was well put together.Anyway, I don't know what else to say except to encourage you to watch this series. (*There are only six episodes.) It is worth your time. And whether or not there is a second season, this season already speaks volumes."
2334,D.P.,"Quite possibly the most riveting and affecting TV programme ever. After each episode I am left speechless, could just sit in my armchair and say....wow....wow.... Having recently switched on to Kdrama I'd thought it was really just good entertainment, but it also proves to be gritty, bold, brave, unswervingly critical, searingly honest, insightful and single-mindedly brilliant as well. This is a new series and it must win all screen production awards next time round. Wow........"
2335,D.P.,"This is a stunning example of how cinema or TV can be used to get people to be aware of and discuss something important.I can only imagine what it must be like to live in a country with compulsory military service, but this show and all of the cast do an excellent job of humanising (as in tells a human story) the situations that must occur when service is only a choice if you are rich or connected enough to make use of the loopholes.A must watch. But not an easy one."
2336,D.P.,"I didn't know what to expect with this one, but from start to finish I was sucked in. This is one show that really can show the dark side of being in the military, it doesn't matter what country your from, the rumours are there, this show just brought it to your screen. It was well done had good fight scenes and great filming as they ran all over the place. I really must say, I appreciated the actors emotions in how they delivered the message of thier disappointment in not getting fair justice for thier comrades. It also showed that the higher ups have to grapple and work with corrupt power hungry people above them while they themselves know the system is not fair. I liked seeing the 2 DPs trying to find thier way, in how to be humane about thier job, knowing it is not easy and each story was not simple but complicated, sometimes more complicated than they expected. Here is where you could see them holding onto thier own humanity as they had to do thier jobs and adhere to military rules that were just sometimes unfair.I hope I haven't spoilt anything for you, season 1 is only 6 episodes, I really enjoyed it and yep a spoiler alert here, cant wait for season 2, they are waiting for Netflix to pick it up. I gave 10/10 as it was well written, acted, and filmed."
2337,D.P.,"This was both one of the very best and most depressing shows I have watched. Superb acting, story, directing, everything. The story's theme is quite heavy, but phenomenally scripted and performed. The series gives insights into the life of soldiers and officers in the South Korean military. Watching this will change you."
2338,D.P.,"This Netflix D. P. K-Drama focusing on compulsory military service in South Korea is definitely worth watching. I never watch war themed shows and only watched it after a search for the lead actor which I loved in other K-Drama. So if I say it is worth watching, that says a lot because normally I would have turned something like that off. But it intrigued me from the beginning because I was wondering what the ""D. P."" was. That mystery title is divulged in the first episode and I suddenly realized what this show was all about. I was surprised to see my favorite actor in such a serious role, and he did an excellent job. Jung Hae-in played Private Aho Joon-ho, who grew up street fighting to protect himself and his sister and mother, was disadvantaged, and had an abusive step-dad, and is empathetic to those that get bullied. He had no connections whatsoever. He himself was immediately bullied by the upper ranks during basic training and managed to standout during his placement interview. He had no real previous skills other than delivering pizza but because of his height was placed on the military police detail. Very soon, he was chosen to go ""outside"" to find deserters and bring them back. The other senior elites are wondering why this junior is chosen so quick to go ""outside"". His first trip outside quickly changes him and the way he thinks about everything and you will have to watch to see why. There is violence, fights and blood, but also empathetic scenes and lessons to be learned from the series. Season 2 will be coming soon."
2339,D.P.,"This drama far exceeded my expectations. Cinematography and direction are just exquisite. Every one of the actors gave it their best. OST is amazing. The story was well written and certainly important to tell. It does deal with graphic and brutal bullying including sexual assault. I can't recommend it highly enough, thank you to everyone who worked hard to bring this gem to life."
2340,D.P.,"Storyline: This series makes us to feel that bullying is not acceptable at any place school, work every new place we'll go. All characters played the role properly except the action part.The action part, we can see clearly that the punch don't connect, the camera view hmm. Disappointing, other part is good.Binge on watching: Not really cause every episode is a new story. You don't crave badly that want to know what's next but this series only 6 episode, maybe you will absorb all."
2341,D.P.,"SPOILERS: I just wanted to vent. But ffs I can see the show ending the way it did but I hope to God it ends up being a dream after they got knock out when they crashed the car in the tunnel. However, it sucks that I can can certainly see it ending the way they did. The last scene after the last scene just seemed like maybe it wasn't the case. Plus it states this show is still running 2021-"
2342,D.P.,"This series is good overall, but the episodes fluctuate from 7-9 in my ratings. Last two episodes are really good and a lot darker in tone. As fellow citizen living in conscription country (not South Korea) I can see the importance in this series. Our country doesn't have it nearly as bad as this series implies it is in South Korea, but nonetheless I feel this heavily.This series has few problems. Firstly it has overarching story, but it breaks in the middle somewhat. Episodes 3-4 are more stand-alone episodes, but they have some parts for the overarching story.Secondly sometimes the series seems too action-comedy movie. There are times where the episode should turn into more dramatic, but it sort of cheaps out and turns into action film fist fight action, when it implied before it might turn into more violent dramatic fight.Thirdly it seems there was lack of funding and the series feels it revolves around same sets too much (this might be somewhat used as intended effect, but it just breaks the illusion about great military complex). Out in the cities the series uses more sets and is more detailed.I can't really analyze acting that well, because I don't speak Korean and don't know their culture enough to understand nuances. For me it was good enough even though the main character seems bit ""cold"" until 5-6 episodes."
2343,D.P.,"Trailer gave me a good impression. Supporting cast done a great job especially hero partner done a great job with a humor.story show reality of army abuse. Because its 6 episode ,so they made it short and crisp. Overall well balanced show."
2344,D.P.,"Must watch series from Netflix KOREA.1. The problems are most definitely real and you will sympathize with every character.2. I did not actually expect the series to be funny ....but it was.3. The CHEMISTRY between the actors is everything.Even the Cameos and the whole cast was excellent.Especially the relationship between the two leads.4. The storyline was unique but (seemed) very much true ,and even inspiring at a point.5. You might even cry.For everyone who wants to watch a slice of life, real, non-romantic, a binge watchable series this is IT."
2345,D.P.,"I'm the first person who gives it 5, so let me write why:
by the episode intro, it looks like it's about one guythe first episode is a good setup, i was personally rooting for himfrom episode 2 it starts to be a drama and comedywe learn almost nothing about the main guy (also close to nothing about the other guys)we're supposed to root for one guy for being bullied/harassed, although we barely see himthe last scene, between the credits, is understanble. Or what, should I be surprised, after seeing the decission of that soldier, minutes before season 1 ends?it's only 6 episodesthe family relationship of the main guy is poorly explainedSeason 1 feels like a story a friend tells you over dinner. You listen to it and you try to relate, but the next day, it's already forgotten."
2346,D.P.,"Korean movie industry are better for me than Hollywood. I just hope there are more tv shows like this, instead of those cutesy dramas. The latest shows of Jung Hea In and Lee Jee Hoon just had me hooked. Great actors, quality shows."
2347,D.P.,Netflix Korea has done it again. Here's another well written/directed/acted series that deals with a difficult subject so often buried by a system that does not support the victims. This series doesn't pull its punches and just gets better and better as each episode progresses. Superb cast.
2348,D.P.,The past three years there have been produced some absolute gems from the Korean peninsula. And Netflix has had a hand in alot of them. This right here is another Korean masterpiece. I hit the thumbs up in the middle of the second episode. 🎭
2349,D.P.,"Intense, humorous at times, and really heartbreaking to see what some of the soldiers go through. The soundtrack was really great as well."
2350,D.P.,"Wow! D. P. Is fast moving and gripping - I had to hold back from binge watching all six episodes in one sitting. So much sadness balanced by bits of light. Makes me pray that all militaries are working to end the hazing and cruelty that seem to abound when the wrong people are given power. Beautifully acted, don't miss it."
2351,D.P.,"Beautifully written,well acted,what more you want. All the episodes were beautiful which makes it difficult to pick which one is the best Wished there were more episodes
The mid credit scene hits hard."
2352,D.P.,"Its one of the best antiwar and violence film/series I have ever seen.No need for S2 or anything, the ending says it all.Now I want to read the webtoon that inspired it.Its beautiful, short, concise and brave.Koreans are killing it, they are the best at long form film storytelling these days."
2353,D.P.,Shows the transformation of an average human being after being knocked down in the army for 18 months (South Korea) and enduring all sorts of physical and psychological abuse. A man is not supposed to complain about pain. And worse If it is in the army not in front of his peers.
2354,D.P.,"It's an amazing story and wonderful piece of tv, that I strongly recommend watching even if for no other reason then just how wonderfully it is made and filmed. But even with how wonderfully it is made the best part is without a doubt how amazing the story is, although it's truly a horrifying tale. A story so gruesome and yet still very human. While I think it's based on reality I sincerely hope it's not. Altogether an amazingly horrifying tale."
2355,D.P.,"Truly realistic. Mad respect to everyone who work hard for this. I hope more people check this great one too. Must watch, it's really great."
2356,D.P.,"I liked it so much. It's funny and it was different, realistic."
2357,D.P.,"Short , well acted , really good characters , the series touch interesting things ,loved it . From argentina."
2358,D.P.,Wow I am totally blown away.I was going to just watch first ep while eating late dinner but ended up watching whole series in one seating. LolI didn't even know there is such military unit exists. Really interesting subject.6 episodes is way too short. I wish they will come out with season 2 soon.
2359,D.P.,"Loved the story, especially the way each episode takes us through different issues faced by the individuals. The cast is another highlight in the series, everyone's acting in the series is amazing, my personal favorite is the actor who has played the role of Suk Bong.Didn't expect the series to be this intense, Left me curious to know more about what else happens in the Army which never is revealed."
2360,D.P.,"This film informs viewers of the reality of the Korean conscription army, 100% without any manipulation or beautification. I joined the Korean military in 2012 and was discharged in 2014. I guarantee that there is no malicious description of the Korean military in this film. This is 100% real, but there are more terrible things in reality. Even though Korea is a free democratic country, it is dragging young men and treating like slaves. And without paying fair treatment, he put it in a beast cage like that drama and forced everything. Despite living in such an environment, Korea does not pay any respect or compensation for the soldier. KPOP, K DRAMA, and so on are all false. This is the reality of Korea. I hope you guys don't admire this beastly country. And i hope you guys respect all soldier in this world."
2361,D.P.,"This drama is a mixture of appropriate fiction of the problems that are occurring in the true Korean army, and you can see the cruelty of the conscription army in this drama. And how young men Korea is exploiting.During World War II, the conscription rate for men in Germany was 78%. At this time, Germany was at war in an extreme militaristic state. But look at Korea. Only young men have already exceeded 90% from the conscription rate and are expected to reach 98% When reached 2022.I have no intention of maliciously criticizing any particular country. However, we have to face the reality, and we wantto let foreigners who have seen this post know how serious Korea is now.This film informs viewers of the reality of the Korean conscription army, 100% without any manipulation or beautification. I joined the Korean military in 2012 and was discharged in 2014. I guarantee that there is no malicious description of the Korean military in this film. This is 100% real, but there are more terrible things in reality. Even though Korea is a free democratic country, it is dragging young men and treating them like slaves. And without paying fair treatment, he put it in a beast cage like that drama and forced everything. Despite living in such an environment, Korea does not pay any respect or compensation for the soldier. KPOP, K DRAMA, and so on are all false.This is the reality of Korea. I hope you guys don't admire this beastly country. And I hope you guys respect all soldiers in this world.During World War II, the conscription rate for men in Germany was 78%. At this time, Germany was at war in an extreme militaristic state.But look at Korea. Only young men have already exceeded 90% from the conscription rate and are expected to reach 98% by 2022 by on national defense obligations even though they are not at war. Is this something that can be done in a free democracy? If a Korean man refuses to be conscripted, he will go to prison. Human rights are completely ignored. Those who are fond of Korea, please do not judge this country by looking at KPOP and KDRAMA. Please. Korea is now facing militarism, and even after implementing the conscription system, it did not pay soldiers properly, did not provide proper meals, forced them to get the coronavirus vaccine, and sometimes injected saline solution. Nevertheless, a person named Seo-uk, South Korea's defense minister, has not come up with any solutions.This is the average diet of the Korean military, and the second picture shows Korean veterans and American veterans.Korean soldiers are thoroughly isolated from society and consumed like machines under the custom of national defense obligations. The reality of the South Korean military has been known around the world through a Netflix drama called D. P., but South Korea's Ministry of National Defense says it will continue to implement the conscription system. I can't move on from this problem anymore. It will inform the world of this problem. If you have seen this article, I would like to tell you. This is Korea."
2362,D.P.,"Netflix should immediately write a fat pay check to the whole team behind this project, even though I had reservation with the director due to his previous work history but God damn this show completely blew everything. The camera setting, editing work. Serious acting unlike cringe acting that we find on other korean show. This is huge ground breaking new direction of korean cinema."
2363,D.P.,The main lead is just awesome. He portrayed the role to the fullest. Every scene he acted came out so well. He got this eye's that can literally convey every emotion. And the plot is very interesting just like the titles every episode has it's own story. Overall the series is a must watch if you ever wondered what happens inside the military. What the soldiers go thriugh both physically and mentally during their serving period. A must watch!!!!!
2364,D.P.,"This six-episode celluloid revealingly modernizes the menace to the serene society.It is the generated danger from accompanying the well-raised essences with the degenerated persons in one room.This work made me remind how I was vicious at some time I wasted during my compulsory enlistment service time, and how injustices inverted to be typical and fair to ranks based on their lousy law toward any and every fresh conscript and civilian as well.I remember how was the leave of a private (from an old enlistment batch) with dropping tears on his cheeks, distributing apologies for attitudes and sleaziness he made toward me and many others of privates, what he-formed to act by ranks orders-unintendedly pushed to execute.This work, like many military-society works-made, I do respect it, has true performances for real issues-showed."
2365,D.P.,"Jung Hae-In does a wonderful performance. It's so much more complex than his usual romance roles, he really does this series justice and should be recognised for the quality of his acting.The overall story is beautifully heart wrenching. What I appreciate though is the honesty of everything. Of the state of things, the false promise of change as well as the inability to do so. But also the irreversible and damaging consequences of being mistreated.The whole soundtrack is absolutely incredible too, consistently so.Watch this if you want something that will touch you but is also wholeheartedly real. Much grit and harsh reality throughout."
2366,D.P.,"I usually don't enjoy Kdramas, the over the top long camera shots where the main character is in despair.... the gratititious romance. But this show really made me want to watch more Korean content. Is is a great mix of humour and drama. Have you laughing one moment and feeling despair the next. Great all round series..... highly recommend it."
2367,D.P.,"D. P. is a very realistic and dark series with excellent cinematography and acting. The way it tackles the sensitive issue in south korean military is mind-blowing and makes me think and reflect alot since such kind of issues are everywhere in our society in either direct or indirect way and the fact that if you want to make something change, you must at least do something calls out the people who normalize bullying and do nothing but ignore even if such happens in front of their eyes. The plot itself is interesting but the realistic acting skills of Jung Hae In make it shine more plus all the casts in the series did their great job. For me, it's the best series of 2021 so far."
2368,D.P.,"I was always curious about why going to military service has to be mandatory for all? When people with connections can easily skip it and take advantage. They just end up forcing people to go for two long year for fulfilling the countrys demand. However, the same country keeps failing people when they need it. Military bullying is something that EVERYONE knows. But no one wants to talk about it. This whole series portrait the rotten side of the service. It was a short series with only 6 episodes. Still, they did a good job with it. The characters played theirs roles very very well and everything was balanced.I really hope someday Korea can change their system and policy regarding this.Anyways,
It is a MUST WATCH K drama. Give it a try."
2369,D.P.,A drama that shows the naked army of Korea as it is without filtration.
2370,D.P.,I have watched a lot but this series takes it all. A very capturing art. It has left me with lots to think of for many days. Praying for a season 2. Best spent six hours.
2371,D.P.,"I ensure that only when we come up to watch this drama with whether your expectation or not, do you seem immersed into the blowing-up atmosphere of the realistic facts hidden or kept out of our vision. The best meaning through all scenes I really sympatize to each characters is TO GET OWN RIGHT EQUALLY, WE HAVE TO PAY SO MUCH,"
2372,D.P.,"Very raw, realistic, full of tension... Overall great drama."
2373,D.P.,"D. P. is a very dark and ironic series in that there are no enemies in the tunnels dug by the enemy, only comrades who kill each other. The soldier's kettle has been in use since 1953, so what is expected to change the army just because of a few deserters?For me, the series is excellent, with an outstanding ending and a wonderful cast, this is the best Korean drama I've seen in 2021."
2374,D.P.,"D. P is fascinating film, i can't stop to go to sleep, 6 eposides is not enough, hope make season 2 soon. Jung Hae In did very well, proud of you."
2375,D.P.,"Yeah of course, the genre is not a romance but a military-related action. The whole series is tense and dark but in some parts, the tension is reduced by some comedies in an enjoyable way. The plot is surprisingly interesting and the acting of main lead Jung Hae In is legendary in this series. His chemistry with his co-stars and supporting actors make this series shine more. The issue in which this series highlights has to be discussed more widely and eliminated from our society permeantly. Such a great series with great message."
2376,D.P.,"It definitely shows the hazing and issues in the South Korean Military, the acting was amazing, the plot is really good, the chemistry was great for the 2 leads, and the comedy or funny parts in the show were timed perfectly. If you still havent watched it you should watch it now!"
2377,D.P.,"1. The performance of the cast was fantastic, you can feel the same with the character in the series and the chemistry between two actors can make you smile the whole series.2. This series were filmed satisfactory, it can make you feel like being in the scene, the technics that they used were absolutely new and awesome.3. The music, is the thing that you shouldn't miss it because it was absolutely great.It's worth watching this, you shouldn't miss it.It doesn't take a long time to watch it because it's just 6 episodes."
2378,D.P.,I need season 2 with more than just 6 episodes. The whole cast are amazing and talented.
2379,D.P.,"This series talks about military life in South Korea and the ethics that each soldier must abide by in the service of their country.We saw in it the harms of discrimination according to the rank of the military, and the opposite of that is the brotherhood between its members."
2380,D.P.,Binge watched the entire series. Didn't expected it to be this good. One of the best Korean series. Loved it. Wonderful acting by all main leads. Very nice story and emotional drama. Hope season 2 will be there.
2381,D.P.,"It's not the genre I'd usually watch but with such a cast, it was hard not to try and give it a chance. Insanely moving. Mesmerizing and heart breaking. Kudos to the whole team for such a beautifully produced show."
2382,D.P.,"Finished 6 episodes in 6 hours nonstop. I admire how it deals with the reality of military service in Korea. Bullying, abuse, bystander, connections, toxic hierarchy and seniority- so many real issues that we see are portrayed in this short series. I cried in a few episodes of how sad yet unfortunately real are the reasons why soldiers flee. The system sucks, no justice is served - no wonder why men dread doing their service. Man, I have no words to explain what I felt and what I learnt from this. Amazing series! Loved the cast."
2383,D.P.,"This TV show bluntly depicts the dark side of military life set in the early 2010s. As a Korean man who finished the military service a little prior to this show, I praise the writer and director for their efforts to put every detail of Korean Army life into the show which reminds me of those days for a while. I'm surprised that the director contains every possible bad accident and unfair system a newly-assigned soldier in the troops should feel, experience, endure, and finally accept. (but actually not all of those bad things happen to one person or one troop at the same time.) Anyways, watch this show. This will leave you many things to rethink in your life, relationship, and community you're in."
2384,D.P.,"I don't feel so good when I see it all.Because this is so realistic and heartbreaking.All Korean men should go to the military.At home, they were a precious family, but when
they go to the military, they are just small items."

2450,Vincenzo,The best part is watching the boyish faced SJK in elegant suits do mafia like things in Korea. I just want to laugh whenever he does his thing. The classical music and opera is well used. The end of each episode is funny and something outrageous usually happens to get you to tune in to the next episode. The first episode was strong with the contrast between how he deals with bad guys in Italy and Korea. Timely nod to Purdue Pharma narcotic issues in episode 3. Episode 4 is quite grand and past things come together.The bad part is subsequently the humour is often painful and the unnecessary overacting of Jeon Yeo Bin is hard to watch. Ok Taecyeon is almost unrecognisable as the goofy intern but his hairstyle changes as he does. Excellent supporting actor Kwak Dong Yeon is a memorable here as a bad guy.I'm still hoping the series will get better and things will get funnier and less painful. They try for jokes when it isn't necessary and it often fails. Even Itaewon Class was funnier and it wasn't mainly a comedy because they reserved jokes for when it counted. Culture clash has the potential for much laughter but it isn't well used. The reactions of the actors are too exaggerated. So many scenes could have been cut.
2451,Vincenzo,"Korean Drama "" Vincenzo "" had a good concept but there were times that it didn't make it work.The main problem with this drama is the length. It's not only twenty episodes long, each episode also was about an hour and twenty minutes. However, the story was not for that length. Therefore, there were episodes, especially the final ones, when the story was full of fillers, unnecessary twists, and ridiculous situations that were trying too hard to be funny. The blend, though, of action, comedy, and legal themes was an interesting combination that worked for most of the cases. Most of the characters were also pretty interesting, though some of them, like the piano lady and the female lead, were annoying and it was obvious that they were written to be eccentric, but that was presented in a way that screamed try-hard. The villain was a boring character in the second half of the drama. However, it must be noted that the big twist was an innovative one and pretty entertaining.As for the performances, everyone did a great job, especially the male lead who finally found the right character for his proper comeback after the big hit DOTS.So, overall, six out of ten."
2452,Vincenzo,"Review By Kamal KAlthough the episodes are longer than normal Kdramas and one episode is 80+ mins, but the story was pretty comprehensive! Not draggy and fast paced, especially in the second half!It all presented in a dark comedy kind of series, with a righteous leader, great amount of fighting scenes, a storyline of corruption and some witty yet hilarious plot throughout. I really enjoyed all of these because it just had all the humour, emotional and thrill in a show, really exciting and fun to watch! This drama in some ways, blows my mind with the integration of mafia and allows all the killing and gun shooting. Well honestly it's kinda weird if you were to think how the male lead can ""lawfully"" kill and torture so many people, but in other way of thinking, these were the best parts of the show!! I don't know about the others, but I just find all the parts where the king of evil are dealing with the demons were so satisfying to watch! So, I just chose to savor it, don't care if it makes any sense, as long as it entertains!Applaud to all the casts, they were all equivalently goooood! Song Joong Ki literally slayed the role and was really cool in all his fighting scenes! Not to say, it really gave me a great laugh whenever he was being ""harassed"" by numerous guys hahaha! Literally everyone in the show is treating him like a meat on the plate! XD Taecyeon was pretty good too, although I personally find him not so suitable for the role, his face just looks too kind for the role, doesn't look bad and scary at all, the starting part of him being a dumb innocent rookie suits him much better! But it was a great spinoff in his acting career, good for him! :) Dongyeon, as good as always, he always pulls off all kinds of characters, a cool one, a psycho or even a coward but kind-hearted little brother. Gosh, and why do his roles always make people wanna protect him so much?Well, I would say maybe not all might enjoy this, but generally, YES! This doesn't have much love story (almost none?), it's more about a deep end conspiracy with a group of people led by a mafia lawyer to fight crime and save the day!!! So if you are looking for a good story, this is it!"
2453,Vincenzo,"Honestly, I sort of enjoyed the early episodes that melded violent crime with slapstick. But it morphed into slapstick and soap opera. Over the top acting, plot and generally silly, cringeworthy scenes.A meandering mess that forced me to stop after 7 episodes. I checked to see if I was near the end and was horrified to see how many more we due to follow. A horror show.Oh, and once an episode our handsome hero throws his lighter away with dramatic effect to burn some major plot location down. Within five minutes we see him annoyingly flicking his trusty lighter that must have magical powers to resist in his hand. OMFG. 🙄"
2454,Vincenzo,"I thought the first half was uneven and could be substantially cut, making a 16 ep series. I thought the second half was as good as any fine Korean series-meaning superb. I stayed with it because of the fabulous cast-terrific on all levels-and was rewarded. The ending was satisfying even if graphic, but hey, don't mess with a mobster's mom, you twits. I loved the sweet pigeon bromance and pigeon onslaught, and the masterful reverse image of the raven. That was revoltingly satisfying as well. And yes there is even romance and a great kiss, too. All in all, Vincenzo is worth the time spent."
2455,Vincenzo,"The stylish visuals and rather interesting premise made me hope for something different, but in the end, ""Vincenzo"" is just one more cheesy Korean drama with soap opera level writing and cringeworthy humor. It could have worked as a ""so bad it's good"" show, but episodes are too long and possibly slower than arthouse cinema, with the same gags repeated all over again, embarrassing product placement, and endless slow-motion shots with people walking along hallways to show off or do funny faces. The humor rests mainly on the contrast between the dark tone of the main story and the goofiness of the support characters, but the jokes are corny and the performances are utterly annoying.The protagonist is a Korean-born, Italian-raised mafia lawyer who is back in his motherland to deal with unfinished business. Yet there is nothing Italian about him - he just slurs random Italian sayings and listens to opera while drinking red wine (come on!!). He is supposed to be a cold-blooded mafia consigliere, yet they spend half of the series trying to justify his extreme actions as if he was a hero forced to fall to the same level as his enemies. The sparse moments of action are extremely dull and formulaic, but I have to admit that there are also a few absolutely crazy but undeniably original plot resolutions every now and then."
2456,Vincenzo,A Korean Working for an Italian mafia family as a consigliere returns to Korea to retrieve hidden gold in a dilapidated block. Here he gets involved with the shopkeepers in the block and when he comes up against a corrupt psychotic businessman things soon escalate out of control. An interesting story which is quite violent at times and leaves the viewer rooting for the anti hero even though his methods are probably more severe then the villains. Overall well acted with interesting story and characters which leaves you wondering if violence is ever acceptable.
2457,Vincenzo,"This so far with just two episodes is the best start to a series i think I've seen, great actors and writing which is where series are made.Great chemistry between the characters and no flaws in the story so far it appears set up for 20 episodes which is a tough test for KD to do without foolish plots but so far this is fantastic.
Kim Yeo-Jin is building a hell of a resume for herself with many great series
it does take about 15 min of background in Italy then it moves along quite well"
2458,Vincenzo,"A feel good Italian mafia comedy is hard to come by. Let alone a Korean one.To feel good the good guys had to win. All the time. But such is not the case here. There are lots of death here. Very calculated. And many fight scenes, albeit simplified and comedic. Together with a fairly sizeable support cast. And most are really one dimensional. Only the 3-4 are somewhat fully fleshed out.The evil ones are really evil. The slimy one stays slimy. The comedy sidekicks also. No one changed a bit except the female lead.And there are loads of side stories. The underling brother, the treasure hunter, the hidden talents, the McGuvin , the tribute to the French Revolution, modern dance, Italian food, and even the pigeon gets to be hero for a day.It's entertaining, but this is just pass your time tv drama, at its best."
2459,Vincenzo,"8/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Action and Crime drama with 20, approximately 80 minute episodes.Park Joo-hyung (Song Joong-ki) grew up in Italy. At eight years old he was adopted and harbors resentment towards his Korean mother who he feels abandoned him. He later becomes part of the Italian mafia and is such an asset the head, Don Fabio, adopts him. As a member of the Cassano family Joo-hyung is renamed Vincenzo Cassano. He becomes a lawyer and utilizes his skill as he works as a representative for his adopted father in mafia dealings. When the father dies, the biological son attempt to kill Vincenzo and, after taking revenge, Vencenzo flees the country back to South Korea.In Seoul, Vincenzo goes to the the Geumga Plaza which is a site where he helped a Chinese tycoon hide 1.5 tons of gold and install tenants to disguise the real intention of the building.The Chinese tycooln is dead, and ownership of the gold now falls to the Cassano family, and Vincenzo plans to recover the gold for himself. Of course, the building has been taken over by a South Korean crime organization in the form of a pharmaceudical company, the Babel group. The Babel group has been strong arming the tenants so Vincenzo decides to team up with one of the tenants, a lawyer, to take down the Babel group. The lawyers daughter, Hong Cha-young (Jeno Yeo-been) was originally represting Babel but after her father is murdered by them, joins up with Vincenzo to exact revenge on the Babel Group. Sparks had originally flown between the two but as they unite toward a common purpose those strong feelings evolve to something more.Overall, I liked this series a lot. All of the actors, and you had a pretty much all star cast with a few exceptions, did an amazing job acting out their characters. The storyline was exciting and the villians were incredibaly villanous. The whole ""it takes a villian to catch a villian"" axiom was true throughout the series. The chemistry between the two leads was not immediate, which made sense to me because they did not start out liking each other but developed a deep friendship through working to take down a common enemy.*Spoilers The pros were the incredible acting, great locations and filming, and appropriate but not too invasive musical scores. Who doesn't love Song Joon-ki in action, he is incredibly handsome and charasmatic. The sense of community with the building tenants was both refreshing and engaging. I loved that Cha-young was a tough, no nonsense lawyer with a bit of a dark streak. It made her the perfect pairing for Vincenzo because she did not have an issue, if justice would not be served, with going outside of the law. I loved that there was gold hidden in the building and how disturbed Vincenzo would get whenever someone would pursue his gold. He reminded me, in those cases, of a Leprechaun guarding his gold. One of the most comedic scenes was when he had to pretend to be gay to lure in a bank that was willing to work with Babel. Whether you are gay trying to be heterosexual or heteresexual tying to be gay if you are engaging the sexuality that does not fit - it is cringy. I was laughing, so hard during that part. The funny thing, was he seemed to turn all the guys around him gay. The men seemed to love him as much as the women did. It was like everyone's dark fantasy, apprently, to be in the mob. So there were bromances galore.The cons were the times that Vincenzo failed to stay true to character. What it seemed, was he was a South Korean child, adopted into the Italian culture but was old enough to remember the language and most of the culture of his original country. His anger at his mother for ""abandoning"" him, and the death of his foster parents through criminal activity, led him to embrace the dark side for revenge. I got that. Made sense. But, it showed, in so many ways that he was very humane and caring and had conscience and could love and all that - not even a sociopath because he wasn't simply ""blending in"" his feelings appeared genuine and he underwent an evolution through meeting and falling in love with Cha-young, being mentored and befriended by her father, and just forming so many friendships in South Korea. But then, his mother, who he was on the precipice of a true reunion with, is murdered and it is like it flipped a switch. He backtracked on all the progress he made and the brutal element fully came back in him. The fact that he had flashbacks and nightmares of past incidents clearly showed that he had remorse to that point. But then it was like he became a slightly different person after his mother's death. I thought the way he killed the Babel villians was just a bridge too far. I cannot reconcile burning someone to death with someone who is a good person. Although the chairman was evil and had done horrible things, drilling someone to death is just the next level of brutality. Becoming as evil as the evil you are punishing does not make you a good person. I was disappointed when he blew up Cha-young's father's killer. He broke his word in my opinion. HHe told him once he did this thing the debt was fulfilled and he could go free. It was dishonest and it seemed even Cha-young felt he had gone too far. But she never said that although her response to the news seemed as if it bothered her.When he killed the female lawyer he broke his morale code which was no women and children. She even said you are going to do this to a woman and he said, basically, you are not a woman, you are a monster. Still, burning her alive was the next level up brutality. It took him from a batman like, superhero justice seeker, to just a murderer little better than the people he was ""punishing"". I also could not buy that the law enforcement friends in his circle were so okay with him brutally murdering those people. They helped him get away with it and even shook hands with and hugged him when he had the blood on him. It was a bit like ""Dexter"" in that dark anti hero type persona but I am just not a fan of that level of ""eye for an eye"" because his treatment of them was even more brutal than the way they treated their victims.The ending also fell short for me. Perhaps they are setting it up for another season. I did not like the very ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" end where he can only come back when on a diplomatic mission (diplomatic immunity). It was over obvious in the postcards he sent that he wanted her to come find him - yet she didn't. To me it seemed as though her emotions toward him took a turn. I did not have the sense she would be willing to leave South Korea and go join him on an island off the coast of Malta. I had no care for his Italian family. We never got to know enough of that piece to care that he had reunited and was now ruling that family. And, we were reminded of his brutality when he mentioned the revenge he took on a rival family and that their remains were fertilizing his grapes. They confessed and kissed but then parted ways with a somewhat sad and whistful look in both of their eyes.His behavior, as other reviewers have pointed out, was not even consistent with what is often the case in organized crime. I knew a situation like that once - one of my best friends in high school let's just say her father was a retired person in a very well known organized criminal entity. In those situations, usually the lawyer is very valuable and also high up in the crime organization. They do not have those folks act as ""hit persons"" they are too valuable to the organization. And they typically have done their dues and don't want to get their hands dirty that way. Not that they have suddenly grown a conscience, but they just don't do the dirty work anymore. So that did not make sense. He was a lawyer and the second in command - the family would typically not risk such an individual by involving them so intimately. Even if he, himself, wanted to be involved, unless there was a compelling reason he would usually be ordered by ""the boss"" not to.That being said - I would still recommend it and might even rewatch it at some point. It is unique and so well acted that the flaws are not a complete deterrant. Others really liked it and did not consider these things flaws. Cha-young had just enough darkness in her to accept a lot of what he did. It was very ""Game of Thrones"" in the darker elements and how most of the characters were not completely good or completely evil but various mixes thereof. And how you were rooting for anti heroes. The ""Queen of Dragons"" in Game of Thrones reminded me of Vincenzo in the way their characters evolved and the sudden switch down a much darker path. But I wasn't a fan of how that ended either. I like redemption and character growth. This followed the opposite trajectory. If there were a second season I might watch it. I am extremely disappointed in the brutality of the murders so I can't think of a way back from that but would be interested to see where their relationship evolved."
2460,Vincenzo,I thought it would be difficult for Joongki to have another love team after the divorce but interestingly the netizen liked the girl. She is not as pretty as the other female leads before but she is funny and had a strong character. Her acting is not annoying either so I guess the netizens fell for this girl too. I like the plot of how each villain ended. I was shocked of how Vincenzo's character was really dark but I guess it will not make sense if it is not related to Mafia. The supporting characters had each unique contributing roles that came as a surprise. Overall I really liked this kdrama but it I think Joongki's acting can still be improved. I also wished that he avenged himself on the two robbers who stole his watch in the first episode.
2461,Vincenzo,"You can see the cast had a lot of fun making this Italian/Korean would-be mafia thriller, the sort of fun NOT experienced in Hollywood since the days of Burt Reynolds. Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!"
2462,Vincenzo,"From IMDB:
""During a visit to his motherland, a Korean-Italian mafia lawyer gives an unrivaled conglomerate a taste of its own medicine with a side of justice.""This reminds me very much about the Mexican telenovela - ''El Dragon, except
this time around it's not a Mexican guy with Samurai skills returning home from Japan, but a Korean lawyer who is quite adapt at fisticuffs himself, returning from Italy. In fact he was a Mafia Consigliere or Advisor.He wears the best Italian clothing, which makes Vincenzo ""Cassanova"" (as people call him) stand out in modern day Seoul. There's dueling law firms,
crazy gangsters, nutty tenants in a building with a 'secret' - and Vincenzo is ably
assisted by the gorgeous and feisty ""Ms. Hong"" - also a lawyer.I really enjoyed watching this -12 x '2 hr' episodes so far; awaiting more next week, and if you want to have a good nights viewing, give this a go."
2463,Vincenzo,"I just started this and it is already so interesting. Song Joong Ki is the main actor and he is such a spunk.He arrives in Korea and straight away the people he meets rip him off. They don't know that he was part of the mafia in Italy. Now they have illegally taken away his building. They don't know what they have done. What he will do to get it back.Oooooh! It's exciting and fun. They are underestimating him at every turn. They don't know the terrible things he's done in the name of the mafia.As well as that he has got an Italian palate and doesn't like the Korean way of cooking it. Lol!Song Joong Ki looks so clean cut, sleek and immaculate but his favourite means of revenge is fire and intimidation. He recruits his team of collaborators from those hurt by the chemical firms.I love this drama so much Song Joong Ki has transformed himself into this pseudo-villain and he and Jun Yeo Bin have this Bonnie and Clyde vibe going on. It's so sexy, provocative and vexatious. Wow! Just want the episodes to keep flowing forward. Every week is like a taster for the next exciting event and experience. I can't wait for what they are going to reveal next, because the real villain has materialized and shocked us all.Some episodes are just crazy and Kim Yeo Jin/Choi Myung Hee is just the wrong actress for this. I don't find her that believable in that part. I just find her pathetic and inadequate when she overacts. Not like Song Joong Ki/Vincenzo Cassano he is so cool, handsome and has that dangerous vibe going on.The brother's, thought it's hard to get the handle on them. Mr Lunatic and Mr Wimp, I wonder how this is going to pan out Then there's the tenants Maybe the Wimp, brother, is the craziest but Mr Lunatic doesn't know it yet.The older brother has been bullying his brother since they were children.A vagrant told them about the hidden gold but thy don't seem believe him even when he shows photographs of it. Still they don't want to move out of the building. They are setting up a protest. They begin to look for the gold tell each other all kinds of lies over it..
I like Vincenzo Cassano and Hong Cha Young's relationship of equality. She is what we call in New Zealand, a hardcase, funny yet super intelligent. She has guessed that he is in the Mafia. She is getting feelings for him but they don't have chemistry yet. She is such a comedian.Vincenzo Cassano biological mother is dying and on the execution list for a murder she didn't commit. He has been ignoring her because she abandoned him and that is why he ended up with Italian adopted parents, but I think that he is beginning to get compassion for her.He finds out that that the bank chairman was the one who set her up. He is preparing for his own revenge. His cohorts are setting him up to seduce the Banks chairman. Through this he finds out what happened to his mum and how she went to jail . That motivates him to carry on with the plan and act as if he is gay.Vincenzo Cassano looks so awesome on a horse.This drama has it's comedic moments then back to serious and deadly. Roll on next weekWell yeah! There was a bit of a lull mid drama but the real villain has hotted things up with a spate of killings. The brothers Jang Jun Woo (Mr Lunatic) and and Han Seo (Mr Wimp) but I think that both of them are totally psychopathic. The older brother has Daddy issues that haven't really been explained or I missed it.Vincenzo Cassano has mummy issues stemming from him being abandoned in and orphanage when he was young but he coming to the realisation that his mum had reasons for it that he didn't know of when he was a child.I was looking at the name Vincenzo it reminds me of incendio.English translation of 'incendio'
incendio
MASCULINE NOUN
fireShades of my Harry Potter experiences.This cold hearted man is getting feelings for this girl that he has no chemistry with the leading female. Yikes! No way!Parts of this is really funny.I thought that they had no chemistry but that kiss in the art gallery was perfectly passionate and they were both encapsulated by it and brought more meaning to their relationship than they had ever dared. Although reluctant at the beginning they kissed over and over. They were both surprised especially him who had never even thought of having feelings for another human being. He had trained himself to be aloof, distant and indifferent. Suddenly their emotions had opened up a new conduit. Now things are a bit awkward for our leading man and woman. They pass it off as acting and laugh it off.The other couple who they were impersonating were having their own Korea experience and proposal with the the residents of Geumga Plaza.How did he know that assassins would come to the roof? He sent Hong Cha Young away to get beer. I rewound. He saw the two guys reflected in something. It's a warning when you hear him flicking that lighter opening and shutting. He thinks his foster brother sent them. He was right.How funny the pigeon came to help him. I knew they had to have some important role in this drama. It's a bit comedic really. You just have to smile.Wow! First time I've actually seen the antagonist actually break a persons arm when I often shout out break his arm. Was this a forewarning? He is so thankful to the pigeons. Then he says ""How can pigeon save a man?""Wow! This is comedic in places but it is also powerful. Don't try and double cross the Mafia. Is regret really the most painful thing in life? Have I got regrets. I do but they don't really bring me pain even at this stage in my life I still think I can fix them up.I can't believe people drink coffee that is civet poop. I'm glad I'm not a coffee drinker.These slow motion hugs are so good. Soong Joong Ki is such an outstanding actor. His small measured movements convey so much power and emotion. His face tries to be emotionless and stoic but they show a different meaning to the viewer.After they killed his mother he went on an arm breaking spree. I always wanted to see arm breaking and here it is at last. Now they will learn what real retribution is. So exciting so violent so bad. Just love it and even though I don't want to. I can wait for the finale. I hope that it is breathtakingly awesome.It pays not to wait to tell people that you love them. She was the only person that he was closely related to. This is so good but he can't die he is the main actor. First time I've ever said this in an Asian Drama.This drama was special. I loved it. It filled my predictions, hopes and of event anticipations.I was reading other peoples reviews and I don't agree with their negative thoughts. I watch movies drama to be entertained not to find faults with the productions. For me most of what I watch is entertaining and fun."
2464,Vincenzo,I loved the opening of the series and thought it was going to be a James Bond type show. It quickly turned into a drama comedy with little bits of action. I was slowly losing interest but I keep seeing reviews saying wait til ep4. We'll I'm saying the same thing. The action is finally back and the main character gets twice as cool. Hope this keeps up. If it does I may have to change my rating to a 9.
2465,Vincenzo,"Song Joong-ki's performance in this series is just incredible. Definitely matched or even outshined by Jeon Yeo-bin's performance. One of the most distinctive characters I have ever seen in my life. Shows how much work Jeon Yeo-bin put into the role. This series is so amazing thanks to the balanced give and take flow of the battle between the 2 fighting forces. Super funny and unexpected reveals about the characters makes this series unmatched. It's just surprisingly superb. Plus, you'll definitely love the vigilante side to it. It is so relevant to today's flood of corruption and crime around the world. This series will satisfy your hunger for everything you ever dream to see in a drama. A must watch!!!"
2466,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is a mafia lawyer of an Italian mafia group. He comes to Korea after their leader dies to take the gold that is worth millions of dollars hidden under the Geumga plaza. While trying to retrieve the gold he comes across a corporate company Babel that gets things done in an evil manner. So Vincenzo teams up with a competent lawyer Hong Cha young to take down the evil Babel group. What makes this show a stand out is the methods used to bring down the corporation. Vincenzo gives a taste of mafia to the evil corporate while at the same time tries to retrieve the gold.It is truly a glorious show and gets you hooked on to it from the first episode itself. The casting is fabulous and the actors have done a good job. The background score itself is sufficient for you to have goosebumps. Song Joong ki looks so cool and have pulled off a stunner with his mass appearances and action sequences. There is romance, action, comedy, crime and so on blended into the perfect ratio. Truly a delight for the lovers of the show. Try not to miss it!"
2467,Vincenzo,"The premise of Vincenzo immediately sparks interest: a Korean born yet Italian naturalized lawyer is a very stylish and cold consiglieri to an Italian maffia family. Through some criminal circumstances he finds himself back in South Korea looking to seize on a (literally) golden opportunity. He camps out in a building that is to be demolished and is surrounded by its weird and wonderful tenants, facing a choice: do I support these lower class citizens or do I take a more opportune road?What follows are a few very funny episodes that establish the many colorful characters and leave you grasping for answers. After what I can only describe as a very cool build up, in episodes three and four those questions get answered in ways that will surprise even the most knowledgeable viewers. By that time I was invested in the excellently written personas and the developments really hit home.Since it is a Korean series, the differences between the poor and the corrupt rich elite are once again highlighted (a common theme in the often excellent Korean cinema), but with a few great twists. The series has a quirky sense of humor and balances nicely between shocking real world maffia problems and fun. It uses Italian music tropes found in your average Hollywood maffia film in a Korean setting, which works out brilliantly.The stylish star of the show is both likeable and pretty scary at the same time while he's being tested in ways he did not even encounter during his time in the Italian maffia. It's a surprisingly fun ride, fantastically filmed and edited, has great use of music and had me thinking 'oh, hell yes' on several occasions.Sometimes it takes a monster to defeat other monsters. And as monsters go, Vincenzo is a definitely among the more compelling.A great watch."
2468,Vincenzo,"I've watched heaps of kdramas and while this story seems good and the lead guy is excellent, something about it is boring me to tears, and i'm only on Ep4. The lawyer woman annoys me as it seems like she's speaking with a marble in her mouth all the time, and some of the actors just don't seem to fit together. I'll keep watching as it takes more than this to switch it off, but I don't have overly high hopes. I hope to change my mins though."
2469,Vincenzo,It was recommended way too many times for me to not watch it. And I had pretty high expectations from it which it didn't fulfill. The problem is that the story is not enough for the length of the drama so it includes many unnecessary and unrelated to the story scenes which makes it a bit boring. Also I didn't like the ending of this one. There were many things which were left inconclusive.
2470,Vincenzo,"#Vincenzo (2021)
Such a GREAT K Drama Series. So well scripted and so enjoyable to watch.Its so amazing how these episodes NEVER seem to disappoint or find some way to twist and turn leaving you right on the edge.Just one thing ending should have been little better like I am not completely satisfied how it ended which makes me want a S2. Anyways I loved the show and every K-drama fan should give it a watch.#Netflix."
2471,Vincenzo,But this show right here is freaking great. Its a ride for sure so far. And I love the humor of the show. And the cast is so great. I like all the characters. And the main guy is a babe 😍 ❤
2472,Vincenzo,"Leading actress is overacting too much and annoying especially by trying to be funny Well not funny but outragesly boring on the other hand Vincenzo is swaggering that is not bearable
Story is simple though they try hard to make it complicated but It doesn't work I relied on some comments those said we should be patient after 4.th episode things would move faster and better. No way Why do they have to exaggrade everyting lots of meaningless screaming and the loud music of each action ??! Btw boss of Babel looks like Real teen. Anyway I think I will watch the last episode to end this torture."
2473,Vincenzo,"Not my usual fare in the world of KDRAMAS, but I have to say, Vincenzo was a great watch! Fantastic cast and script, this is another Studio Dragon slick production with wonderful visuals and soundtrack, thrilling fight sequences and generally, a real and powerful gripping and emotional journey. I could not stop watching once I'd started!! I really loved the cast and the leads are wonderful together!! Real magic between Song Jong-Ki and Jeon Yeon Bin. Wow!!! Thrilling to watch, from start to finish! Loved it!!"
2474,Vincenzo,"It was such a good series to have ended so open.After so many episodes, viewers would have liked to have some type of uplifting ending. So, this is my creation for a more ""fanciful"" ending.After leaving Korea, using the ""one year later"" time jump, Vincenzo - who has a wealth of information on corrupt dealings - has now been given some type of position with Interpol. He goes to the Korean-Italian conference and reunites with Hong Cha Young and they share that ""kiss moment"" under the stars and he leaves, only to return to Geumga Plaza and surprises all the quirky residents for some over the top sentimentality, with each resident having their own astonished encounter with Vincenzo. The Plaza and surrounding area is reborn so the city becomes revitalized thanks to the stash of gold that is being laundered and the funds are used just for that.Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo are married in the Buddhist Temple with the Plaza residents in attendance. They establish a law firm for those who have no political or social voice.In the revitalized building, Inzaghi the pigeon of karma returns to the window with...a family!I'm sure I missed a few other things, but I think viewers would have wanted that uplifting and well-done, tear-jerking finale."
2475,Vincenzo,"I find the serie too theatrical , so I didn't find it interesting anymore. I had high expectations because the serie has such a high rating. But it's not my thing."
2476,Vincenzo,"The first couple episodes were just ok and also there were some good plot twist and many funny moments.But the people in the building he owned were so annoying and the female leads trying so much to be funny with silly gestures. The more I watched the worse it got. The main characters were as evil as the bad guys, and that's saying something. The ending was very violent and I was very disturbed.In conclusion , there wasn't a moral of the story. Applaud the violence when it came from the ""good"" guys , there was not justice at all. It is so overrated."
2477,Vincenzo,"I'm only about half way through this serie - Still I gotta say this is one of the most enjoyable shows on Netflix right now.I don't know where it's going and frankly don't care. It's just one hell if a ride so far.Funny, entertaining well written and acted -you need to check this one out.Just hope there is a Season 2!"
2478,Vincenzo,"Definitely hooked! Was a little disappointed in Episode 1, but it gets better and better with each episode! And in episode 4, the big baddie's big reveal! OMG, I'd never have guessed it was ____!! The cat-and-mouse chase is starting. Let the games begin. I can hardly wait for the next episode to air.Great acting all around. Yes, some stereotyping of mafia, but everything I learned about them was through tv and movie portrayals, so oh well, just go with it. I love Song Joong-Ki. His acting is maturing and gets more seasoned in each progressive show. Dunno how he's got such flawless skin, but definitely a joy to watch. This type of show may not be for everyone, but there's enough humor, warmth, intrigue and edge-of-your-seat thrill to entertain many fans of K-drama."
2479,Vincenzo,The best korean tv series i have seen lately. Fun and crime together. Very enjoyable to watch.
2480,Vincenzo,"Ughhh. Gotta comment on 19th eps. 19th ending was very upset! When chairman brother attack his brother, In real life, it's the clear and the best option that other man at the risk should attack him together at the same time for sake to steal the gun and cut the risk to get shot. But film writer turns it into too drama and was too upset and too bad for the movie! Writer should have changed this scenario into more reality."
2481,Vincenzo,"This drama contains everything as Action, Thrill, Suspense, Emotions everything.Pure gold."
2482,Vincenzo,Vincenzo has different an story from usual korean drama. So if you were looking for a different korean drama it is your best choice. Not a single episode make you bore.
2483,Vincenzo,"I have pushed through the first 2-3 slow episodes, it's now getting better at episode 4.It would be so much more enjoyable if they comedy parts weren't so forced and cringe.But I do like most the characters especially the MC and the fake italian chef."
2484,Vincenzo,"I have watched a lot of K-dramas, but this one is right at the top of the best of them. It is almost a satire of The Godfather--or the mafia genre. Each time Vincenzo pulls off a ""mafia-style retort"" to the opposition, we get a little Mozart to go along with it. Feels so right! Vincenzo occasionally says something in Italian that also sounds amazing.I never thought I would see a K-drama like this. It is totally different than most. It is very refreshing to see something original when too often TV shows are just carbon copies of other popular shows.Watching this show gives me a feeling of comfort and pleasure. I almost didn't watch it because it warned of ""crime, fear, smoking"" which didn't sound very good to me. I am glad I did watch it. I go along with some other reviewers who say you should watch a few episodes before you judge it.I can't wait for the next episode and I wish this drama would never end."
2485,Vincenzo,"This one surprised me in a good way. I don't usually watch k-dramas that aren't centered around a romantic storyline, but I decided to give this one a try. This is a suspenseful and exciting drama that makes you root for the main character, even though his decisions aren't always the most ethical ones. Every episodes leaves you wanting more.However, this drama does somewhat romanticize the mafia. It's also very unrealistic, although that can be expected from a k-drama, so it didn't bother me."
2486,Vincenzo,"I binged watching this for only two days, which I don't think I'd do it for a K-drama, but this one is exceptional. I really love this drama, it is so good, funny and the main casts are so good looking. At first, I wasn't a fan of Song Joong-Ki, but it totally changed after watching him in this drama. His charisma is sooo on point as Vincenzo, and he really enchanted me with his magic. Surprisingly the soundtracks are also very well matched with every scene, even though most soundtracks are so classic with Italian vibes. And I also love Jeon Yeo-been and Kim Yeo-jin, they play the characters realllyyy reallyyyy well. Although the love scenes are very minimum in this drama, but I still really love it. I am so thrilled with the dark comedy offered in this drama."
2487,Vincenzo,"The female lead and her side kick are disasters. (well. The side kicks for the first few episodes)Overacting and jokes are corny. This should be a great show but these two slash half of the good rating.I can help but smile with all the 10, 9 insanely good, perfect ratings.Anyway, the story keeps dragging on for the sake of airtime. One can summarize the whole story in two minutes, how complicated can the plot be? However, I do like the endings when all the villains got the ending they so deserved."
2488,Vincenzo,"Image wise the series is pretty well filmed with the exception of a few scenes (like when Hong Yu Chan died and you see Vincenzo flying in the air).I would also say that some scenes also seem pretty unrealistic, like the court dynamics (and I'm not talking about the things that they did to delay the audition).Other than that the series is pretty good and interesting and I definitely recommend it."
2489,Vincenzo,"I screamed, laughed, and cried.Screenplay and cinematography, magnifico!!!Bravo to all the cast most especially to Song Joongki, Jeon Yeo-been, OK Taecyeon, and Kwak Dong-yeon!Joongki was so charismatic, as always!(Bakit wala kang pores?)
Yeo-been, you made me laugh and cry.I'm your fan now, Taecyeon! You're my 2nd favourite villain! Galing!Dong-yeon, I wish you'll have a starring role soon.I will miss you, Cassano Geumga Family!Vincerò!!!10/10""Friends are like one soul in two bodies."""
2490,Vincenzo,"As long as you put aside your logical and rational mind while watching the episodes, you'll have a good time. There is plenty of action, lots of comedic moments, and twists and turns. SJK once again plays a very cool character who outwardly is a hardened Mafia consigliere but inwardly has a sense of fairness, justice and heart. Like many K-dramas, the evil and greed are apparent in virtually every episode. And unlike most TV K-dramas, there is alot of fighting and shooting but those dark moments are interspersed with light, comedic moments. It is good escapist entertainment."
2491,Vincenzo,"Literally first episode was outstanding and later on after 3,4 episode watched you understand the plot and thrill starts after each episodes time by time. Little romance but acting and charm and such a lil comdey as well."
2492,Vincenzo,"Now that's how you create a dark comedy! The plot twists with action and humour. The cast, director and the writer did an amazing job here.Plus I absolutely love the score. It blends perfectly with the Italian and Korean backgrounds (kudos to the music director)"
2493,Vincenzo,It veered from cornball humour to some serious violence. It never made any pretence to being realistic so turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. Silly but quite bingeable.
2494,Vincenzo,"I've actually been clapping my hands with glee at the little in jokes (diehard food and coffee snob from Italy, trying and enjoying Korean instant coffee) and character development choices (no references here as I don't want to give any games away). Edit: I loved, loved, loved the reverse trope in the clothing shop!!!Still not sure if I'm enjoying the idea that you can only beat bad guys with an even bigger bad guy (as that seems antithetical to a number of the main character ideals) but overall the writing and plot twists are done well. Further edit after series completed: Definitely gets much darker, but makes you think and laugh and gasp along the way, so highly recommended!"
2495,Vincenzo,"Loved
1. One of the best anti-heroes (I've seen many)
2. Lots of social commentaries weaved into drama
3. Active interaction with the audience
4. Brilliant acting and direction with no unnecessary bloodshed
5. Lots of pop literature referencesQualms
1. Technical plot holes
2. PredictableVincenzo is our anti-hero who is devoted to family, reads books like how to befriend birds, and also takes revenge using the spear of atonement. He doesn't believe in serving justice, so he formulated a set of strict principles to avenge crime as a vigilante with calm precision.The show organically shifts between crime, comedy and romance so it feels quite realistic. The plot is- the fall of a psychopath, and how pain stacking difficult it is, thanks to the corrupt judicial system and government. I loved many pop culture references like the miserable ones, modern art and other classic super-rich mafia thrill. In terms of direction, the show is super engaging especially when it interacts with the audience by breaking the 4th wall and also empowering the average civilians within the show. There is no unnecessary bloodshed and nudity like the usual US made shows in this genre, and I appreciate that! The criminals, too get panic attacks like genuine humans :0The show is crime drama heavy so it fills you with adrenaline, but there are technical errors and plot holes. Still the overall script outshines those issues. And of course, to follow up for next seasons they made this one, highly predictable.Overall I loved this show. The social commentary, the drama, everything, kept me on the edge. It's an escapist fever dream from the real-life failures of our society. Can't wait for more."
2496,Vincenzo,"This was really fun to watch, and a surprising and enjoyable blend of thriller and comedy. Parts of it are very funny. I haven't seen a K drama like this before. The two leads are great, and Song Joong Ki plays a consigliere with a range of emotions, not just a flat revenge robot like in some of the anti-hero shows."
2497,Vincenzo,"Again, a Studio Dragon production.Perfect in every way.Acting, story line, music...It's a shame that those kind of diamond won't be recognise worldwide (almost, thank you Netflix!)"
2498,Vincenzo,"Best crime series
its like lucifer but million times better tHan lucifer
i watched in 2 days
HighlY recomended to watch."
2499,Vincenzo,"A trulY Masterpeice
Story 10/9
ActinG 10/10
Action scenes 10/10
HighlY recomended to WaTch
it remind me of lucifer but but million times better tHan lucifer."
2500,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is an unconventional K-drama. It is a common trope in dramas to have a ""good"" protagonist fighting against evil and injustice. However, in this story, it is evil vs evil, which gives the series a unique perspective. Fantastic work by all the actors, the writer, the director, and the crew. For those seeking a gripping drama with mafia, law, and action, this show is definitely worth watching."
2501,Vincenzo,I don't believe you should leave a review unless you watch the whole series otherwise you should leave a review on each episode I thought this was a very well done show and I think Netflix would be stupid not to renew it which is what I heard they're going to do is not renew it. I do wish the female lead had more screen time in the last couple of episodes.
2502,Vincenzo,"Ep 1 is all over the place. Ep 2 -20 irritating. I love Ok Taecyeon, Song Jung Ki. But even they can't save the series. Sorry not sorry this show doesn't deserve 8.5 on IMDB. What's wrong with you people."
2503,Vincenzo,"I'm watched Vincenzo series all episode 1 to 20, till episode 18 series gone nice but last 2 episode just okay because scenes goes very fastly and in every episode little comedy and Vincenzo character is awesome every character acting is very well. I have watched many Korean series but this is not up to the mark because hero everytime is win in this series but I like their ""justice system"" because in this era everyone goes corrupt and thugs so they have not honesty... In this web series those who like crime thriller action please watch this series. Because this is made for youNote:- I am not good in English."
2504,Vincenzo,"If the comedy isn't for you then fair enough. A comedy will never favour because not everyone has the same humour. However I personally think this show has a perfect balance of thriller, action, comedy and suspense. Those who judge shows after watching 1 episode I think are rather stupid. Obviously you're not gonna fully grasp the characters in episode 1/20...that's why there's more episodes. The acting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography is great, some parts you're not supposed to take seriously because they're for comedic purposes. I love the character development too it's amazing. I also love the storyline and the idea of a Korean - Italian mafia...it's quite interesting. I don't wanna give away too much but at least watch til ep 3-4 til you judge. It's definitely worth watching. I like how the romance between the two leads isn't super cliché and isn't the main focus either but it's still there, it's more of a slow burn romance between them. The action scenes are well shot and quite realistic too. Omg I could go on and on about this show I love it so much. Really looking forward to the ending I just finished episode 10 and I couldn't not be anymore eager."
2505,Vincenzo,"Despite the fact that there are 20 episodes and they each last almost one hour and a half, it's impossible to take off your eyes from the screen, definitely one of the best Korean series yet.I loved the development of each character and as an Italian I was mesmerized by the interpretation of Vincenzo, it's not easy to speak another language but he did an amazing job! The shots were amazing, I laughed so hard, I also cried so hard, for sure it's a 10/10, a must watch."
2506,Vincenzo,"Well this show was my first watching K-Drama and it was an amazing journey. The comedy was on point, which if not done correctly would have come of as cringey. Drama was there throughout the story and oh my god Vincenzo was awesome.Now lets see what I didn't like. The story was pretty generic and was predictable but that doesn't make the series bad what makes it bad is over stretching it. The entire story could have been completed with half the run time but there were so much filler. There's a sub-plot of the story which is supposedly very important but by the end of the series it turns out to be literally of no use. Too many glaring plot holes but I'm ready to ignore them because Vincenzo is awesome. That's also a problem in the pursuit to make Vincenzo great they made him not human, same goes for the villain. Other characters were good. Everyone else felt distinct and unique.It was clear that the writers cannot write a simple Romance subplot, which was disappointing as the actors were very beautiful and played there parts well but bad writing hurt their chemistry. The music is good and sound design is nice. Cinematography is very stylish and at times on the edge of being too much but i liked it.All in all, way too exhausting( about 26 hours and 40 minutes) but yeah you'll enjoy it..and forget it too. I gave it a good score as the comedy held the show together,eventhough the story felt overstretched at times multiple twists will keep you hooked, don't expect to get closure in romance side, message given is "" Money, intelligence, good looks, and ruthlessness if present then anything is possible"" as if no one knew that.Thanks for reading."
2507,Vincenzo,"I don't know how to describe it, but this series is very interesting. I always laugh in every episode of LOL, a story that is mixed with comedy, drama, crimes, mafia, and romance. Really recommend for Netflix serial."
2508,Vincenzo,"I thought mixing Maffia with Korea Drama can not be good - but it was a brilliant series, every episode exciting and never a dull moment. We don't know what to do know now without Vincenzo! Soundtrack is also outstanding. A little bit Ocean 11 meets K-Drama. WE LOVED IT."
2509,Vincenzo,"'a Korean-Italian mafia lawyer' ehh? allright. Only problem is nothing is convincing about the character. Maybe its the writing or that actor himself but there is no authencity to him as an italian lawyer. Not to mention all the cliche you would expect from a Korean show surface within first two episodes. Koreans obsession with Europe and how they romantacise west in their shows is another topic for discussion which i wont get into. But have you noticed that the main lead in korean shows always have some connection with west? I guess it makes them cool and someone with higher status if they have some Italian, American, French etc in their background? anyhow. It could be an interesting premises but so far nothing seems to convince me that he is some hardass lawyer. Everything seems too forced. 4/10 for me."
2510,Vincenzo,I have watched more than 100 of kdramas so far and this one is epic. Ofcourse my favorite part was song joon ki but the plot was wonderful. The writers and directors have done a fantastic job with the other crew members. Every single actor/tress had done a wonderful job to bring this drama to us. You should definitely give this a try. Believe me.
2511,Vincenzo,Good story...... U can watch if you like crime story.
2512,Vincenzo,"Best action comedy kdrama feels like James bond movie , you can definitely enjoy this drama. Vincenzo character is awesome ,his acting skills is superb. I would definitely recommend you to watch this drama. Plaza society is awesome all characters good . Thier comedy is superb. And actress acting also superb , she done her job greatly. Love from India ."
2513,Vincenzo,"I literally finished the last episode 10 mins ago.This is the best asian drama I've ever watched.The story, the writing, the music, the action, the SUITS (bows down to costume design team and stylists) and of course the love story were all perfection. Perfectly bittersweet in true Korean Drama fashion but totally fit the bill this time around.The two most compelling characters in this whole series is Vincenzo and Jang Han Seok. Those two .....SMHI'll take a line right from the show:"" So far, we've been like vigilantes. But after this, we'll be monsters.""These two are some of my favourite villains of all time. The are so good and both these actors played their roles to actual perfection.I can't say enough good things about this show and I am going to be rewatching it again before the end of the year.*Standing Ovation*This is gold *smirk*Watch the show to get the reference.Have fun."
2514,Vincenzo,"The first episodes were okay, although it was a bit boring and there were some plot twist that I did not expect it, but after the 4 episode things became more and more boring....nevertheless I struggled to watch until the end
SO DISAPPOINTED
not only the end but the whole story together
there are a lot of jokes that are so cringeeee
there was no separation between good and bad,and it do not offer any good message to the viewersI do not recommend it to anyone
ONLY IF you want to waste your time!"
2515,Vincenzo,"Quality koren tv series
Best of the best...got to keep watching until episode 5 the action 🎬 will start.."
2516,Vincenzo,I am not a Korean but i guarantee if you like good content this is definitely a must watch ... it will keep you hooked as you pass the 3rd episode...Amazing show ... Cant believe its coming to an end.
2517,Vincenzo,"I am from Pakistan, dont know korean language at all but the show is so good that i got glued to it, go past first 3 episodes and the magic spell will take you to new heights, you will love each n every character. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2518,Vincenzo,"The low reviews are perplexing. Makes you wonder about the people writing them - they must have an agenda. Its humor is what makes it a jewel. Never laughed out loud so much in any Korean show, and I've been watching them for many years. Moreover, people overlook its social value. It highlights how out of control corruption has gotten, and that a paradigm shift of attitude and approach will be necessary to fight the elite stranglehold on power that exists pretty much all over the world now. I think this goes over most people's heads, sadly. For most people, the series is just entertainment. For me, it's a strategy. Excellent cast and acting. I sure hope the brilliant team that did this show gives us more."
2519,Vincenzo,"This is the coolest kdrama in my life I really like that Vincenzo Cassano is really cool, invincible, smart, lives fairly in the world of criminals. Every episode that gets more exciting and surprising in the action of Vincenzo. This kdrama features a lot of cool, satisfying and interesting, hilarious acts with the Plaza Geumga team family. DAMN! I really like Vincenzo Cassano and really the best KDrama and enjoy it as much as possible."
2520,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo started slow with episodes 1 and 2, but by episode 4, the ride was incredibly fast that I was reluctant to call it a day after hours of bingeing over the weekend. It is incredible how a single series can manage to be within seconds funny, serious, suspenseful, thrilling, and towards the end, scary. Yet the quick shifts in tone and mood did not feel jarring or distracting. The plot twists and turns kept me at the edge of my seat.That Vincenzo, in the end, reverts to being the sadistic, violent, and scary member of the Mafia is strangely forgivable, because well... he is with the Mafia.What I liked:
1. Cast - Soong Joong-ki seemed to have been tailor fit for his role. Despite his smooth handsome-ness, he managed to be eerily merciless and soul-less when he had to. The rest of the ""Cassano family"" of Geumga Plaza were a riot.2. Storyline - the story is simple, and was carried more by the acting and script. I found myself laughing out loud by myself yet at times hiding behind pillows especially during the last episode. One moment I was laughing at the Guemga Cassano family, the next moment I could barely watch Vincenzo's torturing his enemies.3. Script - catchy, fast. If this were a book, I'd be speed-reading it, hardly able to wait for each chapter to get to the next. The funny parts were not comedic, exaggerated, nor slapstick. The sting operations were well-thought off. It reminded me so much of Ocean's 11, but this was Korean-style.4. Soundtrack - helped a lot in the shift of moods. Serious moments were broken by sudden changes in soundtrack mood. Choice of music was excellent.What made my ranking short of 10 are the few lapses and gaps in logic, but easy to let pass:
1. I can understand that the whole time, Han-seok and Vincenzo were playing cat and mouse and didn't want to kill each other for the thrill of it. But towards the end, after leaving prison, Han-seok wanted Vincenzo dead once and for all. Couldn't he have just gone to Vincenzo's small settlement unit that didn't even have a security lock, and just shot him dead? They could have at least shown a failed attempt at this.2. That thing about Inzaghi and a whole flock of pigeons saving Vincenzo' life.... I have very mixed feelings about this. If there was one thing I was not expecting to be built into the script, it was a minute of fantasy.I was satisfied with the ending. It wasn't open, yet a gap left for a (hopeful) season 2. Minor lapses notwithstanding, this is a show that brought me to one helluva ride. Will definitely watch again."
2521,Vincenzo,"I get what People say about the show being to corny. It started of great, I was all in, even watching 2 episodes subsequently.He's a great character, being played very well. She was goofy and somewhat funny at first, but started to annoy me a bit after a while.There are a lot of good laughs, don't get me wrong. And the story was interesting. But it all just feels a bit too stretched sometimes, and some of the joking and banter aren't really that funny.The show seems to get more goofy and wacky as it continues.. Or maybe it's only now starting to bore me. Somewhere around episode 10-11 I began to watch only half an episode and later on the other half. Now I even stopped a couple of times after 20 minutes. But now, I finally gave up at episode 14, I don't think I'm gonna finish watching. Ii just lost my interest, to continue watching."
2522,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo popped up on my Netflix feed after finishing Kingdom, which in my opinion is one of the best zombie movie/series out there.Vincenzo starts off with a blast, pun intended, and stays pretty steady. However I can't give it a 10 for two reasons: the lead actress and drawing out the episodes.After I got over the initial sour taste of the kdrama formula, which seems to be an odd mix of slapstick comedy and overt violence, I stayed on board through all twenty movie-length episodes. Did you read that? Twenty movie-length episodes. The cat and mouse between Vicenzo and Han Seok was great at times but it became so exhausting that by episode 16 I was like just finish them already!!!!I'm in agreement with several other reviews, the female lead was a weak link. So much so, I fast forwarded over some of her scenes. She wasn't funny and her behavior was more immature/clownish for a lawyer. She only became palatable when she became more of a straight man towards the middle of the series.All in all this was a really good series. The acting was exceptional and the cat and mouse between Vincenzo and Han Seok kept me watching, albeit exhausted, till the end. And I'm even anticipating season 2, if there is one. The episodes just needed to be cut down/or out."
2523,Vincenzo,"I started watching and then I left it, I hate stupid gangsta movies, because the whole thing becomes the question of morality, the Mafia becomes good, falls in love have kids and the end.Vincenzo, it was like revisting childhood, it felt like I was reading a super funny brainy graphic novel , I was in awe of the character Vincenzo. It respects the idea of evil because we are really are not always good or right, we are bad too, and the lesson ushered by the main character will stay with me for life .It is an intelligent series, it was only unbelievable once when pigeon saves Vincenzo but I like that too because I am a romantic, rest was a very well researched plot with good looking people.After you have watched it, either you will become Vincenzo or you will want a Vincenzo of your ownPS Vincenzo is beautiful."
2524,Vincenzo,"I didn't expect much from this show at all. In fact I expected to not even finish the first episode. But boy I'm glad I did.This show surpassed my expectations in the very best way. The show is original and very well written and paced out. Song Joon-ki is awesome, amazing and sexy as hell as Vincenzo. He embodies the role whole heartedly. He makes you laugh, makes you cheer him on to kick ass and tugs on your heart strings. I was incredibly impressed with his skill and dedication to this role. The supporting cast are endearing and throughout the series you get to know a little bit about each one. There is surprisingly a lot of humor, which is honestly a relief because without it the show would be very dark. If I had one gripe it would be sometimes I thought the episodes where a tad long. But on the other hand, you just get to spend more time with Vincenzo and his ragtag group of friends so didn't mind it.This show is just flat out awesome. So much better that whatever Hollywood is peddling out. I hope there's a season two, this show totally deserves it!"
2525,Vincenzo,"Some say that nothing about this drama is realistic. Others say that the hype is exaggerated. In my case, it is hand down the best drama I've seen. I'm amazed at the many details they put into this drama. The small facial ticks of Joon-Woo when he gets angry, the little smirk Vincenzo gives his foes when he's about to make his surprise move, and Cha-Young's little confidence boost when she's in a dangerous situation. My favourite scenes are those where Vincenzo breaks character, in which he feels uncomfortable. You clearly see our beloved consigliere fighting an internal battle, and thinking
about a way to end this circus show. But when he is about to make a move on his 'chessboard', there is no sign of that man.I have no bad words about this drama. It isn't your typical drama about romance and self-discovery in which most of time you can usually predict the outcome. No, it's filled with well-thoughted out unpredictable plots twists. Like the characters, you are filled with adrenaline and emotions. Sitting in the edge of the couch, you are literally screaming at your screen, applauding their victories and (maybe) crying when something bad happens.I recommend watching this drama!"
2526,Vincenzo,"While it takes around 3-4 episodes, Vincenzo is undeniably an underrated series that gets overlooked due to the fact it's a K-drama. Although the medium has a reputation for having excessive amount of romance (from what I've heard), Vincenzo is nothing like that, the mild amount of romance does not affect the story in any way.The first 4 episodes are slightly predictable, the rest of the show is a Rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of the seat.The main character of Vincenzo - Vincenzo Cassano is also really great. Well-written, charming and a straight up overpowered badass, he takes on multiple foes using his wit and experience as a mafia accompanied by a great cast of side characters who are equally as likeable.The show touches on the subject of human greed and Vincenzo must deliver Justice while at the same time tries to grow into a more humble person despite his past life."
2527,Vincenzo,"It's pleasing to watch indeed, but I feel I couldn't really relate with the mafia background. Weak, little drawing about this setting, way too superfluous. The main actor here to me is more like a badass business consultant, rather than a mafia lawyer."
2528,Vincenzo,Slow start but it's getting much better. Episode 4 was really good! A shocking surprise I did not expect at the end. I'm truly looking forward to the next episode.
2529,Vincenzo,Mixture of dark & comedic elements. Good acting by most of the casts despite some logical flaws. Fun and satisfying to watch!
2530,Vincenzo,"Mostly I watch tv shows.. So when I watched the trailer on netflix I thought Let's give it a try.. We,the american/british tv show watchers will found it a lot cringe. But but but!! It's sweet! It's sweet because of the cast,It's sweet because It's cringe but the cast and some of the storyline makes it funny. It's definitely enjoyable! So the People who don't watch kdramas must watch this. And SONG JONG KI!! My god!! This maaaaan!!! Best!! Happy watching."
2531,Vincenzo,"I thought this was going to be so serious but I was laughing with every episode. The cast, every member even the villains are wonderful, it made me laugh, made me cry, made me want to watch more shows with every cast member. Would definitely recommend."
2532,Vincenzo,"There is almost nothing about this show that I didn't love, from the slick James Bond-style title scene to the cherub-faced mobster dealing out vigilante justice with a badass lawyer by his side. I've seen some other reviews that didn't like the humour, so I just wanted to say that this style of wacky comedy is exactly my type - absurd, and not too serious! Sometimes dark comedies can get rather grotesque, and while Vincenzo doesn't shy away from gory scenes, gruesome injuries and death are never the subject of the jokes. Engaging characters, plenty of action and an excellent soundtrack make this all around a show that is well worth watching!"
2533,Vincenzo,Anyone who's watched this will know who I'm talking about in my title ! Excellent Excellent portrayal Song Joong-ki ! 🤙👏👏
2534,Vincenzo,It's so interesting at first but then gets boring so I couldn't complete all episodes.
2535,Vincenzo,"This series surprised me. It had serious, dark and funny moments. The characters were interesting and had their own secrets and back stories. The further you went along the story the more you found out about each character, and it didn't disappoint. Action packed, good começo relief moments and some resonance. I really hope they make a second season."
2536,Vincenzo,"OMG!!! The way episode 4 ended. If they can continue this pace, action and thrill, it'd be one of the best thriller K-Drama ever made..."
2537,Vincenzo,"Never given a 10 before but this has to be 10/10 original storyline as usual, great mix of humour violence, love and friendships, this is my 6th Korean series now and by far the best, subtitles can be frustrating as you have to really concentrate, but I know it wouldn't be the same without the original speech, the usual mix of food and drink and corrupt people everywhere, great characters and acting.Just finished e18 and now have to wait for the next 2 aarrgh."
2538,Vincenzo,"I gave 8 stars. (minus 2 stars because it's way longer and it could have been shorter). I didn't found the comedy scenes funny. I didn't like it.And last, i liked SJK and Kwank Dong-Yeon's Acting. I really liked their acting."
2539,Vincenzo,"I love it this series..... Song jong-ki sir is looking cool & awesome...The characters, cinematography every single thing is perfect. Everyone played their roles beautifully. The storyline itself is so good that it doesn't make you disappointed at all....
.......The plot is interesting and every episode will have a lots of ups and downs and it will leave you at the edge of cliff. For me, watching each episode and then waiting for another episode was an amazing experience...Fabooo.."
2540,Vincenzo,"I have to say I started watching K-Dramas early this year. I randomly picked Stranger (Bimilui Soop) season one and when it finished I could hear a click inside my head. South Korean TV shows are in a golden era. Period. After that I've seen many- and I mean MANY - south-korean series. Some are good. Some are VERY good. Few are outstanding. Vincenzo is one of those. Some K-Dramas start very strong with a very good premise. The seasons are long - usually 18 episodes - wich I love as oppose to Netflix' 8 episode standard.Problem is, some of them start decaying by mid-season and entering in a kinda loop of what I'm gonna call 'reminders' - remind me that love, remind me that song, remind me that character's line. And that love (again)... over and over- There's practically none of that here. The characters (and the writing) are busy enough through the 20 episodes not to fall in that cliché. Keeps the bar pretty high through the entire season.As for the acting.. Oh, boy. It's been some time since I loved every single one of the characters in a show. And I don't want to spoil anything to those whom might read this lines. The outstanding support cast does a fantastic job. The main characters are first class. Song Joong-ki, and Yeo-bin Jeon are great in their roles. But I would give an award to every one of the characters (that lawyers, that father, mother, that brothers, that community) as they made me happy and sad and laugh and cry and frightened and relief. You are amazing. I'll remember you. No question.P. S. Hi, good people from Studio Dragon. That goes for you as well. Keep the bar high. Thank You."
2541,Vincenzo,"I've just watched until ep 13 because the rest haven't released yet. So far, it's very good. Great acting, great scenes, the best kdrama i've watched so far. I can't really feel the main lead chemistry on their romantic scenes. But it's okay since this show has a great plot and story, especially the comedy scenes that always made me laugh 😂."
2542,Vincenzo,"I'm very sure that S2 will be weird and not as popular as S1. I would be really happy if i could see hanseo in S2, but since hanseo is dead, don't make S2."
2543,Vincenzo,"All of cast of vincenzo really have a great acting skill. I'm also glad that the writer-nim dodn't add more romantic scene since this drama is not a romance drama.But pls don't make S2, i'm sure it'll be weird and not as popular as S1. Also, i'm very disappointed when hanseo dead in the final ep. I wouls like to see S2 with hanseo, but since he is dead, don't make S2."
2544,Vincenzo,"I cannot express how much I loved this drama. It has the perfect balance of everything - drama, tragedy, comedy, chemistry. It does not fall short on entertainment. The kind of series you cannot look away from. The main leads - Song Joon-ki and Jeon Yeo-been have done a phenomenal job as has the rest of the cast. The villains are villainy enough that you do not feel sorry for them even once. There is no trope of bad man having a soft spot for the female lead. No overt sexual tension but enough undercurrent to keep you hooked. No excessive sentimentality from anyone. The perfect balance!"
2545,Vincenzo,"It's a bit more bold than the usual k-drama. The Mafia bit was a nice touch, I didnt get why everyone felt the need to overestimate themselves and underestimate the enemy over and over like it made sense to keep making the same mistake."
2546,Vincenzo,"How to best describe Vincenzo? On the surface it seems like the Godfather meets Korean drama and the premise looks promising. In practise, I can at best describe it as a strange mix of black comedy, mixed with action and horror elements. Truly a strange mix, which ends up being confusing and you end up on a rollercoaster, but one that is moving in all directions!The whole story did not make any sense and was far from credible and may be culturally insensitive. A Korean adoptee who can speak fluent Korean and Italian with a heavy Korean accent. Right...! The development of the characters was stale and the plot twists may be surprising, but totally ridiculous.The sub-plot where Vincenzo was gay baiting someone was truly offensive. In this time of inclusion, I found this highly cringe and insensitive. It may be normal for a Korean audience, but in the rest of the world this is not done.We see through the episodes the violence escalating. Where it starts relatively innocent, it escalates into something increasingly more gruesome and gore. Culminating in the torture and demise of the antagonists: stabbing in the neck where we see blood pouring out, live burning of a woman and the slowly drilling to death of the ""end boss"". It intends to shock and wrap up the story, but I found it unnecessary, unsatisfactory and out of context with the vibe of the other episodes.The acting of some characters was quite good though, notably the main protagonist Vincenzo (Song Joong-ki) and the antagonists Choi Myung-hee (Kim Yeo-jin), Jang Han-seo (Kwak Dong-yeon) and Jang Han-seok (Ok Taec-yeon). I can appreciate their performance. It is just that everything else was incoherent and a confusing mess.And what about the take home message of Vincenzo? There is no justice in this world. An eye for an eye. Torture and killing is okay. It is okay to take matters in your own hand. How can you spread such a message? Truly incredible!"
2547,Vincenzo,Perfect casting and story never gets boring anywhere even though each episode is more than hour and I particularly like all action and humour mixed together so well.
2548,Vincenzo,Not everyone might like this kind of comedy. But I liked the overall story. Worth the watch!
2549,Vincenzo,Good but too much overacting of the actress. Overall good series and good story.
2550,Vincenzo,"This show is written very well. It has a good mixture of comedy, romance, and action. This show is so cool and especially in episode 3 and 4 when the show starts to pick up. So excited for the ending."
2551,Vincenzo,"You would be thrilled, amazed, wondered and eventually you people will fall for all the character's. Guys do watch it and don't ever miss this super amazing series'..
You are going to love this💯!!"
2552,Vincenzo,"I liked this series from the beginning. But wanted to wait to a point when I can actually write a review. After watching episode 16, I'm just dying for the next. I'm just hoping this series ends well with the rest of the four episodes.A MUST watch."
2553,Vincenzo,"Only one word in my mind excellent🔥🔥🔥Start with story excellent,
Acting excellent,
Drama excellent,
Action excellent,
Thrill elements excellent,If you thought to watch this drama, you should watch first 3 episodes with patients BCz many people after first one or to episode judge this drama which is not good BCz main storyline and thrill elements start after 3rd episodes and each the episodes completed with cliffhanger 🔥🔥So my request for all people watch this amazing drama with excellent ending, but I am waiting for 2nd season if it possible 😊"
2554,Vincenzo,This gangster/mafia story is not a new concept. Watching in K Drama do excites the viewers. If you like this genre GO FOR IT.Personally I feel the series a little bit slow paced and unnecessary drama.The ending is escalated till 4 episodes which is not watching worth while. It can be done in 2 episodes. K drama carrying 20 episodes should give a ending blast but this drama fails to do that.IF you personally liked the main character you want to see a harsh judgement made by him which is clearly missing. After episode 12 it feels slightly moving on slow pace.
2555,Vincenzo,"Superb webseries, awesome acting by Korean actors. I am really missing this show in my Life. Everything is there in the show comedy, thrill, drama, romance. Superb background music. Totally it's a master piece from Korea. Would love to watch it's season 2."
2556,Vincenzo,"It was an amazing series , everything was just perfect, except for the last episode, from my opinion , the killing was so cruel, it seems like vincenzo remembered that he was a mafia member 😅
And about the gold, they forgot the split it
Taec did his job just perfect."
2557,Vincenzo,"A show where the lead is well ahead of others, though the barbaric antagonists are creepy and crude, the male lead also doesn't give in at all.I watched it while it was airing, so it kept my curiosity going well.Full entertainment."
2558,Vincenzo,"I've actually been clapping my hands with glee at the little in jokes (diehard food and coffee snob from Italy, trying and enjoying Korean instant coffee) and character development choices (no references here as I don't want to give any games away). Still not sure if I'm enjoying the idea that you can only beat bad guys with an even bigger bad guy (as that seems antithetical to a number of the main character ideals) but overall the writing and plot twists are done well. Highly recommended at this stage."
2559,Vincenzo,"Entertaining, gripping plot. Once you start watching, you just won't be able to stop. Yes, the plot is this good and Song Jongki's acting is top-notch. The chemistry between the leads is off the charts, though it's not a romantic drama, and there is a good amount of comedy, which balances the darker scenes. I would describe Vincenzo as an emotion rollercoaster, sometimes you are laughing out loud and are then taken aback by a dramatic, suspenseful scene. What I didn't like was the portrayal of Vincenzo in the last episodes, something which I will not spoil happened and he seemed far too passive and unprepared compared to how badass and cunning he had been shown to be. However, the ending did the character justice, so it was realistic enough. All in all, this drama is top-notch for me. If you are wondering whether or not to watch this, just do it already. I promise you won't regret it!!!"
2560,Vincenzo,"Initial concept was nice but had poor execution. Why did all the characters have to have comic element to them?? The only character that felt fairly normal was the Lawyer, but then he was killed off after couple of episodes.I am amazed how this drama got the rating above 8. I could not even get past episode 5. Just could not take it anymore."
2561,Vincenzo,"I love this film, just love it to be honest. I love how it ddnt focus much on emotions. Great work!!"
2562,Vincenzo,"Only monsters can kill monsters! Yes, and love that the bad guys here, who are very bad, are meeting their match. I read the other review and it makes me wonder if the author works for a competing studio? I've enjoyed every minute of the first four episodes and am looking forward to the rest. Another Studio Dragon hit. Bravo!"
2563,Vincenzo,"One of the best kdramas...
It contains.. Comedy, action, thriller, mystery ,romance.. Oh yes.. Charming cast also.. It's the best example of AATMANIRBHAR... 😌😌.. Go watch it... U surely won't regret it..."
2564,Vincenzo,"Effeminate ML and effeminate villain quite cringe & they don't fit the look for their roles. - The acting isn't bad it's average from most of the cast - Too much comedy for something as serious as mafia became annoying and overused. I enjoy slapstick comedy & find it funny but this drama overdid it & it became too predictable and even overshadowed the main storyline to some degree. Decent drama but you decide, it's just became very average/regular k-drama to me towards episode 8-10 so I dropped it."
2565,Vincenzo,"This series is too amazing.. Vincenzo Cassano character is ultimate.. Most of the scenes full of goosebumps,, worth watch."
2566,Vincenzo,"2 episodes in and everything is looking great . Character development, story telling, motive, funny BGM , screenplay and not a single boring moment."
2567,Vincenzo,"As someone who has never seen k-drama I was hesitant to watch this at first. But after giving it a try I can say without a doubt, that this is definitely an amazingly well-crafted Thriller series.The show has really great themes on the ascepts of Justice and Human evil, with a lot of well-crafted plot twists that wouldn't know what would happen next. It takes a lot of Italian mafia elements and makes it into it's own style. I also hear that a lot of k-drama have some excess amounts of romance and rom-com but Vincenzo isn't one of those, there are obviously romance scenes here and there, but they're at a tolerable amount and do not distract you from the main story, it's primary focus is the Thriller and comedy aspects.It's a perfect blend of Thriller, Action and Comedy although I'll agree that not everyone can get accustomed to the k-drama-esque comedy and may even find it cringey at times. But you're able to look past that, I'm sure you will have an amazing experience."
2568,Vincenzo,"Very well done, the series is a multi layered story but are all somehow related. Downside was Jon Woo is too good looking to be the main villain."
2569,Vincenzo,"I rarely take the time to review shows and movies on IMDB, but this show deserves every bit of praise it can get. Hands down the best show combining thriller, comedy, and action I have ever watched. Yes, every show out there has it flaws, but some of the moments and emotions this show gave me, ranging from sadness, joy, humour, nerve-wrecking excitement and so on, was just incredible. What an amazing journey from start to end. Speechless."
2570,Vincenzo,"Just finished watching the season finale, having watched 1-2 episodes of Vincenzo every day.I started watching it on Netflix UK out of idle curiosity after seeing the giant thumbnail. I got hooked, and so did my family. I'm someone who has accidentally got into KDramas due to lockdown.Vincenzo is a superb thriller, with comedy breaks in it to reduce the tension when it gets too taut.It as about 4 plots, sub-plots, and is (except for the occasional lapse) VERY well written. And the writers delight in mixing genres- gangster, legal drama, heists- to name but a few. And they delight in fooling the audience.It is EXTREMELY well cast.Song Joong-ki is phenomenal in the title role. Cool, a strategist, always elegantly suited and booted, he plays a Korean who was adopted by Italians and grew up in a Mafia family, rising to the role of consigliere. He uses his intellect against opponents, taking on corrupt lawyers, politicians, businessmen, judges, prosecutors.But he can also be extremely violent when necessary.Jeon Yeo-been is also well cast as a feisty, designer clad, relentless, sharkish corporate lawyer Hong Cha-young, turned fighter for justice who becomes his partner in legal vigilantism after her idealistic father is murdered by corporate baddies.The villains are many. And varied in their villainy. K-Dramas can do female villains extremely well, some are absolutely frightening and Kim Yeo-jin was a standout as a truly evil woman, Choi Myung-hee, a lawyer more deadly than any thug. The ultimate baddy is terrifying. A psychotic sadist who can be harming one minute, vicious the next. Don't want to give the actor's name as he's a surprise twist!The supporting cast were amazing. I became a huge fan of the actors who portrayed the shopkeeper-residents of an ageing mall...where years before a Chinese criminal and Vincenzo had hidden in a vault under the mall basement, billions worth of gold bars statues... and a usb stick with info on corrupt bigshots in Korea that could bring down the rich and powerful. The mall residents have their own stunning reveals, in the twisting, turning plot.Vincenzo's departure from Italy after a brief power struggle, returning to Korea to retrieve the gold, is the catalyst for a roller coaster chain of events that had me and my family gasping, shrieking, hiding our eyes, and bingeing on this dramatic feast. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was some unnecessary weakness in the writing in parts of the last 2 episodes.I can't recommend it too highly."
2571,Vincenzo,"I highly recommend this to anyone that likes the revenge theme. It also feels very different from other k-series. It does not get cheesy nor fluffy. It stays serious until the very last episode. In my opinion it was an acceptable end because we all know there is no way out of mafia and the main character does not turn 'back good', he stays true to himself that he is not a good person and what he has done can't be undone or justified. I feel sorry for Jang Han seo because I really liked his character. He started to grow and be truly free of his abusive brother that's why I felt sorry for him but hey, it was his own decision to put a fight. Anyway, it has some comedy as well along the line but the same time it's a solid serious to watch."
2572,Vincenzo,"It's a average korean novel, those who like korean cultural elements may like it, but it's not for me. Now, I'm not a newbie to korean shows and I know they can be a little silly. But silliness in this show is just too much. Poor acting by FL and ML both, specially FL. She just ruined every scene she was in.This definately doesn't deserve 8.5 ratings."
2573,Vincenzo,"Loved the drama. This is my first Korean drama. Action, romance, comedy.. what else do you need??To those who got tired after third episode, just have patience to watch the fourth episode."
2574,Vincenzo,"Holy cow I did not expect this show to get ridiculously good within a few episodes after the initial 2 or 3 weird and kinda awkward episodes. This show has it all, gangsters/mafia, love drama, revenge, betrayals, comedy and a whole cast of amazing actors. Some I initially hated, grew on me so much that I am cheering for them. This show has one of the most intelligent writing I have ever seen displayed on a screen. This is the longest review(and maybe 2nd one) I have ever written, and this show might just be the greatest show I have ever watched. And that says alot coming from a non Korean, born in Oslo, ethnically Somali."
2575,Vincenzo,Starts very interesting and looks promising but by 10th episode towards the end it's frigging insufferable. Melodramatic is an understatement. Only for Joong Song Ki fans.
2576,Vincenzo,"Good acting. Mafia theme And space for romance, friendship and Revenge of course! Well done for the director too! Dragon Studios always do good. You will laugh and cry and have fun!"
2577,Vincenzo,"As someone who loves violence, plot twists and thrillers, this kdrama has rarely anything at all. The story is very dull leading to many plot holes and bad character writing. This is more of a comedy rather than a thriller or dark kdrama. The trailer was one of the biggest baits. The actors did well, which is why the rating is a bit higher, otherwise I'll give it a 3."
2578,Vincenzo,"Dear Vincenzo CastHello this is a Fan of Vincenzo drama. First off all I thank the makers of the drama for gifting me with such a great piece of work. All the things including CGI were great. The acting cast as well as staff did their job as perfectly as they could not giving me a single chance to find a mistake. I am really satisfied with the drama. Its may 2 today and the last episode was aired today. I was really waiting for this episode as well as didn't wanted this drama to end, but as we all were anticipated for a great and happy ending. It was thrilling. This drama made me laugh, cry when Jang Han Seo died (I am angry with this one. I was crying for about half and hour😢) , made me feel better. I had the best experience of my life throughout these 20 episodes. I lived my life in this world with all of them. Anticipated for season 2.Kimaya,
A member of cassano family."
2579,Vincenzo,"This movie is in Korean with English subtitles. Each episode is around 1.5 hours and there are 20 episodes. That's almost 30 hours of my life I'd spend reading subtitles- I was not about to do that. Never!!!However, the first 5 minutes caught me like a mouse in a mouse trap. I couldn't stop watching. It's a lovely series. It's over the top, sometimes exaggerated, the overacting is funny and just works. The serious moments are on point. The slow motion shots make me chuckle- Everything just works.Vincenzo Cassano in an Italian suit made me feel bad about myself. I went and got cleaned up after watching the series- no more sloppy jeans and tees for me.This of just one of those things in life that you'll just totally love or totally hate. I just happened to love it."
2580,Vincenzo,"This is one of the best K-Drama I've ever watched, aside from Reply 1988. If you're a person who can't stand too much romance, this is the K-Drama for you. Even those who never watched any K-Drama love this one.It's genuinely funny, it made my day. All of the cast's acting are so good and entertaining.This is basically an action comedy series wrapped in the world of lawyers and mafia. Almost like those crime movies the people love but 100% more entertaining.The writing is genius, the plot is quite unpredictable. The crisis are well-developed, and the character's solutions for it are impressive - almost unthinkable. The conversations are natural and hilarious, even the smallest details are well-thought of and well-executed.The character's backstory and motives that pushes them are strong, so strong that you won't just fall in love with the heroes but also with the villains."
2581,Vincenzo,"It's not the worst drama but it's not the best either. Too many slow motions, and unnecessary background music. The fanatics people in the building just make it worse, and they always overreacting. I thought that they would fight for justice of the lead actress's father but it never came!"
2582,Vincenzo,"You can see the cast had a lot of fun making this Italian/Korean would-be mafia thriller, the sort of fun NOT experienced in Hollywood since the days of Burt Reynolds. Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!"
2583,Vincenzo,"I won't lie, the beginning was very slow and boring for me. However, it gets much better and exciting. I personally liked the ending and don't think this drama needs a season 2 because then it will just drag it on. Also, han-seo's death was very tragic and i really hoped he would have a happy ending but other than that, this drama was definitely worth watching !!"
2584,Vincenzo,No spoiler just wanna say highly recommended. You will know it after watching.
2585,Vincenzo,"Why?Such a nicely written and directed series it was, except last two episodes. Seems like writer and producer of the series lost track of the story. The time when friend was fighting with the enemy, instead of helping him, the key character was doing unnecessary things like untying rope(which surely can be done later) and watching the fighting! Hah!!Same happened to the Game of Thrones also. In the last season, they rushed so much that, that ruined the whole show.Pathetic to see such pathetic ending of an otherwise great show!"
2586,Vincenzo,"I love this show.It has amazing character development, acting, writing, story, humor. It's absolutely fantastic.Some have compared it to James Bond but I think that undersells it. If you were a fan of Burn Notice (like myself) you will also love this. It reminds me a lot of burn notice with the character development, the action, and the humor. All of this and the story and action are all believable."
2587,Vincenzo,Vincenzo is a total entertainment fun-filled series with some thriller elements. It's totally worth to watch it if you are a song joong ki fan..he has literally killed it in this mafia role!!
2588,Vincenzo,"Watch at least the first 4 episodes and I promise the drama will grow on you! :) You will be wishing each episode is just a click away! Series starts off as though it is going to be an action movie, then turns a bit to a treasure hunt, then turns into a redemption movie, then comedy, then suspense-thriller and uh, even a bit of horror at one point lol. I have to say that probably in all the dramas I've ever watched, I have never quite felt such a broad mix of emotions in watching just ONE drama, but this is not a complaint at all. I seriously need to compliment the writers and director and actors/actresses for doing an amazing job mixing so many elements into one, and most importantly succeeding in the mix!Please make more dramas like Vincenzo! Truly a most enjoyable watch and this could probably be a textbook study for how to successfully mix many genres into one :PTo those with complaints on the silly/comedic parts of the show.. just enjoy it, real life is too serious as it is and its nice to have comic relief no?Oh, and interesting life lesson (though almost definitely unrealistic) from the latest episode I watched - being nice to pigeons could literally save your life one day =p."
2589,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo had an interesting start however when the main character goes back to Korea things start to get a bit silly....I think the first episodes when other characters are introduced are fine but later on a lot of time is wasted on the other building residents and honestly a lot of the times they don't add much to the plot and every time they appeared forced jokes are shown and maybe because of the cultural differences that I might not get, so me personally didn't find it funny at all.Also when they are on a trial everything is silly the acting of the actors like the judge and the main protagonist, so for me that kinda ruined this part of the trial episodes, I expected something a bit more serious...Honestly I found the brothers more interesting then the main characters, especially junwoo, I think his acting was the best out of everyone else, he showed different personas and face expressions in comparison with the main character Vincenzo that most of the time had a serious and cool image.The ending was fine kinda violent did not expected that due to the episodes being mostly ""comedic"". So if you don't watch korean dramas this might not be for you."
2590,Vincenzo,"I wanted so much for this to be a 10 star rating after watching the first episode. I was complete blown away by Song Joong Ki's multilingual abilities in playing Vincenzo, the real Italian backdrop, the international mafia storyline. It really seemed all so promising.However, all this comes to a lukewarm plateau in the next few episodes, where Vincenzo ends up in South Korea and begins executing his mission of extracting gold from the basement of a rundown shopping plaza. It was heartwarming to see the him be reacquainted with the Korean life he had left behind as an orphaned child adopted by Italian foster parents, but I had already been sold on the hard mafia opening in the beginning.What was most disturbing for me was that the entire series opened with the scene of him bombing the shopping plaza where the gold was hidden, but in the end, this was never realized. I was really looking forward to see how he would manage convincing the residents of the plaza to move out so that he could destruct the plaza and extract the gold, but this was never realized.In fact, the entire plot became lost in a mushy romantic comedy between him and Jeon Yeo been's quirky yet lovable character Hong Cha Young, instead of the international action thriller it promised to be in the first episode. It became a story of how an Italian Korean reenacted his love for his countrymen, and how much his countrymen revered the Italian mafia, rather than a high intensity shootout or face off between him and his enemies with Italian mafia involvement on both sides to increase the tension.At the end of it, I felt not only lost but deceived. As much as I love the cast and the screenplay, it wasn't what it sold itself to be. It wasn't consistent, even though it was enjoyable for most parts."
2591,Vincenzo,"Excellent story, plot and the acting was super. The ending left open a possibility of a season 2 which I hope will be made."
2592,Vincenzo,Gets pretty boring after the 3rd-4th episode even thought the first episode was really good and gave me a lot of expectations.
2593,Vincenzo,What am I missing here? I made it through 9 episodes cringing and telling my husband it's supposed to be good due to all these great reviews. We kept waiting for it to get better but I don't get the point of this. It's not funny and super boring. There's really no point to this story. The acting is horrendous. Sorry but we can't continue watching this mess.
2594,Vincenzo,I'm at a loss for words. I forced myself to watch up to E9 based on all these great reviews. I kept waiting for this show to get better. It's a complete mess and no point to the story. I think it's supposed to be funny but it ends up just being cringy and boring. The acting is horrendous. Please don't waste your time. People who rated this anything higher than a 5 have low standards.
2595,Vincenzo,"Don't even remember what happens in the first episode the person insist and start the second not even a minute later i was done. A guy with a starting puberty boy body, easily with in one hand and tiny rope, have one man hanging on that rope(a rope so small that can hold a concrete block)by just one hand while easily talk and and rest his other hand 😂😂 is even worse than old cliche and still today male Hollywood movies at least Hollywood use a male that look stronger while made super extreme facial expressions and almost screaming in pain trying to hold the man."
2596,Vincenzo,"Damn this is good! Excellent writing, acting and special effects. One of my Favorite KDramas and a very favorite tv show in general."
2597,Vincenzo,"I would rate this over descendants of sun, Song joong ki looks so perfect in this role. Kudos!!!"
2598,Vincenzo,"I really love Song Jong-ki acting after watching Descendants of the sun.But in Vincenzo, Italian Mafia Role was Perfectly Stunning and His grace according to the Scene was All matches Nicely.So would Watch it Very addictive.I am quite Sad because it Ended today😭.Overall Bow to Vincenzo Team.Hope we See song jong-ki again in Epic Series."
2599,Vincenzo,No boring episodes and characters are great in acting.
2600,Vincenzo,"To the people claiming that the characters are overacting; this is a COMEDY. And an excellent slapstick one at that. The show really picks up pace after episode 4, and it doesn't stop - the twists and turns are endless. Not a lot of kdramas can keep my attention for the whole run, but this definitely takes the cake for suspense, drama and the laughs. Take it for what it is, a slick and gloriously over the top kdrama."
2601,Vincenzo,"Started off slow for me, after episode 3 I fell in love with the story and cast. Since then the enjoyment level has been a steady incline, episode 10 being the peak. I've never watched any Joong Ki dramas before but definitely swooning over him now in this character. Yeo Been is an exemplary female lead and a great personality to play Chayoung. A great combination of comedy, gore, plotting and a sprinkle of romance! Overall I have high expectations for this show, very worth watching - trust me, it just gets better!EDIT: Still holding true to my review, this drama doesn't fail to keep you on your toes! I'm absolutely loving the story but most of all the slow burn romance! A MUST WATCH. Just hunker down for the first 3 episodes and I PROMISE it's so worth it!EDIT: Finished the series, it's A MASTERPIECE, I'm so sad it's over. I love this series so much, it's unhealthy. What a great ending, things were wrapped up very nicely, but I'm hoping for a season 2. Fingers crossed!"
2602,Vincenzo,This could be the best show on Netflix! A must watch! Fantastic acting with great scenes.
2603,Vincenzo,It's reality... Korina always foxe on drama whith out extra ordinary events.. So reayality..
2604,Vincenzo,The characters are over acting. exaggerated portrayal of roles. it is just hyped.
2605,Vincenzo,"From the very first episodes, it's easy to find the story, plot work, pacing,... was all done perfectly. From how Vincenzo is introduced (I hate how unrealistic the fire spread though) to the schemes, how strong Babel is build as an unpenetratable image.. All could've been something more than this. Yet it might've been this brilliant style which killed the show.First of all: Everything was done perfectly right-on-time like a 2nd grade fomula. Yes good pacing can sometime do great, like how it hyped people's feelin when Joon Woo show off his identity (uwu gud stuff). But what's unforgivetable is how it breaks the beautiful setting that this show provided. We all know lucky moments and coincidences are sometime acceptable as it's reasonable to happen and will only make the scenes more awesome. But bruh not in this case, bc they freakin spammed it! The amount of oopsie moments that were created only for the shake of helping the protagonist and his companions are immesurable. Remember how Vincenzo and plaza owner closed the shelter's door right on time in ep ? Or when he arrive just b4 main girl of the show have her face punched? These little but ugly details totally ruined my experience as it's bland out unrealistic.Secondly: Weak character building followed up by weak script. Seriously, Paolo the gangster boss is nothing but a bullied child who dare do nothing, even can't take revenge on Vincenzo's driver when his master is abroad. And I was totally dissapointed seeing how Vincenzo easily kidnapped, tortured, got information from frankly any bad guys. It's like his aura of a normal build little baby face man and some weak measures of suffering could scare the f*ck out of everyone. Not to say no guard or security plan is effective against a korean mafia boy who works alone to invade Babel's domain and employees. Also, the poducers liked to spam backup saveboats that litterally turns the tide of the show. Oh Vincenzo is in trouble? Don't worry, he's rich and knows martial art at a superior rate! Oh plaza civilians are in danger? Don't care cause all of them know how to fight, and some are even masters of brawls. And you won't need me to speak out loud how trashy nerfed Ant Company was, right? (Although I hate it when the members of goverment and important people keep showing up to help willingly for no particular reason more)
Hmm, at this rate I think further criticism is unnecessary as you may've all now capable of looking at that overrated mess called Binsenjo Cassanova with a more precise perspective. For me myself, well the only reason I watched it to the end is 'cause of Joon Woo's actin, plot and role (as it's acted brilliantly with some manners of being the most realisticccc and No.1 part of the whole show uwu)
Brrrr idk but if your taste is of not very high standard, this TV-series can still entertain you well...... to a certain level that is."
2606,Vincenzo,You'll be enrage to be a mafia too. It super excellent and very promising actors and actresses too.
2607,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo has go some excellent starcast. Like even the side characters were Brilliant in their job. The storyline the messages the quotes were well framed. Some of Vincenzo's quotes hit really hard. No doubt the leads were excellent actor but I would personally praise Ok Taecyeon for his great acting as Jung Han Seok. Like I am obsessed with this Drama and I have already watched it twice, still I wanna watch it again highly recommended. One of the best series I have watched so far..."
2608,Vincenzo,"The drama would started in episode 3. At the first and second episode is used for introduced the character yeah. In my opinion, if you wanna watch the thriller and comedy movie. Vincenzo won't waste your time."
2609,Vincenzo,"It's slow at first, but gets better over the course of the episodes. The plot (no matter how unrealistic it is), the acting, the actions is chef's kiss. Like literally so freaking good."
2610,Vincenzo,"A very good Tv show, to all those writing bad reviews please watch the Tvshow before writing horrible reviews here."
2611,Vincenzo,"I really enjoyed it, I hope it has a second season too, although it was great, and a big thank you to the director and writer and all the great actors in this series."
2612,Vincenzo,"Never seen any Kdramas but this one has just setup level. I personally love Jeon and she put a life in this show. Everything is top notch-action, bgm, emotion, entertainement, suspense, romace. A BIG 👈 TO JOON KI AND YEO BEEN."
2613,Vincenzo,"Was an interesting premise but the story got terribly stretched out thin and what should have been been a movie plot became a ling winding, intensely tiring going nowhere drama.How in earth did this get 8.5 on IMDB? Way tok many Kdrama fans voting for the good looking lead???"
2614,Vincenzo,Wonderful series with full of admirable adorable characters.You will admire both protagonists and antagonists.Wonderful writing and direction.Thorough & wholesome entertainer.Badly wants Vincenzo season 2.Movie full of strong characters.Kudos to the team.
2615,Vincenzo,"One of the best Korean shows I have ever watched, the beauty of the show is in its subtle match of comic element and action sequences which are so evenly balanced in the storyline keeps you hooked through each episode. The cast is flawless in portrayal of their characters, overall a amazing option for both who want to kickstart watching Korean drama or are fans of Korean dramas 💯"
2616,Vincenzo,"Was hooked on the first episode, however, the plot just gets sillier and sillier. Perhaps i don't appreciate this kind of silly comedy. The female lead's acting is over the top, and also not convincing or funny. Always liked this male lead, but i guess the story just drags on with not much happening for many episodes. Would have enjoyed it if it sticks to the mafia tone in a serious revenge storyline rather than trying to be funny but failed."
2617,Vincenzo,This story so predictable...just fine because the actor handsome and the story good but there are no andrenaline...just fine.
2618,Vincenzo,"This show was too long and felt like it just dragged on and on. I felt like this story could have been told in 10-12 episodes. There were just too many useless side plots that led to nothing. It also seemed like the show didn't know what kind of show to be. One moment would be deadly serious and then it would switch to slapstick which totally ruined the mood.In a nutshell, this was too long and too inconsistent."
2619,Vincenzo,"Just finishing Episode 8 of Vincenzo and am enjoying the series. Haven't watched many of these Courtroom Battle scenarios as they tend to be a bit to dry and serious. Can't say that a about Vincenzo though. At every episode so far I've had a great laugh due to the great characters and actors playing their part. Taecyeon is excellent as Jang Jun woo, love the way he has transitioned between his Lawyer role and the CEO, all by just changing the expression on his face. Kwak Dong Yeon is one of my favourite actors from way back in ""Never Twice"" and "" Love in the Moonlight"". He is Jang Jun Woo's brother in this series. It's a big change of role from what I've seen him in and I was a bit shocked, he is scary at times, but excellent a tings. Kim Yeo Jin as Choi Jung Hee is scaring me to death, she is some badass Prosecutor, I hate her tactics in this role but she is some good actress. Now Vincenzo (Song Joon Ki), he's so cool as Mafia Lawyer, I've only seen him in Decendants of the Sun, and didn't leave much impression, but here he is rocking it. I'm impressed. I'm having such fun and laughter watching this, my dog runs out of the room when I Laugh too loud. I'm giving it 9 at this point, may come back to comment when I've watched the whole series."
2620,Vincenzo,"When I read the summary of the show I was expecting a show which had elements of thriller, mystery, action and a well made mafia plot. But all I got was a wannabe mafia or legal drama which had comedy all over the place. It wasn't even a proper mafia or legal drama as there were hardly any courtroom scenes or any real mafia elements. The writers dragged this show for way too many episodes and most of the times Vincenzo doesn't even think like a consigliere who worked for the mafia. Even after so many attempts of accidents and killing, he doesn't think that it's wise to hire more amount of bodyguards for the people who are close to him. There are so many incidents which he could have avoided if he actually behaved like a consigliere. In the ending of episode 19 suddenly Vincenzo was dumb and weak. If you are a fangirl/fanboy of the lead character then you will love this show. But if you wanted to see a well made show like ""Vagabond"" then this convuluted mess isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching the show because of the geumga plaza people and their comedy, but I was expecting something serious. Still I am giving this show a 6 star, only because all the actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and the soundtrack was really good! The show could be even greater if it was done by the writers of ""Vagabond""."
2621,Vincenzo,"Great actors. Today, watching episode 8 I laugh like crack. It's really a great new kind of plot and has a lot of funny moments!!! Love it. I'm anxious to see the final episode but at the same time I will not want it to end!😳 Happened to me before with some dramas, recently, specially StarUp and Hospital Playlist. But this one is over the edge as of now."
2622,Vincenzo,"THIS IS THE BEST DRAMA EVER INDEED. I can't stress enough how good this is. Tha story, the acting, the character development, the VILLIANS, everything is so on point. No one could have played vincenzo better than Song joon ki. He's the best. Jeon yeo been is so good as Cha young. Their chemistry is so refreshing. The drama makes you hate the villian(jang ho seok) and at the same time makes you fall in love with actor (Ok taecyon) cuz he's so good at it. And everyone else as supporting characters are also out standing. You will fall in love with the Geugum plaza family. Finale will leave you overwhelmed. Totally recommended."
2623,Vincenzo,"I think it is the best Korean series ever, you should watch it."
2624,Vincenzo,"If this show keeps up the pace after 8 episodes, it gets a 10.What could be more ""fish out of water"" than a native Korean raised in Italy who is both an attorney and Consigliore to the Mafia? Yet from that seemingly absurd mix comes a basic plotline that makes complete hash out of any lawyer show you have ever seen, mixes serious violence, mayhem and murder with humerous come-uppances to the bad guys, and has an undercover cop deciding that our hero isn't Mafia at all--but a heroic version of Che Guevera? The first few episodes need a bit of time to shake out, but when they get going, it's wonderful. Favorite scene to date--the corrupt judge who is stung by hornets in his classroom. I'm no good at remembering their names, but the female lead overdoes it a bit, particularly in the beginning. Vincenzo is terrific right from the beginning. Co-stars and regulars are also wonderful. The actors are all having great fun, and it shows. I hope there is room left at the end for another season-or 10."
2625,Vincenzo,"Started watching it but weren't expecting it to surprise me this much. As so many others have commented here, after ep 4 you'll just want to keep watching and you'll get even more invested in the show and the characters. The actors are absolutely superb and the plot is interesting, which pulls you in more and more. You will not waste your time on this show!"
2626,Vincenzo,"I didn't like it when it started. Italian korean mefia is a bit too much for me. But after 4 episodes, this drama is worth watching."
2627,Vincenzo,"The current liberal government is fighting against the corruption cartel, which has been established and continued through Chosun dinasty, Japanese occupation, dictatorship governments. The fight against corruption has never been won in Korea, yet and it's still going on. The biggest hurdle for the liberal party is to break the tie between the major newspaper media, the conglomerates and the all powerful prosecutor's office that works for them. This drama is just presenting a tip of the giant iceberg. If you know it, this drama will come to you as a reality."
2628,Vincenzo,"This series is so well done and breathtaking. The plot and actors + production are on the top! I really enjoyed it so much.As a KDrama fan, I think it will be difficult to find another one that good.I'm so happy Netflix takes KDramas seriously because the concept is so good!"
2629,Vincenzo,Another masterpiece of sjk ...his visual in this drama is no joke...please watch it ..just episode 4 and it is sooooooooo gooddddd...love it
2630,Vincenzo,"It is so satisfying from the beginning till the end. It has everything that this drama needed. Totally Justified Drama. Characters, Cinematography, Visualisation, Storyline, Acting, Actors and OSTs, everything feels so perfect."
2631,Vincenzo,"Recently I watch many Korean drama. All drama worth to watch but last few episodes is not so good Compared to starting episodes. In Vincenzo is interesting to 3rd episodes and best thriller, comedy also. But last few episodes is so boring. Overall good to watch."
2632,Vincenzo,"I dont know where to start.. its not even the acting. Maybe its a cultural thing for me and I am not used to asian movie making although I did enjoy Kingdom and Stranger. This one however..
First of all: the soundtrack is totally over dramatic throghout the first 20 minutes. Its on a 100% thrill all the time without there being any thrill that would justify such an intense soundtrack.Then there is the way he burns a whole estate down in slow motion in the beginning and then does the whole ""cool guys dont look at explosions"" kind of walk.Then he snaps the sim card and drops it in his glass of champagne.. its almost like a parody of every hollywood stereotype from the 80s but its just not meant as one.Worst scene however - and we are still talking first 20 minutes here - was when he said ""Papa"" to the dead patron.. I mean theres a South Korean guy who looks like hes 15 years old standing in front of his patrons coffin and then just says ""Papa"" and nothing else. Sorry but this show does not even come close to 6* if it was rated objectively.As i said, might be a cultural thing but I just cant take this seriously and it seems to me that a bunch of people just gave 10/10 ratings because the want to boost korean film making or the genre. Its doesnt even come close to shows like The Wire, Chernobyl, Gane of Thrones, True Detective, Narcos or House of Cards and yet its very close to their rating. Please people stop abusing the rating, it should be objectively and not a vehicle for national pride or cultural preferences."
2633,Vincenzo,"It's. A must watch series . Just have a little patience upto episode 3 , real story starts there after."
2634,Vincenzo,Every episode was full of suspense .. I felt in love with the Italian accent of vincenzo .. Nonetheless the cast is dope af.
2635,Vincenzo,"😍Best best best.. Acting, action, moves, story everything is perfect!"
2636,Vincenzo,It was hilarious though I wish there had been more romance between the main characters.
2637,Vincenzo,"My favorite KDrama to date. Has the perfect level of humor and action. I do wish there had been more progress in their romance, but it was tied up well! I really hope they make a second season about how they come together and what their life becomes."
2638,Vincenzo,"Where do I begin? I was hooked from the start, yet I wanted to do justice to this show by submitting a holistic review only when all 20 episodes were aired. Do not jump to premature conclusions or dislikes, you will lose in the end.Vincenzo is an up-to-date cinematographic homage to Balzac's Human Comedy and Dante's Divine Comedy, depicting nowadays society and performing a yo-yo between black comedy, pure drama, surreal fiction, bitter satire and slow-burned, realistic romance. All packed beautifully courtesy to the talent, hard work, creativity and dedication of the cast and staff.Why 10 stars when there's no perfection in this world? Because Vincenzo is enough and superb in its imperfections. Because it's addictive and memorable. Because it will change something in you while watching it.The Director and Writer did a great job, hats off for their teamwork and mutual understanding upon what this drama stands for. It's clear they had cohesion in the making of this drama. And they challenged the so often all-seen stereotypes and tropes some might expected to get in a Mafia show. The concept used and the mise-en-scene created a refreshing masterpiece!Each episode ends in style, with dramatic or unexpected cliffhangers that will keep you hooked like crazy, trying to guess what's next. And in most cases you'll fail to anticipate correctly.This show display meaningful character developments and human typologies. The chemistry between the cast was palpable and genuine. They were acting like a real team. It was the first time I watched the BTS of a movie/serial to understand how was that possible with such abundance of actors. The Geumga Plaza tenants it's us, the society, for sure. Each is unique individually, powerless when separated, yet with impact when awaken and united, catalyzed around a higher scope than just miserly surviving.The villains were manny and diverse, in accordance with the saying ""the evil is prevalent and vehement"". The Mafia was a concept perfectly used to explain the evil presence and ugly realities like corruption, greed, criminality, betrayal and dehumanization. Yet, small acts of good and humanity here and there saves this drama from a mere nihilism message.The romantic side is discreet, like a footnote, presented meaningfully to contrast with the atrocities around. And being powerful and memorable against all ods thanks to the great and candid chemistry of leading actors. It's the first time I am proud of how this feeling was portrayed between a man and a woman. No cheesy childish tropes, no toxic behaviour, vulgarity or skinship displayed, yet you know that longing and love is there come hell or high water. Also solid partnership, trust, respect and friendship is there, despite comic bickering. It's the healthiest relationship between two lonely people that meet unexpectedly at the crossroads of a toxic, corrupt environment. Being an anti-hero or simply villains is a lonely job, that comes with personal losses and sacrifices. Remembering the stares between Vincenzo and Cha Young along the entire show, but mostly at the end of episode 20, those two pairs of eyes broke me. Makes you wonder what price are we willing to pay in order to stand for each other or f right what is wrong?The OST and BGM of this drama is so emotional and powerful, beyond all expectations! When associated with scenes from Vincenzo it becomes a powerhouse. I'm still listening to it, vividly.Memorable, mature lines and scenes will sink deep in your head and soul because of their innate relatability. You will also laugh like crazy while ordering a corn salad. You will start seeing pigeons in a different light. And the sound of someone toying with a lighter around you will inevitably make you feel that things are about to escalate.All in all, you will want to watch the show more than once, hoping for a season 2, sequel, spinoff or whatever crumbs of Vincenzo are possible. Yeah, first time to give 10 stars to a show, wholeheartedly!"
2639,Vincenzo,"This Kdrama was totally different than others. Whole cast are incredible and fit for their characters. That's why all fans are hooked in this series. Each episodes are not disappointing, They have lots of twist. Thumbs up 👍 Song Joong Ki and the rest of the cast, for making this. Hoping for season 2."
2640,Vincenzo,"Big fan of K-dramas after Crash landing on you.I have seen quite a few of them, even though I don't understand the language. Thanks to quality subtitles on Netflix!!Vincenzo is highly entertaining. Wonderfully lead by Song Joong-ki, all actors did a great job. Chemistry between the lead pair is a treat. Romance is not the main track but still the slow romance was better than most of the romance k-dramas I have seen.Even though the tenants scenes were a bit boring in the beginning, you start investing in their story as the episodes roll. Wish there were more scenes on Vincenzo tackling Italian mafia😎
Last 20 min of Episode 16 definitely was something I haven't seen in a while, unapologetic entertainment!!"
2641,Vincenzo,"This series has perfect amount of comedy,thriller,drama,emotions. It was treat to watch. Everyone has given splendid performances. Song Jung-ki actually looks like Italian-Korean. Loved the show."
2642,Vincenzo,"The plot, story, character amazed me. I never expect sjk and jyb will be an insane combination with sense of crime-thriller. Also I like Jang Han Seok that play as a psychopath and Choi Myung Hee as Jang Han Seok partner, their teamwork vibes was insane eventhough they lose from sjk and jyb. Also the teanwork in geumga, and Mr Ahn as a intelligent that calm down me with his stupid action hahahaha."
2643,Vincenzo,"The most amazing series ive seen among 100s of dem till date. It has comedy , romance, killer action, crime , suspense ...its outstanding n mesmerizing !!!!. The story writing,logic,humour, the direction, filming, those peculiar mind-blowing characters , each one of them have nailed their role💯💥 The burning chemistry between Vincenzo and cha young 💋💓 Song joong ki u r the besttt💥💋💓"
2644,Vincenzo,"Much lovee worth watching 💓Best drama in tbe decade💥💯 logic, script, direction, acting, everybody nailed it😭💓💥💯"
2645,Vincenzo,"Ok Taec-yeon is a great actor and so is the rest of the cast, the show made me laugh alot."
2646,Vincenzo,"This show can complete in 10 to 15 episodes 20 episodes too long.Comedy is painful 😣 love story without emotion
While watching this show don't find for logic manlead can anything 😂
Watch only when u got free time."
2647,Vincenzo,"From all the K dramas I watched, Vincenzo stole my heart. It's one of the best kdrama to have ever existed. Equal mix of thriller and comedy made me binge watch the whole series. For anyone starting K dramas I would definitely recommend it."
2648,Vincenzo,"So amazing outstanding drama of the year
Wow... its amazing drama best actor of the year Song jong ki."
2649,Vincenzo,"This drama screams QUALITY. The characters are all interesting and very unpredictable. Some says it's very predictable but I guess they watch
it after watching some spoilers everywhere the internet. The plot, the characters, the scenes, the comedy, all PERFECT. The chemistry of both the main characters is just out of this world. It's not even a romance genre but it's much more better than the other romance drama l watched before, not gonna lie. I really love the female lead character, she makes the drama more colorful and fun especially to the main lead character who has a very serious and strong personality. The ending is a cliffhanger which I think is also good because it makes the viewers crave for more. I would be the most happiest if they make a ""Vincenzo: The Movie"". All in all, this is the best kdrama of 2021. This is what you called Masterpiece. This is a stardard. Worth everything!"
2650,Vincenzo,Everything great good acting. Main characters did well from the beginning.
2651,Vincenzo,"The story is enough to make me feel lost in the drama, with lots of action and comedians that are enough to entertain the audience.From the inside, it's quite entertaining, especially the dark jokes drama which can no doubt make you laugh. Maybe not everyone likes what it is from the jokes that have been prepared in this drama. But I really like the drama, even millions of people on earth feel the same as me.Weaknesses in this drama:
There is one ep that seems, one scene being repeated tends to be boring and makes it difficult for the audience to digest the next story. However, because we were surprised by other actions, we were made to forget about those shortcomings for me.Second, Vincenzo is helped by Inzaghi and his friends. It really doesn't make sense, science actually exists. There is a sense of wonder and also strange in me.But if it can be corrected, Vincenzo should have been defeated at that point, it will make the audience feel disappointed and then more enthusiastic to watch it.There is no scine Vincenzo loses, as if the plot is very imposing the plot, to make the villain continue to be weak. In terms of plot, it may have been planned that this story would be like this, type."
2652,Vincenzo,"Without much ado,if you haven't watched this,go watch it..I don't care if you've read negative reviews & you are not convinced..Watch with an OPEN mind,no judging of characters until the end,grab a popcorn & if possible get the original kversion on Dramacool..Heard the one in Netflix has been dubbed..I & my colleagues followed this drama right from when it aired & up till now,we have withdrawals from Vincenzo 😍..
Every character is perfect, the calm & cool/introverted Vincenzo, the crazy & warm hearted/extroverted Chayoung & the rest of the crew..Sincerely the director gathered the best cast👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾...This drama had it all,dark comedy, romance,thriller,action..Just name it!..So go ahead & watch it!!!The best decision you make on Drama Selection this year...Judge for yourself."
2653,Vincenzo,"Cha Young grew on me to be honest. I came for SJK but I fell for JYB.I love the fact that towards the ending of the drama cha young seemed to calm down a bit thanks to her relationship to Vincenzo but also loved that the writer didn't deviate from cha Young's character at the court scene in episode20. I was so happy seeing her being that weird & sassy Lawyer again..I like the fact that their relationship wasn't about changing themselves, they instead balanced & accepted each other & were a team!!!..He's (Vincenzo) like her bomb detonator...So whipped for her, always ready to defend her /back her up when she goes crazy
I loved how he always got her back
I enjoyed all their moments
For folks saying Cha Young's character was overly dramatic.Don't forget ;
1) This is a dark comedy genre
2) Vincenzo's personality is stoic & introverted...Cha young was created by the writer to balance this..
3) Opposites attract..Ying to Yang(Cencha couple)..
4)She's not your regular FL that's dependent on the man..She's bold,assertive, smart,gets into the game,proactive, weird ,funny & down to earth..
5) The Guemza plaza people were dramatic too(that's how they are real life by the way)
6) It would have been boring & annoying if the FL was submissive(no offense to women who have those personalities,we love you)...A lot of strong women in the 21st century can relate with the extroverted Cha Young
Thank you JYB for your perfect expression of Lawyer Hong Cha Young."
2654,Vincenzo,This is the best series i ever seen. The action and story telling is the best i want the next sesson of this series please. The crew and cast acting is no 1 rating.
2655,Vincenzo,"It's a good Korean drama tbh, the story starts with a main character's impact where a strong, smart and yet broken, tired with everything that has done in his life.Overall the drama is a main character centric and he is the main character that you want to put your empathy there and root for him till he did the job or get what he deserves, and has one of the best endings I've ever seen.The story is also really great but not compact enough to put you on screen all the time.Actually my review is 9.5."
2656,Vincenzo,"Really I can't stop watching this incredible series , the
chemistry between song jong ki and jeon yeobeen is unbelievable 🔥😍 I enjoyed every single moment..."
2657,Vincenzo,"I can't stop watching. This is my favorite series this year. Beautiful cinematography, thought provoking plot, charismatic lead actors and great supporting actors."
2658,Vincenzo,"I read some of the other reviews, where people are criticizing the stereotyping of Italian Mafia.But the TV series isn't about Italian Mafia at all so lets just forget about that.I love the characters so much, Vincenzo is shown to be level-headed and is ofcourse another Korean awesome hero but still is isn't shown to be invincible and can't predict everything.The daughter is shown to be smart goal oriented but still human, with our own fallacies and shortcoming. So what if she likes money, everybody does that.Speaking about the plot, well what do you know full of twists and turns till Ep 4 atleast. To be honest some things are predictable but still you can't create everything a new."
2659,Vincenzo,This is my first ever review. I just need to express my feelings. I loved this tv series I anticipated long for it to be available in Greece Netflix! I have to words to explain how much I loved it from episode 1 till 20 it's fire! The actors the directors everything was more than excellent! I want to delete my memory and watch it all over again!
2660,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo pulled me right in for the start. The writing is amazing and the actors are spot on. Song Joong KI plays his scenes flawlessly. He plays an Italian. Korean mafia lawyer returning to Korean for business where he meets fellow lawyer Hong Cha Young played by Yeo-bin Joen who team up to fight against a law firm and their major client Babel. Together they work together with a strange but unique people. The show has action, suspense, romantic, and thrill. The story line does start off a little slow until esp 4, but it is well worth the wait. I am working on trying to get my co worker to watch the show with me. DEF WORTH WATCHING!!"
2661,Vincenzo,"I thought we can all agree this is trash.On a technical level everything is bad - overacting, cringeworthy slow-motion, terribly slow pacing. We are not even at a level of quality where it is worth to have an actual discussion about what's to like and what's not.I could see this as a 6/10 considering fans skewing the rating, but what the hell is up with all the 9 and 10s? Are you people for real? Is this the first tv show you ever watched in your lives?"
2662,Vincenzo,I'm having such a great time watching this show! I laugh and cry! Vincenzo's facial expressions tell you exactly what he is thinking! I love all the characters! Dramatic but always with comedy relief!
2663,Vincenzo,"What do you expect from a drama/series?Entertainment...right.We all watch web/television series to entertain ourselves, those are our escape of reality, daily routine, & puzzled life...that's it...then here is the series, VINCENZO, it has a strong story, characters, perfect cinematography, actors are doing great, & not only actors, side actors have their own strong presence in this series, they are not bystanders, only you have to be little patient, and let them unfold the many level of excitement to you, the drama took it's real start from epi 4, after that every episode will leave you clueless, you can't predict what step both the team will take against each other.In between comedy is there to make the air light...it's my personal thing that I don't like serious and intense dark crime thriller movie/series...that's why VINCENZO is a rainbow for me, it fulfill it's genre, which is dark comedy...you'll get both 50-50.I strongly recommend this to people who really enjoys humor, and thrill at the same time.I've already watched 12 completed episodes, & it's not boring for even a min, go for it without a doubt."
2664,Vincenzo,"I dont know where to start.. its not even the acting. Maybe its a cultural thing for me and I am not used to asian movie making although I did enjoy Kingdom and Stranger. This one however.. First of all: the soundtrack is totally over dramatic throghout the first 20 minutes. Its on a 100% thrill all the time without there being any thrill that would justify such an intense soundtrack.Then there is the way he burns a whole estate down in slow motion in the beginning and then does the whole ""cool guys dont look at explosions"" kind of walk.Then he snaps the sim card and drops it in his glass of champagne.. its almost like a parody of every hollywood stereotype from the 80s but its just not meant as one.Worst scene however - and we are still talking first 20 minutes here - was when he said ""Papa"" to the dead patron.. I mean theres a South Korean guy who looks like hes 15 years old standing in front of his patrons coffin and then just says ""Papa"" and nothing else. Sorry but this show does not even come close to 6* if it was rated objectively.As i said, might be a cultural thing but I just cant take this seriously and it seems to me that a bunch of people just gave 10/10 ratings because the want to boost korean film making or the genre. Its doesnt even come close to shows like The Wire, Chernobyl, Gane of Thrones, True Detective, Narcos or House of Cards and yet its very close to their rating. Please people stop abusing the rating, it should be objectively and not a vehicle for national pride or cultural preferences."
2665,Vincenzo,"I'm normally hooked on any TV show or movie that has to do with lawyers, and the show's synopsis had me intrigued. It hooked me within 30 minutes of episode one. This show is, by far, my favorite TV show of 2021 and it's rare that I watch anything with subtitles. The storyline and the dark humor are second to none. I'm currently on the eighth episode. OMG!!!"
2666,Vincenzo,Started the series after checking out the rating. Found it silly with a lousy ending. Wrong casting of the villain which is almost likable in spite of his sadistic acts. Not worth spending 30 hours on this series .
2667,Vincenzo,"I saw clips from The Swoon about this show, and the more I looked at it, I was surprised to find this comedic yet action-oriented and conspiracy-filled take of a show around its Korean-Italian Mafia protagonist. I enjoy the cast of characters, the comedy, and the action, and so far, the show really has been quite a ride, in terms of having cliffhangers where the back-fill of explanation often can be quite crucial, but more than once, it's made me feel a sense of relief or despair. I don't think the posters or the trailer really can capture what duality this show has between the noir feeling at points vs. The truly absurd comedy, so it's confusing to tell what you're getting into, but by the time I hit episode 4 I started to realize that it was going to be a ride and by episode 10 I was just super invested in rooting for the characters. Now going to start episode 16, and I will come back to review to adjust it once I fully see the show."
2668,Vincenzo,"The show has a lot of heart with it's wholesome side characters and charismatic leads. Even the villains are enjoyable with how much they just love being evil. With 20 episodes over an hour each I thought it would drag at some point, but the plot just flowed so smoothly the middle kept its momentum. There's plenty that can be done with a second season, but if they just want to leave on a high note that would be an understandable decision."
2669,Vincenzo,"My actual rating for this show would be a 9.5 but I don't mind rounding it up to 10 because:Everything about this series was dripping in sheer Quality! From the visual effects, the script, the instrumentals and songs, the editing, the costumes, the sets, to the performances of the actors, each scene was oozing with magic. Each episode felt like a movie - I was satisfied with the plot that unfolded per episode but was also left with a yearning to see the next one.The baddies were so colorful and basically pure evil and even though you hated them you appreciated them anyway. This show had a lot of supporting roles but I was invested in every single character on this show. They were a lot, but it never felt crowded. Each character had a soul and identity and it showed throughout this show's 20 episode run.And lastly I want to highlight the outfits in the show! Everyone was SO classy! Especially, SJK and JYB! SJK served his looks in literally EVERY SCENE. Both his and JYBs outfits were on point all the time, I was constantly blown away because they looked so good!This show is almost perfect. I say almost (and the reason for my 0.5 point deduction) because I wish there were more fluff/romantic scenes between the two leads!!! After everything these characters went through (and because my thirsty inner-self craved it), I wanted to see more PG13/R action between V and HCY. I'm not saying I'm not happy with the scenes they had (I am), I just wish they had MORE.Anyway, this is a solid Drama and you should watch it!"
2670,Vincenzo,"10/10 start to finish. At first I was feeling real iffy about the show because of how Vincenzo was treated at the beginning of the show once arriving in Korea. I knew that Vincenzo the man himself would be the deciding factor on whether this show will take off or not. My goodness! When it came time for Vincenzo to deliver he NEVER missed a beat. He was the focal point and orchestrater of how well the show will flow. When the show finally took off it never took its foot off the gas! The supporting cast made the ride EVEN MORE enjoyable! Great job by the writers, director, the rest of the crew and cast!"
2671,Vincenzo,"Ep 1-3 is kinda boring. I almost drag it down. All happen started from ep 4, it was amazing, I loved it so much, especially Jeon yeo bin."
2672,Vincenzo,"This show is well made, and every episode is special. It has a lot of funny moments but it has everything else-action, romance, comedy, thriller..."
2673,Vincenzo,"I love every single episode, it countains nice comedy and a great job story line! Vincenzo is the funniest and adorable mafia i think😂 but instead of 10/10, i give it 8/10 because i kinda got little disappointed by the last two episodes, it feels like ""forced"" to be ended in 2 episodes!!"
2674,Vincenzo,"That scene where pigeons literally saved vincenzo made roll on the floor. I was speechless. It was like a scene out of cartoons. I am not saying it was good. It was so stupid, but gave me a good laugh.I started the show for song joong-ki, kept watching for song joong-ki. The episodes were horrendously and unnecessarily long. There was 20 episodes but i think 8-9 episodes would have been enough for such plot. Sometimes the comedy was forced. Overall, it wasn't all bad but it wasn't good either. As i said before, the only reason i kept watching is song joong-ki."
2675,Vincenzo,"I have never been this depressed after a drama ends. Vincenzo is a mixture of comedy, thriller, action and romance. Song Joong Ki and Jeon Yeo Been did a great job portraying the 2 leading characters as anti-heroes. The scripts was well-written and everything is just perfect for me!"
2676,Vincenzo,"This is not a fan-friendly review. Although the series is not the best, it is a good series that several chapters can be rescued but not all. At first we are used to very long chapters, a bit empty, they have top moments that hook you but a thread is lost in the critical attention of those who see it. There are chapters that I consider to be really good like some initials and some endings, but 20 chapters are not necessary, chapters that if you skip, you will still understand the plot and you did not miss anything, clearly it is not a piece of art, because it does not have The best photograph is very long, there are characters that do not have nuances, such as the antagonist, who dehumanizes someone only to have feelings of evil, or to hook up with a character who practically only at the end realizes the love he feels for the girl , which we must question because at this point in history it is not healthy to continue having this type of concept about love as a couple. Now, there are chapters that are really good for the nuances of some characters, for the Korean humor, for the impeccability of the script, for the photography of some landscape scenes, for the costumes. But I insist that a maximum of 10 chapters would be good, not 20 because I feel that in addition to saying good, some are not so good but I already invested a considerable time I have to finish it to see the outcome that is anticipated in the acting of the characters from the initial chapters .The development of the relationship between the characters is seen throughout the story, but I question the way a character is idolized in this case a man in the role of savior. In short, it is not a bad criticism but a constructive and obvious one, I love this actor and many of his characters, I like many things about him as an actor and seeing many characters from other series that are still really incredible in their acting roles."
2677,Vincenzo,This is one of the best kdramas i have ever seen. Please make it a series..please!!! I Love Vincenzo!!
2678,Vincenzo,I'm from Indonesia. My name is Noval East Java. I I think this film is highly recommended because until the sixteenth episode I am still curious to see the end of the story he still returns to being a Mafia or the possibility of him dying or a happy ending.
2679,Vincenzo,"Drama #Vincenzo. It's overall a masterpiece. Main cast #SongJoongKi, #JeonYeoBeen, #OkTaecYeon,#KwakDongYeon and other supporting cast did a very good job. Everyone do the justice for their characters. The dark comedy genre and slight romance gone well through out the drama. Chemistry of the male lead and female lead is extraordinary. This is not your chessy Melo drama, people who are into dark comedy, thriller this is the best choice. Vincenzo holding a mature relationship between the male and female lead. It's not a childish romance type. Well understanding is a main highlight among them."
2680,Vincenzo,Great casting! Love Geumga family and Babel Family. Song Joong Ki delivers as expected.
2681,Vincenzo,"Had this in my watchlist for a long time, but kept delaying as felt each episode, which is 90 minutes long was too much of a commitment.But after the first episode, I was hooked. The story isn't anything new, just like movies from South Korea, but the way the its structured and told is what makes South Korean content so refreshing."
2682,Vincenzo,"The first couple episodes were fine, but the people in the building he owned were so obnoxious. The more I watched the worse it got. The main characters were as evil as the bad guys, and that's saying something. The ending was very violent (and unnecessary) and I was very disturbed."
2683,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is such a well made drama that there haven't been a single moment where I regretted watching it. The plot ,direction ,cinematography,OST,cast and all the like were top notch . I must say that each episode itself was a fantastic thriller with its own twist. I can't also keep myself from mentioning about the amazing acting skills of the whole cast . The drama also didn't miss out on fun at appropriate places. Now that I've finished watching it , I feel like the Cassano geumga family is my own . Give it a try because this drama will surely keep you entertained right from the start till the end ."
2684,Vincenzo,"Song joong ki's walk and talk as a mafia lawyer, jeon yeo been's hilarious over the top acting and the villain , all of them are acting seriously well."
2685,Vincenzo,"Ok, so this is the another drama series which would i love most after, It's ok not to be ok. I have seen so many scene in this whole series which was gain so attention. This series can get your interest from the 1st episode, and make you push to watch another one.Whenever you'll start this drama then you'll die to finish this as soon as possible.So, you'll completely enjoy this series."
2686,Vincenzo,"This text is about the dialogue of Vincenzo Cassano, who incorrectly said that King Cambyses had skinned one of the corrupt judges while he was alive.During the reign of Cambyses, one of the
Achaemenid kings, bribery were considered a crime and the penalty was death.After the execution of one of the corrupt judges, Cambyses removed his skin and, as a cover, placed it on a judge's chair, to be a lesson to others.The author of this series must answer why he told such a horrible lie? Cambyses tore the skin of a corrupt judge after his execution, not while he was alive.I know that even though he was dead, he should not have cut off his skin, which is wrong.But the author also did a terrible job and compared we Iranians to the Barbarians and He described us as savages and bloodthirsty people. That such a description is not acceptable at all and is a horrible lie. If the author has narrated this story in the script with full knowledge, then his work is intentional and distorts the history of our country And he must apologize to us Iranians."
2687,Vincenzo,"This is a definite watch! People who sleep on this are missing so much. From the acting to the emotions, the dialogues, shots all are mind-blowing. Special thanks to the directior, the cast and crew for making every minute realistic each episode and ending each episode with a cliffhanger. This is a masterpiece."
2688,Vincenzo,The Plot and the cast are perfect!! Best k-drama in 2021!
2689,Vincenzo,It is the best drama I have ever seen after descendants of the sun.....song joong ki looks fabulous....jeon yeo bin's acting is also mind blowing....it is a full fun package... really worth watching...I will give it a 10/10...
2690,Vincenzo,It's quite an interesting show with dark comedy. Definetly not stupid like someone commented. If you don't like it don't watch it or bother commenting.
2691,Vincenzo,"This drama was very good and attractive👌🏻
i really love it😍❤I definitely suggest you to see it."
2692,Vincenzo,"This series has everything you could think off including romance, dark comedy, action, friendship, thrill, fight for justice and of course superb cast!!! Love it so so sooooo much
And 3 leads just took the drama to another level... In short there is never been, never is and never will be a kdrama like
I absolutely love this drama missing it already."
2693,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo has everything. Its a legal drama, murder thriller, comedy and romantic tension. It took me a few episodes to get into it because I'm not used to Korean programming and its quite different to western TV style. But it becomes both gripping and an easy funny watch. Add in quality acting from all the main characters and great writing and this is must watch for us every Saturday and sunday!"
2694,Vincenzo,"I mean it's really good and yeah it's worth watching too
. Totally recommended"
2695,Vincenzo,The primary characters are excellent.vincenzo is a strong character and Song joong ki perfectly portrays that.His acting itself is dark comedy.His opposite co-star is new to me.Her acting kind of reminds me the its okay not to be okay female star.It will be a perfect combination.The plot so far is good.You can expect some twist too.
2696,Vincenzo,"Just finished watching the episode 4. Wow, it was so good. Well made mixture of thriller and comedy.I saw a few negative reviews here written after eps 1 or 2. I recommend watching at least up to eps 3 and 4. The real story starts from eps 3. Eps 4 is like a complete well made movie. You will surely enjoy it."
2697,Vincenzo,"I was very excited to see Joongki's acting in k-drama again.. and WOW this drama is superb. At first, I decided to watch it because i want to look for another genre besides rom-com, plus the cast is Joongki (one of my fav actors). This drama is very fun to watch! It has a dark-mistery, fun, thrilling and so on. Those actors and actress acting skills are really amazing, knowing that joongki/Vincenzo who speaks Italian very great several times! And the plot twist... got me CHILLS. when you think it's predictable, but actually it's really unpredictable :) can't wait to see eps 5 next week! highly recommended. thankyou for putting efforts to make such a remarkable drama, i'm enjoying it so far."
2698,Vincenzo,"I just love this drama and also recommend to all to watch this, and give this show alot of love!!"
2699,Vincenzo,"You're going to love the kdrama if you're all over Song Joong Ki, but the rest is trash. Foreign actors are so bad at acting and all their acts were so forced especially the trying-to-be-funny scenes, the series was boring for me because of how poor the transitions of scenes were, especially the forced comedy. I'll edit my review once the series has ended, and i really hope the story line will be good because it is the only reason i might change my rating. If Song Joong Ki wasn't the main actor, i swear i won't even last watching at least 2 episodes."
2700,Vincenzo,"The character 'Vincenzo' has been splendidly written and brought to life by Song Joong Ki.This guy seriously grows on you with his cool demeanour and micro expressions.You find yourself disarmed and helplessly falling for the him !! Sigh.Such a stark difference from what he played in Descendents! At times it's hard to believe he is the same guy.Other characters are played perfectly by the cast. The script is fast, fun and exhilarating at times.Loved the quirky female lead and the female attorney in a negative role too."
2701,Vincenzo,"Dude imma kill for watching this drama, everything is perfect. It feels like u r watchin an anime (="
2702,Vincenzo,These movie is very exciting. I love it.and the vinchenzo's character is good for. Movie.
2703,Vincenzo,THIS DRAMA IS BEST!!!!! I'M IN LOVE WITH VINCENZO.....!!!!
2704,Vincenzo,This show is well worth watching!! Excellent and great actors i look forward to every episode. Definitely a must see in my books!
2705,Vincenzo,"10/10 I have never left a review on here for any thing I've watched but I had to make it my business to express how awesome and perfectly executed this show is. I literally could not stop watching. It will shock you, make you tear up, laugh, say oooh and ahhh. It keeps you engaged with all the plot twist. Bravo Bellissimo."
2706,Vincenzo,"I love Vincenzo. Best Korean show made. And, I watch many Korean shows and I'm American. Please, Pease make a second season and more. I'm hooked. It's funny, yet the story line keeps you on your toes awaiting the next show. I see this as an alternative to American James Bond. Love the characters. The two main characters love connection is very spot on. Romantic, funny, comical, yet real. Just all around great story line. Love it love it. I could see many seasons of their quirky show and relationship solving crimes for many seasons to come.."
2707,Vincenzo,"My first ever review but i just had to do one for this show , Just finished episode 16 and now have to wait for two weeks until the next episode and lt me tell you, i am HOOKED it is amazing . Really picks up after episode 4 and after that i cant fault a single episode, they're filled with so much drama . Definitely a must watch , its in my top 5 k dramas for sure."
2708,Vincenzo,"Boring until you get to #4 (big shift and big reveal). Episode 10 gives you anxiety at the end. Episode 11 (another big reveal). #16, OMG so good. Slow burn for the last 5 minutes. You really see the Consigliere. This episode by itself gives the drama 9 stars. Although, now I don't know how they'll keep a balance of humor within the story for the last four episodes. #16 set a high bar for the last four.I think Ms Oh knew all along.My prediction: Ms. Choi is going to survive. He will not kill her. Remember episode 1. No women and no kids. That's why Vincenzo doesn't respect Paolo. So, she survives but lives in fear.Maybe Hong Cha-young will do it in another episode or Jang Han Seok or Mr Han or Jang Han-Seo. It won't be Vincenzo. Hong Cha-young started going a little icy in episode 11.Watch Vincenzo. Once you get to episode #4, it really takes off."
2709,Vincenzo,Best kdrama ever!!! Pls pls pls watch it! 10/10. Best kdrama ever!!! Pls pls pls watch it! 10/10. Best kdrama ever!!! Pls pls pls watch it! 10/10.
2710,Vincenzo,I don't know about others but this definitely deserve a million stars/ rating.
2711,Vincenzo,Okay so this drama is typically the bessst! I don't know why there are so many people who rated this show with 1 star! Believe me this is the best drama ever....yeah Many of them said that the female lead is ruining the show but if you watch every single episode you will fall in love with the character.... The storyline is just amazing! Also the chemistry between SJK and JYB is lovely!!! The villains are sooo daebak.....and every episode has its own energy.... I highly recommend this show for all the kdrama lovers.
2712,Vincenzo,"It's such an amazing show and I don't understand why most people are criticizing it without giving it a chance. Maybe if you have the patience and watch past episode 3 then you will fully understand what the show is about. Trust, I was turned off with the first 3 episodes but once episode 4 started, I was literally glued to it. Just give it a chance. This is one of the best Kdrama's I've watched (coming from someone who is a kdrama fanatic). If you're not used to kdrama's and their comedy then I don't think it's for you. But don't leave a bad review without even giving it chance. If you watch past episode 3 then you will fall in love trust me."
2713,Vincenzo,This is the best series I've ever watched in Netflix with a full pack all the elements necessary in a thriller. And the actor Song Joongki nailed his performance in this series. Highly recommended series. 👌
2714,Vincenzo,"I love it , I love everything about it Song Joong Ki is an outstanding actor I love it ."
2715,Vincenzo,"I'm sorry but how in the world can they have a 8.5/10 when clearly its a hit in multiple countries. Some of use have to read subtitles, but still find this show awesome. Something else bias is going on here. I mean it's an awesome show. So stop being petty and give them the 9.5/10 they deserve."
2716,Vincenzo,"Song Jong Ki plays his role perfecto! Really likes the story, plot twist, and also the commedy."
2717,Vincenzo,"After watching the first 3 episodes I waited patiently for the last episode to near so that I could binge watch the entire season in one go. I hated having to wait each week. I love everything about this program, especially all the characters. I was so upset when Jang Han-Seo died. And now that the season has come to an end, there is an emptiness in my heart. Well done to the cast and directors and everyone involved behind the scenes. You all did an amazing job."
2718,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is definetely my taste of kdrama, it has lot of plot twist with amazing cast member. SJK acting skill is no doubt. There is no wasted characther there. Everbody have a important role in the movie
Love it!!!!"
2719,Vincenzo,"The first 15 minutes of episode 1 was the indicator that this k drama is different. Well written story and characters overall... every episode captivates and keeps you guessing. Good balance of action, comedy and drama. And once again, Song Joong Ki shows his perfection as an actor. Best K drama ever!!"
2720,Vincenzo,"I've watched Vincenzo until ep.18 (out of 20), so I guess it's already acceptable for me to write a review. My feeling about this series : unfortunately, really really disappointed.The reason why I watched this series is because I was intrigued by the genre : a mixture between politic, thriller, action, and comedy. The first few episodes are quite fun. But that fun only last for approximately the first 10 episodes. Even in the first 10 episodes, I already found several issues that bothered me. For example, why is Cha-Young fighting against her dad in the first place? There's no backstory whatsoever about why she chose to work in Woosang despite how corrupted Woosang is (only for the money? I dunno). Then, there's Myung-Hee. What is her motive? What is the reason for her total support for Han-Seok despite their constant losing? Is she just downright 'evil'? And for Han Seok, I just can't believe the writer just explained his character as a psychopath. Don't tell me that this is not a lazy way to create an antagonist character.What annoyed me the most is actually what she and Han Seok keep on doing every single episode : an empty threat ""You'll regret it"", ""What if I kill you first?"" blah blah. Their method of winning is apparently : A doesn't want to cooperate? Kill A. B knows something he/she shouldn't? Kill B. C is acting annoying? Kill C.But of course Vincenzo will always outsmart them and win. If this only happens for like 2/3 episodes, I won't be so annoyed. But this pattern of handsome-and-perfect main lead that keeps winning against the 'bad guys', no matter how cliché it is (yes, Inzaghi, I see you), for every single episode, is just.. underwhelming.Han Seo is at least a more interesting character than Myung Hee or Han Seok. He shows change : once a shadow for his brother and was always afraid of him, but now finally has courage to fight against him and even becoming wittier.I mean, this series can be great, with a proper storyline. Probably a less perfect Vincenzo that can make mistakes sometimes. Probably a smarter and cunning antagonist that's actually 'do' something instead of just talking big and failed miserably..Don't get me wrong, I love the actors and actress. They saved the show. They saved the poor and lazy story writing. That's why I give the rating of 5 : despite the meh story writing, the CGI of Italy (and Inzaghi apparently) is beautiful and realistic, some of the comedic scene is quite funny, the cinematography is amazing, and the music they choose do compliments the atmosphere.But, in the end, nothing can really save a poor story."
2721,Vincenzo,This series is very addicting. I love how the actors and writers draw you in and then throw a loop at you. Likevyou definitely didn't see that coming.
2722,Vincenzo,MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE... THE BEST OF ALL AND CAN COMPETE WITH ANY DRAMAS.
2723,Vincenzo,It's one of the best dark comedy kdrama i have ever seen 😍
2724,Vincenzo,I love the drama a lot. Vincenzo never disappoint me in any episode.
2725,Vincenzo,This show is a definite must watch!SJK is fantastic!!!!!
2726,Vincenzo,This DRAMA is absolutely 💯 - the first 15 minutes of Episode 1 got me so hooked. It just got better each Episode.Definitely the best K drama I have ever watched.Everyone must watch this!
2727,Vincenzo,"Story: 9.5/10
Characters: 10/10
Cinematography: 10/10
Production: 10/10
Enjoyment: 10/10.Overall: rounds up to 10/10If you like a witty, comedic, dark, gory, antihero story with a good splash of romance, you've come to the right place. I went into this series with no expectations. 2 episodes in, I felt enjoyment but no real spark. Then episode 3 passed and we went into the fourth episode; from there, the enjoyment of this series takes off exponentially. Each episode is action packed, meaningful, heart wrenching and fun. I've never enjoyed a show so much as I have this one. It's been an absolute pleasure to follow each weekly viewing live. The chemistry between the main leads is absolutely captivating.Vincenzo is going to leave an empty hole that no other drama can replace, and it's bittersweet knowing it's over. Definitely worth a watch, and I'll be rewatching this one for sure. A complete Korean drama masterpiece."
2728,Vincenzo,"You start off thinking the show is good, but after episode 3 it becomes great, and after episode 7 it's AMAZING. I'm so glad I found this gem and that a lot of others are enjoying it! Have never enjoyed watching a series as much as I have this show. The best part is, the ending was extremely satisfying (unlike so many dramas that have been ruined by the ending).The romance is UNDENIABLE. Great job SJK and JYB, now please give us more behind the scenes and photoshoots. Overall, I'd give this series a 10/10, and encourage all of those on the fence to give it a try!"
2729,Vincenzo,"Just finished the series I am SO satisfied with this drama! The romance bits are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, even though they were few and far in between, the buildup and the resolution is one of the best ive seen, despite this not being a romcom. I also love how gory some of the scenes are, it does NOT disappoint. The filming and production is incredible, thumbs up to the entire crew that made all of this happen. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
2730,Vincenzo,"I really don't know where to start with but in one word this series is ""SUPERB"". If you are sjk fan, you can not miss this series. The director have used all his charm. You just have to watch the first 15 minutes and fall in love with song joong ki again and again. Coming towards plot, the storyline is well scripted, each episode is we directed, all OSTs are awesome, chemistry between male and female lead is heart fluttering, the genre is amazing, you will be laughing 80% of times but there will be some serious moments and even cried when sjk cries. Song joong ki have shown his amazing acting skills. You will be immersed in the moments when sjk cries, become angry, his gaze towards female lead, his passion, his guilty, his story.I won't give any spoiler but I can say if you are looking forward for ""not-cliche-cum-satisfying-ending"", please watch this series and support song joong ki like me."
2731,Vincenzo,This is a one of the best Korean Drama Series that i've ever seen . Its really thrilling and the plot was really² amazing . Valid No debat jelas no kecot.
2732,Vincenzo,"Its an all in one drama. The best thriller with all that is needed. Its really made with the perfect cast..the perfect roles assigned even with the perfect dialogs.And the lead role SON JUNG KI, he is the best actor.Even the main villain was amazing, both are such a great actor.Whole cast is love..Can't wait for next season...."
2733,Vincenzo,Just finished watching Vincenzo and it was one of the best Korean series I've ever watched! And I watched a lot of them. This role was made for Song Joong-ki. The ending was a little emotional and I wish it would have been different. Very entertaining!
2734,Vincenzo,Only in 1st ep I was abt to die to I survive till the last ep....... I personally really liked this drama and song joong ki nailed it I really don't have a word to say just watch the drama n u will get it.
2735,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo left us in the edge of our seats with each episode, it's wittingly written and has twists you don't expect.It's unique in its combination of genres, because you get action, drama, comedy and romance in a well balanced proportion.You're able to see the growth of each character and also the chemistry among all the actors it's awesome; but especially we've such a great chemistry between the main characters.Though all the actors and actresses did an amazing job, even the villains that made such a great work that you end up hating them; Song Joon Ki was marvelous, how else do you and up loving a violent mafia guy.This drama it's totally recommended!"
2736,Vincenzo,"Love all things want about this drama storyline,
Vincenzo is full package drama of all crime , love , comedy love it too much ....
Best drama ever ... 😍😍😍😍"
2737,Vincenzo,"I've watched from start to end. The cast is perfect,it feels that the characters have come to life. The storyline is unique in between all those typical dramas. You have a very HOT mafia ;) and equally charming female lead.It has drama,soooo many twists but you won't feel lost,it will always leave you in the edge of the seat wondering what will happen next. It has comedy which relaxes the mood and...romance. Oh,it has a romance so good you'll fall in live with thus series,it isn't the typical romance. It shows two people being caring towards each other through small and subtle actions,it shows the two people understanding each other without the need to say anything.If you don't watch kdramas but want to try some,VINCENZO is the perfect one. I am VERY picky when to comes to movies,dramas,songs and all so I would say DEFENITELY go for vincenzo.If you need further convincing,I suggest got to youtube channel called ""The swoon"" it will give you enough tease to make you watch the show."
2738,Vincenzo,"Watch it and then thanks me later.Song joongki is back with a powerful and a extremely interesting drama ""Vincenzo"". The story line ,the chemistry between the actors and the chemistry between the others other leads are very good.this type of drama you might not have watched before."
2739,Vincenzo,"The show starts slow but is an exponential graph afterwards , the story keeps getting interesting and each character gets their own space , growth , time be it a funny character or a serious one. There are moments it feels so sad that it hurts and moments where you will laugh your heart out. Cast is appropriately chosen and everyone does justice to their characters ,backgrounds and music serve the best haven't seen a drama with such engaging story in a while."
2740,Vincenzo,"You can dislike Vincenzo (which is totally OK), but please, thou sha not disrespect this master creation. Vincenzo got me so spellbound that I had to create an account to write a review. Honestly, I have to say that every one was spectacular in his or her role and the addition of comedy totally sealed it for me. Kudos to everyone for the wonderful job."
2741,Vincenzo,"You will get attached to the show and the characters. This drama is saving 2021. You will love the chemistry between casts especially between Song JoongKi and Jeon YeoBeen. Their chemistry is so superior. Its been 2 weeks but I cant enjoy other kdrama because my head and heart are still stuck in Vincenzo. I wish they have Season 2. I also want to see Song JoongKi and Jeon YeoBeen in another kdrama, ahhh their chemistry screams Power!"
2742,Vincenzo,Perfect drama I personally love mafia crime stories so i really enjoy this drama. This drama is realistic funny wonderful highly recommended.
2743,Vincenzo,"How many times in Life do we experience things that give us waves of Goosebumps?Vincenzo is an extraordinary show with brilliant showcase of Talents from all the actors and kudos to everyone who made this show possible. Thanks to Netflix for making this show available in India with appropriate Subtitles.Song Joon-Ki (Vincenzo) is the cutest Mafia and HOW!!!Jeon Yeo-Been (Hong Cha-Young) is the best partner in crime. Loved her quirkiness in the show.Im Chulsoo (Ahn Gi-Seok) is the most fun-loving supporting actor as an Intelligent Service Agent.Entire star cast has done amazing job and unfolding of every character of the show is just so beautiful. I have never liked Kwak Dong-heon (Jang Han-seo) in any dramas before, but he is very impressive in this show. Villains of the show actually makes us feel uuggghhhhhh.Despite of being a crime thriller show, the partnership and chemistry of lead actors is what makes the show MOST SPECIAL. So mature so breath-taking and realistic. Vincenzo being a Mafia is shown to be Cold hearted but has a heart of Gold in real. He cannot be in any relationship given the dangers that come along. Just for that reason her mother was killed after 30 years of reuniting with her. Cha-young understands this and somewhere down the line they come close and start being like a couple and Vincenzo does things to make her happy and protect her. The fake proposal act they had to do was Real to them in their hearts. Finally, when Vincenzo confesses the love in words and yet leave her again, she still understands it. Just a fictional show but the feelings the audience can feel is Real True and Deep.Show has 20 episode and not for once it felt dragged. Action sequences were really enjoyable especially whenever Vincenzo would hold Gun and of course the Lighter.Inzhagi the pigeon act was pure genius. So was the entire Gay act by both the involved cast. It was brilliantly executed.Joon-Ki's and Yeo-Been's Shaman act was the best portrayal of their Versatility in acting.Soundtracks/OST not to be missed. I am always by your side by John Park is the perfect song that describes Vincenzo Cha-young relationship. MESMERISING.The piano/hacker girl helped to retrieve gold and so did the Monks and they kept a share for themselves. I get it. But other plaza members also helped a lot and were sincere and deserving of some gold if not a lot. They called themselves as Cassano Family with the growing attachment to Vincenzo which he reciprocated. In Finale they show 'After 1 year' and I was really hoping the lives of family & the plaza to be a improved version but it wasn't so. Plaza members even came forward to help the piano girl twice when in danger, so felt unfair for other members to not have a share.Subtitles do not give 100% justice and satisfaction of the show. If only everyone could understand the Korean language itself, the love for this show would be 1000 folds more.Already missing you Mr. Corn Salad."
2744,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is one of its kind, specially Jeon Yeo bin and Song joon ki's characters <3. The series is a great mixture of comedy and thriller, loved the twists and turns. The series has quite a brutal but justified ending. Overall, watching it was worth all the time and effort!!"
2745,Vincenzo,"This is an amazing k drama filled with comedy, mystery, corruption and abuse of higher power. An Italia raised Korean, who is a Mafia consigliere went back to Korea to accomplish his mission but gets entangled in a dirty business. ""The weak"" helps this Mafia Consigliere, Vincenzo over calm the road blocks. Love this drama until Vincenzo was distracted by love and could not save the loyal Allie who saved him. That was the most disappointing part but other then that It was an amazing drama."
2746,Vincenzo,"I think the writer's initially had a good idea and the basic plot had potential but then the writer's tried to way too much (ie. Tried to appeal to everyone and ended up with a too long ridiculous, stupid, and silly drama that I found to get worse with every episode.) I did like the early episode and the main character and main villain, hence the 3 stars). I cannot recommend this drama and unlike other kdramas I would not feel sad if the building collapsed and killed all the characters (well maybe I would shed one tear for Vincenzo)."
2747,Vincenzo,"Extremely overrated show! Feels like the script was written by some 16 year old kid and was brought to execution! Extremely poor character development and super annoying Female lead!It seems the producers don't understand the meaning of black comedy, the comedic elements were way too overdone and turned out to be more lame and frustrating than anywhere close to being funny!It was seriously one of the worst KDramas that I have watched so far! It was a sheer waste of my time!"
2748,Vincenzo,"The First drama Korean I've ever watched, can't wait for the season 2.one of the best action comedy 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
2749,Vincenzo,I love this series. It is so beautiful. I love vincenzo cassano because he is very brave💕
2750,Vincenzo,This was the best series ive ever seen. Its sad that ive seen it now. The story was so good together with the ending. Please make a new season.
2751,Vincenzo,"This is one of the best shows I have watched in a long time. The writing, the casting, the flow, and the crossover between drama and comedy was genius. I loved the opening scene with the gasoline filled crop duster. Yes, there is some cheesiness, but so there is in life too. This casting was spectacular, the leads and supporting roles could not have been better played, the connection between these actors on screen was memorable, and the kiss.. oh that ending kiss, it drew me in as if I was being kissed."
2752,Vincenzo,Damn its so good that i hv watched it three times.
2753,Vincenzo,This drama is just popular because of song joong ki.
2754,Vincenzo,"Loved every minute, was hooked from episode 1. Genuinely don't understand anyone who didn't love it. What's up with that? 😳 I loved all of it!"
2755,Vincenzo,"Song Joong-ki is just an original,I enjoyed the drama from the start till the end ,his Italian dear Lord .Give this guy a bells he is so good . I'm the type that fast forward dramas but with this kdrama I was hooked. I fell in love with this guy right here."
2756,Vincenzo,"What an incredible drama series!!!What a story!!!!!Fine level of acting by the actors. Not only with the enemies Vincenzo also plays a game of chess with the viewers. The whole serie is full of sunpense,thrill and surprises but sweet touch of romantic scenes gives the viewers real ""paisa wasul"" experience. Trust me if you can watch all the episodes patiencefully you are going to experience such a series which is going to give you a fever of it."
2757,Vincenzo,"I've never been one to write reviews on movies or TV shows, but after just finishing Vincenzo, I can't resist the urge to share my thoughts!This show has been such an amusement park and I loved every single second of it! I won't spoil anything, but I'll give my thought on some of the different aspects of the show.The story (10/10):This show grabbed a hold of me within the first minutes. The beginning really set the atmosphere and painted the main character as a cold, calculated and mysterious person. I mean; who does not like a beginning that glues you to the screen right away. I have to be honest and say that I binged the whole show in a week due to the never ending captivity of Vincenzo and the story that unfolds around him. I'm hope I'm not biased, but this show had me from start to finish and for that I have to give the story, a top rating.The characters: (10/10)
As the show goes on, we get to know all the different characters, their personas, their believes and what their values are. All the characters are great and gives the show a perfect balance of excitement, comedy and sadness. I can honestly say that I was just as interested in Vincenzo as I was in the other characters. They all had their story unfold like a present thought out the show.The protagonists were great, the antagonists were very good and all the other side-characters were interesting. What more can you ask for?The music: (10/10)There is nothing more to say than ""Bellissimo!"" The music was used in a perfect manner, the choice of songs at certain moments were spot on and they really gave the show a good feeling of Italian and Korean. Much respect the the people who worked on the music for this show.This might seem like a very biased review, but I still can't shake the feeling I'm left with, now that I've finished the show. I want to watch it again! I want to experience the opening sequence, I want to hear the music and I want to see how it ends all over again! Brilliant show! Just brilliant! If you haven't watched it, then do it! I promise you won't regret it. I laughed, I cringed, I cried and I enjoyed my way thought this masterpiece! I hope you will do the same.If you've read this far, then I thank you for reading my thoughts about this show. Leave a like if you enjoyed reading about my extravagant experience with Vincenzo!"
2758,Vincenzo,"Absolutely engaging. To all those who got bored to early, I'd suggest you wait till episode 3/4, you'll be hooked."
2759,Vincenzo,"Been watching kdrama from years and this show is the most over rated. The comedy is cringe. The people in the plaza are annoying. The male and female lead lack chemistry and their romance is awkward. Twists are silly. Over all 20 episodes is too much. I don't understand what's wrong with the users giving 10/10 just for the sake of increasing ratings. I couldn't go past episode 9, where I generally binge watch many kdrama."
2760,Vincenzo,IN TWO WORDS..........ACTING IS FABUIOUS..................Boring and disappointed in the middle of the story and at the end of the story.............
2761,Vincenzo,"Best korean drama. The all of cast really amazing, the plot, the cinematography and their chemistry got me crazyy."
2762,Vincenzo,"Characters are completely idiotic, mainly the female lead, and the main lead, Vincenzo. The rest of the side characters are just annoying plot fillers. They don't contribute anything useful, just childish comedy no one finds funny. There are never really any stakes because of how thick the plot armor is so the ""tense music"" in scenes just gets more and more annoying every episode. Guns are often pointed just as a scare tactic, not really used, and it gets annoying really fast. Writers keep shying away from the actual plot because they know they don't have the guts to make a good plot that remains strong and consistent. Too many slow motion scenes that just were awful to endure, not because they were heartfelt, but because they were unnecessary and just dragged the episode out. It felt like the writers were just coming up with something random left and right just to have 20 episodes. The plot was complicated at first but it soon came with a simple solution...with two thirds of the show still left to fill up with gags and cringeworthy moments instead of the characters actually solving the problem. I would have stopped watching this at probably the fourth episode but the only reason I watched the rest was because my cousin wanted to finish it with me. I recommend watching this if you want to waste your time. If you don't, there are plenty of other crime/thrillers that you'll find much more captivating out there."
2763,Vincenzo,"The logic of details is terrible 😪 not fun, stupid."
2764,Vincenzo,"Suspense , thriller, action it has all u need, very nice drama,
only one star minus because of wrong casting of villain . Overall good script."
2765,Vincenzo,I loved everything to do with this show the cast and everything. The whole shows vibe is amazing there was not one scene that didn't look like it was supposed to be in the show. I would love to see a season 2 and she the cast do something bigger than frost season and love the relationships in the show.
2766,Vincenzo,"It is really one of my favs, i love how they have mixed comedy and thriller :))"
2767,Vincenzo,Good series film but I think main charactor is too op :)
2768,Vincenzo,"First couple episodes great but after that it becomes a massive disappointment and a struggle to watch. The series is far too long and is like a game of cat and mouse. Nothing really happens until episode 19. In some cases you end up rooting for the evil guy to win. It is a struggle between trying to be this ""serious"" crime drama and a comedy where reality doesn't exist. Great actors but plot it too cheap."
2769,Vincenzo,"I see a lot of people talking good about this one, but in reality if you are used to actual good shows/movies it wont make it for you too. The acting just feels fake and weird, couldn't make it past 15min episode 1, that first fire scene is just not nicely executed."
2770,Vincenzo,The series kept all its excitement until the last episode and the leading roles were very harmonious. It is in the top 3 among the series I have watched so far. I fell in love with SJK's acting👏👏👏 It was simply a great series!
2771,Vincenzo,"Uma dos melhores kdramas de 2021. Elenco maravilhoso, atuações impecáveis! O enredo entrega tudo: ação, comédia, suspense e romance. A atuação do Song Joong Ki é 10/10."
2772,Vincenzo,Please make a season 2 of thia video.... We want season 2 of this series this series is one of the best and masterpiece don't quite this series all of the best series in.
2773,Vincenzo,Vincenzo .Song Joong-ki's performance in this series is just incredible. Definitely matched or even outshined by Jeon Yeo-bin's performance. One of the most distinctive characters I have ever seen in my life. Shows how much work Jeon Yeo-bin put into the role. This series is so amazing .it's one of the best .💯
2774,Vincenzo,I enjoyed the first few epsiodes but I got bored on the middle so I stopped watching the latter part. The plot of the story was too bland. Some of the characters were trying to be funny but their action is a bit cringy especially jeon yeo-bin acting. I gave three stars because I like joong-ki and the cinematography of this series is superb.
2775,Vincenzo,"I'm a big fan of crime/mystery and comedy dramas and this drama was just the perfect amount of each genre. This drama made me fall in love with all the characters, especially Vincenzo. His character was so attractive personality and appearance-wise. I think they picked the best actor for the character because Song Joong-Ki really brought Vincenzo to life. And I had the biggest crush on Hong Cha-Yeong because she is just so amazing. She reminds me of Bae- Ro-Na for some reason and I love it. The villains did amazing & the story was chef's kiss. Definitely on my top 10."
2776,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is a ""must watch"". I personally don't find any unlikable aspect in this drama. Acting, directing, writing, story, cast, etc all the things are on the point. This drama is not a single genre dealing series so it have something for everyone. It's a new treat for kdrama lovers. I don't have words to explain how much song joong ki was good. There is no doubt in song joong ki's hard work. I think he deserves a desang. And song joong ki's proformance was brightened by others cast members. Vincenzo was titled by main character's name but it would have been always incomplete without the other cast. Jeon yeo bin and song joong ki seems like made for each other. Taecyeon was brilliant. I think people should watch first and then believe on the reviews. Go ahead. You'll not regret."
2777,Vincenzo,"Vincenzo is a great episode.please Vincenzo season 2 I am waiting .Sir the next part of this should come. Quite funny. At the age of eight, Park Joo Hyeong went to Italy after being adopted. He is now an adult and known as Vincenzo Cassano to the Mafia, who employs him as a consigliere. Because mafia factions are at war with each other, he flees to South Korea, where he gets involved with lawyer Hong Cha Young. She is the type of attorney who will do anything to win a case. Now back in his motherland, he gives an unrivaled conglomerate a taste of its own medicine with a side of justice."
2778,Vincenzo,"Ive watched plenty of dramas in my life, but almost none of them have been as good as an attention grabber as this one! There has not been any moment in the series that hasnt completely grabbed my attention. Song Joong-ki's acting as vincenzo had the perfect amount of charisma and confidence to create an everlasting impression on the viewers in correlation to Song Joong-ki's character Hong Cha Young. All in all, I highly recommend Vincenzo to anyone who's looking for an action packed drama with a subtle hint of romance.P. S. I love corn salad 😂💗"
2779,Vincenzo,It keeps you glued to the screen every second. Gripping all genre drama. Two thumbs up.
2780,Vincenzo,Worst drama ever!Ok Taec-yeon is so pathetic! He is still stuck in 2009!He mentioned the heartbeat song more than once!!!!!!!
2781,Vincenzo,"It looked interesting, but the premise, the story and the dialogue were so stilted and formulaic, it was just boring. Technically the film looked pretty but there was no narrative to hold it together. Don't waste your time, there are much better series out there."
2782,Vincenzo,"It was my second Korean series which i watched. And i am totaly shocked how the storyline went. It was a masterpiece.When i watched this kind of a series or films i usualy want to see a few things : Does the main character has the coolness, brillinat mind, and do amazing plans . Vincenzo is very powerfull man and you saw it..He has ability do whatever he says. And i thing he has the most powerful abilty: Gather the people and believe themselves.It was totaly joyfull to saw how the Vincenzo gathered all the people around and see them became Mafia like.Anyway if you want to watch this movie do it."
2783,Vincenzo,This show is super duper good!! You wont regret watching. (First time giving review on korea drama because this is just so good)
2784,Vincenzo,"A very promising, well-made episode 1 which then deteriorated into a convoluted story with too many side plots and worse, with exaggerated slapstick acting. The subplots are unnecessary with unconvincing characters. Most disappointing after
a very impressive episode one."
2785,Vincenzo,"I didn't expect much tbh, but is truly amazing. I'm in Love with this series. It Is dark comedy with a bit of action, drama, romance. Everything keeps getting better and better. Definitely worth a watch."
2786,Vincenzo,"I kept watching until the ninth episode on the advice of the comments here that the series gets better as it progresses
Then I got tired of it, it got worse and worse.Short and to the point, I think it's an idiotic, childish series.The humor is theatrically stupid.The main character is unreal, the lawyer, with all her exaggerated movements and manners, is downright idiotic.The rest of the characters apparently have intellectual disabilities.So I give it the lowest possible score."
2787,Vincenzo,Great story and acting I really enjoyed every minute.
2788,Vincenzo,"Suspense, comedy and action. The guys love him and the girls do too."
2789,Vincenzo,"I saw a lot of people critiquing the first four episodes for being misled about this being a neo-noir crime show. My expectation however was another K drama with a darker theme.This turned out to be it, while the the first few episodes are more comedic in nature, the following episodes get darker and darker. The finale rides the line of a straight up torture film. The action was top notch but some of the comedy was a bit cringey. It didn't help that all the 'funny' scenes were accompanied by goofy jingles.Although the main villain turned out to be a character with little backstory he was still very intimidating. The show made you feel very sorry for the protagonists and most of the time I actively hated the villains.Besides the comedy I thought that the show had a few other weak points; the romance and the subplot about the gold stashed under a temple. The weird thing is that I could feel some chemistry between Vincenzo and Hong but besides two kisses and a hug there was not much romance. They probably cut it short because the show already had so much plot. The gold subplot is weak because it goes on for too long and the characters act in bizarre ways.On a positive note the rest of the show was good including the music and cinematography. There are some scenes where character's deaths are portrayed in very creative ways.In terms of structure I am starting to notice a pattern in K-dramas: 1. Set up the story in 3-4 episodes 2. Spend about 10+ episodes stretching out the story with twists and turns. 3. Resolve the story in 4 episodes where one of the main characters gets injured. 4. do a finale where the characters get to say goodbye or stay together and kiss.Overall the show is a solid 8 out of 10."
2790,Vincenzo,Oh man !!! No words just Respect. I will not forget this series ever.
2791,Vincenzo,Episode 19 and 20 sucked. The villain managed to set up a perfect trap for Vincenzo and yet the plot armor let him escape!!!
2792,Vincenzo,"It is one of the best things in TV I have seen in years. Wicked, wild and twisting. I would have to take breaks only because of the suspense. Only thing close in American TV is Fargo. I loved it and have watched many other shows with Soon Joon-ki. Just the creative hidden twists and flashbacks that filled in questions, not gaps. Have to do subtitles. Their own voices make the difference. Loved every minute of every episode."
2793,Vincenzo,"Great actors, great plot, great music!!! ..................................."
2794,Vincenzo,"I love the way hero and heroin lead the drama . This drama extremely funny and stunning perfectly!! Balancing of comedy and action . I love the way Song Joong Ki lead , not because of his good looking but he is very good looking person . There no lies . But the way Song Joong Ki performed extremely super ! He deserves an awards. The way he leads and the way he speaks very fluent. This drama very eye catching to us ! Thank you for making these drama and please ignore the critics of this drama . Only a dumb person just criticising this drama . For me the drama was the best drama ever !! Im not regretting it all for watching them ep 1 till now ! I love VINCENZO . I hope VINCENZO AND SONG JOONG KI getting some awards ."
2795,Vincenzo,"One of those shows, which gets better and better, the more you watch.I am really impressed by the quality of the production: sound, acting, cinematography, suspense, serious, funny, sad and on top of it, really good story telling covering one main plot with many interesting side stories.Definitely a must watch.10/10."
2796,Vincenzo,"It's really addictive and a great series for binge watching. Its sometimes cringe, but those are the traits of a few characters."
2797,Vincenzo,I loved every second of this show! It felt like watching Oceans11/James Bond and a briliant comedy at the same time.I became addicted to K-drama!
2798,Vincenzo,"This is an exceptional series. I enjoyed everything about it... acting, storyline, cinematography. I particularly enjoyed the campy, and occasionally corny portions that were uniquely delightful and entertaining. It had an added sense of pathos, tenderness, and positive versus negative."
2799,Vincenzo,"Its my first review here.Just done watching EP4. Ep4 ends with Luciano Pavarotti's Nessun Dorma...Adding impact and a great ending to EP4.
Been a long time since I watch a great drama."
2800,Vincenzo,No cohesion to the story telling. Vincenzo's motivation isn't clear and logic has gaps. Very messy and you need to overlook alot to really enjoy this nonsense script.
