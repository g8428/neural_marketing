0,Encounter,"There is something soothing about the tone of this romantic drama about a rich older divorced Hotel CEO lady and a young man who works at her hotel. The Cuba parts are quite enchanting. But things slow down back in Seoul.
The smiles are a big feature here. Park Bo Gum smiles a lot from big out of place grins to half smiles. Song Hye Kyo seems too laid back and gives weak smiles too often. The romance has kissing but they behave more like friends than passionate lovers. In law interference from both sides rich and poor. The impact on the poor side is quite interesting for a change it is usually the other way round. Also the ex husband wanting to get her back is weak and just a plot device. The downfall of the powerful seems a contrived. She actually looked better with her ex husband."
1,Encounter,"The premisses of the story were good, as the story of the leading lady was tragic and it was obvious that when he met the young man, her life changed as well as her as a person. However, the romance and the love story all together lacked intensity. After the strong start, the events tended to repeat each other and the twists were boring. At least the performances were good, however, the two leads lacked chemistry and looked more like good friends than lovers."
2,Encounter,"Great cast and story, except when the writer falls into KDrama bad mother cliches and silly plot twists and gaffes in the last couple of eps to extend the episodes to the 16 signed for. PBG has the toughest role in creating a character who evolves from sweet but callow youth to a truly good man everyone else can learn from. I loved him so much. Also, the OST is one of the best in KDrama, and those two thematic ballads had me in tears more than once. It's a good drama, but once again the flaws that do exist are in the writing toward the end, not the acting or direction. Recommended."
3,Encounter,K-drama that running just a tad too slow and lacking punch despite promising first episode in beautiful Cuba. This time Park Shin-woo brought gender reversal of atypical lead characters with different social class to fall for each other and overcome the obstacles.Most exciting aspect was the pairing of Song Hye-kyo & Park Bo-gum. They didn't disappoint fans and audience with solid sweet chemistry consider their age gap in challenging relationship. Supporting cast only gave serviceable performances to extend the show with hardly any twists.
4,Encounter,"A couple have a brief encounter whilst in Cuba and on their return to Korea they meet again as a new employee at a hotel and the owner. A gently paced romantic drama which sees the couple having to deal with their different backgrounds, a jealous ex husband and an ex mother in law from hell. A well acted drama from the entire cast and some interesting side characters makes it an enjoyable though steady watch."
5,Encounter,"With a super casting of Park and Song, the story itself is disappointingly dull.The business ability of Song is not amplely reflected in the drama. And i also hope that Park be more able and has exceptional wit to help Song on her hotel business. So he will be more musculine.All the episodes develops just on their romance. The whole drama is one dimemsional and is not rich in content. The Cuba setting can just bring excitement for the first two episodes.A foreign setting and a supersar casting is not enough to make a good drama. Especially for this drama Song is older than Park, there will not be many kisses and romantic scenes like typical love drama. I expect the writer would add something special to compensate for the age gap. Like Mr Sunshine the age gap are compensated with beautiful shooting, great war scene, amazing costume. In Boyfriend we do not see anything special worth praising.Anyway the acting of the lead couple is above standard. They are both so famous and must have some attractiveness by their own character. Thus still worth a score of 7."
6,Encounter,"7.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2018/2019 South Korean television romance drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.Cha Soo-hyun (Song Hye-kyo), has lived life in the spot light serving as a poster child for her politician father. Her mother, who sees her daughter as a pawn to further her husband's political career, marries her off to a chaebol whose family has wealth and power sufficient to support her families' political ambitions. The loveless marriage soon falls apart when Soo-hyun's husband declares he wants to marry one of the women he had been having an affair with. There are conditions to the divorce on both sides, Soo-hyun's mother-in-law insists she continue to attend family gatherings until her son remarries. Soo-Hyun requests to be CEO of a hotel owned by the family which is on the verge of failing financially. Soo-Hyun makes the hotel so successful that she goes to Cuba to strike a deal to expand her hotel brand. It is while there that she has several chance encounters with Kim Jin-hyuk (Park Bo-gum), who saved doing part time jobs for a fun filled trip too Cuba before returning to South Korea and settling int his career. Soo-Hyun takes an impulsive trip out without her staff to see a highly recommended beach sunset and winds up being pick pocketed and stranded. She asks Jin-Hyuk to help her and they wind up spending a spontaneous and eventful evening together. They planned a good bye meeting the next morning but Soo-Hyun gets delayed and they return to South Korea separately thinking they are unlikely to see each other again. Fate has a say though and Jin-Hyuk's new job is with Soo-hyun's company. Differences in age, social class, and her ex in laws and parents desire for her to remarry her former spouse all stand in the way of the developing romance. Can the two overcome all the obstacles?Spoilers** Overall I would characterize this as boring. It wasn't bad but it wasn't particularly good either. The entire story line was very very predictable. When they were in Cuba it was slightly interesting as it was intriguing knowing neither one of them really knew who the other one was so there was anticipation in that. Also, in Cuba, they were doing some interesting things in that cultural space. When they were back in South Korea there was a moment of uncertainty when it turned out he worked for her and her company and when he had to go to an office farther away. The female lead character had a very ""flat"" personality. It was supposed to be due to her upbringing but, other than a few more smiles, the character did not change or grow significantly. It made it hard to understand why the magnanimous male character would be so madly in love with her. I thought that her conflict with her ex's family would turn out to be a way bigger deal than it actually wound up being. The fact that her father took care of it made the entire struggle leading up to that kind of a mute point. Even their small break up was very predictable and the fact that they got back together even more predictable. If it seems like I'm using the word predictable a lot it's very intentional there were no major surprises or twists which for me made the story very ho-hum. His mom and her actions is something you would expect within the context of a Korean drama yet I still found it very mean and irritating. I know it's the American in me that finds the way parents in Korean dramas interfere in the lives of their children annoying. When it is just them disapproving and working on their own child it is one thing but when they harm someone else emotionally it is just abusive. I was disappointed he was not angry with his mom about it. The father was and I liked that. I was glad she finally came around but it was almost too late. Not one I would rewatch or recommend unless someone is a serious fan of one of the leads or just likes very predictable romantic dramas."
7,Encounter,"I had rather high expectations from this show and it turned out to be a somewhat average, formulaic love story.
The only thing that really sets this show apart is the fact that it switches up the male CEO falling for the poor girl/secretary trope that is very common in k-dramas. The story is pretty simple, nothing too exciting but it makes sense. The plot revolves mainly around a very angsty, cutesy romance, so if that is your thing you will probably like this. The acting was very good, the soundtrack was decent, and I will say the cinematography was very pretty and well done.
This was a ""noona"" romance (which I didn't realize till a few episodes in), and while I normally dislike noona romances, this one didn't bother me too much - Park Bo-Gum did seem younger, he is very cute and bright eyed in this so that makes him feel very young, but Song Hye-Kyo is gorgeous and doesn't look her age so it worked. They did have chemistry, but not overwhelmingly so. I didn't like the Cuba scenes that much as the ""foreign"" actors in k-dramas always feel so stiff and awful, and this was no exception.
I actually kinda felt bad for the ex-husband.
To be honest I skipped through most of the episodes after the halfway point, I was rather bored and I could see where this was going and wasn't really interested.
Overall this was an okay watch, but wasn't something I personally liked very much. I was expecting something really amazing and touching and it was just average."
8,Encounter,"That was never fully realized in this drama. I love KDrama and usually appreciate the genre 's storytelling ability, but for some reason this series didn't live up to its promise. The lead actors are both outstanding performers, especially Park Bo Gum. In my opinion, he carried the show and his performance and that of his fictional family was the reason why I watched it to its finish. Song Hye Kyo performance was okay, but definitely could have been better. I give this drama seven stars."
9,Encounter,"This k-drama is not an american movie where there overly intimacy, telling I love you after meeting 3 days & obscenity.This drama has the obstacles of culture difference, tradition, custom, subtlety of love & interpretation of romance.Awesome leading actress & actor! Both beautiful people have such beautiful chemistry together despite their age & social standing.This drama is no different from some other dramas where the rich abuse their power! The challenges they have to face its even higher than Mount everest! The vindictive mother-in-law, even her own mother can be repulsive, an ex-husband who doesn't know how to treasure what he got until someone else has it, the company employees sabotage her, she is fighting against all odds & unbelievable obstacles!This drama maybe slow, draggy or not romantic enough for some but it has all the romance. The understanding of 2 people being love is never to give up on love, show them what has been there, reliability & whatever difference they have, they can overcome together! So this drama is worth watching as it is one beautiful love story!"
10,Encounter,"This is a nice show, if you're expecting fast paced high drama this isn't for you. If you are okay with manipulative, underhanded, revoting mothers of ""high class"", this is right up your alley. Two unlikelys fall for each other and their world turns upside down. Typical story, but nicely done.Cuba is lovely to see, I wish they were there longer at the beginning though. Korea is also beautiful and the scenery is lovely. The cheesy product placement is so forced and cringeworthy however, and it spoils it. Subtlety is so much better. It can be done properly and i wish they didn't mess it up like this.A nice watch if you're not into action or shows that have a mysterious plotline."
11,Encounter,"This is a nice show with an obvious Park Bo-Gum effect, it probably would have flopped in a heap without him. Needless to say though, he makes it work. A typical rich girl and poor (yet handsome) boy out of her league fall in love, held back by evil families and families who don't want the drama.It is slow, very slow, but the scenery makes up for it in Cuba. The only annoyance I have with it, apart from the very obvious product placement (subtlety is key, ppl!) is that rich chick's sideburns. Holy, once you see them you can't not notice they must be waxed in place for eternity. (Petty I know, but it's the little things!).Sideburns aside, if you don't want a heavy plot line you need to think about, watch this."
12,Encounter,"The drama has a very simple plot. It is very obviously predictable with hardly any plot twists. It is very slow paced and sometimes dragged with unnecessary dialogues as well. And the drama is heavily focused on the main couple with less time for the supporting cast, which is a bad decision because the supporting cast were the lively characters that added more colour to the drama.Talking about the main leads, both the actors are my favourites. I adore and love Song Hyekyo for more than a decade and simply cannot control my face muscles and smile like an idiot whenever Park Bogum is on my screen smiling.However, I did not like their acting in this drama. While I felt the chemistry (good job director), I did not feel they each liked their characters or embodied them comfortably. Especially Song Hyekyo (I love her but I have to say it) was expressionless most of the time and I felt this was the worse acting job she has done. It was sad to see and put me off. Park Bogum tried his best with his goody-two-shoes perfect specimen of character, but he still came of a bit bland. I enjoyed his role in Hello Monster much better!The supporting cast was much better in comparison. And were actually fun to watch.HOWEVER, you will forget everything when you watch the drama because of its photographically beautiful cinematography. It's a photographer's heaving! The sceneries were eye soothing, delightful and magnificent!I took about a month to watch all the episodes where as usually I finish a 16 episode kdrama in four days. So, it was a boring watch for me. But, I will still recommend it to you. Your view might be different to mine. (Plus those charming views must be seen!)"
13,Encounter,I am giving it 10 stars because this drama is different from other K Dramas. It is so simple and subtle that you fall in love with both characters.Park Bo Gum always do amazing work with his charm. Simplicity at its best.Also there are many negative reviews regarding this drama. But if you want to see something different then supernatural KDrama then this is it.
14,Encounter,"I adored this kdrama!!!! From the first episodes the immense charm of Park Bo Gum, the magical story and the exotic Havana, made me totally attached to this drama!!! I just couldn't stop watching it!!!Loving story, full of romance, magical scenery, kindness, beautiful words and charming leads!For me, overcoming obstacles to win the love of your life, while being true to your own principles, would be the main message of this drama.Happiness followed by sorrow gave us emotional ups and downs.I cannot even express how Park Bo Gum has PERFECTLY acted on this role! I feel that whole drama was played on his face expressions alone! And... OMG!!! he was so, so, so HANDSOME, especially with his long hair!!!!! OMG!!!! So Handsome!!!!!! Love you Park Bo Gum!!!Song Hye Kyo was also great in her role of the ""cold face"" woman, living in such an oppressive environment.Excellent love story!!! I adored it!!!!"
15,Encounter,These K-dramas really know how to do romance. The cinematography is excellent...perfect advert for Korea and Cuba. Each episode gives me a tingly feeling at the top of my head. There are no coincidences just pleasant believable serendipity.
16,Encounter,"Like many of the recent Korean dramas, the story really starts off in a foreign location, Cuba. The series has wonderfully captured the charm of Havana with its beautiful cinematography and music. Park Go Bum, expert traveler and amateur photographer comes to the aide of a hotel CEO who has lived a life dictated by others up to this point. Despite her reserve, his warmth draws her in and she allows herself one evening to really live. Fade away and they are next in Seoul where she is the CEO and he is a newbie employee. The friendship continues to grow despite her desire to keep him at length. No wonder. Who can resist his smile? You can't help but hope that there is a happy ending despite their differences in social class or wealth or age."
17,Encounter,"...and that's enough!I have a lot to say.First, it's true, that the female lead does not seem to feel anything.I came up with two explanations. First, she is portraying a broken person, someone who was taught to forget about herself and her own dreams or desires to just turn into a puppet. Habits die hard. Moreover, she is so not used to beeing happy that she doesn't know how. And she's afraid she'll have to pay for it at some point. Finally, what woman her age could dream of keeping a Park BoGeum ? Hm?Second explanation: Most Korean actresses are bad a conveying their character's feelings. I noticed that a lot. The pathos always seems to be brought by the male leads (first and second leads). It was painfully obvious, for instance, in ""Are You A Human?"", a perfect drama minus the female lead's poor, pathetic acting. She was the human falling for a robot, and yet, the robot was the only one who actually seemed to feel! Those actresses behave as they should, it's just that their faces seem to be carved in stone. Son Hye Jin is an exception.That brings me to watching this after seeing ""Something in the rain"", one of my favoutite dramas ever!!! Son HyeJin and Jung Hae-In? You ship them toghether right away, HuynBin or not Hyun Bin! The comparison would definitely make Encounter feel dull and akward. So I tried not to compare.Still, when a statue-like actress stands next to Park BoGum and his amazing, breath-taking, heart-crushing (I'll end up inventing words here) acting skills, It doesn't look good.That was the only complain. There went a star.Park BoGum. Well. Do I need to add anything? Just... even if you're not gonna watch the drama, check episode 11 on 7.10. This scene will show you another side of him. Not an angel anymore is he? OMG, I keep watching this, chills... Oomph!I liked that the story was simple. Nobody looses their memory or gets murdered. There is no huge side love story to take away most of the show. It's just two people falling in love and struggling to make it in a hostile and judgemental society.I loved that there were black people! Woah! So many of them! Some of them could even be seen for more than one second! One of them could even speak ""up!"". Un-believable!So far, I only saw a black person with a meaningful role in ""I am not a robot"". In Memories of the Alhambra, black people just stand there. They don't speak. In ""Moon embracing the sun"", there is a black kid: a thief. In ""The case of Itaewon homicide"" a black man speaks for a fews seconds, And in ""Boys over flowers, there are two black people with a few lines...I admire that some directors dare show what might hurt korean eyes. First, black people outside Korea. Some day, who knows? Black koreans?I loved that drama. And not just because of PBG."
18,Encounter,"While I have been a longtime fan of Korean movies, especially the thriller genre, it has been less than 6 months since I started watching kdrama. With the help of the confinement I have watched a good number since then, including a few romcom or love stories which I liked. Believe it or not, this is the first time I saw either leads and it's only by reading other reviews here that I learnt they are both big stars despite their age difference. Hence my review is not influenced by their reputation nor am I in a position to compare their performance with their other roles. I am rating this show simply based on my enjoyment and my expectation from a love story.Many reviewers considered the plot too simplistic and boring. That's one of the main reasons I loved this show. I did not want a thriller or political intrique. I wanted to see two people falling in love and eventually falling out of love. I wanted to see their relationship grow as they talk to each other. I am not looking for plot twists unless they come from the couple themselves - fear, lack of trust, over possessiveness, pride, self-interest... so I was happy that a large part of the show is focused on the couple. Apart from the mandatory breakup, I am relieved there aren't many plot twists. Everyone knows there are always at least one or two evil or well-meaning characters who will get in the way and they are here but, as far as I am concerned, they don't distract from the core love story.Is the love story realistic? Of course not, in terms of a beautiful and tragic CEO's chance meeting in a foreign land with a handsome but much younger man who turns out to be a future entry-level employee in her company. But in the context of a love story and a modern day fairy tale, this is not a problem.In real life, for better or for worse, the office romance between a (female) CEO and a much younger (male) employee, if that actually were to happen, would obviously be problematic and considered socially unacceptable by most. In a fairy tale drama, that makes for a good story.As a guy I at first found Park Bo-gum's physical feature too feminine and his smile too cheesy and borderline creepy. However, after getting used to it, I admit his youthful, idealistic and always sunny outlook is exactly what his character is supposed to be in order for the CEO to fall in love with him. More than anything else in this drama, I find his forever optimistic and never-angry personality the most unrealistic element. Yet, because I view this as a fairy tale and the actor played this role so naturally, this does not distract from my enjoyment of this show at all.As mentioned, my enjoyment of this show comes from watching our couple's relationship evolve. Truth be told, their relationship is rather simple. He fell heads over heels for her (for her beauty?) and she for his optimistic and free spirit life view, romantic character and ultimately his ability to rescue her from her self-imposed habit of sacrificing her own desire and happiness for that of others. Literally, he is her knight in shining armor and, viewed from this angle, her attraction and love for him is totally believable in my book. The actress Song Hye-kyo is classy and her portrayal of a stoic figure with tragic history is touching.This is my first 10 rating for a kdrama. Not because it is perfect, but because the actors are fabulous and they brought to life this simple love story and feel-good drama which happened to be what I am looking for at this time, without too many tedious subplots and turn twists which are common in most Kdramas."
19,Encounter,"Overall Rating deserves to be > 8.3.I was really hung up & stuck with sad ending from ""the rise of Pheonixes"" but then stumbled onto this show.Even though it had a rating of 7.2 boy I am glad took the chance and watched the show.It's a feel good show. This is added to the my list of shows that are worth rewatching."
20,Encounter,"Being divorced myself, I really connected with this show. Song Hye Kyo plays the lead so well, I really felt for her throughout the season. It really depicted the struggle of a divorced woman who would still like to live her life, have a career and deal with the fallout of her marriage in a way that was completely relatable. Her meeting a younger man who intrigues her, even though she knows it shouldn't and their journey was lovely to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend a watch to anyone."
21,Encounter,"Really poor drama! No chemistry. Park Bo-gum tries his best, though he relies too much on his smile, but Song Hye Kyo is just plain boring. Hard to believe that there is any real attraction. Gave up half way through. Life is too short and there are better kdramas out there."
22,Encounter,"This show was slow. Just their romance not everything else. I mean they would show every pause the actors take and that was annoying as hell. I expected a lot from this drama but it was a disappointment. Why? Because the women didn't show any emotion even when she was with the guy. This was just the opposite of a cold male CEO. In this case it's the women. Their romance was dull boring. And the first encounter was not at all realistic. I don't know what it was I tired really hard to like it but I couldn't. All I can say is that it's not everyone's cup of tea.However, there are two reasons why you should watch the show.
1. The lead actor's smile. Seriously his smile is drool worthy because it made the show. It was the only thing I looked forward to. His character's personality was also good.
2. Landscapes. The first few episodes we're set in cuba and had shown beautiful landscapes. Places you would like to escape to.Other than this. I didn't like the show that much. Please note. I just watched around 5 episodes. I couldn't bring myself to complete the series because I am very picky and I like good plots."
23,Encounter,"In my opinion this is the best of the serious romantic KDranas.It beats nearest contenders ""Something In The Rain"" and ""One Spring Night"" due to its consistent pace and evenly spread key scenes that advance the relationship.Its not cutesy, but the main couple are good together.It also handles the secondary characters well.Shame there aren't more like this."
24,Encounter,"This is the first #Kdrama I have seen after completion of all seven seasons of Bollywood drama #Thementalist. As no other movies & dramas are at par with #Thementalist, I was searching in all languages with English subtitles. Finally randomly I have selected #encounter, which is the first Kdrama. Initially, I wasn't expecting too much expectations as like #Thementalist. Whereas this drama satisfied me in all aspects and especially my interest and expectations on Kdramas have increased to a different level. In #Encounter, I enjoyed #Songhyekyo acting very much. Because of her I have seen her all other dramas which are available in #Netflix #Fullhouse #descendantsofthesun and #Thatwinterthewindblows. Now I am waiting for her upcoming serial in #Netflix. Thanks to her entertained me in my difficult phase.Thank you

25,Encounter,"Just finished series. The scenes in Cuba were beautiful. Both lead actors are very talented just felt it was a mismatch. As a mom, it was a little cringy to see a 20 something year old with a 40 year old. I know I would be upset. And her hairstyle made her look even older. This was a series since I started it had to finish it."
26,Encounter,"This is a story of a sugar boy who meets a rich princess, and has no problems but how to find a good entertainment to seduce the princess. This movie is not about real life. It shows what Koreans live for, wealth, money, beauty, perfection.
In my opinion this movie has no value at all, is far distant from reality. This show should end on episode 15. This show is for loosers who dream about wealth, money, beauty, perfection."
27,Encounter,"Bo-gum is honestly the best actor I've ever seen.... his facial expressions and all the emotions he shows.. I've never seen them in anyone else's face <3
He also shines in ""Lovein the moonlight"" so make sure you go watch it!"
28,Encounter,"I was waiting for this drama for so long, that I had such high expectations for it. I loved it. But it lacked that ""oomph"" aspect from my perspective. The storyline at the beginning of the drama was beautiful, but then it was sort of repetitive and I kind of watched the last few episodes with a bit of lack of interest although I'm very biased towards Bo Gum that I didn't have enough looking at him. It was okay for me, magical at first but then cool down but the reality of things."
29,Encounter,"I'm a big fan of Korean drama and whilst some are good and some I drop after a few episodes. I really love this Drama. A really good start at the beginning and you will love the 1st episode. It drags a little in the middle. But overall, a great wrap up in the end. Jin Hyuk (main male character) show's really great emotion and Soo Hyun (female lead) is so beautiful. My new fav Korean actress.
Anyway, I was smiling alot throughout the series and was always excited when it would be out. Cried a few buckets on the last 2 episodes. But also smiled alot. Go ahead and enjoy the series :)"
30,Encounter,"This was my second Kdrama - but the first I watched right through I(at 16x70 minute episodes its not too long!) I found the two leads likeable and believable and their growing relationship handled with a convincing blend of awkwardness and comedy. All the characters seemed very grounded (apart from the wicked mother-in-law) and there were no irritating over-acting stereotypes padding out the plot.The script makes repeated and extensive use of flashbacks as the two lovers reflect on what has happened / what people have said, often referencing scenes from much earlier in the story, reflecting a very strong sense of structure. The premise is good - that's what hooked me to start watching - but the writer doesn't fully get to grips with it (eg the fact she would have turned 40 late in the story - he's 30 by then - is ignored even though their age difference is a big deal for everyone else). Supporting cast storylines - the spiky personal secretary/friend and the ex-husband especially - start of well (and have good actors inhabiting them) but then stall by about episode 8 - possibly because the ex-husband is becoming a surprisingly sympathetic character and the writer didn't want to genuinely challenge Park Bo Gum role as the love interest.It's a fascinating insight into Korean culture. As noted by others, the romance, while beautifully shot, is passionless to the western viewer - they probably kiss 5 or 6 times but never with urgency or sexual desire. As its winter most of the time, the lovers are usually in sweaters, jackets and coats; given the photogenic nature of the two leads its striking that we never see any flesh other than neck, wrists and ankles. The power wielded by mothers (and the archetypal villainess mother-in-law) is disturbing, and the codified respect given to those 'above you' in business or society is dramatically displayed.Song Hye Kyo is gorgeous - the age difference between her and Park's character is not very obvious - but as she is now 40 in real life, it will be interesting to see how her career continues and what Korean tv can offer her. I suspect she is capable of a lot more challenging work than what she will be scripted to do."
31,Encounter,"I didn't manage to finish the series. I stopped at the 5th episode. The leading guy is cute; perhaps too cute for a guy. The leading lady is too expressionless and cold. She makes one wonder why would someone fall for her. All in all, a rather boring romance."
32,Encounter,"I thought that the acting in this show from all the characters was amazing.
The story really pulls you in and keeps you engaged, it was just magic.
I really enjoyed watching this."
33,Encounter,"Just like my headline shows, the acting of the both lead actors......the whole cast is flawless in this drama. Song Hye Kyo showed everyone again that even a simple storyline like this which is one dimensional, can be beautiful to watch. She found a good comrade in Park Bo Gum. They killed almost their every scene together(which is mostly the whole drama btw).
The emotional scenes towards the end is the highlight of this drama. Every time Hye Kyo had tears in her eyes, she made me cry(and i never cry watching dramas btw). She is the most beautiful crier I have ever seen in dramas.
Park Bo Gum played the role of a handsome man in his late twenties who is more mature than his peers of the same age. In the beginning one of his friends said that he had never seen him get angry or fight anyone. So I was waiting patiently, episode by episode just to see him get angry at anyone once. But it really never happened.
The story doesn't have many shades. It flows in only one direction. But the dialogues.............. man they are amazing. This drama has some great poetic lines.
So the summary of this nonsensical review is that Flawless acting and Poetic Dialogues can turn an ordinary story into an extraordinary drama."
34,Encounter,"""If the sea's job is to make waves, mine is to thin of you"" (translated from a Korean poem).Park Bo Gum said this ""I like to act in shows that have meaning, and make people laugh and cry. This explains why he chose to act in Encounter, in addition to the passionate, free-spirited and optimistic character of Kim Jin-Hyeok which he's drawn to.I am watching this drama a second time because a year ago when I watched it, I was a Song Hye Kyo fan more than a PBG fan. Now I heart PBG as I've come to appreciate his acting talent. This time, I pay closer attention to the dialogue, and I feel like I'm receiving a richer experience, and able to empathise deeper with the characters. (His other great work includes ""Reply 1988"", ""Hello Monster"", ""Love in The Moonlight"" and the most recent ""Record of Youth"").The plot revolves mainly around 2 protagonists - the young Kim Jin Hyeok in his 20s smitten by the older Cha Soo-Hyun in her mid 30s. KJH is just beginning his career in the hospitality industry while CSH is the CEO of the Donghwa hotel chain and a well-known business woman in high society. The 1st episode is set in romantic Cuba where they first meet, and there is instant chemistry between them. When they are back in Korea, harsh reality sets in as we witness how the couple fight against the social norms of a judgmental and gossipy society like Korea. For audience who come from more liberated countries, you have to understand that Korea is very traditional in terms of background compatibility and filial piety where children of ambitious and rich families are obligated to marry for alliance reasons.KJH is like a breathe of fresh air to CSH's stifled, lonely and routine life. His courage to save her from humiliation in turn gives her courage to want to protect him and live her own life, breaking the shackles of her evil ex-mother inlaw. KJH also has his own share of issues to grapple with as he's suddenly thrown into limelight and labelled as the pretty boy chasing a rich and lonely older woman for materialistic reasons.The focus of the plot is on the romance between the two characters in a corporate environment, where CSH stands to lose her hotel if she is not shrewd or careful as she continues to pursue her love. The sub-plot of the supporting characters are interesting to watch too. And I heart CSH's uncle driver who always finds ways to allow CSH and KJH to spend private time together. He's like an accidental cupid. There isn't a lot of exciting corporate scenes.Acting wise, I feel Song Hye Kyo lacks emotions. She smiles weakly, cries easily and while some of her scenes touch me (the restaurant scene where she is holding KJH's camera to take a photo of KJH, and she suddenly weeps behind it because she can hide her sadness behind the camera - my heart cannot!), overall I think she has done better in other drama series. Maybe this is CSH's character - elegant, witty, and mature so she can't afford to have too much facial expressions? Park Bo Gum, on the other hand is able to emote his character and I find myself rooting for him and feeling sad with him. Even before I was his fan, his acting already affected me. What more now?!So should you watch this drama in light of the mixed reviews? I'd say you give your time to at least 2 episodes and then assess. This drama will test if you are a logical and critical audience or if you would just get pass that and focus on ""following your heart"". It's a show where you would want to watch alone in a safe space because when you are immersed, you will have all sorts of silly expressions - laugh and cry - alongside the characters. It may convert a realist into a romantic, the conventional to unconventional, and trigger the emotional side of you which you thought you have lost touch with. If you are willing to be an open and vulnerable audience, I am sure you would enjoy every moment of the drama.Now I understand what PBG and SHK chose to act in this show."
35,Encounter,One of the best heart fluttering drama i've ever seen. Plz try this . you wont regreat
36,Encounter,"This movie is like a beautiful poem
Amazing actors, BGM, cinematography.Felt watched a organic creation
Kudos to the makers."
37,Encounter,I'm truly in love with this drama. Every characters of this drama are just beautifully done their best. And again I'm in love with Bo gum. He's just a gem..
38,Encounter,I really love the show. The story was charming and beautiful. All actors were great main cast and supporting cast. I enjoy it a lot. It was very calm and more realistic drama. I will recommend this drama.
39,Encounter,"Every thing is on point. Characters play their roles so well you fall in love right from the start. Loved the OST (esp Take Me On), the timing of the soundtracks makes this series touching."
40,Encounter,This show is just beautiful whether we talk about the romantic scenes or the sound tracks.this show is just awesome.but I don't understand why this drama got so low raiting on imdb?
41,Encounter,"I've been watching again and again. The drama makes me so happy, warm. Although I cried a lot when I was watching it, I like it a lot! Don't know how to describe exactly but so amazing!"
42,Encounter,"This show is extremely well written and acted. When I watch the scenes between the 2 leads, it makes me smile ear to ear because it's so heartwarming. The way the 2 leads flirt and joke with each other is very cute and endearing. The supporting actors have their own interesting sub-plots and are great also. When I saw Park Bo Gum in ""Itaewon Class"", I thought he was just a pretty face but boy was I wrong, he is an excellent actor. He is very natural, and does a great job expressing the emotions of his character. I love all his facial expressions. It's just so fun to watch. I love his carefree character in the drama, so charming, witty, kind, sensitive and selfless. It's a kind of character that you don't see much in dramas."
43,Encounter,"Encounter was the last drama Song Hye Kyo did before her hiatus for over two years. Since she is coming back with a new drama project, I decided to rewatch Encounter to mark her comeback.Its story revolves around Cha Soo-Hyun (Song Hye Kyo), a daughter of a politician father and an ex-daughter-in-law of a powerful family. She met Kim Jin-Hyeok (Park Bo-Gum) in an unexpected encounter during her trip to Cuba. They met again as CEO and employee in South Korea.This drama is one of those fairytales dramas most people grow up watching - the princess and the pauper. The good thing about it is that the production team embraces its concept. It is evident in the animated fairytale short intro of every episode. There are plenty of aesthetic shots in the drama that gives viewers a more romantic and fairytale feel. To tweak a cliche romance drama, Yoo Young-A, the writer, decided to make the female lead the CEO and have the opposite main character do the cute antics. In the past, it was always the other way around. Song Hye Kyo has her little share of acting cute, though. Of course, the never-ending battle-for-the-CEO-sit is still there, but at least it didn't involve any villain-plotting-to-murder-the main lead plot. The drama has an overall sad tone, but the supporting characters lighten up the mood.Cha Soo-Hyun is the typical CEO character. Confident, poise, with a sad backstory. We always get to see her cry, worry, and occasionally smile. She only got upset once or twice, and it lasted for a minute. It would have been better if we saw more emotions from her. Also, it would have been a good buildup if we saw her character struggle in fighting her feelings a bit more. The impact when she would finally let go and give in to her feelings would have been immense. The drama undermined her character when she turned to male characters twice for advice about what she should do regarding hotel concerns. We don't see male characters doing that. They contemplate and make decisions on their own. Cha Soo-Hyun is supposed to be confident, and she has been running the hotel for years. Heck, she even upgraded the hotel's status from a three-star to a five-star hotel. For sure, she would know how to deal with those concerns. Song Hye Kyo's performance as Cha Soo-Hyun is satisfactory but not consistent. It was cringy watching her act worried in some of the scenes, but she's good other than that.The male lead Kim Jin-Hyeok is the perfect boyfriend. Good looking, overly kind, family-oriented, thoughtful, and sweet. He's flawless, which is disappointing. It wouldn't hurt to give him one weakness for a little realistic characterization. On the other hand, Park Bo-Gum did an exceptional job as Kim Jin-Hyeok. He gave life to his role and owned it. His cute antics and sweet smiles would reach you, but the cheesy lines would get you too.If fairytale-like romance is your cup of tea, for sure, you'll enjoy Encounter. Overall, it's a decent drama for hopeless romantics, but not for realists."
44,Encounter,"One of the best Kdramas I have seen so far. Loved Song Hye Kyo in Descendants of the Sun, and here she also shined with her talent to bring to the screen the best not only of herself but also of her partners . She is really a great actress.
This drama is a masterpiece. It is modern and still succeeds to bring to life traditional Korean values which seem in their rightful place. It is so rare in dramas to see so matured and complex characters, portrayed so finely that you can feel them even through the screen. It is also rare in dramas characters to go beyond simple, first-signal reactions and fast-processed, cliche-ed insights - nothing of the sort here. In a world, where love and kindness are considered weak and simple, they show us how to turn the defeat into victory with the power of love.
All kinds of love thrive here - not only romantic, which the drama more satisfying for me. Love that strengthens the ties between people and does not destroy them, love that is worth fighting for, love that can bring you back to life - I wish everyone of us could be so wise and strong to build such a love in their life. Because all characters here did just that - made the effort and built their lives on love. Here love was the power of life and this film sets an exemplary model to follow in our lives too. Even the worst betrayals, when seen through loving eyes, are worth forgiving - and what a great prize comes at the end!
Highly recommended!"
45,Encounter,"The first drama that I want to write the review and maybe will be the only drama that I want to write the review. Even maybe too late but still it's better than nothing.
Good story
Best acting of the actor make the best chemistry ever that make it feel like a real life.
Simple slow and calm story but really deep means
So amazing 💯👏👏👏👏👏
Make me want to watch it over and over and until now I've watch it more than 2 times minimum 3 times and I think I will still want watch it for the next 50 years.
Park bo-gum Song Hye Kyo best chemistry ever.
He has a million dollar warm smile that could steal everyone's heart.
#blossomentertainment #encounter #parkbogum #songhyekyo"
46,Encounter,"Im truly touched watching Encounter. Park Bo Gum! His eyes speak, he reflects his emotion so perfectly with facial expression and i liked the way he talks! He is a complete actor! Cinematography, music, dialogues, script, direction all were more than perfect! Loved it."
47,Encounter,"Beautiful movie, excellent acting skills from both SHK and PBG. The love story is so gentle, heart-warming and makes you feel so much in love. Their on-screen chemistry is wonderful and amazing to watch!"
48,Encounter,"The story is very simple but it keeps you engaged. The story develops slowly. If you are not that much a fan of slow paced drama then it's not for you. The dialogues, the soundtracks are just so perfect. This drama is beautiful in its own way. With a simple plot and outstanding acting from the actors it touches your heart. To be honest I found myself smiling while watching the drama. The hurdles are simple yet realistic. The only way it lacks to me is, I wanted to watch the growth of relationships of side characters as well. To me it was one of the dramas that livened up my days."
49,Encounter,"Couldn't have been better. It start with an amazing first episode laying the perfect groundwork for the rest of the show to go on. It becomes a bit slow later on but in my opinion, it worked for the show this time. It makes the scenes more important and conveys the feelings better. The casting was great."
50,Encounter,"If u like to see a Man as a rabit and a woman as a paper towel see this show
Disgusting relation"
51,Encounter,The plot is loose. But sound tracks are awesome and placed at perfect moments. Perfect series to let the time flow.Song Hye Kyo is the best <3
52,Encounter,"This is first time i see korean drama...
Story, plot, detail, soundtrack, its so amazing!!
&Maybe, just this my korean drama...
Best romance film in my life...Uh, I dont know...
This film, make me feel falling in love again..."
53,Encounter,"The story is so simple. And could happen. The man is very love the woman and so kind. Didn't have a bad intentions. The woman also so love, but think to much. But the the reality. PBG so handsome. Song Hye Kyo so pretty. She look older than PBG as a story need. Make love her from now. I love U Full SHK. 😍"

110,Another Miss Oh,"Another miss Oh is about two women who share the same name. Therefore they had been often confused for one another since high school. But the biggest confusion was yet to come, as the first's ex fiancé destroys the second's wedding, believing that she was his ex lover. And the story gets even more complex, but fortunately, it is easy to keep up and it actually quite interesting. The fact is that the drama keeps you entertained up until the end, though the last episode wasn't as good as the rest of the series. Though the secondary stories weren't as good (actually they were kind of foolish), but the main one was really good. The romance was great, with good chemistry between the two leading characters, as well as great performances, that give out laughter and sadness as well. So, 8 out of 10."
111,Another Miss Oh,"There are two Oh Hae Youngs, one is beautiful and successful and one is ordinary and plain. They went to the same school where the ordinary one was continually embarrassed for sharing the same name. There lives become linked again through one man Park Do Kyung who has foreboding visions of his future. An excellent cast with highly entertaining stories of their own, and a truly outstanding performance by Seo Hyeon-Jin who wears her heart on her sleeve. A great series which captures moments and approaches in different relationships, with families, friends and those they love."
112,Another Miss Oh,"An innovated plot, with the terrific acting of two excellent lead couple. Male lead is hot and musculine. Female lead is famous of acting in comedy. But I must confess that I am a bit tired of the fussy girl female lead is acting in every of her drama. Simply looking for something new from her.All in all, an ok film though."
113,Another Miss Oh,"Episodes.Oh Hae-young (Seo Hyun-jin) grew up in the shadow of another girl, who went to the same school, who had the same name. Things finally seem to be going right for her in her adult life when she is on the verge of marrying Han Tae-jin (Lee Jae-yoon) an attractive businessman who is worthy of bragging about. However, the day before their wedding, Tae-jin breaks it off saying some very hurtful things. Park Do-kyung (Eric Mun) is no stranger to heartbreak, his fiance did not show up on the day of their wedding. Do-kyung finds out that Hae-young is going to marry another man, Tae-jin and Do-kyung and his friend formulate plot to ruin the husband to be and stop the marriage. Do-kyun is a successful sound director who supports his brother and his widowed mother. His mother is looking for a wealthy husband who just so happens to have the right connections to help Do-kyung carry out his plot. Only problem is he is breaking up the wedding, and ruining the husband to be, of the wrong Hae-young. Now there are two miserable, jilted, people who fatefully cross paths and find solace in each other. Hae-young does not know Do-kyung, who she is drawn to as if by fate, is the very person who caused her current unhappiness. Can a relationship built over such a deception last? Tae-jin is acquitted and returns to reclaim his intended bride. Will Hae-youngs feelings rekindle? The other ""pretty"" Hae-young returns and decides she made a mistake and wants Do-kyun back, will her beauty and style win back Do-kyun? Can the ""normal"" Oh Hae-young step out of the shadow of the other Hae-young and realize her own worth?I liked this one but I didn't love it. Some of the posters showed dolls and such so I thought it would be a lot more comedic than it actually was. The characters said things to each other that I cannot imagine anyone saying to someone else and that person still liking them. They also say things about other people and life that is a bit shocking. I really liked the side romance. I also liked the main male lead's sister and his friends. The story was compelling, the romance was sweetly satisfying but there were times, when I felt angry or shocked at things the characters said or did. I also found that it dragged a bit for me, in some areas. And her mom was strangely abusive to her daughter. it was good but I didn't think it was great. Totally worth watching but not a list topper."
114,Another Miss Oh,"An initially interesting start devolved into an utter, cringy mess.
The premise of this show was somewhat interesting, but I literally hated every single character in this show. Seriously. Every. Single. One.
At the start you kind of like the cast, but within a few episodes they grow annoying, and eventually just straight up intolerable. Do Kyung is boring and emotionless. Hae Young 1 is a screaming, crying nightmare. Hae Young 2 is a spoiled princess brat. Both Hae Young and Do Kyung have AWFUL mothers. Do Kyung's older sister is just weird and obnoxious. His younger brother is annoying and immature, and his girlfriend acts like a 12 year old. They are also all alcoholics (except for Do Kyung who ""doesn't drink"" but then he does every time he gets really upset?). This was a mess, and the seeing the future story line was the most interesting part and it really wasn't that great in the end.
And the soundtrack! OMG if I had to hear those same two songs one more time I felt like I could have been pushed to murder someone! Just awful!
Skip this one, it is a waste of time."
115,Another Miss Oh,It was very infuriating how the male lead character played by Moon Eric very passive and unwilling to fight against a fate he believes he deserves. That did not help the story at all and pretty much suffocated the atmosphere of the whole series with heavy feelings. Sometimes it felt so hard to watch or even finish the episode. This series could have been a gem if the lead character was given the willingness to not accept the consequences and to unearth the truth.
116,Another Miss Oh,"In the beginning of a few episodes, not a fan of the leading she is messy, clumsy, plain Jane, really crazy, always wasted, really pathetic, no self-confidence, talks trash & frivolous.Her ex-fiance is more handsome than the lead actor.The leading actor is considerate, sweet but fickle-minded.His ex-fiance is definitely more pretty & sweet.The actor mom is despicable! So hard to watch! She is so abusive! She uses her son, take advantage of him, gold-digger & thoughtless!Do-kung is lucky to have a bestfriend that cares so much for me, including his younger brother & the 3 guys that works for him when he is sad. They are there for me, no question ask!I am very surprised that I actually like the drama & will see it again! Their chemistry is awesome! The kissing is so swoonworthy! Definitely worth watching even again. Loved it!"
117,Another Miss Oh,"When I first started this K-Drama, I didn't have much expectation for it, nor was there anyone in the cast I was particularly smitten with (they were all ""new"" actors to me). However, I changed my mind within a few episodes.As romantic K-Dramas go, the plot did contain some of those ""impossible coincidence"" cliches, but overall it was a fairly fresh story. However, IMO it was the the acting which really carried this film, with emotional and believable performances from the entire cast. Also, aside from the somewhat heavy/dark main story, there was plenty of humor on the side to lighten the mood.This show also deserves acknowledgement for containing possibly the raciest make-out scene I've ever seen in a K-Drama (it is in one of the last few episodes). Don't get me wrong, clothes stayed on and no beds were involved, but considering how limited physical romance usually is in K-Dramas, I was still duly impressed that this one didn't pull any punches in it's portrayal of normal adult passion.If you like K-Dramas and make it through the first few episodes, I think you'll be glad you did. Recommended!"
118,Another Miss Oh,"I got through the show quickly because it was simple and funny. Mainly, the simplicity of this series has left no one bored. The concept with the sound director fascinated me from the start until the end and how his profession has found a delicate place in every scene. The delicate tones, noises, sounds sounded like melodies. How he handled it carefully himself only added value.I adored all of the moments associated with the tone. Recording his singing as a child. The recording of her confession of love. After the experience that he always left his recorder on when he was on work, I felt the need to listen to them too. The shot of the night and in the wheat landscape. The whole process of recording sound in a movie was interesting to see.The appearance of the two people with the same name should have been modified somehow. They were both very different and both very beautiful. But the main character was always put down with her clothes, which I couldn't understand, because at the beginning of the series we could see her nicely dressed and feminine.However, if she did this on purpose because of her boyfriend at the time, then it's very mainstream. There are also clothes that are less feminine and still give a person a certain charm, here they were only presented in a bad light.The series has only acted about their looks and that of others. She put beautiful people in the upper class, portrayed her former friend as God just because a beautiful person was with her. If so, then the other Miss Oh couple wasn't made for each other either because of his average look.However, her character traits did not go hand in hand with her insecurity about her appearance, as she always seemed very self-confident even about the outside world. A little contradicting.Even the supporting roles were unrestricted and exaggerated, worst of all I found his younger brother's relationship, which I hated to see on screen, while I loved his sister's relationship but found a bit excessive and too little screen time. So I think the acting skills seemed a bit unsteady, but actually it was the exuberance of the characters lent.This affected everyone except the male protagonist who, in my opinion, was limping a little with his acting skills. The whole drama with Miss Oh Ex, who broke up with her because of her eating habits and that of his mother, could have been skipped, at least that he wanted to kill the director. I found that this idea had to be weighed up better. I would prefer a different concept or less around it, because it seemed to be set in order to fill the time.In the end I can briefly summarize the exaggerated behavior of the characters, because it is in a way embarrassing and cringe. The only significant characters with a lot of meaning behind it were her parents, who adore their daughter, although the actions have not always represented this.And in the last episode, where she begged her mother to move in with him and after the consent, the camera shook when the door was slammed. Did you notice?"
119,Another Miss Oh,Absolutely loved this - This show made me laugh so hard but it also made me cry just as hard - the cast was so good and the 2 main characters were amazing - I wish the show would never end but it did and thank you for such good ending .. what am amazing show.. now that I'm done watching it I will watch it all over again -I'm just in love with the male character.
120,Another Miss Oh,I really really liked all the characters they were great but the main character -Eric Moon- absolutely loved his character and just could not get enough of watching him- he played his character so well - the kissing scenes were the best kissing scenes I have seen in the Asian dramas- on a quest to find more shows with Eric ..
121,Another Miss Oh,"First, I've only seen 2 episodes, but I'm hooked. The premise is original: thinking you ruined your ex- lover's wedding, but actually ruining a complete stranger's who happens to have the same name as her. I'm curious about what happened in the past and what will unfold in their future. There is a surprising amount of interesting characters in the two main characters' lives; I'm expecting more character growth than just the main two.Second, there is just a dash of fantasy with the precognition aspect to make it interesting. I love the character, Lee Jin-sang's response to his friend's new talent (played by Kim Ji- seok, who I'm relieved not to despise this show, because I know he's a good actor who usually plays despicable characters).Third, it's fascinating to see range of responses to the cancelled wedding and how Oh Hae Young (Seo Hyun Jin) responds to different people.Edit: I've now seen all the episodes. It stayed strong throughout; it kept a dash of humor in each episode, too. Definitely one of my favorite K dramas."
122,Another Miss Oh,"I've watched my fair share of k-drama.
So far, you start noticing the repertoire Of ROM-COM where two guys are battling for the love of the main actress lead. But with ""Another Miss Oh"" I find a more refreshing palate. Two main lead are going through the motion of falling in love but too many obstacles in their way. Main actress is funny and just lays her feelings all down in the open. Main actor is reluctant because he had acquired new phenomenal power and had seen what the future potentially brings. But throughout their journey, you can't help but fall in love with these two main leads. Their chemistry is bursting through the screen and I couldn't help grinning at times like an idiot 😜. You have the support of all the supporting characters and each role played is an essential contribution . So basically, you got the best friend support, the disapproval of parents, the crazy yet funny sidekick(s) that gets you through the rough days...I mean, I could watch this drama over and over again and this is coming from someone that doesn't like to repeat already watched movies. It's heartfelt and their kisses and hugs make me believe in true love. You'll laugh, cry and even get frustrated but all in all, just wonderful. So it's definitely a high recommendation for me and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did."
123,Another Miss Oh,"Eric's acting suckssssss . Even the supporting actors much better than him!
The female lead also have really freak annoying character
Its boring!"
124,Another Miss Oh,"The story was indeed very unique. Their humor also very funny and had me laughing even at some ridiculous things. My problem was with the male lead character, he's just very annoying. His character is just a coward and selfish in so many ways. Oh hae young literally pleaded to cry for begging him to stay, but all he did was walking away. And all of the sudden, he got back with her just to save his life."
125,Another Miss Oh,"The whole series tries to make the protagonist look like a vulnerable and great guy. But The big problem is that he destroyed another guy's marriage by accident. He hides this fact from all the people who are affected by the marriage being called of. It is a torture to watch the episodes where they are trying to build romance between the protagonist and the girl whose marriage he destroyed. When I looked at the rating for this series it made me really sad. Wow, so many really enjoyed watching a screwed up plot. In addition to the ridiculous screwed up plot, the show also gives the protagonist a psychic ability to see future. This is so random and useless. The three star is because there are aspects like the Oh's (girl) relationship with her parents that is cute."
126,Another Miss Oh,"I really liked its comedic moments which frankly, comedy isn't one of my favourite genres but it was really good. The romance aspect was good too and you could see how devastated both the leads were during the darker times of their relationship."
127,Another Miss Oh,"I couldn't finish this drama due to the toxic relationship between these two, I don't get why she was so obsessed with him meanwhile he still hadn't forgotten his ex. Besides this I didn't like the acting at all, but I have to say that the concept of the sound director character it's pretty interesting."
128,Another Miss Oh,"I'm on my 3rd rewatch. This time, I've been made to appreciate even more the production quality and the outstanding acting of both leads and all the supporting cast. The direction as well as the OST are great too. Highly recommended."

148,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"So many things about this series are exceptionally good. The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist.
Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Much better than The King Eternal Monarch where there was little chemistry between Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun.
Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching.
The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. For all those who have been disappointed by unsatisfying endings in K dramas this one helps to makes up for some of them.
A must watch."
149,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,""" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)"
150,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The main leads' acting in the emotional, dramatic scenes was very good. The scene that stand out for me are when Sang-tae cries out that his older brother wants to kill him in the hospital in front of the mural. A tear slides down Ko's cheek.The songs in this drama are VERY good! I must add to my Spotify!I feel I am more understanding in mental health after watching this drama. The drama shows various patients with a variety of mental health issues including PTSD, trauma, childhood abuse, autism, etc.Moon Gang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong's kiss scenes were really, really hot. This drama mentioned sexualities, condoms and even showed the two of them assumedly naked under the covers holding on to each other.Ko's fashion style - I love her designer clothes and gothic kind of style. She wears Dior saddle bags, Louis Vuitton scarf, designer heels. The drama didn't shy away from showing brands."
151,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"What can I say about this amazing drama? I really don't have enough words for it. This is a mixture of drama, comedy,psychology, mystery. I was stick to this drama til end because of it's unique storyline (Gem). Even I watched it twice .Talking about acting, I have a crush on Kim Soo Hyun and I'm just amazed at his acting skills. The chemistry between two brothers are awesome. The carefulness, love for his brother made me fall for him again and again. Besides that Seo Ji Yeo is outstanding. I love the way she reacts xD O my my she is damn cute and her acting is on top.This is highly recommended K drama. If you are new to K drama, you can start with this amazing drama."
152,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Grt series funny sad etc and make it better the actress is well BEAUTIFUL
153,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's ok not to be ok is a drama which centres around a psychiatric hospital where the sensetive Moon Kang Tae (Ye-ji Soo) works. Moon Kang has an autistic brother Moon Tang Sae(Jeong-se Oh) who is the only witness to their mothers murder. Go moon Young (Ye-ji Soo) a fairytale book author who writes stories on the dark side (think Tim Burton style) She also has a troubled past with the possibility her father who is at the hospital may have murdered her mother. The paths of the main cast have crossed in childhood, and their relationship with each other is troubled. Go moon is a flamboyant extrovert and once she sees something she likes she focuses on it alone and has no internal awareness. Moon Kang is shy and introverted and the early romantic exchanges between these two are extremely funny and enchanting. The music is excellent, the cast is superb, the story is well written as it slowly evolves and it is directed at a great pace. An outstanding drama with a gothic feel."
154,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"After completing this it was just okay, it started out really good and interesting but like most KD dragged on to much still this introduced maybe a new Korean actress that could be a star"
155,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""This line from ""Rocky Balboa"" seemed to ring loudly in my mind as this series concluded for me. Indeed, no one goes through life unscathed, and some take even greater lumps than most. However, no matter what we've suffered, it's perseverance that matters most. Not giving up. Always push on.To my mind, K-dramas are dominating the television airwaves. While I have watched a few bad ones, most have been anywhere from great to superb. ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" certainly fits the ""superb"" bill for me.As several reviewers have already mentioned, this is a very unique series that deals with the mental and emotional suffering that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. Perhaps that is what makes the series so relatable as well as profound with the central question: when do people finally acquire the courage to take responsibility for their own lives?For so many people in this world, we blame our parents for our misfortunes and our sufferings. Why didn't they love us more? Why did they mistreat us? Where was that unconditional love we were supposed to be showered with?Unfortunately, the answers we tell ourselves are filled with as many lies as the questions we come up with. Perhaps we weren't worthy of that love. Perhaps we simply weren't good enough. No matter what answers we contrive in an attempt to ""makes sense of it all"" we, too often, play the victim.Gang-Tae is a caregiver at a local mental hospital. His body is riddled with scars given to him by patients who have lashed out at him. However, his physical scars pale in comparison to his emotional ones. In short, he truly believes he is not worth loving.Sang-Tae is Gang-Tae's older brother with fairly severe autism. He suffers from a moment in the past when he was present for his mother's murder. The murderer threatens to kill him should he ever tell anyone about it. So scarred by the event, Gang-Tae placates his brother by making sure to move every autumn of every year. He somehow wants to be free of his burden.Ko-Muen Young is a woman who was touted as a princess by her mother; someone who is head-and-shoulders above everyone else. And people should be treated with disdain and contempt for being so beneath her. This is a woman who has no idea how to interact with people. She had no filter, and therefore, speaks her mind and her feelings, both good and bad. She is a little girl desperately wanting someone to love her.The irony is that all three characters, in some way, shape or form, represent some of the most common fears and desires of every single person on this planet: to be worthy of love, to be relieved of our fears and burdens, and to simply be loved for who we are.The series masterfully navigates how all three characters are able to find peace with themselves, and perhaps, even some joy culminating in a last episode that will have you smiling and crying at the same time.Yes, it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to fall. It is okay to be knocked down. It is not okay to give up and stay down. Everyone must find the courage to get up and keep going. That is the series' central message.The performances in this series are top-notch all the way around. However, accolades must truly be given to Jeong-Se Oh (Sang-tae) who turns in a performance that easily rivals Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" In fact, to my mind, Jeong-Se Oh's performance surpasses it. He is truly deserving of any awards he might acquire for one of the best acting performances seen in a long time.This series has almost everything: a mystery, laugh-out-loud moments, heartfelt moments, cringeworthy moments, and plenty of relatable moments, depending on who you are.I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It should almost be required viewing. For perhaps, you might find some ""healing moments"" of your own as you watch this show, and be presented with the question: will you blame others for your problems? Or will you find the courage to begin living your own life?"
156,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean Romantic Drama television Series with 16, 70-85 minute episodes. Alternate title is ""Psycho but It's ok.""Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun) and Moon Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) are two brothers who have lived a difficult and unsettled life trying to outrun the horror of their past. Gang-tae is the younger brother but was told before his mother's untimely death that he should take care of his autistic older brother. who has autism. Sang-tae is the older brother but significant autism leads him to being child like, innocent and honest to a fault. As a younger child, Sang-tae witnessed his mother's murder which left him traumatized and, for some reason, terrified of butterflies. Gang-Tae is a care giver in psychiatric wards and has been able to move from hospital to hospital as they move around. at every place they settle in. Ko Moon-young (Seo Yea-ji), writes dark fairy tales which are inspired by horrific events in her past and an overbearing and abusive mother. She is invited to teach at the psychiatric ward because her books have special appeal for those struggling with their own psychological demons. Circumstances lead the three to the town where they all grew up and when their paths overlap Moon-young is drawn to the quiet compassionate and devastatingly handsome Gae-tae. Moon-young is extremely beautiful but unapproachable as some have indicated she has antisocial personality disorder. Those who irritate or seek to harm Moon-young are likely rto experience her wrath and her manager spends significant time and money cleaning up Moon-young's many social blunders. What Moon-young wants she usually gets and she begins to relentlessly pursue Gang-tae. The two seem like oil and water but are actually more like ying and yang. Can they solve the mysteries of the past and grow a love pure enough to heal both?I am really glad it is ok to not be ok because I certainly wasn't when this ended. I so loved the main characters that letting it go was like leaving old friends. It was such a wonderful and masterful story that was a little like ""The Adam's Family"", ""Rainman"", dark fairy tales, and A Series of Unfortunate Events"" mixed together and birthed something with elements from all yet uniquely its own. The backdrop of the mental hospital was fascinating because there were patients struggling with a wide range of mental health challenges. The honesty, compassion and courage the disorders were presented with spoke strongly to the message that we do not always have to be okay. The two brothers and the way they had their weaknesses yet leaned on each other through a rough and lonely childhood as orphans was very heart warming. Moon-young proved to be a lot less heartless than her exterior portrayed and was the missing key for the duo to become a trio and develop into a true family. The acting was amazing and the music, costume and sets were beautiful. I will watch this again and highly recommend this wonderful series. I would not change a single thing."
157,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I had a little bit of a hard time connecting in the first few episodes because I had no idea what I was watching to be honest!! LOL! But trust me when I say that this series takes a complete 360 and becomes something completely captivating. An emotional, thrilling, heart warming ride! I was not expecting this series to become what it did. Such an amazing and wonderful series. Full of so much story, heart, emotion, trauma including childhood trauma, friendship, romance, family etc. The 3 main characters just grab your heart and never let go. The whole cast is amazing really! Give this one a shot if you love Korean dramas!"
158,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I absolutely loved ""It's okay not to be okay"". Great message, great characters, great chemistry and plot. The cinematography was amazing and really loved the animations as well. Moon Gang-Tae was perfect and very well written, and Sang-Tae really adorable and cute. The slowburn romance between Seo Ye-ji and Gang-Tae was wonderful. Ps. The mental health issues were nicely done, wish more dramas did this!"
159,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Okay, so let me start by saying I loved the whole concept of this show. The slightly ""other-worldly"" feel of it makes this show feel very different from anything I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, from Soo-Hyun's heartbreaking performance, to Ye-Ji's feisty, sadistic-but-fun anti-heroine, to Jeong-Se's unreal acting as an autistic man that is on par with Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. The music is lovely, and the slow-build romance between Moon-Young and Gang-Tae is so wonderful to watch.Now for the flaw - the ""villain."" I absolutely HATED the whole plot-line of Moon-Young's evil mother. It would have been fine if she had remained dead and was just this haunting, painful roadblock for Moon-Young to get over. But instead she somehow survived a fatal fall down a staircase and being thrown into a lake by her husband? And no, this miraculous survival was never explained. Also her face completely changed, and apparently she just got plastic surgery to change her appearance, but somehow no one knew about this? Don't forget she is supposed to be an incredibly famous and popular author. And she was perfect at faking being a really nice and wonderful nurse at the psychiatric hospital that her husband just so happened to be admitted to - how did she even get the job? She just had a fake name and resume? Did no one ever check up on this woman? Honestly it was so dumb and unrealistic, and when she finally showed her ""true colors,"" she was just so over the top ""evil"" that it was laughable and totally ruined the whole mood.The show was saved by the performances of our main characters, but I'm glad they left the reveal of the mother till almost the very end, otherwise I might have stopped watching altogether. I think its worth a watch for the good reasons mentioned above, but the mother story line is something you will have to just ignore."
160,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Two mentally ill people - a man who thinks of everyone but himself and a woman who thinks of no-one but herself - teach each other to function as normal human beings. It's a moving love story.Such an interesting premise, which the actors make entirely believable. However, the acting honours go to Oh Jeong-Se, playing an autistic brother, who stole every scene in which he appeared.This series is well worth watching and highly recommended. It is almost as good as Mr Sunshine and Crash Landing on You, which are also from Korea and are the two best TV series I have seen in years."
161,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Its not exciting and not realistic at many points. However it has few emotional scenes. Overall, I can only give 6.5 because its not that good as marketed."
162,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Without a doubt, this series is the best South Korean series has been ever made in history without exaggeration.
In the beginning, I was not really interested in this show, but the perfect acting of its actors made me convinced that I would continue watching and with each episode the series' magnificence, enthusiasm and events increased. I want to talk about Soo-hyun Kim and Ye-ji Seo
They are undoubtedly the best original Drian romance story and their representation is convincing and realistic without making a frequent occurrence in all the other Korean soap operas.
This is the best Korean series and it makes the rest of the series garbage next to it.
Rate 9 but give it 10."
163,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama's high rating is absurd. Fans of the performers were continuously exhorted on fan sites to rate this show 10/10, never mind the forced acting, the dragging pace and the appalling lack of originality of the series. It has even been shamelessly trying to grab the ""most-watched Netflix series in 2020"" crown, based on inaccurate statistics in a site not affiliated with Netflix that tended to give dramas shown later in the year higher points than those shown earlier. Official Netflix reports have given that crown to other kdramas.The idea of fairy-tale themed episodes is merely a copy of ABC's Once Upon A Time TV series. The storyline where the leads turned out to know each other in the past is so overused in kdramas I could not help but roll my eyes when it also came up in this fan service. Excusing a person's rotten behavior because of things that happened in her past is a rotten cliche. There are countless brave and strong people who have survived much worse trauma than what the spoiled annoying female lead went through without becoming witches. But hey, dress her up in gorgeous clothes and serve up more sex and fans would go gaga. Just turn a blind eye to the harassment the male lead suffered from the female lead. Had the genders been reversed and it was a female being harassed by a predatory male, the outrage would been deafening. But no, the harasser is dressed in designer clothes and you have to understand, she is sick having been through a rough childhood, so let her be. In fact, shower this drama with awards. Sicko predators out there could take a pointer from this drama on how to get away with bad behavior. (sarcasm alert)To fans of performers, please rate responsibly, not blindly giving top marks just to put your idol's show up some lists or to influence awards committees. This has already discouraged people I know from watching more kdramas, wary all kdramas are as bad as this or even worse, since this has such a high rating. Rhapsodizing this as a family show is really going overboard unless you wish to raise wannabe predators. But they would all get cured in the end, right? So, rhapsodize away. (sarcasm alert 2)."
164,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Bring your own smores.I won't try to describe this. Just get in the camper and journey with these characters.This review, and the show's itself is not about spitting hairs over the level of accuracy vis-a-vie certain mental ailments or whether the plot is plausible. Trust me, I understand the pain mental illness brings home. The show creators are giving us a little therapy and laughter in the hurt. It's entertaining enough to mute the outside interference and provide a safe space for a little escape.Every element is a win: Acting, costumes, characters and their arcs, sets, plot, dialogue, writing, directing, and soundtrack. (I want to jump in and have my own nice, long, cathartic, airing-out-my-lungs argument with this gang. What an emotional high colonic that would be.)It all comes together to make something that is truly stylish, sad, sagacious, sanguine, and... SUBLIME. It is way better than just okay.IMHO...
🎬9 🤔8 🎭9 🦋 7 💓 8 ⚡7🌞8🎨10Suggested Age 14& up."
165,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is a series for 12+ of age. It's mostly a series written for children. Very childish. I wish some Korean series drama/romance are for the older target groups. It wasn't bad, but the series consists of 16 episodes. I only found it most interesting when something major happened and that was towards the ending of the series. It's a very soft storyline, nothing really exciting. All I was thinking during the first 6 episodes, okay a big spoilt woman with problems is harassing the man with words. The man is also having problems and you have to wait like 10 episodes until something romantic happens. Before this it's only staring eyes and some soft/romantic music while they stare in each others eyes. If you have plenty enough time and like slow and soft series you can watch this. If you are an adult and also like more adult series and a little bit faster paced series don't watch this. It will bore you."
166,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I watch kdramas since 2000 and this one is by far my favorite. It's extremely entertaining and addicting. The direction, the script, the acting, the cast, the image, the soundtrack and so on are great."
167,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Easiest 10 rating of my life. It's really hard to do romance movies or series that actually bring anything new to the table and feel distinguished and intimate. This series deals with the real harsh nature of life that most media choose to mellow while carefully easing you in. I haven't watched a romance series in a while and this one is what I would describe as perfection. If you are someone who reflects one's self on the lead characters, whether you are a man or woman, you'll definitely enjoy this couple's relationship. I know I do."
168,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's not just a fantastic drama but this has mystery, human emotions, love between friends, strangers, brothers and 2 lonely people. Weak people do strong together!It's really that good. Everything comes together!One of the best!It's worth an extra binge watch!"
169,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Really really really wanted to love this drama but it's too predictable. But I loved the acting and cinematography! Specially the actress was top notch. But too much unnecessary focus on side characters. I liked the emotional views in this drama. Loved how simple his 3 wishes were! Overall I would say it's overrated.
170,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Absolutely love this drama!! Each and every episode was a masterpiece !!
The plot.. story line.. the cast.. the acting omg.. the dresses
Everything was so so perfect !!
Absolutely must watch drama !!
Straight up perfection !"
171,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"As my title says, this drama is certainly different from what I've seen until now, and it's good, really good. And the actors do a marvelous job.
This drama will get you through a very large spectrum of emotions. So it's a must-see. It really is."
172,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Tldr; not for everyone, especially if you don't like unique and different. But if you like picking up that variety donut pack at the grocery store? This is for you, and a tissue box too!One reason why ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" is liked so much. It is literally a gem. The amount of elements it combines from horror, comedy, romance, and mystery; is just insane. Then the creators managed to have real children's books drive the story and still touch on sensitive mental issues.Trying to find a similar Kdrama is almost impossible, especially seeing this one delivered its' elements very well. You might get people calling it over rated just because it is not your stereotypical Kdrama. Which they would probably benefit watching something more vanilla.They also nailed their OST, atmosphere, and aesthetics. Really caught that depressing mood/vibe, while being uplifting when needed.The female lead (Seo Yea-Ji) played crazy love interest very well-to the point people are saying the male lead (Kim Soo-Hyun) didn't do good. I believe he did fine; it just that Seo out shined everyone. On top of that, she looked absolutely stunning in this Kdrama. If you look at her past roles; it is hard to believe it is the same actor.Easily one of my favs and probably is in a lot of people's top ten lists. Something to watch at least once, and then a 2nd time before you hit the hay."
173,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Since there are already so many glowing comments about this show, I won't go into detail on how incredible I thought it was in every possible way. Suffice to say, I couldn't tear my heart or my eyes away. Zero cliches, a deep story with complex, non-standard characters, delivered by compelling performances from the whole cast. Even the ending (where many KDramas tend to come apart or fade away) was beautiful, tightly written and satisfying. Truly KDrama at it's finest. Don't be put off by the uninspiring synopsis on Netflix and just watch it. You won't be sorry.ROMANCE RATING: 8/10 * * *There were only ~3 kiss scenes, however the ones that we got were romantic and passionate, with sizzling chemistry between the lead characters. Viewers are also treated to a few unexpected fan service shots, courtesy of Kim Soo-Hyun's impressive torso and washboard abs."
174,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I've seen some 14-15 Korean dramas and this is by far the best I've seen. Probably among my top 10 shows.The actors play their characters from heart and on point. It's an emotional roller coaster throughout 16 episodes, but keeps a hint of creepy eerie tone at the background, especially in the first 10 episodes.The chemistry between the two lead characters feels so real, which keeps you hooked.In short, it's an amazing show, quite different from other K-dramas and a must watch for everyone."
175,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This is a very well done 16 episodes with very little downtime or story lulls.Sure it tugs at the heartstrings but the characters are so fleshed out and have such great personalities it doesn't miss a beat.
176,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show is magical. It's not something that you would witness before. It will keep you hooked from the beginning till the end. And will make you want to re-watch again and again. Instead of skipping, you will be rewinding to watch a scene to hang on to every word of the dialogue, every eye movement, and every small detail. Even the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful.This show addresses autism, alcoholism, anti social disorder, depression, being lonely and a lot of other mental health issues and finally will give you comfort and closure. This human healing drama is not just about its main characters, every single character has their own story and you will watch it again and again to focus on each of them, to watch their story unravel, to live through their pain, to witness how they overcome these difficulties and rise up like a beautiful butterfly."
177,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show is very special.
Here's why:OUSTANDING acting performances by the whole cast, especially the main cast though. While Kim Soo Hyun has been one of my faves for a while and is the best paid actor in Korea, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se captured my heart with their performance. I truly hope they finally get the recognition they deserve.UNIQUE plot with a rarely approached social issue, specifically in dramas: mental health and how to deal with people who have mental health issuesBEAUTIFUL storytelling and screeningEMOTIONAL journey: I laughed, I cried, I shivered. I was happy, I was sad, I was scared, I was angry.FUN FACT: I've never cried as much as I did watching this series LOL (but please note that this isn't an entirely depressing show because it's not!)This show made its way into my TOP 2 dramas next to Crash Landing On You."
178,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Great title BTW, which never hurts. It's also the official slogan for OK Psychiatric Hospital, a facility by the ocean where Gang Tae ( Kim Soo Hyun ) is a caregiver. He lives with/cares for his older, autistic brother Sang Tae ( Oh Jung Se ) until an eccentric, anti-social author of dark children's books called Moon Young ( Seo Ye Ji ) crashes into their lives.
This is a good, sometimes very good series which doesn't reach the exalted heights of my top shelf ( 30 But 17, While You Were Sleeping, Hotel Del Luna, S1 of Welcome To Waikiki ) due to some frustrating script/directing issues.
What they do get right is that critical central relationship. Yes, it's knee-deep in the sort of incestuous ( as in growing up next door to your future girlfriend ) tragedy endemic to K-Drama, yet the characters are vividly drawn & the bumpy progression towards a real ""family"" is a joy to watch. And speaking of vivid, I'm sure every young actress in Korea was chasing the part : it's a juicy role that not only embraces all human emotions but it's also fun. She gets to say whatever she thinks with no thought for consequences, which includes calling out fools where required & abusing anyone in her way. The male lead isn't nearly as colourfully written, yet is handled equally well.
Handled not so well is an alleged relationship between the author's loud-mouthed publisher & a nurse at the hospital. The script lets them down, while his long-suffering assistant ( such a scene-stealer in While You Were Sleeping ) is wasted apart from the very end. I was also dismayed by how the visual fun of the first few eps is abandoned thereafter, though the show does look good in general and a gothic, Tim Burton vibe is noticeable. And kissing ? There's a bit, & there should've been more; early on, SYJ makes some very raunchy comments in public, but the director coyly cops out later & not because SYJ was just wanting attention.
So casting a gorgeous lead pairing is no guarantee of success ( as proven in Backstreet Rookie ), though it works magnificently here & the chemistry sizzles. KSH has more of the dramatic chores to do & is impressive, while the husky-voiced, ultra-charismatic SYJ dominates the screen whenever she appears. OJS as the brother is effective & the boss of the hospital is enjoyably avuncular & ready with a smile when there's chaos all around.
The ending ? So important in my opinion & leaves a sour taste if it's mediocre. The finale here is thankfully satisfying & left me in tears."
179,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A drama with so many precepts. Every single episode has a unique title of a fairytale and analyse it with a different deep way. An interesting and very smart plot keeps you focused till the last episode. Touchy ,romantic ,funny and depressing at the same time. Amazing acting skills from all the cast but especially the 3 leads were outstanding. Beautiful OST and costumes too.The only negative for me was some story gaps . I would like to see a second season or some extra episodes as an explanation. And also some second roles were a little annoying sometimes."
180,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I actually found it very boring after ep 3-4, but I forced myself to watch it to the end. I love the main actors and their acting skills are amazing, but the story felt repetitive and unpredictable. And I am not going to go into the psychology of the series, how wrong they are, promoting wrong idea about their mental illness and toxic relationships we see in this series. I don't usually mind when tv series romanticize toxic relationships (for example: overbearing, narsisistic CEO), but it didn't work for me in this one because they actually made the characters be involved with psychology, therapy and etc, but they did it poorly as if they didn't want to do the necessary research about psychology which was needed for the story."
181,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It have connected one way ir another to everyone watching this but at the end there will be smile and warm hearted feeling of acceptance that it sure is ok to not be okay.
182,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Just woww... The series is so fine that you can't define that in words. It shows the bond between two brothers in the best way. All characters are written and executed very well. Particularly you will love the character of Sang-tae who is the elder brother of Gang-tae. In their childhood a bad incident happens, due to which the siblings has to change their places often. Sang-tae is mentally weak, but he knows how to deal with people and he is expert in that. Gang-tae loves his elder brother Sang-tae immensely and he always takes care of him. As the story moves ahead, Gang-tae meets Ko Moon Yeung, an author and he starts loving her. The story however has a mystery of butterfly, due to which these brothers have to change their places. Overall this series is a bundle of emotional scenes, thrills and small laughing boosters. You must give it a watch......👍👍👍"
183,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This was a delightfully entertaining, emotionally compelling romance drama (with a touch of suspense)! Seo Yea Ji, by far, is my all time favorite actress: I will continually be fangirling her work no matter what character she plays! Seo Yea Ji, Kim Soo Hyun, and Oh Jung Se were exceptional in their performance together. Each one of them complimented the other perfectly to create a breathtakingly beautiful and brilliant drama: really fantastic chemistry! Wonderful narrative, excellent writing, fabulous script, and fantastic cast! Netflix does it again with an outstanding series! Bravo! Loved it!"
184,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This series has wowed me. It's a fairy tale sprinkled with comedy, romance, murder and a deep understanding of personality disorders. Absolutely brilliant. Characters to fall in love with....go in with an open mind and you'll love it."
185,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story is wonderful, but something is missing from the plot I think.. so that's why it's 9/10. Everything else is perfect. The cast, how they act, the screenplay, storytelling, and of course the main thing in this kdrama is the emotion, the connection, and the messages.. it's simply the best.finished watching at *10/08/2020*"
186,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This was an exquisite piece of art! Highly recommended, from the music, score, acting, story, visual elements, costumes, settings, extras, direction all were top notch."
187,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Story is epic. Each and every episode is fascinating and engaging as to what will happen next.
Songs are so good that i downloaded all the songs right away.
Cast is superb, great acting by Kim Soo Hyun , Seo Yea Ji and Oh Jung Sae .
Saranghae to the show and especially Kim Soo Hyun ❤"
188,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Very dark, gloomy and depressing.How the: ""You are born like this"" about this lady justifies her being constantly rude, cruel and evil to other people and insult them, hurt them or destroy their lives?However, the psychiatric hospital is presented like a kinder garden. Really???I forced myself to watch up to episode 4. But after that I had enough. I could not continue.I am a great fan of Kdrama. I am really an addict. I have never given less than 8 stars to kdrama series. But this one was totally unacceptable for my taste.The 3 stars are only for the good actress acting, the cartoon and the cinematography. Otherwise it would be 1 star.If you are already depressed, don't see it. You will worsen."
189,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It is one of the best romantic series I watched. It will definitely in my top5. It's a simple story two people falling in love and overcoming emotional and physiological wonds.
It's different from usual kdrama and you wouldn't get bored for a single minute. The chemistry background songs were more than perfect. I didn't want it to end. It's more than just romantic series,I didn't want to say the spoilers.
Please watch it , it will make you laughf , cry and happy ."
190,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"IONTBO us definitely worth a watch. Some parts of the show looked somewhat inspired by Tim Burton, and some other parts like the books illustrations reminded me of the movie ""Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart"". The cinematography is splendid, and the script is thoughtfully written.Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Tae played an award-winning acting as the autistic brother. I was surprised to see him being so into the character, as I saw him played another corporate role in another Kdrama. Seo Ye Ji is terrific as the beautiful, moody, anti-heroine character Mun Young, and Kim Soo Hyun as Moon Gang Tae looks balanced in complementing her.I loved how the ending provided the freedom for the three main characters. Only that I was wishing for a more explained back story of the evil Do Hui Jae ( Koo Mun Young's mother), like how she survived although she was like bleeding to death, how did she have so much money to change her face, why she was behaving like a lunatic despite being a famous writer.. which were all left unanswered. Major plothole there.The supporting characters are filled with kind hearted people who taught a lot about humanity and goodwill. Watching the show kind of opens a new window of seeing life in a different perspective, like finding happiness although life itself feels so dark and gloomy.I think I will rank this kdrama 3rd after CLOY and Descendants of the Sun."
191,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I m just goin with what wasn't very good , i really enjoyed it , the symbols and the way it was written but the fact that it all felt like it was leading to smth big and then it all was just meh , nothin surprising bout the way it all came down except for one thing which i m not going to spoil. The finale itself was nice bc it didn't end like plainly but protected what the whole drama was about. Overall very nice messages and Worth it."
192,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"There is a lot to love about this show. Great characters with interesting personalities, story-telling and animation, some dark themes. It culminates in a touching ending that for me made me miss the characters once it was over."
193,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story of this series was really interesting and unique, which was already enough to make it good. There were also many wonderfully thought out side plots that made me want to continue watching it. The vulnerable scenes were really touching. I really like how you got to see so many different sides of the characters and how they developed and grew throughout the series. Towards the end it did feel a little slow paced, but other that that this series was great."

Haeng-ja: Humans are too weak. That's why they suffer, like your patients.
Doctor: People stick together because they're weak. We lean on each other like this. That's what makes us human. Will you ever be human?
***A beautiful story of love, friendship, brotherhood, family, autism, trust, and acceptance.Perfect screenplay! Magnificent cinematography!
Bravo to all the actors! Many thanks for adding colours to my weekends. I love Gang-tae(Kim Soo-hyun), Mun-yeong(Seo Ye-ji), and Sang-tae(Oh Jung-se) the most. I felt all their emotions. Superb actors indeed! They deserve awards for this drama. I cried on almost all of the episodes. Love the outfits of Mun-yeong. Love the soundtrack as well.This is gold! I give it a 10/10. I strongly recommend it! 💞#itsokaynottobeokay

195,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Wow! That was an exciting ride. I stumbled upon It's okay to not be okay (IOTNBO) accidentally on social media. Actually, that title made me search more about it. And I was hooked from the beginning. Never thought I would see such a beautiful animation in a Korean Drama! That intro was amazing.
The story style, colours, artworks and the soundtrack are so beautiful. They give a fresh and unique experience to the viewers. Hats off to the creators for adding up these artistic vibes to the drama. I enjoyed the way how KMY storybooks intertwined with the original story.IOTNBO mainly deals with mental health. If you listen closely from every character, you learn something for life. Friendship, family, love and drama - it has everything that a typical KDrama has, but it's so much more than that.
Also, I must say the scenes with the patients in the hospital are so powerful. I can't express how much respect and gratitude I feel for caregivers in the health industry.Thank you cast, you all were absolutely brilliant!
Good job Netflix, Thank you for giving a chance to this unique story!"
196,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The cinematography is excellent. It's clear that this was a big-budget drama meant to supersede previous K-dramas in filming quality. However, the whole premise is dull--garden variety sociopath falls for a stiff, self-abnegating man afraid of love. And pursues him. This is their story. I lost interest by the 4th episode. Unless there are interesting distractions, like wars, zombies, challenging primogeniture, escaping enemy territory, etc. a drama that focus entirely on a romance can become boring very quickly. It's better when the romance is part of a larger story and isn't the sole focus on the drama. After enduring the dragging pace and lack of stimulation I switched to another K-drama, ""Kingdom"", for more thrills."
197,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is hands down, the best K-Drama that I've watched so far. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions from having you laughing till you can't breath to sobbing and blowing your nostrils into mountains of tissues. Not many people can say that a tv show can help change your view on life but I truly can say that this drama has. It teaches life lessons and portrays hardships that people go through in such a soulful and ethereal manner that it leaves you starstruck. All in all, even if you've never watched Korean dramas, this is the type of drama that everyone can enjoy with their friends and family."
198,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Very interesting and charming Tim Burton-esque opening sequence. I looked it up to see who designed it and sadly there are no credits listed toward the artists. Not sure why this is but maybe someone can get on that.
199,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I love Kim Soo Hyun, let's get that out of the way first. He's the reason why I watched this show. He's a remarkable and versatile actor and devastatingly handsome. I've followed his career since Dream High and loved every one of his dramas...except this. I can see the premise of the show, and it was actually promising at the beginning. As someone who suffers from mental health issues, I could relate with that aspect of the show, although as one of the reviewers mentioned, it glamourized mental illness...that part of it I didn't like. I do appreciate the healing side of the show and how the characters eventually experience growth and transformation. I also liked how they related every episode to a fairy tale. The concept was there, the execution, not so much. Sometimes the acting was too cheesy. I even felt KSH hammed it up in certain scenes. I liked the Sang-tae actor, he deserves an award for his portrayal. I also liked the secondary characters like Juri, Jae-Soo, and Manager Lee. KSH and Seo Ye-ji did have chemistry off screen (I watched BTS too many times to know), but I personally felt something was missing from their on screen chemistry. The plot was predictable-I already knew, for instance, in episode 2 or 3 who her mother was-and the script was pretty basic. It didn't give me anything new or something to ruminate on. It was literally just a CW show with Korean actors, and one of the reviewers on here actually mentioned how the appeal of kdramas is that they are for the most part more chaste...this was pretty daring, I must say. Very Hollywood, indeed...and I guess that's the effect of kdramas becoming more internationally known, and with the Netflix crossover, one can definitely feel the Western influences on the show (e.g. music soundtrack which I felt didn't match the show's mood). There were many ship-worthy scenes, which I would like to go back to, but the beauty of Gang-tae and Moon-young's relationship was ""the chase"". Once it got to ep. 15 and 16, where the two become an item and do their business, it lost its appeal for me. It seems like the show knew what the audience wanted and gave it regardless of whether the quality was good or not. Some scenes could have been done differently or left to the imagination, but I'm obviously the minority on this. Then the villain which **spoiler alert** the show built up to be this super evil and scary witch-once she makes her reveal, she's eliminated in the same episode like a pesky fly lol a little anti-climatic. I laughed because she waited, what was it, 25 years? To have her revenge. It would have been better if she just tormented her daughter from afar. She got caught by the police so easily and wasn't much of a threat. Finally, never in real life would I buy a book by Moon-Young for a child lol what crazy parent would? And ep.16 was unnecessarily long...even felt longer than the Lord of the Rings 3's ending."
200,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This series started out very cheesy and flashy, but with each advancing episode, the writing and the acting went up a notch, the 2nd half of the series really makes up the obvious cheesy love story. There are some hints which you should pick up, this series is a good detective thriller in disguise, its very well done. The moral teaching, family values in the series are very strong and on point, and really is effective and makes your heart so warm and cheerful experiencing that. The performances by everyone was phenomenal especially Oh Jeong-Se, he was very very good, during the whole time I was convinced that he was suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorder, wow he was really really amazing. Seo Ye-Ji was so good, her performance of a empty can was really well, the way she shouts at small things for making her angry was always funny. The characters were very well written. The flashbacks were very well made, Kim Soo-In was really scary and sweet at the same time. Hee-jin Choi's character was really fleshed out pretty well. The world building was really well done. Kim Mi-Kyung as the only sane and modern mother in the series did a very good job of lightening things up. Kim Joo-Heon was the most cheerful character in the whole series, rally loved him. Kim Chang-wan as a psychiatrist, he was very charming and had a calming presence in the toughest of situations, he was so gooooooood. This was my first Korean Series, I am looking forward to watching more Korean TV shows, I always was a fan of Korean movies as they were so relatable culture wise and character wise, but this new type of content from Korean really blew me away, PLEASE GIVE THIS A SHOT, Don't give up after the first few episodes."
201,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's OK to Not Be OK is a splendidly told tale, beautifully produced, solidly written and featuring outstanding performances from the three leads and super-solid work from a large and talented supporting case.The story is set largely in and around a psychiatric hospital but where it would seem that the three leading characters are themselves in grave need of being institutionalized. The leading man, Moon Gang-tae, played by Kim Soo-yun, plays a caregiver with infinite patience who must live his entire life in slavery to his autistic brother, Sang-tae, outstandingly portrayed by the veteran actor Oh Jung-se, to a point where he is clinically depressed because of the relentless grind. He needs therapy, support, and, truth be told, a day off and a roll in the hay - none of which he ever allows himself to take (despite the fact that two beautiful women are on his case). Even when he has the opportunity to spend the night with one of them, he is so overcome with guilt and depression that he treats her beyond shabbily and then abases himself to his brother, who as can be expected reinforces his humiliation. Sang-tae is not to be blamed for this - he can't help himself - but, for a long time, all the mental health professionals surrounding Gang-tae ignore his obvious symptoms and needs and do little to help him to find balance. This enables a series of dramatic moments, to be sure, but it occasionally lends an air of unreality to the proceedings.The leading lady, Ko Mun-yeong, brilliantly acted by the sublimely beautiful Seo Ye-ji, is also a non-inmate, equally if not more in need of therapy. She plays a best-selling author of somewhat twisted children's fairy tales, with a knack for speaking the unfiltered truth about anything and everything in a way that is excruciatingly uncomfortable for her interlocutors. (I will never forget the lecture to the patients in which she reinterprets Beauty and the Beast as an example of Stockholm syndrome.). For all her self-centered personality, she is, nevertheless, the first person who gives non-material help to Gang-tae. (Everyone else just offers food or a place to stay.) At one point, she asks him straight out the crucial question, ""Are you going to sacrifice your whole life to atone for your sin towards your brother?"", a sin that he had not in fact committed. You have to ask yourself why it is Mun-yeong, and not the health professionals, who first has this insight.Sang-tae completes the trio. He is a talented illustrator but his gifts are overshadowed by his classically autistic personality, which makes him heavily dependent on his brother. Like Mun-yeong, however, he is a speaker of truth and he catches on in an instant if his brother is lying to him or trying to control him with petty deceits.The show's conceit is that these three heavily damaged individuals will find in each other the means to overcome their misery and the traumas of their past lives which, this being a KDrama, are deeply and somewhat unnecessarily intertwined. It's a slow burning process. In a flashback to one point in their childhood, Mun-yeong witnesses Sang-tae fall through the thin ice of a frozen lake. At first, Gang-tae, knowing already that he has been condemned by his mother to a life of servitude to his brother, runs away, but he relents goes back and saves him. Gang-tae in turn needs rescuing from the icy waters, and Mun-yeong throws him a float that keeps him from drowning. When they meet again years later, Mun-yeong slowly falls in love with him (as he with her) and, often against her own selfish instincts (or perhaps to gratify them), she tries to rescue him from his all-encompassing misery.Similarly, Gang-tae tries, at times, to help Mun-yeong overcome her worst self. No one else seems to think that she needs therapy or some other form of intervention. They just complain about her.And Mun-yeong and Sang-tae form an unlikely bond. It begins unpropitiously, with Mun-yeong trying to get close to Sang-tae as a way to break through Gang-tae's iron reserve but in the end, a genuine working collaboration and mutual friendship transcends their relationship with Gang-tae - in one delightful scene at the end, the two force Gang-tae out of the room while they working together on a book. I suspect that people familiar with autism will find some (not all) of Gang-tae's behavior in the later scenes suspiciously un-autistic, but on the whole the show portrays mental health issues in general and autism in particular with great sympathy and some considerable delicacy.There is, perhaps, some artificiality to the whole affair and it is not helped by some of the more irritating tropes of Korean dramas - repeated eavesdropping, characters get drunk, toss up and then forget everything, the incessant arm-grabbing (although for once the women do it almost as much as the men), and the frequency of scenes involving meals, including several irritating Subway product placements.Among the supporting performances, some shout-outs: Kim Chang-wan as the hospital director, Kim-Joo-hun and Park Jin-hoo as the much put upon publishers of Mun-yeong's books, and in a bravura cameo turn, Kwak Dong-yeon as a patient who, with a major assist from Mun-yeong, hilariously disrupts his father's political campaign. There are many others. Perhaps the weakest is the young but very busy TV actress Park Kyu-young, as Nam Ju-ri, a nurse and long-time friend of the brothers, who is appealing but bland, probably because the part is not well-thought out. She descends from a leading role as a true rival for Gang-tae's affections to a distraction who hangs around many episodes after that triangle has been definitively resolved in Mun-yeong's favor.What makes this show so watchable are all the extraordinary performances, lead and supporting, and the engaging character development and situational comedy and occasional drama that are more important than the relatively thin plot. The production values are strong and the use of Mun-yeong's fairy tales, especially the book she writes at the end with Sang-tae's illustrations, is moving and lovely. And I would be remiss not to mention the beauteous Seo Ye-ji's stunning fashions. They are striking but there is no questioning how much she adds to them. In the language of books, this is a page turner. Sixteen hour long plus episodes never felt excessive."
202,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is a beautiful drama to watch, the filming is rich in colour, the storyline is well done. I loved the journey each character goes through to overcome, find courage and learn to love or be loved. I was really surprised by this one as I have by passed it several times. But I finally can say what a beautiful piece this was. So glad I watched it."
203,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"What I liked
1. A merge between fairytale and real-life themed storyline
2. Major character arc
3. Cinematography
4. Realistic portrayal of struggle with emotions and mental health
5. Brilliant acting and dialoguesWhat I didn't like.
1. Acceptance of toxic behaviourThis show has encaptured all possible emotions in a box and sprinkled it across the storyline like fairy dust. I can't get enough of how beautifully the story evolves. This show is not just about romance, it's about-
1. Strong family bonds with people irrespective of bloodlines.
2. How our childhood experiences or the past, both haunts and keeps us alive.
3. People with mental illness are humans too, they need extra strength to come out of the box
4. We don't belong to others, we belong to ourselves
5. Human beings are weak so we should lean on each other to become invincible.
6. Butterfly means psyche, some may see it as madness, and some- cure.
There are numerous little reminders like this throughout the show.
I also loved how the creators gave us a complete picture of the story that will proceed after the show ends. That's some next-level passion for storytelling.Along with this, I want to point out Ko-mun-Yeong's toxic behaviour towards Gung-tae. I understand her pain and her behaviour, but I sometimes felt her controlling behaviour was accepted and barely addressed. Even in the end, her controlling behaviour is just joked about. No matter how much love exists in a relationship, that level of need to control your partner is never okay.This show will always be in my memories- the honesty of this show is one of a kind."
204,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"People can dislike my comments all they want but I will still go ahead and say it. This show was the worst kdrama I've landed my eyes on, for a couple of reasons. As a mental health advocate and psychology graduate I worry people take this show seriously. The way they portrait the female character as doing all these very despicable acts and portraying it like a badass character normalizes mental illness. There is no real message of psychology or self care. The mental illnesses showed were not very realistic and very stereotypical. The girl gets away with doing everything because she has ""trauma"" or she's just too badass. I also don't think it's okay that they portrait her as someone that can do whatever she wants around the main guy and gets away with it.The couple has no chemistry at all and the guy has zero personality nor he stands for himself and everything she does to him. This the perfect example of RUN AWAY from a relationship as it is a very toxic one. The only thing I learned about him was that he really cares for his brother, and that was it.Besides the cinematography this show was a huge disappointment and I don't recommend it."
205,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Perfection on pure state.La perfección en estado puro.La perfection en état pure.
206,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,So happy that there are so many reviews and so many votes in such a short time. What should I say about the great grade ? AMAZING! I am literally going to recommend this to all my acquaintances even though they are not into Kdramas at all. I have to make sure to convince them to watch this because it is absolutely fabulous. Made me cry so hard and laugh with all mt heart at the same time. I have to search some lines and note then down just because the're too good. Just as you note quotes from books. That's impressive! I'm gonna stop here otherwise people will think I exaggerate but honestly..I'm not!
207,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's an okay drama for me, it's a bit overrated, but is the head nurse really is mun yeong's mother ? how did she survived from the fall and being thrown into the lake ?"
208,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The cinematography is absolutely stunning - each shot is unique and breathtaking. The actors are incredible and you're in love with them episode 1. I have never seen another show let alone kdrama at this level of perfection. It better win an award for best show because I'm absolutely floored at the overall gift of this show. It touches and moves you with so many different emotions- I'm only halfway through the season and I'm just itching for more.
209,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Just finished episode 4 and am blown away, everything about it is spot on. Can't take my eyes off Go Moon Young who is made even better by the male lead who never changes expression, he is totally wooden throughout which just makes her that much more spell binding. Looking forward to more episodes."
210,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Very good story, script.
Recommend to watch for people open minded.
-^_^
Lady is so beautiful, I like her and all acting is good.
To be watch!!!"
211,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"When I started watching this web series, it was feeling very bad, slowly when I progressed till episode 7 I started showing interest in it after that I enjoyed it I want to tell you guys that it should be slow at 1.5 speed. If you see it will be more fun, I am reducing this rating of two stars."
212,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have been putting watching this drama off for quite some time, now i know why. I needed to learn that nothing will compare to it, and i am a big fan of CLOY and Vagabond. Strong plot, excellent acting performance, scripts, camera, soundrack..
What was interesting is that it made me watched it through the eyes of Moon Gang-tae, i felt what he felt, i laughed when he laughed and cried when he cried.Seo yea-ji was absolutely stunning, her makeup, hair, attire.. i couldnt take my eyes of her. Although her characters started off as a cold and emotionless woman, her warm smile gave her soon away. I was very impressed with how well her character developed throughout the series. I was also pleased to see that her character was equally strong as the male lead. This doesnt often happen even if put in a position of power.Kim Soo-hyun, what is left to say. He is a Mr. Actor. And who have thought that it will be Gang-tae who will have to let go, eh??And of course, lets dont forget to mention Oh Jung-se as the lovable autistic Moon Sang-tae. Amazingly well portrayed.The supporting roles were just as good, all very well complimented each other.For me the best kdrama of all times, a must watch that opens eyes about lives of carers and how they often sacrifice their own lives and happiness for those they care for."
213,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Simply , This is a wonderful family Drama. I have seen a lot of dramas including Korean dramas. Usually Korean dramas are cheesy, funny, exciting and romantic. There is usually a bad person at the top of the chain and finally the good wins. But this is like no other. Every single episode was unbelievable. specially the first 4 episodes. I am going to watch this again as this drama can actually teach you many things about life. This is a wonderful drama which must be recognized and watched universally. Bravo. from a Sri Lankan Biritish fan."
214,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"What a refreshing and unique show, what a way to portray mental health issues and what a way to show the emotional side of how family deals with mental issues.I really enjoyed this show, the main leads were fantastic especially the autistic older brother.The soundtrack was great, the locations were lovely and the outfits were UNREAL.I really wish I could forget and watch this one again."
215,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This might be my favorite Korean drama I've seen. From the animation to the books to the relationships it's sincere and inspired. Really beautiful story and characters. I can't say enough good things about it. Don't miss this one! Everyone is perfect. Really well done all around.
216,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"After completing the whole series I can safely say that this is highly recommended. They way the story is told , the acting from all the cast and the meaning behind the tales is top notch."
217,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is probably the FINEST foreign TV-series I've ever watched! It taught me some great lessons that will definitely make impact in my life.
The TV-series shows that our life isn't perfect at all, nobody is 100% good or bad in character, and we might not get the ""Happy Ending"" in our lives, because this is real life, & we've to deal with things throughout it."
218,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Beautiful- sadness- loneliness- creative- dark- heartbreaking- mysterious- romance- disorders- happiness- friendship- horror- and much more. A good watch. It will not disappoint you. I loved it !
219,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The main plot of the show is how the main characters find their true self and how they overcome their past tragedies. There is a lot of emotion within it. The story is connected to the past of the characters' life and has amazing build up for the main plot. It was really exciting to watch how the romance also works out between Go Moon Young and Moon Gang tae. I recommend you to watch it as it's really good.
220,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I wanted to like this show because the premise is very unusual. A young man (Kim Soo-Hyun playing Moon Gang-Tae) is the sole caregiver to his mentally and emotionally impaired older brother (played by Jeong-se Oh as Moon Sang-Tae).
Gang-Tae also works as a caregiver in a succession of mental health care facilities. The brothers constantly move from place to place as a result of Sang-Tae 'acting out', often in the form of panicked episodes based on his fear of butterflies.A famous writer of dark, twisted fairy tales (Seo Ye-ji as Go Moon Young) is worshipped by Sang-Tae for her stories and illustrations. Inevitably, Gang-Tae crosses paths with Moon Young, not realizing he knew her when they were both very young where he was severely traumatized by her behavior. As adults, Moon Young now relentlessly pursues Gang-Tae and the storyline goes from there.I'm four episodes in and I can see why this K-drama was not very well-received when it initially ran in South Korea. The character of Moon Young is written as an extremely annoying, privileged, prima donna who has childhood secrets and traumas of her own. However, it's hard to care because she's been written as such an exasperating person with a spoiled, cruel attitude and actions to match. I'm finding her tediously painful to watch. Sadly, this leaves the role of Gang-Tae reduced to a series of blank stares, speechless moments and zero emotional range. The secondary roles of a male and female friend to the brothers are relegated to sounding boards and only used as filler to round out the story.I'll try to finish ""It's Okay to not be Okay"", but I can't commit to it. The pacing is off, and the writing (in my view) borders on being unsympathetic to the world of mental illness. That being said, I've yet to find one character or storyline interesting enough to warrant watching the show through to its conclusion."
221,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I like this tv show but i think its a little overrated
i mean acting and cinematography is great but everything else is normal
this is a honest review
this series is 7/10 not more not less
so long !"
222,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Hard to watch, lead woman, sick as hell. I cannot tolerate people that are psychopath. Well blah, blah, blah. How much can you say about sick add person."
223,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Decided I liked it after all. Oh Jung So is an awesome actor. Have seen him in other shows. This was exception, really shows his versatility.Don't understand need for review to be book length."
224,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I just finished four episodes of this show and all i can say is WOW! This one is a MUST watch even if your not into korean tv shows you still have to watch this one. It's truly moving. The acting is simply amazing and the issues are real and I feel so many people can relate to the issues because in life everyone goes through alot of downs and this show truly covers peoples dark areas inside themselves they want to hide. Its a stunning show please watch if you haven't yet!
225,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I must visit south Korea someday. Excellent cinematography and a matching Storyline.After the world of the married and now it's okay not to be okay..
226,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Watched it for Kim Soo Hyun, and then hooked by Seo Ye Ji's Moonyoung."
227,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Well this was my first K drama that i watched i must say i was very impressed. From writing to direction, everything is perfect. Acting was at par especially by the guy who played Sang tae. I want to admit this that I'm in love with Seo yea ji after watching this show. This show is unique in terms of story telling. Mental health problem which i got to know is a major issue in South Korea was explained very well. Every character played their part very well which makes the show flawless until you reach the climaxI would have given it 10 rating easily because of the acting, cinematography, direction but climax was so horrible that i had to bring down the rating to 8. It appeared to me that climax was written by Ekta Kapoor where Mihir was resurrected after 20 years with a plastic surgery. Antagonist of this show, the mother, her character was never explained properly. Till the end i was clueless about the character of the mother. Why she was portrayed as a monster, how she escaped death, what did she want at the end? So many questions, nothing explained.Alternative ending according to me - As we know that the daughter had traumatic childhood because of her parents, director could have shown that she has overcome our trauma because of Gang tae and Sang tae's love and they have started a new family. No need to resurrect the mother. The show could have ended in 15th episode."
228,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I watched all episodes of this drama. It's fully entertaining and you can definitely enjoy this drama. The emotions between two brothers is awesome . Lead actor and actress acting is superb. I am a big fan of Kim see hyun , I already watched his two drama . His acting is awesome . Chemistry between Kim see hyun and Seo yeah je is superb. Her acting is awesome . The comedy of Sang tae is another level. Supporting cast also good. Ending is superb . You can definitely enjoy.COMEDY , EMOTIONS , LOVE , ROMANTIC."
229,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Look if you are looking for a Kdrama that is gonna be so engaging and compelling that your tempted to keep watching from beginning to end straight without breaks this isn't it. The storyline is there but there are also a lot of scenes that are just time filler.Basically most of the characters in the drama have a troubled past and come together in this hospital. Seo Ye-ji has a slightly annoying yet bearable because of her stunning appearance character. Soo-Hyun's character is the best part because he is pretty normal and balanced and Oh Jung-Se acts superbly well for his role but the character he plays can be a little frustrating. You need to be patient with this Drama because some parts can be outright boring.As far as the screenplay and the visuals its awesome. The dialogues are pretty good, nothing crazy but some memorable messages. There is hardly any action and very little comedic relief.This drama is definitely darker, creepy, and on a more serious note than your typically kdrama. If your into that type of stuff you'll like this. If you like a fast pace, lovey-dovey, hilarious drama you are not gonna like this one that much. There is a love story but its very calculated and mature.The drama is good really only in the beginning 5 episodes and the last 4 episodes. It really picks up at the end.I might sound a little critical but I don't really see why everybody is acting like this is the greatest drama ever. yes it has a good message on overcoming the past and facing obstacles and so on but from an entertainment perspective I wish it was a little better."
230,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"''it is okay not to be okay '' is an intresting kdrama with weird and unexpected plot .The chemistry with the leiding couple was soo harmonic and their acting skills was super ! Especially Moon Sang-tae , i really respect him .The ost was okay but there are a lot of songs that they could not stay in your mind for a while..but that' s okayOn the other side there are some DISADVANTAGES that i cannot forget ...
To start with there are some irritating second characters that i would like not to exist , they also try to be funny but they aren't
and finally there are a lot plot holes after 14 ep.''it is okay not to be okay'' has many oppurtunities to be one of my favorites kdramas but the unsatisfied end and the plot holes take it back."
231,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Binged 22hrs of TV perfection in 4 days!
The message is so important and if you strip away some of the KDrama eccentricities, we can all relate to the pain these characters went through, the effects on their mental health and (spoiler alert) how they found healing. I really related to the one of the male leads in how he sacrificed his happiness to look after his brother - all apart from his ridiculous good looks.I strongly recommend watching it and if you've never watched a Kdrama before here's my breakdown of what to expect:
Episodes 1-3: what is going on? But... I'm falling in love with the female lead (Seo Ye-Ji)
Episode 4: First cry. OK I'm invested now and I'm in love with the female lead.
Episodes 5-13: You'll laugh, cry and repeat. Also who needs sleep! Same feelings about the female lead
Episode 14: I don't want this to end
Episode 16: WOW!Special mention to the actor Jeong-se Oh who plays the autistic character Sang Tae. - what a performance! Incredible acting.In these dark 'rona times, we need a show like this. Stick with it - you wont be disappointed. Did I mention I was in love with the female lead?"
232,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This k-drama feels different and I love different! I'm astounded with the animation, cinematography, writing, and acting. I smell Baeksang Arts Awards."
233,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"IOTNBO healed me in a lot of ways. I'm gonna be so disappointed if it doesn't bag Grand Prize and Best Drama on the next Baeksang Arts Awards. Beautifully written, well-directed, and well-acted. Not to mention the superb animation which felt like watching straight out of a Tim Burton animated film. A daily reminder for everyone that ""It's okay not to be okay""."
234,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"1. There is no chemistry between the leading couple. It is hard to believe they are in love.2. The plot is neither interesting nor original.3. In many episodes nothing happens.4. The episodes are too long.5. There are A LOT of plot holes.And the list goes on...
There is no reason for this series to be in the imdb top 100. It is just not good."
235,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I think that the actings are soo amazing.
It was really emotional in some parts and I really like it overall
Highly recommended"
236,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"At first the story seems a bit slow but there is no lack of energetic feeling in the story. As the story progresses, it will become more intense. The director knows very well how to attract the attention of the audience with a Ingenuous story. I enjoyed the whole time. All in all, the time was good. Everyone must see."
237,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The best actors with the best acting.!
And it contains a lot of informative content.!"
238,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The best actors with the best acting.!
Contains lots of informative content.!"
239,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I shed tears unabashly during the last episode. This K-drama certainly outshine everyone. To be fair, each K-drama has it's own merit, be it Rom-com, thriller action etc. But this one dares to be different. From the acting, which is superb, every character is so well portrayed by the actor you are instantly drawn into their lives, you share with them their pain, joy... their ups and downs. praise to the Director, the script writer and everyone involved in making this awesome story. K-drama has come of age. Spinning a story of mental health, coupling with love, fears, weakness of human nature is no means feat.
If you watched K-dramas before, you will enjoy this one. I have no reservation recommending you watch this one. If you never watch another K movie this is the one not to miss. Enjoy. You can thank me later."
240,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Came for romance. Stayed for an amazing acting perfomance by Oh Jung Se, in his portrayal of Moon Sang-tae."
241,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A couple of really good kissing scenes that aren't as conservative as most k-dramas.
Storyline is unique and there are a lot of powerful hidden messages.
The only let down for me was that the 'twist' and 'culprit' reveal was short lived, it felt like the build up was highly anticipated but then it was all over in minutes.
The main actor Kim Soo-Hyun was very good in this series, i didn't like him in ""My Love from the Star"" (as he seemed insignificant and overshadowed by the lead actress) but in this drama his acting was very memorable. The supporting actors were also very well portrayed especially the brother with autism, excellent acting from Oh Jung-se.
Overall, a must-watch drama filled with a captivating storyline, powerful life messages, and sweet romance with great kissing."
242,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Great story & awesome acting. The Koreans are on fire!! The story is about 2 brothers and a woman who are on a journey of self discovery. Special mention to Oh-Jung Se for his unbelievable acting as a person suffering from autism.
243,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The big takeaway here is that every writer and director ever, not only in the kDrama arena, needs to watch and learn from this show. The arc is perfection. The acting is brilliant (and if there is a scene or two that gives you any pause, there is a reason for it and you don't have to wait five episodes for it to play out). Even for the supporting actors the roles are wonderfully well portrayed. The costuming and sets are fantastic. And I adored the score. I think it not only made the film but also was the best soundtrack I've experienced in a kDrama.The direction and writing are superb. Pulling together a suspense slash love story in a setting that puts mental health at the forefront makes for an extremely slippery slope, and adding in a fairytale metaphor could so easily have been the recipe for disaster... but on the contrary the storyline was executed absolutely beautifully. Every single ""typical"" move was thrown out the window and even the small details were attended to.The way the storytelling blurred the lines between ""acceptable"" neurodiversity, stigma and those of us who deal with the fallout of childhood trauma in our everyday lives without being too heavy or overdramatized was SUCH an incredible breath of fresh air. This is the way a show should be put together."
244,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Believe me..... Just watch it... I don't want to spoile anything regarding this kdrama.It's so awsome so awsome that no other Serie or kdrama can replace it's story... And I also loved the whole cast of this series specially the lead heroine ❤ .It's one in a life time experience... Story Of a creepy world of different people turning into a real Measmarising fairy tail.
245,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Korean drama bombshell truly amazing heartwarming story, lovley and goofy characters, cast is extremley good some episodes are slow but its worth it!
LOVED THE SHOW, ITS A MUST WATCH !!"
246,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"How the show portrays mental health was wonderful and makes it memorable. It does a good job of showing the real struggles families and individuals have to go through while not overbearing you.The actual romance I felt was a bit too long and predictable. I was starting to lose interest mid-way, but something comes up in the last third that hooked me and the actors nailed it to the end."
247,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is one of those series that leaves a mark on your heart. A moral for each story, a beautiful depiction of what is means to be dependable. The hidden truth behind the weight of mental illnesses. The songs, the stories, the laughs and the sadness. I wouldn't miss it. And I will any day watch it all over again."
248,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"To begin with, here the character development has been very impressive, a good storyline and a different one as the stories of fairy tales in blended into the life and stories of the characters. Along with that, it also highlights the issue of mental health and how one can cope up with it which can be seen in the title "" Its Okay to Not be Okay "". It also has some comedy and hilarious scenes which adds to brilliance of the show along with romance. The acting was also amazing. I have no cons to suggest for this show except long episodes as seen in many Korean dramas. I am a beginner in watching k-dramas as its my second only after ""Crash Landing On You"". I hope that its interesting although a short review."
249,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This is the Korean Drama I will recommend to my family and friends who have never watched Korean drama. It will captivate you right from the beginning!Full of heart and humor and morals of the story foundation for a healthy psyche!
250,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"After the first two episodes I was surprised of the dark humour, it looked a bit like a Tim Burton Tale. It's not a too big spoiler to say that this develops to a very deep love story. There are other K-Dramas with a more surprising screenplay. But not so many with just a good and likeable cast, a great cinematography and deep interest to its characters."
251,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Although I could see the director trying to implant romance between main characters, the more I watched the more depressed I felt.Both of the main characters bear too much and left nothing to give. As a outside audience, I feel like I'm watching two drowning ppl, out of nature they're attached to each other but pulling to sink together. What kind of distorted and suffocative relationship is that. Yes the story is attractive but the same time made me feel really uncomfortable, I hope the main characters wont get together in the end(still at ep.7."
252,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This series was so well done. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Actors were incredible, well written story. I loved the female leads outfits so beautiful. Had some surprises. Did not disappoint."
253,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Strong story and unfamiliar
I was enjoyed every minute of this drama
Top 2020 drama
Thanks for the writer and actors and producing and everyone in teamwork for this unique drama"
254,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This tv show does not generalize, sensationalize or glorify mental health issues. They show that every person despite their appearance may have something they're working through. The main characters have insane chemistry (brother to brother, friend to friend, lover to lover) which makes the story even more believable and the scenes more enjoyable. I have never seen a tv show like this before and I absolutely love it!"
255,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,How great to have the characters evolve and keep going for the silverlining through all kinds of break ups and make ups. Love the soundtrack and score. Love the great sense of humour. Love the refreshing take on the so-called human nature. Much much appreciated I will revisit this universe for sure.
256,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show really hits differently. The story is very special and well delivered. Topics of mental health, trust, friendship and love are brought upon. I really love that we see the perspective of the world from an autistic person. This drama has heavy and heartaching scenes, but also comic, and is pleasant to watch. Solid plot, strong dialogue, exceptional cinematography and visuals, professional acting and great chemistry, and beautiful soundtrack.
Highly recommended show!"
257,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The intro is good, but I didn't find the first episode interesting as a whole. The camera shots were awesome as well as the transitions. What I like about the series is the way the female lead expresses her thoughts implicitly. The children stories laid out for each episode also contributed in making this series better. This drama also let you see the two sides of a story as well as the characters. All characters are flawed and made beautifully. A suggestion for improvement is to lessen the dull moments and fill each episode with more happenings. It was ended well though, I really like it. The female lead is also funny especially in episode 9."
258,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really loved this k-drama. Normally I don't binge dramas, but I watched this one in one week (which is fast for me). I will say I am a TOTAL chicken and a few scenes freaked me out or made me feel a little scared, but if you are a chicken you should be okay. I think I was more startled bc I wasn't expecting that from this show based on reviews and recommendations. The character development builds really well and the show keeps a good pace the entire time. This is not one that will disappoint you in the end or leave you confused. There were only a few MINOR plot holes, but overall pretty good. This is also a little bit of a heavier drama, but there are some comedic moments. It's worth it for the romance, they have a strong screen chemistry."
259,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I loved everything in this series, the cast, the story, the direction, the ending, the main character's chemistry
It's my new favorite KDrama!
I give it 200/10"
260,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Acting of all cast is best & Story is mind-blowing & Peaceful. Especially acting of 3 main characters toch my heart respectively
1. Ko Munyong
2. Sang tee
3. Gang tee."
261,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Recommended and must watch movie series. I could rate this above 10 if ever there is.
262,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Brilliantly done with subtle and not so subtle messages threaded throughout the episodes. I can't say too much without spoiling it, but it starts out the first few episodes with some scenes that may be interpreted as quirkinesses or silly, but stay with it and you will discover such deep and profound meaning in this movie. The acting was superb and the dialogue soul piercing and moving. I have been a fan of K-dramas for 10 years and I have watched at least 70 or 80 of them and this is one of the best. I'm so glad that Netflix has started investing in original K-Dramas. I have also worked in the mental health field so I have an extra appreciation for the context of this film series. This has drama, thriller, crime, mystery, romance, all rolled into one, with a spectacular scenery to boot."
263,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Most of the kdramas that link to past are well connected. But in this story it was something else. Acting was too good.In first few episodes the cinematography was different and fun but later on somehow it turned into conventional
264,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Acting great
Actors great
Story great
And just visually stunning."
265,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really love Korean dramas. But this has to be one of the best! The main characters are just great. You almost fall in love with them. The story is very well written, and it conveys a clear message! You have to watch this 1000% for sure."
266,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Another interesting story about this girl, boy and his brother. Liked the story's in the drama and the moral of everyone one of them. They were wonderful and sad but at the same time very wonderful. I liked that type of drawing in the story even if it's for kids. How they were build and looked like.The girl in this drama, a famous writer who has two famous parents who's exist in a way but at the same time don't in another way. Her attitude was entertaining and interesting. I loved the way she took care of bad things, how she talked and was cold as ice even if that's not a very good thing to be. She didn't care about what other people thought about her or if they thought she did was wrong. She just didn't let anything stand in her way and did the things she decided to do.The boy in this drama don't have any parents, I don't remember about his and his brothers father but their mom got murdered. His brother was the only one who saw it but didn't remember their face. His sadness and loneliness hurt me, all he did was taking care of his brother without any parents. I felt bad for him most of the time but I just wanted to punch him sometimes too. When he looked back to when he was young it hurt me the most to see how he felt left out.Liked the actors and loved the bloopers at the end of the show! So cute to see how it looks like behind the scenes. Liked the layout of the story, that she had a moral in every book she wrote. Even if it was a tough way for them with problems and revealing truths it's a beautiful ending at the end and I'm very happy for them!💜🖤"
267,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"IOTNBO indeed contains a different storyline than most of the dramas. I really enjoyed watching it. Pairing is cute!! The drama was mixture of Reality, mental health issues, touch of comedy moments etc! But one thing is that, it's imbd is overrated. Lot's of dramas out there with amazing storyline, famous too but their ratings is between 8-8.9. I feel this drama is overrated if you think about it properly. Otherwise I liked it!!!!👍"
268,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really loved this show, the acting is great and the storyline is really unique. It's dark but the funny and sweet parts balance it out. I won't give spoilers but I think it ended well. I highly recommend it!!"
269,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Ko Moon Young is one of the powerful female lead i've ever seen! Although, she is psycho, but that's okay , she showed us the well character development through each episodes which have a children's book fairytales. Beside Ko Moon Young, i really appreciate that each episodes always have taught me something good in life. Well, Moon Gang Tae's character is well paired with Ko Moon Young, their chemistry is really really good! Meanwhile, Moon Sang Tae is the character that i cared the most. Well, this is a good drama. But, sorry, i can not give 10/10 because of the ending, i do think the whole story ends at episode 15. When i watch episode 16, I don't have the things to be curious on because all of the things have been cleared on episode 15."
270,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the first time i liked non-lead role very very much. I liked his acting very much (Jae-su). I am giving 10 out of 10 stars for him. Fabulous, Extra-ordinary."
271,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I like the actors and the story is very nice!
But.. each episode lasts almost an hour (could fit better into 30 minuts) and very few happens..
I survived 5 episodes with a lot of facebook breaks..
This is something that happens in a lot KD's lately..
Try to keep me watch without leaving."
272,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"GREAT STORY, STUNNING PHOTOGRAPHY, GREAT DEVELOPMENT, TOP TIER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES, FEEL-GOOD ENDING. This drama has everything go watch it if you haven't"
273,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"First of all what a cast we've got here specially Seo Ye-ji (Ko Moonyoung) and Oh Jung-se (Moon Sangtae) they were just stunning make me cried at some times and even relate with my darkest and saddest self and thoughts.
This is not a happy fairytale, its the most enjoyable darkest fairytale with some ups and lots of downs but at the end you felt happy, satisfied and just different.
I loved It and I loved Ko Moonyoung book stories."
274,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Great drama, from the first episode to the last one. The actors are amazing, almost all of them. The psychological developments of the main characters are really well done, showing us the pain and heal they go through step by step. Sang-Tae is definitely the most lovely character ever."
275,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"EDITED REVIEW-
I wrote my earlier review after watching the second episode, and am editing now after watching the last episode.
I am in tears and the joy I am feeling right now is heart warming. This drama was so beautiful and fabulous... I have no words.
The story line is so good, you will be in tears and you will think again about K dramas, its that beautiful. Every character development is smooth, and its not complete 360 change which usually is shown. Its just becoming better. The costumes, music, scenes, dialogues, actors, editing, production... everything is so perfect I-... Its just awesome.
This show didn't disappoint me even for single second. The last episode is so beautifully, you will be crying that it ended and be happy about the ending the characters got.
And Boy did the actors act?! Kim Soo Hyun is famous I get it, but Oh Jung Se?!! Major shout out to him and Yoo Sae Ji!! these two acted so good that I got moved for real. I have seen Oh Jung Se acting as support actor in so many dramas, but this? This is how a good actor makes a supporting character into a Lead character. Its brilliant. New respect for both Oh Jung Se and Yoo Sae Ji.
This show is a must for everyone who thinks they are 'Not Okay'. This show will show you that being 'Not Okay' is 'okay'. You can have flaws too, and you will see that everyone has them too. You will see that being not okay is what makes you human.OLD REVIEW-
I have watched many k dramas, and this is very different.
Maybe because it's a Netflix original, but it has the touch of more than just k-drama. Whole production idea is different, including the story book display. Great concept. It's not the flowery, lovey dovey k drama fairy tale. It's a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes k drama's concept of childhood friends meeting again and dark deep dialogues. To say it's playlist is good, would be an understatement. Just two episodes and I am already in love with it."
276,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,A lovely story about stories. It gives you a different perspective on how you may have interpreted some stories all the while making you feel the characters and their desire to be loved and to change their routine on life that might have become boring and overwhelming.
277,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's different from the kdramas you will see. It's artistic, it's magical. It's so beautifully portrayed. Every scene is so emotional. I think it's one of the best I've ever seen."
278,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I dislike drama slash romantic shows. But for this series I will make an exception.
The storyline, the acting, perfect casting, the location, even the in story fairy tale books/stories were brilliant!!! Just brilliant. I am just blown away. And for someone who loves korean horror/zombie shows (i.e. kingdom, train to busan, etc) - that is a big thing. I am absolutely amazed by the three main leads. The supporting cast are also top notch. Its the most well cast production Ive seen so far.
This is a k-drama that I can definitely recommend. It is a brave show that tackles mental illnesses and I am so very proud how this has been done thru this show. Good on you for doing this. We need more of these shows!
I wonder if those fairy tale books are actually real books? If not, then they should be. Loved the storylines there too! and the artworks!! Love it.
And last but not the least - the female lead's outfits! OMG - just for her outfits I would watch the whole show! I dont know who she is but she carries them so well, i love her acting and i love her voice!!!! Hope to see more of you in the very near future!"
279,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't get the hype really. I watched 4 episodes so far. For me I wouldn't mind if the leads were just annoying. but glorifying these annoying behaviours, I can't accept it. FL with Antisocial personality syndrome, a dark past, Different from the usual fairy tale nature of the romantic dramas. This would have made a great plot. but they focussed on the dark side of it. For eg, The assembly man's son ran away with the FL and caused a big scene at the election campaign. They showed that as FL done a good thing. I get that his father is not a good person. but what she did was not the right thing. Also Violent portrayal of scenes in a children's storybook. FL leads says it has deeper meaning to it than what is shown on the outside. But how children are supposed to understand that. But that would have been okay because the character can't really understand peoples or emotions. But the writers chose to glorify that. It is okay to not be okay. But it is not okay glorify the factors that makes them not okay.
I am gonna watch the show anyway. will update this then."
280,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"What a captivating story filled with excellent acting and cinematography that made me, a 23 year old man, cry wholeheartedly many times both out of sadness and happiness.
I genuinely cannot nitpick even a single thing that could've been done better, I loved it all and was glued to the screen for the past few days."
281,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Shed a lot of tears on this one. I really enjoyed the story. Even though it takes longer time for me to finish it. I'm glad that I didn't give up. I'm gonna miss all of them, specially, Sang-Tae oppa. <3 I love the tandem of Gang-Tae & Mun-yeong."
282,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's Okay Not To Be Okay is something that I would recommend. Not a heavy drama but it will surely touch your heart. I personally fell in love with each of the characters because they all have that 'factor', all of them contributing to the very beauty of the film, to feel love and to feel loved."
283,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Some of the characters are truly fascinating like the cranky psychiatrist. But the romantic plot was a hoax in itself.
284,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story, soundtrack, location, character back stories and character development are all great! my heart will always remember this kdrama because of how it made me feel. the final episode was amazing, that's one of the kdrama ending that i really liked because I've seen the characters happy, unlike other kdrama ending where i wanted to see more.. with ""its okay not to be okay"" it was very satisfying, there's closure, it made me cry and smile at the same time. i will never forget that last scene of Munyeong, Gangtae and Sangtae."
285,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's not the romance that's most captivating about this story, but the way they all struggle with their own demons(hardships), and understand each other, because they know what pain feels like. It's just so real and so raw, that you see the pain they go through, and you feel every emotion, strongly.It really exposes us to how people can look so perfect, so successful, but be hurting on the inside, and it takes strong people, that are forced to grow up quickly, that know how to survive, but lack the one thing that makes them difficult to be understood from the rest: normalcy. You see these characters develop a loving-something they've long to feel-relationship with one another. How they come together and lift each other up, not realizing how much their strengths and weaknesses help one another, is just, unforgettable. What a lovely, impactful, love story-with all 3 members."
286,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is a beautifully-crafted masterpiece about human healing which deserves awards and recognition. I love this Korean drama because of its well-written scripts, great character development and brilliant story telling which uses artsy and animations.The three main charactersKo Mun Yeoung - a famous children book author, who are both a Cinderella and an evil witch in the story. She is suffering from anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) due to her troubled childhood. Outwardly, she exudes a strong commanding presence and deadly charm which hides a fragile lady longing for love and acceptance.The actress is really good in portraying symptoms of sociopath. She does not know how to empathize people's feeling due to her traumatic upbringing. She treats them as objects, until she finds a ""home"" ( family ) with Moon Gang-tae and Moon Sang-tae. (which she never experiences from her dysfunctional parents). She begins to change, understand and care for others which helps her recovery. Her written children books have inspiring stories too.It is difficult to treat people who have anti-social personality disorder because they are very reluctant with conventional therapy. They have a problem but don't understand it. In the series, it was perfectly executed. Alternative way to help people like her.Moon Gang Tae - a psychiatric worker who looked after his brother all his life. This guy suppresses his own emotions for his older brother (who has autism) and for other people. His body is marred with scars he received from his patients. Quite admirable guy for being selfless. Though he loves his brother and willing to do anything for him; he feels traps inside. Unable to realize it, he also needs someone to save him.Everything change after meeting Ko Mun Yeoung, who could see through his mask, told him of being a hypocrite and to face his fears heads-on. This was the first road of Gang-tae's journey towards self-discovery/self-awareness and healing. It's kinda liberating when he found his true self. His own voice, emotions and goals in life. He was happy. Eventually love found him too. Gang-tae story tells us, it is not only the people who have mental disorder who always need help but also the people around them, the caregivers.Moon Sang-Tae- an older brother with autism. In first half of the story, we saw his struggles, running from place to another and hiding behind the closets was his manner of coping his trauma. The actor was good in portraying a high functioning person with autism.Sang tae is a morally pure soul and love-able character. He is the voice of reason for Ko Mun Yeong and Gang Tae, his younger brother. Most of the powerful scenes in the story was between him and Ko Mun Yeong because it was profoundly moving. She helped him achieved his dream as children book illustrator. Gang-tae learned his value and place in the society, found his independence and set his brother free.Truly an outstanding TV series. 10/10."
287,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I almost skipped on watching this title because originally I thought it was made by Netflix, I am really glad I watched it. It's an amazing KDrama and one of a kind acting from all the actors. A roller coaster of feelings. It has its cheesy moments but still a 10 in my book, it kept things entertaining from start to the end.Fortunately Netflix was not involved in the making of this show, because lately they ruin everything they touch. Luckily they just stream it on their platform so its not a cheap PC production like the usual Netflix stuff."
288,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I am a male American, used to American movies, dialect, and character plots, but never in my life have I seen an actress with a steaming sexuality as Ye-ji Seo's character. I would see her as Eve in the garden.My wife and I thoroughly enjoy Kdramas, but with this one I should keep my comments to myself.I really appreciate Kdramas that are not about silly youthfulness, and trading characters, or yet traveling into time. That is an over used plot line that cannot go further, but this drama, being a suspenseful, somewhat erotic in a safe nature, and well acted, fits my love for the Korean film industry.The actors of both the protagonist and his autistic brother has a feel of real brotherhood and compassion. A word that does not any longer fit our lexicon. Refreshing to see.Watch it!"
289,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is must watch Korean drama for all people around the world because storyline and deep message of every episode is masterpiece.Acting of main three characters (moon gang-te, sang-te and koo mun Yong) over the top.So overall this drama have all things to watch 16 episodes back to back.😍😍😍"
290,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really love this drama so muchhh. The characters were good, the storyline was unique, and the fairytales part were so perfect. I enjoyed watching this and even titled this drama as the best drama this year, but......the ending?hmmm I don't think so. The ending really changed my opinion of this drama. Anticlimax. Bland ending. Or maybe I had high expectation from the ending. Many things in the ending didn't make sense from me. I'm just dissapointed with the ending but overall this drama really fun to watch, many moral values that we could learn. I have to agree with Kim Soo Hyun, 'this is a healing drama'"
291,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama has everything I could ask for consisting of romance, drama, and mystery. Two people meet by fate and find emotional comfort within each other, healing themselves of their scars. Seo Yea-Ji perfectly portrays KMY with the combination of her fierce look and deep voice, charming many viewers. Kim Soo-Hyun is also an amazing fit for this role. One quick glance at his eyes, and you'll be drawn into the painful world of MKT. Both had hardships and grudges they've been keeping in, it's just a matter of when they'll fully express it. Each episode has a message behind it and it never fails to keep me wanting more."
292,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A complete new scope drama. Highlights the emotions which we feel on daily basis when we deal with people in our surroundings, let they be stranger or someone you know.I really felt a refreshing feeling of viewing my life from a different perspective.I must say that most of the K Dramas make you attach to it like you are the main character in it. Which helps us to introspect ourselves .(It's my personal opinion so please spare me.)Coming to the Drama, I personally love the acting of Seo Ye-Ji. A complete badass female lead which i ever saw in K drama. It's not wrong to say that I want some of her traits in my future partner. BUT after finishing Episode 16 I completely changed my perspective. The DESTINY is a real deal and the people we meet are get attracted to us because we do share something in common.A must watch show, followed by super duper cast. Kim Soo hyun, Seo ye-Ji and oh Jeong-Se a complete full drama package.Please lift up your hearts and go for this. You will NOT regret this."
293,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"As an expert in this field, I see all sides of humanity. I've learned that everyone has a story... For the most part, this series was accurate. If you want to see the many sides of mental illness and how we become who we are, and the courage it takes to heal, please do yourself a favor and experience this. I cannot recommend this enough. Stellar performances from the leading and supporting characters. Adorable moments and heartbreaking at the same time. Do not miss this."
294,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This is bestes show of my life i never see this type of show but when i start watching this show i love it very very much i loved this show best show for all really i like it sooooo muchhh...
295,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Beautiful Drama must Watch
Actors Did their acting Perfectly
One of the Best couple On Screen."
296,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The actor who plays the brother with autism is such a wonderful actor. I hope people realize how good he is.
297,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Could had be done in 10 episodes but still amazing!A roller coaster of emotions and a stunning production.Jung-se Oh acting is so good! One of the best performance I recently saw!Give it a try :)
298,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"After watching this, i have a hard time finding anything that can live up to the exitement, and quality of this k-drama. I am no film-expert but i have never seen anything with that level of personal development."
299,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A fantastic made kdrama. The interesting storyline, cast, and awesome cinematography. Watching this show, people get a chance to learn about their true self..!!"
300,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama is a must watch! I am not a kdrama lover so its surprising that I can really enjoy this drama. The storyline is a combination between romcom and disney x tim burton, so it is pretty refreshing to see how each episode has a moral story about mental health that is connected with a fairy tale. Not only that, I give my ultimate applause to the main trio! Their acting is superb. Oh Jung Se really nail his performance as a man with autism. Kim Soo Hyun gives a dashing performance as selfless man who really loves his autistic brother (his visual is beyond words). And Soe Yea Ji can portrays her character really well, I got annoyed and jealous with her at the same time. I get hooked by the end of third episode and literally cant stop watching till the latest episode, and get to wait every weekend to watch it in Netflix. I wish this drama gets the attention it deserves."
301,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"As a psychologist and critic, I say do not miss this wonderful series in any way. Everything in this series from screenwriting, directing, acting, editing, costume design and so on It is amazing. All the actors played amazingly well, both with their eyes and with their limbs. Everyone's characterization was so great, including all the sub-roles, That you understood all their morals and behavior. The look and character of each one was full of words that you fully understood. This series was so great in the field of psychology. As a psychologist, I was amazed that they were able to master the details of the human soulShow that I really have to admit I have never seen it so accurate anywhere. You have to watch this series many times and very deeplyTo understand how much the series has small points and thoughtful dialogues. Add to that the soundtrack and soothing songs of the series. It is a masterpiece. About directing and editing and designing costumes that. Which is indescribable at all, you will realize that it is absolutely amazing with one episode. In my opinion, the score of the series should be even higher. Imdb , Raise the score of the series."
302,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"One of the BESTEST K.dramas I've ever watched! I know its a little late but better late than never.The story line is just perfect and the acting is superior. My most favorite thing about this drama is, its covering the subject of Mental Illness. The accuracy in showing each of the disorders, then treating them the way they should be, just loved it! Especially the title, its amazing! The seriousness, the mystery, the humor, the spookiness in some scenes or I must say the essence of gothic scenes, everything was wonderful. I must say I really liked the style of Seo Yea-ji as Ko Moon-Young!Overall its just perfect, I would surely recommend this to every drama fan. Go for it! Its really worth it!"
303,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I absolutely loved this series. The actress is excruciatingly beautiful and the actor handsome. Sang-tae should have an award for his role as an autistic young man.But I also have an ulterior reason. I am a Caucasian who was married to an incredible Korean lady who immigrated to the US. We were married for many years until she passed away in 2017. We had an incredible multicultural marriage. Recently I discovered Korean movies on Netflix. I have to read the subtitles, but just hearing the Korean being spoken is so warming to my heart. Plus, the words that I do know bring such fond memories and joy into my life. I am old and do not/could not have another relationship. No one could compare to what we had together and I will soon travel on to be with her in the new heavens and earth. Until then I have our fond memories. I was so incredibly blessed to be married to the special person my wife was for so many years.So, I am such a sucker for Korean Rom-coms or K-dramas until then. I simply can't say how much I enjoyed the suspense, scenery, and actors/actresses in this series. Thanks for the joy all of you brought to me during our evenings together."
304,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the first k-drama I've seen and it's honestly the best discovery ever.It's a story about healing, above all: many scenes made me cry (I was so moved), but it really brought me joy. It heals your soul, I swear.I loved every character, they are very well portrayed and their relationships are truly wholesome.Also, amazing love story and great chemistry (I fell in love with both the protagonists)."
305,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show itself is an apology letter to people who are mentally different from the society we have created thinking they don't understand us but it is exactly the opposite.
This show gives its audience what we expect from a classic yet different drama. The transaction from one scene to another is so smooth that you don't realise the effect as anything dramatic. The emotions of loneliness Sadness Happiness Jealousy Love are so amazingly portrayed that you feel like this is no big deal but will let you understand human nature.
Also how many times have you felt the need to ignore and not be bothered about those mental patients that we have separated from our regular society.
Think."
306,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I specifically just made an account to leave this review. Simply amazing.
The subjects covered in this series, the acting and the cinematography was perfect. Oh Jung Se played his role spectacularly, I was in tears again and again watching his amazing portrayal of an autistic older brother. If you're in two minds whether or not to watch this believe me, you should watch it.
Brilliant."
307,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It contains lots of msgs.. For daily life..
& It's completely different from the typical k-drama /C-dram Or any other series... 💚
Highly recommend...
I can assure ....you won't regret"
308,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I watched this drama more than 20 times (looks really toxic indeed), but I like it more, never get bored. After watching it over and over again, I realized that even the small details in this drama have a very deep meaning. This drama changed my perspective, the way I saw the world.I also have a brother with autism and as a child I often felt that my parents treated me unfairly, I was considered like the wind in the family. But through this drama, I recovered, my pain slowly disappeared.For people who think this drama is boring. I don't think they know what ""empathy"" means. understanding this drama requires a very high level of empathy, and a very deep analysis.This drama has many profound meanings. It is true as the saying goes, only those who suffer will understand what suffering is. Thank you for bringing this beautiful drama into my life. I love this so much. I will never forget it."
309,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is my very first K-Drama that I have watched after Full House (that aired at least a decade ago). So, I was able to watch this with a fresh mind, with no expectations. I didn't know who the leads were, having not watched any K-Drama/ movie before therefore, I guess I can write an unbiased review as I am impartial to any of ""fandoms"".
I initially watched this because there was nothing else to watch in Netflix. This kept on getting suggested to me and I gave in. What I didn't know was that it would turn out to be one of the BEST dramas I've ever watched!Where to begin?
The cast: The whole cast (not just the leads) are quite talented. I believe that each and every cast member helped to breath life to their characters. It was as if I was looking into lives of real people with real emotions who have had their own live problems and are trying to overcome them by leaning on each other.The lead characters were exceptional. Especially the actor who played the character of the brother with autism. I have a cousin sister with autism and I was amazed at how accurate his portrayal was. For many episodes I actually believed it was a real person with autism not just an actor doing a great job!
Moving on to the main couple, Ko Moon Young, the female lead with anti personal disorder (I believe she was misdiagnosed), is one of a kind character. At first she is rude, obnoxious, and borderline obsessive. It is quite easy to dislike such a character. But, the actress pulled this difficult task with elegance, style and grace that you can't help but fall in love with her even before the male lead would. She has the best character arc in the show going on to become the most lovable and warm character at the end.
I found the male lead to be quite normal when compared to the other two, however, he is not always likeable. He has his faults, he is not a knight in shining armor, he too makes mistakes and sometimes does not even correct them just like a typical human being would do. It was a realistic portrayal of a man being pressured to take care of his brother with autism all his life, sacrificing all his needs. We see the story from his perspective.The Story/ Writing: I should say the writer and the team has paid attention to every small detail of the story. The way things connect just marveled me. The dialogues are not cheesy or unrealistic. It's quite thoughtful and meaningful and though provoking. There are many relatable quotes that you can take away from this show.
Also, there are few books that were written by the scriptwriter her self! These books, if you get your hands on them, are great as well. Each book contains a children's story that is acting as a cry for help from Ko Moong Young. You will see each story's significance when you watch this drama.Directing: I believe the director and the production team has paid attention to every small angle, lighting, view and even every breath by actors! It is quite exceptional how magical some scenes were!Soundtrack: It is hauntingly beautiful and funny when it needs to be. I loved every OSTOverall Verdict: Highly recommended."
310,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Acting was fabulous, particularly the brother with autism. He deserves an Oscar."
311,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It was aesthetically pleasing and well acted. But Oh my god OVER-DRAMATISATION of literally EVERYTHING. Couldn't related to anything or anyone, nothing was believable (except the portrayal of autism). Couldn't even finish"
312,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's probably one of the best shows I've ever seen because in a way, it has a bit of many genres including drama, romance, comedy, and even mystery. Kim Soo hyun is truly mesmerizing. You can expect the best story with the most exceptional actors, please spend your precious time watching this series and you won't be disappointed."
313,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I didn't like the first episode but after that I was captivated for this show. Superb acting by Oh Jeong and Kim Soo. I hope both won awards for leading and supporting role. Very well done!
314,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama is a total perfection. From the cast, soundtract, screenplay .... everything."
315,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This drama gave us a lot of life lessons. Hats off to the amazing actors and crew for this masterpiece. Best KDrama to date.
316,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Its okay not to be okay will be remembered for how it was beautifully and masterfully done from the plot , the cast, ang their acting."
317,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This was beautiful. Every aspect of the show was beyond amazing. Story, acting, dialogues, cinematography, everything was exceptional. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it."
318,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Here's a warning for you! Don't start watching the show before August 9, because you'll be forlorn once Episode 10 finishes, which will make you wait week after week for two new episodes every Saturday and Sunday, and that my dearest, is a wait you don't want to undertake. It's a rollercoaster of a story with sparking chemistry between the lead characters, typical can't live with or without cat-mouse chase. I am tired of childhood friends meet again storylines in K-dramas, but here, they know it at the outset, who they are, no surprises there. It's the sheer fact that they know exactly who they are, that they want to avoid each other, yet can't stay apart. Immensely creative storyline, set against the backdrop of mental illness, a much neglected topic. Regular people walking and talking around a psychiatric hospital, goes to show, mental illness of various kinds, which may not always be visible on the surface. Splendid performance from all actors attached to the storylines of the main characters. It's quickly becoming my all-time favourite K-drama - why? Because it knocks at all the corners of your brain and heart with well thought-out dialogues and screenplay. Must watch!!"
319,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I will keep it simple and short.The story tells about the girl who needs help in her life so that she can push through her life.She was devasted inside because of her mother being dead and her father who disliked her very much,who even tried to strangle her two times.When she gets to see gang tae she really wanted him to be partner but the obstacles that comes at both their life must need to be faced. Gang tae has to take of his brother meanwhile mrs.ko has to lift her company up once again and wants gang tae by her side. She is evil outside but angel inside."
320,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,OMG!!!Just completed the series and already fall in love with mun yeong.A beautiful face attact you alot but to fall in love its the vibes that should match with yours.They way she potrayed her emotions.. I have never seen it before.Lots of love to all the stars.. Its a family watch.
321,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Settled acting by the lead pair and main characters
Screenplay, cinematography, taking, production values everything was too good..."
322,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"During the pandemic disease of Covid 19, we need some kind of the ways out for our emotions and feeling. This series is the one that we need for our ways out of fears, worries, anxiety and stressing. I would recommend you to watch. The actors and actresses are so talented and the main actress is really cute and scary. And I loved it souch. Thanks Netflix for such a romance and comedy."
323,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Omg!!! What a masterpiece, just beautiful. Fun, emotional, heartfelt, self-finding, never underestimate the power of LOVE and the meaning of true HAPPINESS. NOW PLEASE STOP READING AND START WATCHING."
324,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I'm sure this is a good show if I had finished it, but I can only take five episodes of of the guy that acts like a bigger beach than the woman. The rest of the cast was really good, I just don't know of any man that act like this fool. Maybe they're out there, but I don't know any. After awhile that stoic look on his face wore me out to submission for me to say, no more, I'm not finishing this even after I invested five episodes on it."
325,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A really really Beautiful Show with Cute and Lovable Characters, Different storyline, Romance,Comedy,Horror, Thriller, Suspense, Family drama, Story of Siblings,what else is remaining, there's everything in the show you want to see and enjoy. All the lead have done justice to there Character the pacing of the show is very nice and engaging I would recommend to watch this with your whole family there are few Kissing Scenes but it's okay or you can skip that part. The relationship between characters is absolutely brilliant it is very relateble and you will fell in love with that characters,the story arcs are perfectly done the Cinematography and Music of the show is Perfect.You will be Crying, laughing, getting emotional throughout the show. This is one of the Greatest Show I have seen after Breaking Bad and Death note. Congratulations to the Director for directing this Beautiful Show and All Cast and Crew who were there in the making of this exceptional Show.
A must watch Family Drama."
326,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The plot and storyline is lovely. Seo Ye Ji is a superb choice for Go mo young character. Feel happy to watch whenever Seo Ye Ji and Kim so hyun are together in a scene. The acting skill of San Htal brother is mind blowing. Hope to get much more success and awards in the upcoming years.
327,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's the drama for which I cried. It's really heartwarming. It's worth watching. I am in tears and joy at the same time. Episode 16 is the best! A lovely healing drama.
328,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I like this series really, well in first episode I find out that this series is very HYPE but after watching some episodes I found it one of the great series. I liked most Ko moon Yeon character, it's not irritating during the show apart I liked it most. I hope after you watched this series you liked this series very well. Also both brothers are acted well."
329,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"While watching last hour of show I was happiest person. The complete show is emotional rollercoaster throughout. I'm really proud of Moon sang tae ! Each character with its unique storyline and something to tell you, teach you.
It isn't just cliche HEA. Wonderful soundtracks, lovable and tearful."
330,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is by far the best kdrama in 2020
The chemistry from the main leads are crazy
The cinematography is gorgeous
The story is really good!"
331,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Gang gae's brother sucks a lott...😡If I would be there.....I would have killed him...how can he interrupt in his brother's life 😑.....his friend also sucks.....
332,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Loved the engaging story and the chemistry between main leads. The performance of both the leads was outstanding.
333,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Let me start by saying this is an excellent acted psychological drama/love story, with the main protagonists scarred by events or situations they have been in during their life. The main setting is a psychiatric hospital & I will not go into the main storyline details b/c that can be read in a synopsis.I wanted to give this drama an 8 or 9/10, but there is one RIDICULOUS plot twist that I cannot forgive so I've only given it a 6/10.*****SPOILER ALERT******Okay, let us talk about the mom of the daughter still being alive. It really goes off the rails on this ""twist"" in Episode 14. In Episode 13, the mom was shown explicitly being thrown off a 2nd story balcony by her husband & directly landing on the side of her head on the below stairwell. She suffered SEVERE hemorrhaging that would have killed her; but let's say for ""creative license"" sakes she survived this event. She would have had a SEVERE traumatic brain injury & would be eating through a straw the rest of her life! But there is more. Her husband then throws her body that's inside a bag into a cold lake. So basically, she's now dead X 2.But nope, she's been alive the last 20 yrs. & is now the head nurse at the psychiatric hospital! Say what?? It's explained that she looks nothing like her younger version b/c of plastic surgery; and by looking at the difference b/t the 2 mom actors, extensive/multiple plastic surgeries! I don't know how she found time to go to nursing school.If that isn't enough bad writing, it's shows the mom/head nurse helping a patient kill himself that occurs in Episode 1. But there are surveillance cameras in his room. A detective with more than 1 brain cell could look at the surveillance camera to show her helping him commit suicide! But that would have been the end of this drama after 1 episode.To me, this type of writing is an insult to the viewer. I understand in many dramas you must suspend belief to a point. But this ""suspension"" is Friday the 13th Jason type-suspension. And this is not a Friday the 13th type drama. Overall, it is a beautifully written drama showing how 2 scarred individuals fall in love while one grows a soul & the other finds life beyond helping others.My recommendation is to watch this drama but have your favorite hard liquor of choice available in Episode 14..........it might make the ridiculous plot twist go down better."
334,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The first half of the series is vastly superior to the second, but on the whole, this is a very likeable story."
335,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A perfect healing drama !!! Kimsoohyun is the best and the other actors as well
Best picture and i love to see this many times. A masterpiece and award winning."
336,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This Korean drama was recommended by New York Times as one of the best shows in the world in 2020, and i could not agree more.As a health-worker, i truly understand each character is suffering from trauma and others have serious mental disorders showing glaring symptoms which maybe repulsive to the society.Every one of them is flawed or broken and needs help. Whenever they face trauma, the solution is to run away but by doing so, they do not heal emotionally and stuck in the past with fear, anger and remorse. It's making their lives and the people around them miserable. This tells the story of Sang-tae and Gang-tae who run away and an elderly patients of Ok Psychiatric hospital who fought against the Vietnam war - A Boy who feed on his nightmares.I must say and i agree with others, Ko Mun Yeong mental disorder is difficult to treat. No, i don't find her actions acceptable at all but to her defense, she is different from her mother who killed or hurt people without reasons. Her mother was on another level and incurable.On the other hand, Ko Mun Yeong lacks empathy because of her mental disorder. But she has done some good things which was overlooked by many. Mun Yeong helped Sangtae become a Children Book Illustrator. She lent her car to Gang-tae. Though she hurt the guy who reviewed her books but he tried to blackmail Mun Yeong by milking money from her, insulting her, wanting sex from her and threatening to destroy her reputations. She saved a young girl who was lured by her father in convincing to commit suicide with him. People like her is difficult to understand and to treat. Her childhood was unbearably hard, she had to obey her mother out of fear. And her father tried to kill her, boy, that must have shattered the young girl. This traumatized her resulting to suffer from a mental disorder.Her personality balanced off with Gang-tae who suppressed himself. He thought its the only way to help his older brother. Eventually, they met and helped heal each other wounds. This is a healing love drama.Sang-tae faced his trauma and was healed at Ok Psychiatric Hospital. He was not afraid of the butterfly anymore. It was stated in the narrative Butterfly symbolized as a cure.There are so many things i wanna say but to some up, this is really good drama and worth watching. The stories of the secondary characters and patients were interesting and inspiring too."
337,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Loved everything about. Loved the acting. Loved the storytelling. Loved the chemistry between the whole cast. Am hooked!!!!!!!!
338,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"An absolute masterpiece in every essence. The story, the acting, the feelings you get from this as are just next level. This is our second K Drama after Crash Landing On You, living in the west we have now discovered these Korean series are light years ahead of anything we have seen before. If I could rate more than a 10 I would. Lastly the actor for the role of Moon Sang-Tae Should be given an Oscar or something equivalent, his performance was literally nothing other than outstanding."
339,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Just finished but i am very much moved by this drama. It felt like i was moving with them in their journey. Brothers love friendhip family and loved one. Cried, laughed, scared and i am speechless. His love to his brother omg superv acting. Thank you for sharing love of joy 👌👌👌"
340,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"One of the most well written, unique, brilliant, healing , and deep series i've ever seen
every single scene, dialogue is full of hidden inner meanings, and it's really the Best at symbolism and metaphors.the Character development in IOTNBO the SMOOTHEST and the BEST I've seen in k drama."
341,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Great story line.
Brilliant directed by Park Shin-woo.
Amazing cast with beautiful Seo Ye-ji and Handsome Kim Soo-Hyun.
Supporting actor Oh Jung-se(Sang tae) is lit.Great story building in each episode. New concept of animated story line was a great experiment by team. Easy to understand through animated graphics.
Bro-mance and Rom-Com both combo are amazing.An emotional nad heartfelt good bye to this series."
342,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's really awesome. Different from the normal trend, Best Korean drama ever"
343,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Best kdrama series of 2020 and lead actress seo ye ji outstanding and standout of the drama and all cast are doing wonderful job!!
344,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"All the characters in this series are likable.This is really a beautiful series. It has everything in it.romance, suspence, thriller,comedy, mystery, family drama.the direction is awesome . Songs are also good. First four episodes were difficult to complete for me but then I was into this series.this series is very emotional.one of the best series I have seen so far."
345,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Beautiful! Amazing! Wow! Just Wow! I have no words to describe this drama. Every episode is better then the one before. I really loved it.
346,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"An impeccable ending, and each episode made me to learn and acting is out of the line. I just finished the drama and i will miss it for sure, the title is justified, and i recommend every one to watch ."
347,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama is just perfect, u can't find one better!"
348,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I love it becuz of the romance parts and the exciting storyline
349,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I can't understand who give weak rates and low numbers . Plot is good characters performance is perfect . It's one of my favorites that gives good feelings to me. Don't pay attention to haters. Romance is not my favorite and I am not a Korean that can enjoy the comedy part of series still it was very interesting and I enjoyed alot.
350,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Every part is adctive and writting screen was awesome. Its far different from other love stories and drama. One word for series ""ma$terpieace""."
351,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Well i am a huge fan of romance genre but only quality series of movie. So i watch very little romance but i see something different and memorable. This series is so beautiful and lovely i almost cried while watching it and i didn't wanted it to get over. It is perfectly balanced and perfectly casted series. It surpasses my expectations and i am totally in love with the series along with the cast which i love and will miss... lots of love to the team
352,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's 10 days since I have completed watching this masterpiece but ,not able to forget .In these 10 days I have watched it 3 times. If you start watching this automatically you will be going to care the characters. A beautiful family relationships will force you to cry and it's not depressing at all. You will land in different world and at the end you will get disappointed that why it has ended."
353,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Okay at the beginning.Story Started to fall apart since the 4 episode.
354,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This is mandatory for ur watchlist....the plot is awesome...liked it.
355,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's an Asian hit. However, I personally disliked the drama for its limitless pity. Psychos are one-sided victims. The main character works in a mental hospital. He looks like Cinderella. Already in the first episode, the man was showered with misfortunes - he was beaten, humiliated, fired, kicked out of school by his autistic brother, he was cut with a knife, someone vomited on him ... And this is only in the first episode. To finish off the viewer, we were shown a beautiful, scarred body clearly hinting at the sufferer's difficult past. The main character is a storyteller, she is also sick and suffering. Like all psychos in this drama, her parents are to blame for her problems. All in turn cry, scream, suffer and sting each other."
356,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I must say this drama is one of the best.
I'll make it really short.
The acting as emotions by the main cast is on another level. They really had me on an emotional rollercoaster ride.
The story is extremely unique and a well thought out story line with a major twist.
I am really happy I watched it.
Shout out to the cast and the script."
357,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have watched many noteworthy titles like Goblin, you who came from the stars, descendants of the sun etc. Nothing even comes close to the near perfection of this drama.
With such a brilliant cast, the emotions on the screen seem very much real.
This drama is a sure keep and my applause to the cast, director, script and last but the best the OST. Just brilliant!!"
358,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This Kdrama ruined me so well that it made do an IMDB review (for the first time since i'm too lazy to do one lol) EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KDRAMA IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
359,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The natural chemistry of Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun got me so crazy like i mean i can't help but to ship them!!! The casts are all amazing, the story line talks about mental health and how someone should deal with it. The plot of the story got me asking every questions on who's the real culprit. I MEAN HOW CAN I NOT LOVE THIS DRAMA WHEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS JUST SO PERFECT?!"
360,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I'd never thought I'd find the perfect Korean drama, but here I am.. giving 10/10 for this K drama because it really deserves the 10/10 rating. Watching the main leads' acting is a truly enjoyable experience for me. The chemistry between the main leads are out of this world. I can relate to the characters and the stories in this drama.. As someone who has mental health issue, I'm so glad I've found this healing drama."
361,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I love moon young stories and her inference from famous stories like beauty and the beast . its a drama full of emotion thanks two wise script writer and talent actors .
362,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Every one should watch this rollercoster of romance really wonderful experience. Want to see 2 nd season.
363,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Oh Yeong-Se deserve Oscar of all Oscars... All actors did amazing job though... I saw all 16 episodes in one breath... I hope this is series that many people will see... It deserves to be seen... As I wrote, piece of art."
364,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This has got to be the most overrated kdrama ever. It's okay but definitely not better than other kdramas that have lower ratings like Crash Landing On You, Descendants of the Sun and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin). It glamorizes mental illness, condones sexual harassment, has hammed acting and an unbelievable storyline for a villain."
365,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Outstanding series. This series had became my all time favourite. There is not a single department where this series lack of. From story to Cinematography, Animation to fairy tail, outstanding music and score. Spot on Acting by all the cast. Kudos to the director and writer and my favourite 'seo ye ji'.Must watch and also Hindi Dubbing is Outstanding."
366,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I absolutely love the show, it was so heart wrenching but heartwarming at the same time. The main characters they worked together and I love how they become a family at the end. I just love that they included a character that you wouldn't see elsewhere where that character does have problems that it does show problems that people do have and it shows how family can do a lot and mean a lot. So I really appreciated the show it was something that really made my day and I'm so glad that I watched this I don't think there's enough words for me to truly say how much this show was amazing."
367,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story/plot of this drama, as you may already know by now, deals with mental health. Talk about taking risks, this production dared to be different and they delivered! Dark yet refreshing. The story and script was very interesting and provoking. The theme meant to not just entertain but educate and bring awareness on mental, emotional, and psychological issues people can relate to. True to its goal, the drama indeed is a healing drama.Impeccable acting by the 3 lead actors and by all the supporting cast. Everyone did justice to their characters, especially the 3 leads with their complex characters. Obviously, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se delivered their characters well (I did a little bit of acting in theater in the past and while their characters were challenging, it was much easier to internalize and deliver than that of Moon Gang Tae's). So hats off to Kim Soo Hyun... how could he have pulled off that character well is pure genius!The direction was neither fast nor too slow, just the perfect amount of suspense that viewers need to stay glued and captivated. The production was amazing too. They perfected all the details (costume, lighting, tone, angles and framing, special effects, dialogue, etcetera) and they were able to give the perfect scene setting and atmosphere needed in this type of unorthodox genre. Perfect execution!And as a special bonus, the soundtrack and musical score supported well the overall theme of this drama. Just made watching every scenes beautiful and touching!This is a deviation from the usual and the norm in kdramaland but watching the perfect blend of the technical and sentimental ingredients of this drama is already healing the soul. To say that this drama is a masterpiece is an understatement. I'm giving it 11 stars!"
368,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It is the best, undisputedly, I did not feel a single moment of boredom throughout the 16 episodes, and the most beautiful thing is that it contains romance, comedy, fantasy, drama and shocks as well. I laughed and cried and was also surprised. I highly recommend this series. It must be watched."
369,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The plot keeps you intrigued right from the beginning to the end. The characters are very well written and equally well performed.The music is the soul of the drama... Beautiful.. aesthetically pleasing... Locations used throughout lifts the mood! Kudos to the costume designer!Story is well written.. direction is amazing with the we'll use of comics and the graphics in between.The connection between past and present is very smooth.Most importantly the concept and the way importance given to mental health is encouraging in many ways.The climax was little disappointing in my opinion. It could have been lot better.Overall the best drama !!!
370,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is absolutely typical romcom. Jaded. One-sided. Empty. I can only highlight an interesting presentation with animation in the style of Tim Burton. This whole drama is like a pretty wrapper that has nothing in it. The highlight of the drama for many was the sociopathic heroine. Who throughout the series stalker and harass a man. The man on the whole series looks like a deer. Yes, just a deer. Which they grabbed by the horns and led away. He has no opinion. There is no will. A rag with a nice torso. But he loves his brother and thanks for that. . Creepy. That the audience likes it. Apart from the pretty pictures and pretty faces, this drama is nothing else..."
371,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I've been exploring K-drama these last few months. This one is by -FAR- the best K-drama I've seen, and better than most of the series I've seen in general. Everything comes together: great cinematography, good music, great script and subtle acting by three amazing actors.Highlight for me was of course the developing relationship between Moon-Youn and Gang-Tae. I've seldom seen such tenderness on-screen, yet it never becomes tacky as there's plenty of humour there as well. Also the interaction between Moon-Youn and Sang-Tae was splendid, and often hilarious. The plot concerning Moon-Young's past/mother could have been better developed, but that's nitpicking.In short, If this series doesn't move you, you don't have a soul."
372,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This has been one of the most incredible dramas i've watched
373,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Just amazing!! Great acting, character development everything is just perfect"
374,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Best drama ever , i love this drama so muchActors , edits , storyline everything is a best"
375,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,In my opinion the direction and character development is one of the best that I have seen. I just didn't want it to end.
376,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I Started Watching This Show Before my Exams And Yet I'm Watching It And My Exams Are tomorrow.
Yaa This Show Has Good Endings at each Episode Which Will Lead you To watch second episode immediately.There are Sometimes When I Think That I'm watching something like Bollywood But Storyline Is Great So No complaints.
just Watch The Show Without Knowing Anything about it You'll enjoy it more.
Watching Your First Kdrama Watch This You Won't Regret it."
377,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama Set the bar so high ! Everything is perfect from the opening to the ending. Such a masterpiece. The writing, acting, plot, cinematography, transition, screenplay, scoring, chemistrty between the actors are just on another Level. It's more than just drama, it's a life lesson."
378,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama set the bar too high. The Acting, writing, scoring, cinematography, transition, screenplay, plot, the use of fairy tale metaphors, the chemistry between the actors, everything is just on another Level: Such a masterpiece.! It's Okay To Not Be Okay is more than just drama. It's A Life lesson."
379,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really wanted to say it is amazing but I can't.It starts off really well and interesting and yes the leads and some of the supporting cast did a great job in terms of the acting but for me I have to connect and have empathy with the characters and as far as the female leads character is concerned I could not. Yes she had a hard and toxic childhood, but that does not give permission to be cruel and spiteful as and when it suits her. I could have been won round had the scriptwriters not included a scene where she tears the butterfly's in half, but after seeing that scene, I just could not see her in any other light but cruel. As others have said there are many who have had a tough childhood and a turbulent relationship with her parents, but they grow up to be compassionate people regardless of their issues. If you dig deep enough you can always find reasons for even the most ruthless person, but that does not make it OK. As for being a famous children's book author - what parent would allow their children to read such dark storiesThere are some light and humorous moments, the autistic brother and the Director of the psychiatric ward are fantastic, but at times I found it very slow. I am at episode 8 and struggling to keep going. The premise of the story is good and it has some interesting themes, but I think the scriptwriters didn't take into account that once you present a character in a cruel light they risk losing support for that character."
380,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It is indeed a human healing drama full of messages and life lessons. At first, I thought the story would be like another typical rom-com kdrama but my guess was wrong. I already captivated by the visual storytelling from the first episode.All of the actors are well casted and their superb acting were really satisfying.In my humble opinion, what made this drama unique is the way it successfully conveyed the messages on mental health with its mature acting and meaningful dialogue. I learnt a lot of things thanks to Its Okay to Not Be Okay. Totally worth to watch."
381,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,There's not many series that make a special place in Audiences heart. But this series one of those which made a special place in our hearts. This series has an amazing and an unique story line. I just love it.
382,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The female lead is probably one of the best characters that I've ever come across in kdramas... She's such a badass queen that you start loving her more as the series progresses. The acting is extremely amazing.The drama handles so many mental and emotional issues beautifully. The personal traumatic experiences of each of the characters helps shape their personality. The drama has some amazing cinematography with such aesthetic visuals that it's hard to take your eyes off of the screen. I'd watch this drama again and again just for the experience.
383,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's okay to not be okay is the best drama I've ever seen💙
384,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Since 2019...I have following Korean Drama deeply and I have watched many Korean Drama but It's okay to be okay is one best best korean Dramas I have ever seen till date. This drama is on another level because of beautiful story line, best dialogues, narrating the story, director and cast give full efforts to this drama.Interesting FACT: The screen writer Jo Yong said the plot and storyline inspired by his real life love someone.(No spoilers for reviews)Right from the first episode, I was pulled in and I really didn't want it to end. This drama for those who love dark romantic, motivate, psychological dramas. I don't right any character name Or anything related to drama. This series gives you roller coaster ride to your emotions, curiosity from the beginning where you could not to stop in between instead you will keep waiting for the next episode to watch. When I have completed this drama, it effects that healed my soul somewhere...I am really really... Thank You to all members, cast, director and specially screen writer Jo Yong for healing my soul and many souls around the world."
385,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It is categorized as a RomCom, but it is more than that. It is a balance of diff. types. One thing it is a 100 percent is it being a healing drama. It provokes you to face the ugly truth we live in, on how we relate to people we consider less or different from us but at the same time give us that sense of hope (if we allow ourselves to be open with it) that we can be better versions of ourselves."
386,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Watching many K-Dramas after the years I've found this to have such an intriguing and unique storyline. The details from the soundtrack, artwork, costumes, and character development were meticulously thought out. Oh Jung Se deserves an award for his role as an autistic adult--One he portrayed with dignity and deep understanding. I am from the US and I can unequivocally say that his method acting is on par with the greats. Think Eddy Redmayne in The Theory of Everything or Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot. As for the main characters they had a good chemistry-Seo Ye-Ji put all she had into the role and was a mysterious but ultimately playful and likeable personality. The writers really made you appreciate people for who they were despite their struggles. The nuggets of wisdom throughout the show on life, wellness and forgiveness shine through. I wish there was a second season as this show makes you want more and more. I don't normally say a show can be life changing or impactful but in this case the artistry, attention to details and careful storytelling feels like a love letter, packaged with care and hope. Truly 10/10 need more!"
387,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have been watching kdrams from quite a long time but this show is amazing better than DOTS, GOBLIN and any other popular KDrama ..the way it presents various illnesses and emotions is amazing"
388,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"What an amazing show. I'e seen a lot of k- dramas but this one is totally different from the others. It is a blend of romance, horror, comedy and emotion. Tells us how a lonely person overcomes his fears and gets attached to the strangers and eventually finds a new family.
What makes this show a superhit is the brilliant performance by the cast and crew."
389,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The best kdrama I have ever watched .. I highly recommend this drama.. you won't be dissapointed ..
390,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Awesome storyline. Brilliant acting. Wonderful star cast. Every episode kept getting better and better. Stellar performance by every star cast. Left me wanting more of it. Just 16 EPs wasnt enough.
391,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I'd say this is not your typical Korean Rom-Com. The story talks about the concepts of mental health and trauma. This was a breath of fresh air for me and enjoyed the series thoroughly. The cast best suits the characters and couldn't be more perfect. And the story ! Wow! The writer is a genius. The way children's books and stories carried the series forward is simply mind-blowing. Highly recommend.
392,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama is perfecto, the main characters, the story, the ost and the chemestry is on point."
393,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"After watching many dramas, this is by far the best I have seen so far. This is why...
Every scene is beautiful in it's own way. I felt an emotional connection to all of the characters and have become invested in the story.
It brings the topic of mental health to the fore front so is very current.
The chemistry portrayed between the two lead actors is heart stopping......just kiss already!! 😘"
394,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The writers did a marvelous job with the storyline, and to have S.Korea's top actors n actress portray these characters makes it even more beautiful.. I have to say I've watch Oh Jung-Se- ( who is the brother) act in a lot of other shows, but this series , Oh- I hope you win best supporting actor award, your acting role in this series, is so different from your other roles and you mastered it! Bow down to you Oh Jung-Se..
And of course the main lead actor- the BEAUTIFUL and TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun
I gotta say for someone who hasn't done a new series or movies in awhile came out strong with his acting, but of course that's why he's the top korean actors in S.Korea.. Watching him ""work"" this character in details, you can see he has his entire heart/mind in this for the next 16 episode, the connection between him and his brother (oh Jung-Se) melts my heart, the sadness in his eyes, the love, the laughter, we can see it through his acting.. so far just 4 episodes, and I see awards coming their way! Great work, just beautiful!"
395,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Let me say that the writers did a marvelous Job! On top of that the best of the best S. Korean actors portraying these characters and doing it brilliantly is great!
Oh Jung Se, you are going to win best supporting actor again! I've seen other dramas he's in and this one is something different for him, 🙇.. and he's doing it very well!

Ye-Ji Seo, great character for you! Love it!

396,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is truly a masterpiece from the storylines, plot twists, cinematography, osts and superb actors. Thank you for allmthe casts, staff, writers, and people behind this brilliant drama series."
397,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's one of the best K series of 2020; Wonderful production with a brilliant script and dialogues; Very different drama with a great concept. Acting is the best I have seen in K dramas and with a very strong female lead.
398,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Wonderful production with a brilliant script and dialogues; Very different drama with a great fairy tale concept and perfect performance by the leads - great cinematography. Acting is the best I have seen in K dramas recently with a very strong female lead and with many amazing tension and romantic sciences, most are done with face expression only."
399,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It is the best drama of 2020. We can see how versatility kim soo hyun is.
400,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Good chemistry for Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji, aside from they're both looking good.
Interesting plot. You get excited for every episode. You'll feel their emotions, sometimes you'll feel you can relate and you can laugh and cry while watching."
401,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Absolutely amazing!! You have to watch this series to understand the level of amazing story telling talent that Korea has. Hollywood and bollywood lack this talent.
402,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's Okay to Not Be Okay
If you haven't started watching this series which is trending top 10 on Netflix, then please start watching and trust me you will fall in love with this unusual love story.I am finished with 10th episode of this series and I liked Everything thing about this series, it's story line, characters and actors playing those character fit perfectly to the characters, Aesthetic, cinematography and character development of every character with every episode, supporting actors are like cherry on the cake.Writer (Jo young) and director (Park shin woo) who is also directed Encounter another one of my favourite series.I feel director Park shin woo really have nack of portraying unusual love stories.As I said Every things about this series is so good that it will keep you hooked and with an excitement what will happen next.As the title says that it's okay to be not okay, which is well justified with the story line. There is one important character Moon Sang tae (Oh jung se) and one of my favourite who is an autistic person.Moon Sang tae cannot well understand human emotions but have memorized these emotions looking at different human emotions which he always sticks to his wall and remembers it and also never fails to show what he feels inside. Moon Gang- tae who is younger brother of Moon Sang-tae (Kim soo Hyun) and Ko Mun -yeong ( Seo ye-ji) children's book author. They being normal' human being suppress their true emotions deep inside their heart and keep a different face to the show the World.
It's not only the love story between two doesn't make this series exciting to watch but a different human psychology depicted through Ko Mun -yeong ' s children's book and titled episodes with the same.This depiction psychology and different perception is something where we are able to connect ourselves in our life and can understand others too.I especially liked the ko mun Yeong character which is not normal korean heroine character like cute and innocent (that place is taken in this series by Moon Sang tae.)This character is being shown as a real witch with breathtakingly beauty and fashion and it's not just because she is a lead she has to be in good fashion, there is a reason why is this character being shown as over dressed or high on fashion which you will find out once you watch.Moon Gang tae is a character with lot of patience who works as care taker in mental Asylum and whose whole life is been spend taking care of his brother Moon Sang tae
Being the only one to take care of his autistic brother and sacrificed entire life for him is craving for little care and love for himself.There are supporting characters who fills gaps and also make you laugh hilariously , especially jo jae-soo (kang ki dong ) who has really good comic timing , I have seen him other series as well, and his work in comic timing is just awesome and yoo seung jae (Park jin -joo) as well is very funny and cute.This series is just not the roller coaster of different human emotions but also the added suspense from the beginning where you could not to stop in between instead you will keep waiting for the next episode to release"

404,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I've never been much of a kdrama fan. I've watched a couple through the years usually casually and would even leave some unfinished if i found it boring already. This is the first kdrama that has ever gotten me so hooked its crazy. Tbh it transcends the usual type of kdramas and its def a must watch even for non kdrama fans. Cinematography is stellar. The chemistry of the leads is FIRE. The acting is excellent. When the characters are in pain u also feel like ur in pain as well. And most of all the story is beautiful and relevant. How they intertwine fairy tales with mental health and mental disorders is so touching to me and it even made me reflect on my own mental state. If this drama and its actors/actresses wont get awards I WILL RIOT!!!
405,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I love this drama because this give a lesson for everyone.. Kim soo hyun-shhi and seo yea ji-sshi's acting is not joke, oh jung se-sshi also good well.
The point this drama is the best as I see ever, sometime make me sad to happy, suddenly feeling like roller-coaster lol. Umm they look good together and the best chemistry, I love them as the best couple. They are deserve getting a winner this year and getting Oscar.Hyunji forever-Moonmoon forever"
406,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I am an Indian and watching kdrams for 7 yrs now. And I have no doubt this one is the best yet. My God, their acting was so phenomenal and realistic and not just main characters but the whole cast.
And obviously storyline was so unique and just perfect.
The end was perfect. I registered my IMDb account just so that I can rate this show .
In love with this series."
407,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The Cast, The Director, Soundtrack, and the Story is truly impeccable.
Very humble drama with deeply message that can relate to its viewer.
It's Okay to Not Be Okay is a proof that it does not necessarily take a high fantasy and highly imaginative story to make a good drama like its predecessors.
The thing that It's Okay has while the other Kdrama doesn't is that they can touch the viewer with their deep meaningful story that leaves a good mark in people heart. Watching this drama is so healing, yet very entertaining. It is certainly award winning type of drama. Seo Ye Ji acting and beauty is beyond on point. She makes other K Actress in her age looks so so compared to her excellent beauty and powerful acting."
408,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's okay not be okay can be summarized in one word, brilliant!. The drama delves deep into emotions probably you never knew you could feel. The cinematography leaves you awestruck. Each character is etched with so much care that you land up getting emotionally invested in each of them. Seo Ye Ji is brilliant as a children's author with a personality disorder. Oh Jung Se plays an autistic older brother with so much conviction and innocence, it makes you want to give him a hug every time he is on screen .Finally Kim So Hyun who plays Moon Gangte brings a simplicity and rawness to the drama.Please do watch it, you won't regret it!"
409,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Specially if you have any of the problems that took place in the drama and you always felt like no one can feel or understand you.Here,you will feel understood ,you can see that others feel the same and that you never overrated the problem or overreacted. It teaches you to not keep your feelings inside you and to let them out cause if you didn't you might explode, it teaches you how love can change alot (not only relationship love but friendship and family love too) and whoever said that the ending is bad ,it's totally not but the drama is so great that we just can't
get enough
p.s:this drama helped me to face one of my own life problems and to understand it way better"
410,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I'm not all about those cheese romance TV shows. But my god this was unlike most romance TV shows (and romance movies) I have seen in my life. Impossible to not fall in love with every single character. Loved every single one of them. Even the questionable ones. It's not just the romance, but the family dynamics and the friendships as well. Not to mention that manager and his secretary constantly bickering was hilarious. Undoubtedly one of my favorite shows."
411,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This movie is a masterpiece! First the title of the drama isnt it a comforting pharse!? This is not a typical kdramas. 16episodes with 16different retelling of fairytales that will change your perspective, try seeing things from other sides:-)
i love Moon gangtae and his character development from a suppressed and stressful boy to a caring and brave man who will protect his loved ones.Moon sangtae who shows us how patients with autism live their lives and how amazing they can be.And the most important one is Ko munyeong, an antisocial children's book writer who can see through everything despite her scary character from the outside, in fact she is just a girl who needs warmth and love:-)
screenwriter jo young really studied hard on patients with psychiatric disorders and did an amazing job here
i cannot finish any other kdrama after IOTNBO because this sets such a high standard for me:)"
412,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The usage of fairy tales and central themes definitely kept the show grounded and focused. The show takes this even further by using familiar fairy tales to allow the audience to understand the characters better.From the very beginning, I had quite a few concerns about the show. For starters, it is about mental illness, and they are showing this to a predominantly Asian community who has never really had much content to deal with when it comes to the subject matter. The portrayal can either be glorified, derailed, or dull to the point the story won't really connect to the audience. Another issue was the murder plot, and how that could easily derail the story. These two concerns lingered until the end since the conclusion was really the only factor that can decide whether they were valid concerns or not.After finishing the show not just once, or twice, but three times (and counting), I am glad those concerns were invalidated, and it is obvious the writers made and effort to ensure none of them would be. Even better, the writers drive home the title of the series by showing that even until the end, none of the characters, both minor and major, are completely recovered, rightfully going against the idea that mental illnesses behave similarly to many physical illnesses which can be cured completely.The casting was beyond spot-on. Kim Soo Hyun's status as well as the nature of his previous roles makes his role in this show even more remarkable. We are so used to seeing him be so alluring not only in terms of his looks, but his characters' personalities in general. As I started this show, I was expecting him to be just as or even more alluring than he was before. Instead, I felt frustration (in a good way) towards his character's behavior, making me feel conflicted as this was not how I was used to seeing him. He looked glorious in the show but in terms of how his character was written, that was the best thing about him. To me, this is the role where his character felt the most humanized. He was perfectly imperfect, and he played it perfectly.I had never heard or seen Seo Yea Ji before this, and after watching her performance, it makes me wonder how many more underrated and insanely talented Korean actresses there are that I have not discovered. She not only played her role, but she EMBODIED it. She definitely had several shining moments. I also felt conflicted towards her character. Her intentions were wrong, but it seems that she can read people better than they can read themselves. She ends up doing the right thing for all the wrong reasons. In that sense, I loved how her character played out this way.I think it is worth noting that their humanized portrayal of a character with high functioning autism. I think they drove home the point that Sang Tae was different than others, but definitely not incapable, not just in terms of taking care of himself but of those around him as well. And just like every other character with this show, he too had mental health issues to deal with and flaws in his character that affected his relationship with others and his growth as a person. Making each character dimensional was just the list of things that has yet to be commended for with this show. And just like his co-leads, Oh Jung Se delivered a hell of a performance.Looking at the wider picture, this show does have international implications. The success internationally is one thing, but it does lead you to wonder how well Asian productions can stand against their western counterparts in terms of creating quality content. The writers of this show wanted to deliver a heart-felt story and from the beginning until the end, they clearly stayed with that purpose. The show was filmed stunningly and was written beautifully and creatively. The gist of the story was fairly simple, but the delivery is incredible. As a watcher from the US, it is painful to see the reception of this show not be as great as the dull, problematic TV shows gaining high viewership ratings."
413,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have an attention deficit disorder when talking about movies or shows on TV but with this particular drama, I was hooked like a leach. This drama not only depicts the meaning of true love but also the meaning of we are okay not matter what our circumstances maybe.I love the characters Moon Gang-Tae and Ko Mun-Yeong and how they balanced each other out. I want to see more of this duo on tv and on screen, hopefully this is not the last we're going to see them because it would be a shame.This is by far the best that happened in 20/20 for me. I am not an avid K Drama fan, I was able to finish the entire thing with my being so lack of interest in a long drama series but this one keep me and myself glued to the tv every week and I am still rewatching it every now and then. Some of the episodes are my happy pill.The chemistry of this two main characters are undeniably on fire! I mean, they are perfect for each other in reel and in real life so hopefully they found each other perfect too. The chemistry of the Moon brothers are so beautiful that you envy their relationship towards each other. Sang-Tae's character is so good, I've seen him mostly as villains in some other KDrama but with this, you fall in love with him. The relationship between bestfriends are also shown in this series and I want a bestfriend like that. The loyalty, the trust, the love and the respect for each other is beautifully crafted in this series.Glad I was hooked and now I am a big fan!. Highly recommend, if you have a hard time reading the subtitles in English, you can rewind and watch it again. Each episodes made you cry, laugh, and love it!I tell myself now Saikojiman Gwaenchanha. It's Okay to Not Be Okay!Happy watching!"
414,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is one of the best drama I have ever seen... All the characters are so good, and the couple looks really gorgeous together.... The story seems very interesting as well as uncommon.... It shows the reality ...
And finally you can say, it's okay to not be okay!"
415,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't usually watch foreign work because I'm not a fan of subtitles, but my daughter talked me into this one.
I was hooked after the first episode.
Fantastic writing, gifted acting, incredible insight into the world of mental health.
I HIGHLY recommend this series."
416,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Amazing Story, It teaches a lot of things and everyone should watch this once! A love of brother! After few episodes the Thrills are super exciting, I love this series 🌻"
417,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I love about this series is the overall story. Casts are stunning and perfectly fit to the character they portraits. The cinematography, acting, settings, and story that you can really relate to. I recommend this series a 100% must watch."
418,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Anyone who haven't watched this series yet? Then you must right now. I'm speechless actually. Everything I have been expecting in numerous series / dramas I've watched and known, this ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" K-Drama is the answer. HAHA. The casts, genre, story, ""everything"" was made me addicted to it."
419,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Out of all the shows I've watched, this has left me with the worst post-drama depression ever. I can't describe or understand why exactly I am so invested in the characters, ESPECIALLY GANG TAE AND MUN YEONG. Ever since I finished it, my heart aches every time I think about the show. It's like a void that will never be filled, in the most beautiful way possible. I love it so much and I really hope they somehow renew this for another season, although unlikely. The chemistry between the actors kills me, each scene they're together hurts me even if it's a happy one. I loved the magical realism and the little details they put into the plot, which just further enhanced the great acting of all the actors. If you're planning to watch this, I recommend preparing yourself 'cause you're gonna feel empty for a while after finishing it. Try to not miss anything and dedicate your full attention when watching it - that's how you'll enjoy it the most. I don't think I have ever shipped a couple so much, the dynamics and their backstories and the way they healed through each other are just perfect. The tension and the stares during those sweet and intimate scenes are what really pushed me off the edge. And of course, the funniest faces and lines at the most unexpected moments. I am 100% sure that this will probably be my favorite k-drama forever, I got so lost in their world and I find myself going back to it every now and then. I find comfort in them and I've gotten so used to it all. The familiarity you'll develop with the show is the best part of everything. I don't think I'd ever be the same again, I love the way I feel whenever I watch/think about it, it makes me smile and cry at the same time. My greatest wish is for these two to work together on the same project again, even if it's not for a season 2 of IOTNBO."
420,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"2 words: Seo yeji.
I hope that OH JUNG SE Get the reconsideration he deserves, his acting is everything also soo Hyun was a really good gang tae
Everything is letterly an art"
421,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I am a person who loves feelgood films,and this film is really much more than a feelgood.its a korian drama and I use subtitles for understanding and I make sure that every sentence that they said was I really understood.so PLEASE watch this drama because I highly recommend you this drama with all my hearts."
422,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"One of the best Kdrama i ever Watch, i definitely suggest this mind blowing drama,,,in this drama everyone put their best and help it to Reach on the pick. Loved this drama, wish I'll see this kind of drama another time,,I'm eagerly waiting for this kind of drama 💚💚💚💚"
423,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show is so good it completely ruined regular TV shows for me!!!When im watching a TV show now after watching this masterpiece I do not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters I use to love and care about!!! I think that is a good thing? Maybe?But holy *** the Trio of Troublemakers are some of the best actors I have ever seen in my life!!! The way they play off of each other in every scene is way to good!!! They need to be in more stuff together ❤11/10 must watch it is definitely with out a doubt in my top 3 favorite shows of all time!!!Last thing, who ever did the wardrobe need a BIG payday!!! Because I have never seen a person as stunning as Seo Ye-Ji ... some of her outfits she was wearing OMG 😍"
424,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I can't explain how this drama make me better and fell in very good mood
I will watch it again and again."
425,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Wow fantastic series
Every thing in this series is wonderfull and beautifull
Kim soohyun is the best actor because he can play with his face very well."
426,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"With all the ingredients of a thriller, It's Okay to not be Okay is in fact, first and foremost, a love movie, perhaps the best so far.Love comes naturally, shy and authentic and gets stronger as long the characters walk the hard way to the epilogue, which is a happy ending but not in a cliche sunset or something of a kind, but at a coup of coffee, on a hilltop.There are many things to praise as excellent in this movie, from the settings, the script, the music and the play of the main characters but the character played by Seo Ye Ji stand out from the other two brilliant interpretations, of already known and experienced actors, in the roles of the Moon brothers.Seo Ye Ji is incredibly expressive and talented, the real star of this movie. Her smile is a rare feat, something I was craving to see throughout the episodes."
427,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Yet another Korean drama to bring out the truest emotions in us all. I can't say how grateful I am to be able to submerse myself in such a spectacular display of human emotions. Distraught but found, it's the best feeling."
428,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"You rarely come across something where the urge of watching next episode become higher , heart rate starts pounding fast n you can't wait to watch all the episodes. Same happend with me, this is my 1st KDRAMA series n I'm not disappointed. What a masterpiece 🙌 I can't put it into words, I never saw something this magical n masterpiece 💕 that raw emotions, feelings, character development, pain, background music n songs, I felt every single thing while watching this series.. Now after finishing this series, I still don't know how to get over this amazing piece of work 👍 I just can't forget it, every character has done a phenomenal job 🙌 the memories will stay with me forever! The soundtracks n background music everything was a top notch... I really wish I could forget this series so that I can rewatch it right now. Even though it was my first KDRAMA n there are many more to watch, but I highly doubt if there are any who will be able to top this amazing masterpiece 💕 I wish it never ended."
429,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This is the best healing drama of all time. Well made and actors are great especially Moon Gang Tae ( kimsoohyun) i love to watch this many times .. such a masterpiece.
430,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This drama is great only because of the acting of Oh Jung-Se / Moon Sang- and the wardrobe of Ko Mun-Yeong / Seo Ye-Ji.
431,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Well, while writing this review while in bed after finishing episode 11, I can't stop thinking about this story! So wholesomely put together and the actors and actresses did a Platinum performance with their emotions and characters. Quite convincing.As for the storyline...If you're an anime fan into slice of life and romance genre, this is for you, it gives me the vibe of this should've been an anime instead of a series (I am an anime fan and only watched a few KD's to know the similarities between this series and an anime with their storyliness).How the main actress' character's stories have so many dark underlined meanings, starts the story off as a tight dark yet mysterious start to the first few episodes of the series, and as the story progress everything starts to unravel, everyone sorting out their demons, and it becomes more and more brighter and warmer.As for the actor who played the autistic brother, HE DID AN EXTREMELY EXCELLENT JOB. You feel so compelled and part of this story, you are pulled in such a way that you can feel it in your gut the emotions, as if you're standing right there in the background.Each episode is 76 min long. Worth it. Instead of it, like any other series, being 45 to 59 mins per episode. Doesn't drag the story, always something to keep you hooked."
432,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Who ever give lower rating must be lee min ho fans , they cant accept that , kim soo hyun havingbetter acting skill in so many ways"
433,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't write reviews. However after seeing so many great reviews I felt like I had to say something. This was the most boring k-drama I have ever watched! Nothing actually happens it's just people talking. I understand how some people are saying ""it has real themes!"" and how great the portrayal of autism was etc etc..
Yes great to see autism being showcased in a series with real themes however based on just the entertainment value of this series I could not continue after episode 11. I was bored several episodes ago but kept on watching waiting for something to happen which nothing did and I just felt like I wasted my time."
434,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show is absolutely amazing. The message that the title alone sends is inspiring, and by the time the rollercoaster is over you will be pumping the brakes wishing the ride would never end. I really loved the music, and the atmosphere they had throughout the show. It was quite mesmerizing and even hypnotic at times. The fact that the actor and actress actually had the disorders they were portraying brought an incredible level of authenticity to their performance, and that authenticity really carried the story well from beginning to end. It is a very layered and complex story with many well developed characters. It will definitely leave you deeply moved with an inspiration to grow in your own life."
435,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I watched and was bewitched with k dramaI just don't get this one. I am dragging my feet just trying to reach the finish lineI can think of 10 plus series that I watched and are better than this yet lower ratingStands out the brothers immense role as a person with special needs.The story for the last 4 eoiseds 3 to 7 is not moving forward.Every 130 mins a small hint of something.Very average and unless the ending is wotkd shattering very disappointing
436,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Its been two months already since it ended and i still feel so attached with the story and the characters. How to move on ?!?!?! This show will always have a special place in my heart and will always be on my top tier list. And its sooo good it hurts 😭😭😭😭
437,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,A fantastic serie with amazing performances . The chemistry between the three lead characthers is fantastic. Oh Jeong-Se is spectacular as Moon Sang-tae.
438,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Oh-Jeong Se's roll in here was amazing, this guy has range! All the other leads and supporting actress/actors played there rolls top notch! Great series!"
439,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't know where to start. I've never written a review to begin with, and I've seen a lot of shows. This was my first introduction to kdrama. And what a beautiful and emotional ride it was. The story is wonderful and tragic at the same time. And what a brilliant preformance from all of the actors. I've never seen a show quite like this and I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone should see it - it touches some heavy topics in a brilliant way. It is absolutely one of my top dramas I've ever seen, and let me tell you, that says a lot. If you haven't seen it - do it. You won't be dissapointed!!"
440,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A heart touching series that i love.. You need to be patient for the first episode, but later on it goes best"
441,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Unnecessary Stretch without serving any purpose, quite an average story. Lazy Screenplay, Forced background score at places where there is silence required. Nothing to hook the viewer. It would have been more tightly knit play if episodes were reduced by atleast half."
442,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The acting in this series is out of this world. The character development is perfect and realistic. Beautiful cinematography. Amazing supporting characters. If I was to look for a weakness it would have to be that the plot might be a little bit too complicated. The characters and acting alone could carry this show and some conflicts are unnecessary. Overall it is the best show I've ever watched. It is very close to perfect.
443,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"/best series

""Best kdrama of 2020"""
444,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Loved the unique concept of the series. The storyline, the characters, the location and its aesthetic beauty just added more to the attractiveness of the show.I was completely hooked until the very end. There are quite a few things to learn from this show. I felt i could relate to some of the events in my real life. The beautiful collaboration between a fairytale and reality was so so beautiful to witness. This is my second K-drama this year aftet Crash Landing On You and i am really glad that i watched this! :)"
445,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"An absolute gem. I've never seen Seo Ye-Ji before, and i'm still mesmerized by how deep and sexy her voice is."
446,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show explores and fleshes out themes in ways different from what I've seen in usual kdramas. It has many original concepts but still has that korean trademark chemistry between the leads that will give you the heart fuzzies.In short, come for the romance but stay for the story. Also, Kim Soo Hyun is definitely not human... how can he still look so good after all this time?!!Side note: this is my first time seeing Seo Ye Ji and I am blown away. She is so appealing and extremely good at portraying her character. Currently checking her other works just to see more of her and her acting prowess!!! It's easy to overdo Ko Mun Yeong to the point of campiness but Seo Ye Ji plays her with such nuance that KMY feels like a real person.Why I love this show:
1. The character development of the leads and main supporting cast across the episodes is nothing short of amazing - each main and supporting character has depths that shine in different moments throughout the series.2. The sets are beautifully made and the crew's attention to detail is astounding. The animation and other means to portray mental health and how different disorders are experienced gave me new insight into what these people must be feeling when they go through their episodes.3. The laughs and humor in this dramedy are well placed, feel natural, and let's you laugh along. The serious moments are heavy enough to make you cry. The heartwarming moments are genuine and can make you both laugh and cry.4. THE CHEMISTRY AMONG THE LEADS IS NEXT LEVEL!!! The filial chemistry among OJS, SYJ, and KSH is so good you'll be rooting for each of them until the end. The romantic chemistry between KSH and SYJ is explosive!!! Can they please just be happy together?5. The music is interesting and elevates the mood of the show.Why this show isn't a 10:
1. Everything about and regarding the ""main villain"" in this series is the one thing that feels forced... there are a lot of plot holes and convenient set ups needed to make this villain work in the world of the story."
447,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I just fell in love with the fairy stories in each episode. The cast is perfect ,full of strong emotions. I have laughed with the strong bold character of hero n heroine ..and i have cried with their emotional side as well. The childhood trauma of mine was a lot similar to the story.. may be i felt connected with the story, emotions and all tales eternally. Best series i ever watched."
448,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama is one of the best I have seen. The story is rich and layered. It is very unique. The acting by all three main actors are sublime. I recommend it as well to international viewers, I am a native English speaker and have really loved watching it. It portrays various mental health issues in a sensitive manner and you will become invested in these beautifully written and acted characters from episode 1."
449,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"After watching this web show i am so amazed how can k drama made this fantastic shows .
Incredible fair tail stories and acting and most important thing contribution pf every actor.
Nice wonderful.."
450,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is my favorite drama of all time. I love all of the characters inside, except for the villain. Love the couple, also his brother. This is a must-watched drama. The healing side of this drama healed me a lot. The development of the characters made my heart fluttered. This drama is so amazing, not like the other romantic dramas with the cheesy moment. The romance gave me the tension of the real couple. Hard for me to move on from this drama."
451,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's a heart-melting kdrama. After a few episodes, it made me wonder what a man could endure before he broke down. How much sadness does a man hide behind high walls?"
452,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Cute show, I'm addicted. Must watch for all :)"
453,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The actors are very talented and the story is very relatable!
454,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Not your typical kdrama, it's really different and the chemistry between the characters is amazing. I love everything about it and highly recommend it."
455,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's written so well that I can easily see the artwork behind all of these episodes.It's directed as we can relate with every scene and feel it on our way.The characters are incredible their skills just blew my mind.You should have to check this masterpiece once if you want to feel good.
456,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's loaded with chemistry between the two leads. The visuals are another reason which makes this drama a must watch. The music in this drama are so beautiful and heartfelt.
457,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't usually write on here about anything but the unique story, the acting, the characters and every little part of this show made it impossible to not write my appreciation for it.I'm am amazed and In love with this Drama. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who reads this but I needed to just say that anyone that comes across this drama should give it a go. It's honestly the best series I've seen all year and one of the best I've seen ever."
458,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This k-drama is amazing! I can't describe its extraordinariness with words. Definitely the best k-drama I've ever watched in my whole life!
459,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Music 10/10
Acting 9/10
cinematography 8/10
Directing 9/10.Great acting by all of artists specially sang tae(oh jung-se)
Great music my favourite ost specially {breath (Sam Kim)} and {in silence}"
460,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Loved it. Not those kinds of cringey dramas. A lot of life lessons are told in this drama.
461,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A total surprise, going into this i thought it was going to be just a well made series with nothing really impressive about it... i was wrong.The three mains on this are just unbelievable, the story is interesting throughout the entire series, at no point feels boring or overwhelming, the character archs are paid off in a compelling way, some of you will probably tear. The support characters are relevant and have a great development, by the end you will miss them too.
And the story is just fantastic, the fact the episodes are long allows the story to breathe and feel like taking a pause (while still developing the story in a compelling way). Im just in love with this show, i have no regrets going into this, loved it and enjoyed it all the way through."
462,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Truly a very valuable treat that is awaited every weekend by fans of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji around the world.
463,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The ending was a bit rushed. I wish they gave more backstory on the mother and had spent more time playing with the mother daughter relationship and the mother's return.
464,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The series has a very good mixture if expressions and the actors nailed it mainly seo ye ji and kim soo hyun
465,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I like the story, the characters of the tv drama was really awesome.. Moon Yeung, Gang Tae and Sang Tae, kudos to them"
466,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I recommend you to watch this serie, it had smtng particular"
467,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I Just Say That This Is BlockBuster Drama I Ever Watch
Seo Ye Ji Just killed it and kim soo hyun performed very well
this very very interesting do watch and
plzz RATE THIS 10 STARS
Plzz Watch U Will Never Disappointed
RATE THIS 10 STARS"
468,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's not a typical love story. I can't wait for the next episodes!
469,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I'm not even finished yet; I think I have like 3 episodes left till the end, but I really wanted to go ahead rate this already to express just how much I LOVE this drama right now!!! 😭😭😭🤗🤗🤗 It's pretty addicting too!"
470,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's only been 4 episodes but it's the BEST K-Drama I've EVER watched. I'm confident they can keep up the energy! LOVE THE PAIRING!!!!
471,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have watched so many KDramas but this us my first time writing a review for one because I just couldn't stop myself. This drama is a complete masterpiece. I was reluctant at first thinking that it would've been a sad melodrama and would have left me crying and sobbing for days, which I didn't want. But I was so wrong! This gives me a kick and life lessons which no other drama could, and this is not those typical KDramas which have a not-so-significant female lead. The female lead is the most powerful, and the male is such a good match for her, a great human being. It tells us how someone can enter our life surprisingly and turning it upside down, making it much better than it was, and your loneliness vanishes. It teaches the importance of love and warmth in our empty lives. Overall, one must give it a go. The acting is terrific, and, you'll remember the kiss forever ;)"
472,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"If you haven't watch this, you better start watching it. It's not just a typical RomCom and a little bit of Dark side Korean Drama, but it also talks about Mental Health Issues which is timely relevant and everyone should be educated with"
473,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS DRAMA. THE ACTORS, THE CONTENT, THE DIRECTOR..... THE WHOLE TEAM HAVE DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED OUTSTANDING EFFORT INTO CREATING THIS AMAZING SERIES. IT TEACHES US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY IN OUR LIVES AND THAT SYMPATHY IS ALWAYS AN IMMORTAL MEDICINE FOR A BROKEN HEART AND A VULNERABLE SOUL. A TOTAL MUST WATCH!!"
474,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,An absolute must watch kdrama of all time!!!! This has been upgrading Kdramas to another level of amazingness. You should experience it yourself and I'll bet that you will not regret or feel like youre wasting your time for this. This is a masterpiece.
475,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"From watching this show, people get a chance to learn about their true-self !"
476,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Even though this show just recently started streaming, it already got me hooked on its first four episodes. I can say that this is not your typical romantic comedy tv show because the story line doesn't just focus on that alone. It also promotes mental health awareness, which I think, is not always seen on tv shows. It shows that there are different kinds of mental illnesses and how each one should be given of importance and should not be neglected. Anyway, its a tv show that is worth watching and looking forward to the next episodes."
477,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The storyline is unique and powerful, it serves you dark fairy tale with valuable life lessons.The acting is very impressive, even could make us feel connected with their feelings. I love how this drama bring up mental health issues to make us more open-minded about mental illness. I recommend you to watch this slowly, and feel the healing process of each characters."
478,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes. The actors have great chemistry; their charisma is insane. I really enjoyed the animations that were incorporated into the film. I highly recommend everyone to try experiencing this great drama for themselves because it will surely not disappoint.
479,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Best actor and actress , good chemistry both of them"
480,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"THIS IS A HEALING SHOWThere are definitely some things I've learned from it.~ Accept your reality
~ Remember your pain and overcome it
~ Love yourself first before loving others"
481,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Creativity at its finest. Highly recommended. This drama will open your eyes to what's going on around the world right now.
482,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Actually I am not a fan of either the main actor or actress. I am a typical person who chooses to watch a drama because of the cast, while watching this drama my desire is actually just to fill my free time, not to wait for the comeback of the actor or actress. It could be called just an accident, but dang! even from the first episode I was very much in love with this drama, the main actors were equally very strong, their wives were very good, the storyline was not common and boring, it tells about someone's mental state, they have a good moral message. To be honest, since I became acquainted with the world of Korean drama, this drama has been included in the best drama of all time, in my own opinion. Look at this drama, I guarantee you will not be disappointed"
483,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Best chemistry I have ever seen in a Kdrama. They're so good that I don't think there is out there who can match their chemistry. For me, they should be proclaimed as the PRINCE AND PRINCESS of Kdrama. This drama and leads will go down as one of the best. Broke the ITAEWON CLASS & THE KING ETERNAL MONARCH record and now holds the highest rank in the global ranking as (6th) WORLDWIDE!!! They also dominate as Top 1 in 8 countries and making a wave in western countries!!! (c)MelaParkALL IN JUST 8 EPISODES!!!!"
484,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama has a brilliant plot, stunning visuals , excellent actors and mind blowing editing. Absolute perfection"
485,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It just got you hooked from the first episode. the aesthetic this drama have was just *chefs kiss. i really tortured myself by watching this while it's still ongoing. but i could already said that it's a must watch !!
486,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is such a great show!! It got me obsessed within the first two episodes. The main characters are both so good at portraying their emotions! I LOVE that the character of the main actress is so different to other main characters to diverse K-Dramas. Ok so let me explain. In most Dramas its always this quirky, shy, innocent girl that has no idea about life or whatever and that always needs the help of a man to achieve something. In its okay to not be okay though, the female character is strong and independent. She has more like this personality where she knows from the beginning what she wants and tries to get it by whatever means. And can we just take a minute and appreciate how visually pleasing the main actors are like omg they are GOREGOUS !!!"
487,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have recently stepped into the world of kdrama with CLOY and then stumbled upon this gem. Loved the story, the way the story is told, the performances from all the actors and the cinematography. Everything is so perfect. I fell in love with Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji together. Their chemistry is beyond beautiful and natural. Everytime they kissed my heart did a summersault, it felt so genuine and intense. The character developments thoughtout the series of all the chatacters are amazing. I feel like this show is very under appreciated among kdrama lovers. Do give it a watch and I am sure it won't be regretted.."
488,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A number of things about this korean web series are really awesome and catchy. Starring Seo Ye Ji as children's book writer Ko Moon-young and Kym Soo-hyun as caregiver Moon Gang-tae are unforgettable. The chemistry building between them in every episode, their up and down relation and the unfinished love of their childhood are portrayed magnificently.Plots, costume design, character building, scripting, cinematography, songs, background music, special effects, casts and especially the ending are awesome.Basically the story revolves around Moon Gang Tei(Kym Soo-hyun), a caregiver in ""Ok psychiatric hospital"" and his childhood crush Ko Moon-young(Seo Ye Ji) who later became a children's book writer. Their love story is so involving. The pain feels profound. Healing each other in times of need, crying while in pain and overcoming their fears together are presented beautifully. A mixture of drama, comedy, psychology, mystery made the series that much intense.Surely, there are some minor technical flaws but those can be overlooked.In the end, I will surely recommend you watching it. This will make you laugh and cry from time to time. And as it perfectly says ""It's okay to not be okay."""
489,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's okay to not be okay/psycho but it's okay is not your typical K-drama.Love everything about it. The casts, the chemistry, plot, cinematography, the OSTs. It promotes mental illness awareness as well. The character development is on point tho~ and it has deep meaning behind the storylines.I've watched so many K-dramas (being a kdrama fan since decades ago) but for me, this is by far the best K-drama. Ever.
This is truly one of a kind drama that doesn't deserve even 1-sec skip.Hands down to the IOTBNO/PBIO crews!PS: i love KimSooHyun & SeoYeaJi...
their chemistry is insane and it's on another level.
I ship them and hope they will become real couple ^_^"
490,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's okey to not be okey best drama of the year, so beautiful storyline, excellent actors, very good job the directors and the writers and may more... congratulations....."
491,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story line, the actors, the raw emotions, pure but selfish love of each character, OSTs, iconic lines, mysteries and of course the romance that the world needs to see and experience as we face the pandemic. These drama will surely captivate our innermost desires and ambitions along with emotional and mental health care... To make it short, Its the best and keeps getting better as we approach the end"

493,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I agree that once you passed the first episode, you will be hooked and you can't wait for the next episode. You will never get tired of watching it over and over again... while i am waiting for the next episode, i watch the old episode again, can you imagine that. I like the acting, very spontenoues , very natural, i like the chemistry of the 2 main characters. They are all good delivering their roles though. very real. Not lousy or overacting. They delivers. The story is not boring and one of a kind. The story and characters are all unique. This will be my one of the best ever kdrama. I will be very sad if this will be missed out by everyone."
494,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Ethereal and mischievous, the show is truly a work of beauty as it contrives to thrust its viewers into a world surrealism. It's Okay not to be Okay (IONTBO) manages to weave the fairy tale stories of Ko Moon Young (SYJ) into the central plot of the show. Each of the fairy tale story is reflected on each episode. Albeit whimsically portrayed through stop motion animation and silent film production, the fairy tale stories speak of volumes as it mirror the real lives of the characters of the show.I would also like to commend the chemistry of all the actors involved on the show ---especially the leads, Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Yi Ji. Their on-screen partnership blossoms as they perfectly embody their characters on the show."
495,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"1. Sizzling chemistry of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji!
2. Beautifully gothic fairy tale aesthetic.
3. The sweet brotherly relationship.
4. The quirky sense of humor.
5. Perfect casting!
6. Fabulous wardrobe!
7. Best CGI effects!
8. Addicting OSTs!
9. The cinematography shots!
10. Most importantly, this show showcase Mental Health Awareness which is very timely and relevant.You are missing out a masterpiece if you're not yet watching it!"
496,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Not your ordinary romcom korean drama, it's really amazing how they tackle and discuss this kind of issue. Because nowadays its becoming more and more stigma being emotionally unstable. In this novela they delicately discuss every issue and concerns of persons with disability. The acting of actors both Soo Hyun Ssi and Yea Ji are highly appreciated as well as Se Oh Oppa. Every episode is to die for and every episode exceeds your expectations."
497,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the best drama i've seen in the past 4 years. the story is unique and informative in away. it tacles a very sensitive topic but they executed it beautifully. this drama is by far the well written, well directed and well portrayed by the actors. no bad acting at all!!! everyone deserves an awards for the great portryals not to mention the chemistry between the leads, it is on fire. it would be hard to outopced this kind of drama and chemistry."
498,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really love it. Actors are beautiful.
Attractive script. I hope everybody love it too."
499,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Deep, meaning full but also fun and romantic drama."
500,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,One of the best if not the best kdramas I've watched. Beautifully-written. Heartwarming.
501,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Never felt this excitement before when watching Korean drama. This is perfection from the casts, storyline, script, acting and in overall. This is my favorite Kdrama so far! Superb makes my heart flutter."
502,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The animation, cast, and plot are A+ I hope they can continue with more seasons It's amazing how talented these casts are, especially what they are portraying I hope more kdrama will be like this for the reason that it is so addicting Seo ye ji and kim soo hyun's acting skills are superb! so as the other casts"
503,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I can't begin to explain my obsession for this drama. From the cinematography, unique scene transitions, animation to the sound effects is all done so well. It's not just a romance, it's so much more. The title speaks for itself, it's a story about healing but we have to keep in mind no one is perfect or will ever be and it's okay. It's okay to not fit into the ""norm"" that society has etched into us. It's about understanding and accepting. It's everything! It's not heavy but it's not light on the emotions either. It's the perfect balance. You will find yourself laughing so much then the next you find yourself in tears. I am fully invested in the imperfectly-perfect characters."
504,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The storyline, acting, characters, soundtrack, visual aspects, costumes are just amazing.The lead actors are perfectly cast for their roles. The show deals with so many real world aspects and has some real heart wrenching scenes. It will leave you with a sense of nostalgia and a sense of belonging. There are very few shows that come along and make you feel this way. This show will make you laugh, cry, fall in love with the characters. One of the best k dramas to watch in these uncertain times which will tug your heart in all the right ways. A definite 10/10."
505,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It has been a while since I have not watched a spectacular korean drama. I think the last drama that hook me is The World of The Married. But it is different genre. As k drama fans know, kdrama recently introduce many types psychology and mental illness drama but mostly the drama only focus about their love story and the script seems off sometimes until it becomes so typical like any other kdrama. But unlike this drama.. every phrases, scripts all hook me up. The animation, direction, well written, and well acted as well."
506,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama can make you laugh, crying, and falling in love at the same time. Very recommended"
507,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Well written drama.. creative direction and excellent acting!! plus visually stunning actors.. chemistry between the leads is intense.. favourite drama this year so far...
508,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Superb acting, great chemistry, best drama! Sobrang ganda jusko!"
509,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This series is great
everything about it is brilliant"
510,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I have watched ahead of many k dramas in my entire life, and a lot of unique plot of the story and i've encountered a lot of lessons too. However, this fresh k drama gives me chill and goosebumps because of it's flawless storyline and ofcourse it's cinematography whereas the whole cast is very great with their acting skills. This is the only korean drama that has a different plot story regarding about our reality, the whole production idea is very quite impressive and it's not only about the flow of the story but also the lessons you'll get to know here in the drama. This is the new whole package korean drama of 2020 that you'll never forget.I know that we haven't complete to watch 16 episodes yet, but we already knew from the start that this drama is something. My experience towards watching this drama is that unexplainable or i couldn't just explain it through words but i'll try to express its feeling towards watching this. First of all this drama has an interesting storyline and i can say that the main cast has the chemistry because of its uncommon similarities. My experience of this is that, i was hooked when i first heard that it is one of the ""Upcoming drama of 2020"" and then when i read the whole story it gives me goosebumps because of its interesting storyline and ofcouse we all agree that we also want to watch this drama because of ""Kim Soo Hyun"" But actually it doesn't matter because this drama got me hooked. It makes me feel overwhelming every episodes that i've had watch gives me a lot of lessons, i mean every episodes will give you a lot of lessons in life if you're actually sad, bored, broken hearted or any other feelings you have in life it doesn't matter when you start to watch this drama. It also makes me smile like an idiot ofcourse like what i've said it has the most interesting beautiful storyline among the best kdramas that you already watched. As soon as you've start to watch this drama you'll never get bored or tired of watching this endlessly. This is the first korean drama that made me express my feelings through writing a review and also it mades me express my feelings that i've been holding inside for my entire life at last i've no longer to hold any pains inside because i've learned something from this drama. I thank the whole production for releasing this drama, i bet that a lot of people will love this wholeheartedly as well as i do. I am a leukemia patient, trying to live peaceful life while recovering and i found this drama that gaves me a lot of courage and hope. For many people out there if you found yourself needing a help and then this drama will provide everything for you especially the awaiting lessons! And one thing for sure i'm a die hard fan of Kim Soo Hyun! A lot of love coming from philippines! I love the whole cast and production, keep up the goodwork!"
511,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Truly a masterpiece, with wonderfull music, talented actors and a breathtaking storyline. The director of the psychiatric ward Ok said: It's just like when You fart. If You hold it in 99 times and finally let it out, it could kill people. (in ep9)"
512,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The best kdrama , I wouldn't change my mind about it.
I like their acting ; they are varrrry talent .
I like kim soo hyun alot ; he is one of the best korean acters ."
513,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I can relate to this show. I so love this drama :-) congrats KSH
514,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the first time I ever felt compelled to write a review about a drama. I am not very good with words, but I am obsessed with this drama and so invested in both the main and side characters. Beautiful cinematography, script and the acting... WOW! The chemistry between Kim SooHyun vs Seo Yeji vs Oh JungSe is beyond anything I've seen on any Kdramas. KSH & SYJ are beautiful and are just mesmerising to watch. It is refreshing how each episode is a life lesson and has an underlying fairy tale theme which is inter-wovened into the plot and the character's development. Each ep gets better and better. Counting days when the weekend would come, so I can strap myself and engross in the show. This show will make you laugh and cry, laugh cry within minutes. Thank you production team for this drama and for casting such stellar casts. It is truly a healing drama for me."
515,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story is like an onion- it has many layers. Each layer reveals a mystery. It also took on a heavy subject such as autism and managed to cover it in a realistic manner. As I watch the show I feel the struggle for the caregiver and at the same time begin to understand and appreciate the uniqueness of the person with autism. This is brought about with good storytelling and great actors.The story is also about people who have been hurt and they are not doing okay. Just like the title, ""It's okay to NOT be okay."" , it helps the audience appreciate each character with their flaws and their struggles to the point of being endearing.It takes a while for the story to build up and it gets more intriguing as each episodes progresses.Unlike the typical K-drama, the characters are not immediately likeable and thus if one is expecting that- they may be disappointed. However, this show is worth watching because as the onion is being peeled off- we learn to love ourselves and others a little bit more. Also, we get to see the world with different perspectives, 'broadening' our hearts"
516,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't wanna this drama to end, but I'm curious about the ending. This drama is really amazing. They're great actors, really!!"
517,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I love this drama! It's probably going to me my number 1 kdrama!
518,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the best drama I have seen this year, very touch, be sure tissue ready before you watch, it makes you laugh and cry"
519,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Very so much the best of this ""its ok to not be okay"". If you don't watch, you will regret it, because there is a lesson from the contents of the story in it. I like it, sarangheo..."
520,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Almost every interview the cast mentions or describes it as healing drama. As I reached the 9th episode, I can get why they claimed it."
521,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the show that everyone might relate to. Some topics are quite sensitive and hits a spot to anyone watching. This is a proof that anyone might be struggling too. So if you're someone struggling too this might be the kind of show to make you feel better and light hearted.
This is not like any other kdrama. The actors are very convincing and gave great justice to the roles they're portraying. I can't imagine any other actor/actress doing this. I like the on-screen and off-screen chemistry of the lead actors. I commend the writer and director for pulling off this great show."
522,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The most PERFECT drama ever. You must seen from ep 1... the visual is no kidding and also ost totally suitable with every episode
523,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"All about this drama is absolutely incredible. The storyline, visuals, actors and even the soundtracks"
524,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Have watched a lot of Korean Dramas since Prince Hours/Goong and I can say this is not only one of the best but THE BEST drama I've watched. Not your typical romance drama. This also about brotherhood, friendship and makes you face your own mental health. Repeated multiple times each episodes and never get tired of it. It makes you feel a Rollercoaster ride of emotions, it definitely gets to your heart. Storyline, cinematography, the actors, OST and Tim Burton like animation is PERFECTLY GOOD. This drama is one of the best things that happen this year."
525,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"You must watch it! Dark fairy tale mixed with slice of life, romance, and comedy in this drama is epic. You'll find that this drama is not like others. The actors and actress really impressive. They're so good at playing their role. They are also good looking. Worth it!!! I really love this drama, ^^"
526,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is probably a fruitless effort to actually describe how great this drama is, since I absolutely cannot express it in words. However, I want to elucidate that the way mental illness along with the romance and thrill are connected and interwined together has won over my heart. Not to mention that Seo Ye-ji is such a beauty, it's literally a treat to watch her. I love her and I never thought I'd be such a die-hard fan of this woman."
527,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Making a drama or a movie on Mental Illness concept is very complicated and should execute it with very accurate information simultaneously show it to the audiences in a very understandable way.
I think It's Okay To Be Not Okay Kdrama has done a great job by showcasing various mental illnesses and how to cope up with it in a very unique way.
On the whole -
Best Story
Best Cinematography
Best Direction
Best Couple - OMG KSH and SYJ....I Love U guys !! Why don't you guys get married ?!
And Brilliant Acting by all the CastESP. KIM SOO HYUN ! Your Acting Skills are god gifted"
528,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Interesting story, cast and great cinematography, plots and the chemistry of the lead actor
A great night food for everyone
I have watched many K-drama before, but this is the best.I felt an emotional connection to all the characters and have become invested in the story. It bring for me the topic of mental health to the fore front so it very current"
529,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I just really don't have words to describe what i am feeling of this drama. This is a masterpiece, an emotional roller coaster in which you are feeling emotions that you don't know that existed.
I am speechless and so grateful for this drama ""it's okay to not be okay"""
530,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This series is excellent, you should give it a shot. From the story, to actors and even the cinematography I'm not gonna lie, it's 💯 percent perfect!"
531,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I dont know how to express, but im in love with thiss drama, the cast, the story, the background, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KDRAMA. THANKYOU FOR CHOOSE SOOHYUN AND YEJI FOR THE LEAD. THEY HAVE BEST CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. Not just they, but act all the cast is really out of the box, i mean ITS AMAZING DUDE. OH MY GOD. i love ITS OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY, HUUU I WISH SOOHYUN AND YEJI HAVE DRAMA TOGETHER AFTER THIS. THANKYOU FOR MAKING THIS AMAZING KDRAMA."
532,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Literally the BEST Kdrama of the year. I literally sit every weekend refreshing Netflix waiting for new episodes to be released. I do not have enough words to praise this show!!
533,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Even though I'm currently watching until Episode 11th, it's good enough to tell that this shows can make you experience all of the emotions that you can expect from a great show. The cast deliver each of their role on point. The 2 main leads, Moon Young and Gang-tae show us how 2 people who need love and can possibly find love, passionately and wholeheartedly. The brother, Sang-tae, is portrayed as accurately as one good actor can, who has autism and is not willing to lose his only family member but trying to learn to let someone in their closed circle. Must watch!!! You will cry."
534,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the kind of drama we all need!!! After watching so many amazing dramas, this is a drama that makes me feel like my soul is LITERALLY getting healed. Each scene was so impactful and the whole drama was packed with so many different emotions. The way they could keep it light but still suspenseful is just... i have no words. I just love it.
I especially loved the scene where it was showing the female lead letting go of a rock that was in her hand. It showed how having just one person on your side, who loves and protect you, can help you become a better person. It was a breathtaking moment for me, I HAD GOOSEBUMPS!!! It was amazing how it was just a 1 sec shot.
P.s.
I have a question,
this is a drama that is trending worldwide but isn't doing so well in Korea. Why? I'm really curious."
535,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Amazing casts, brilliant story line, and incredible crew"
536,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Since the first episode came out I knew that I will love watching this kdrama.I can wait for the next episode...
537,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Love this drama a lot!! Every saturday and sunday can't wait to watch it!! Good job to the teams!!!
538,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The 13th episode will surely give u chills. At last we get to know about ko mun yeong's mother.
539,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,We've all been going through tough times and it's hard to explain what you really feel until i came across this korean drama. This series is like a person who i could talk to about my childhood traumas and my mental health. This is more than just a kdrama. This has helped me accept my flaws and the horrible experiences i had. This has helped me accept and respect whatever life has for me and deal with it. I'm still in the process of healing bit I can say I have some progress after watching some of the episodes of this show. This is a blessing for me.
540,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I hope this will have Season 2, 3, 4 until 100! 🤣 I super loved this Kdrama! ❤ Complete package and amazing actors specially SEO YEJI and KSH. Best Couple! Chemistry is on fireeee!! 😍 I love youuuuu ate Seo Yea-Ji. 😘from 🇵🇭"
541,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The drama shared with us that fairy tales are not just about the ""and they live happily ever after"" but it's about pains, emotions, struggles, resentments, and trust that has been vanished and we need to pick up the pieces to find ourselves. Psycho But It's Okay is not just an ordinary Korean drama that you wish to eat popcorn while watching but honestly this drama empowers mental health issues. Another thing is the characters are is trying to give us awareness about the people in our surroundings that are mentally challenged and how can we deal with them. The best Korea drama ever"
542,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It is extremely rare for Kdramas to focus on mental health. In this drama, we see people with PTSD, Antisocial Disorder, Autism etc. AND WE LEARN ABOUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY by looking at their experiences and how the actors portray their lines. It is amazing!!!! This drama is something we need to cherish in history! And I am not exaggerating at all. Also, Seo Yea Ji IS THE PERFECT ACTRESS to play Ko MunYeong! I cannot imagine anyone else playing her role. I am happy that she is getting the recognition SHE DESERVES as lead actress. Seo Yea Ji is so committed to her craft, as I read articles of her past projects about how she prepared for her roles. SHOUT OUT to all the amazing cast!!!! The casting crew did an amazing job putting these amazing actors together!!!"
543,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I definitely recommend this drama for you to watch. No spoilers. ;)
544,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I love how this drama is about mental health issues and not a typical romcom drama. After watching this drama I have the courage to face the things that frighten me most and to remember all hurtful memories instead of avoiding them. Thank you IOTNBO! And thank you Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Yea Ji, Oh Jung Se for being superb actors in this drama!This is my favorite quote from The boy who fed on nightmares:
""Remember it all and overcome it. If you don't overcome it, you'll always be a kid whose soul never grows."""
545,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I feel sad for all Korean drama next to this drama (It's Ok to not be Okay) because it has set such a high standard.
546,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This drama is very well made. Its plot, storyline, casts, everything make it perfect. No wonder it will be hit drama. The casts, especially KSH and SYJ, also OJS really did a great job, their chemistry is no joke. Thankyou for making this drama alive. It s sad that the drama will end soon. I will be waiting for their next project and hope KSH and SYJ will be paired again in the future."
547,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Masterpiece is the only word that comes to my mind after watching this series. Amazing screenplay, brilliant story, and perfect actors. Seo Ye-Ji is par excellence. The message conveyed by this show is going to resonate for a long long time!"
548,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is only the second k-drama that I am watching.before this drama,I only watched my love from the star which blew my mind and instantly made me fall in love with Kim Soo hyun and k-drama.Then I searched to only find that most of the Korean dramas are like this same genre.so I was searching for something new and when I start watching this drama, I find that it is something new addition to Korean dramas..not that typical rom-coms.its a unique and emotional journey of love and relationship.this realistic portrait of relationship made me fall in love with this drama"
549,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Literally a masterpiece. There's so much more than the visuals of main character. But the way this drama explain how life works through the fairy tale is just.. so pure. You don't even have to think of anything while watching it, the drama will heal you."
550,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It's a human healing drama. I can even learn about mental illness. Moreover every episode covered in a fairy tail that makes me curious what's fairy tail will pop up each on the next episodes. Still can't believe it will be end up soon 😭 but 💙💙💙💙💙✨
551,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Salute to all of you (casts and crews). This story is really a human healing drama.
552,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Kdramas are not what i usually watch but this one is very worth the watch. The chemistry between Kim so hyun and Seo ji is outta this world. I higly recommend. Even if this genre wouldnt be your ideal thing to watch, I guarantee that you will like !"
553,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I've been watching everyweek and so far it never waste my time and it will make you sit at the edge of your seat every episode.. One of the best kdrama I watch. Combination of drama and romance. Thumbs up to the actors of the show. Also the director and the writer!! Superb!!
554,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The writer is a genius, lots of meaningful quotes, the acting of the players, especially Seo Yea Ji is amazing .. especially for episode 14 I think she worked really hard and deserves an award. Don't forget Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se, this trio is the best .. as a healing drama, this drama has made me learn and have a new perspective on life .."
555,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This isn't your typical romcom Korean drama. Watch with an open mind cause this show touches the issue of mental illness. The characters may seem confusing and even toxic at first but if you continue to watch, you'll understand why they are the way they are. Each character develops in their own unique ways throughout this show so pay attention to that. What I personally love most about this show is the powerful chemistry of the cast. It feels natural. I'm hoping there's a second season. Absolutely love this show, it may very well be my favorite Korean Drama and I've watched countless of them. Thank you for this beautifully written and portrayed masterpiece!"
556,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's a perfect story. Every detail is appreciate from the writer, director, profs, actors, music,and a lot more. I gained knowledge and it give inspiration this hard times. Is a stunning artwork! You must watched! Everything for me is perfect I always rewatching and never get bored. I always have fun because of this kdrama especially to character ko Mun-yeong, actor seo ye ji is super talented actor.

557,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the best drama i have ever watch! This drama was different with another drama! This drama give us many moral value , very healing and very recommended! i still can't believe that the drama will end in this week .. i hope there's a second season on this drama with the same casts :))))"
558,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"From the script writing to the actors, this kdrama is just a masterpiece. It touches on mental health in a way that kdrama don't. The reality of mental health is depicted and often is really represented not just giving us a happy ending to some of the patients stories. From happiness to sorrow to anger, this kdrama is an emotional rollercoaster but it is amazing"
559,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story of a children's storybook writer with ASPD, an older brother with autism and his selfless caretaker younger brother. Yet the one who seems the most normal is the most broken and needs the most healing. A rollercoaster journey of emotions that provides a different insight to life for all three of them. This drama undertakes a journey of how each of them learns to find happiness, each in their own ways but each with the help of each other."
560,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"By far this is the most beautiful Kdrama I've watched that despite of the limitations due to covid the production was able to deliver awesome shots. Cinematography is impeccable. The 2 leads act as if they were really made each other. So much to learn even the side stories. Truthfully, this is a human healing drama... superb craftsmanship!!!"
561,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"From the title, Itself ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" just hit the theme of the drama to be a 'healing'. This is the Best drama I watched so far. It's not about fantasy or heavy drama or a funny story but it's about how we heal with the help of others, and to help ourselves. The way how they slap the real problem in this society, just hit me, us, harshly. We connect to the drama that tells the world on what we feel, emptiness, loneliness, & abandonment. Episode 4 hit me differently when Moon-Young said ""You also won't understand me until you die."" because Gang-Tae said her to first because all his bottle up of feelings just burst. It's just no matter what status or situation you are we are still different. If you think life is hard for you to compare to others, you don't know their story, you might know the feeling & pain but we are different physically, emotionally & mentally. Don't compare your situation to others. Yours is yours, mine is mine, every one has different struggles.I'm telling you pal, you won't regret watching this drama. Best Storyline, Best Cinematography, Best Production, Best OST, Best Couple, Best Cast & Best Ending."
562,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is for me the best KDRAMA i have ever watched. Its a LOVE story in every sense of the word. It did not only show romantic love but also familial love, love for others especially for those people who need it the most. Every episode tackle an issue and gives light to it that melts or breaks your heart. Worth every time you spend watching them. Kim Soo-Hyun and Seo Ye-Ji's visuals are just a bonus. Kudos to all staff and crew for making such an incredible piece of art!"
563,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Since the beginning of this drama, I have learned so much about mental health and life in general. I was very short-tempered before this drama and now I learned to count to 3 before exploding 😂. This dramas was filled with SO MANY quotes that pertained to my life and I can say that it made me a better person. I never would have believed a kdrama could give me a different outlook on life until this one. If you are contemplating if you should watch it, I DEFINITELY suggest you do and take in what they are trying to say about life. Also, WHAT AN AMAZING CASTING THE DIRECTOR DID BECAUSE IT WAS PHENOMENAL ACTING FROM EVERYONE."

Kudos to the team for such magical creation."
567,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I thought it was the best drama i've ever watched. The plot, MUA, wardrobe, message in this drama greatly presented to the viewers.But i still wondering about some mysteries that how Moon Young's mother remain alive after her dad sink her to the lake and when she says ""I will take care of my son"" before she killed Sang Tae's mother. Any thoughts?"
568,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,It was such a healing drama...the character building was amazing...thanks for this beautiful journey....
569,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"By far one of the best K-drama I've seen. Kudos to Netflix for producing this masterpiece. Everything from the story line, the actors, sound tracks, costume - just wonderful. This drama will make you fall in love with the characters and side characters. Each character development is smooth and we'll thought of (not rushed like in some K-dramas where you can tell the only reason why certain things are happening is because it's near the end of the series/season).Truly entertaining, heart warming and an all around brilliant show."

I myself learned more about the importance of having the warmth in life, how to love myself more, how to be more patient in a stressful situations, how to deal with certain people and how to forgive people, how to think twice before action and most importantly all the humans are equal, disability or Sickness doesn't separate people into different categories, after all we all are human... Each individual is weak, So we lean on each other... no one can live alone....Such a beautiful ending, outstanding acting, all the dialogues, scenes are delivered perfectly... simply amazing!! This story will always be close to my heart...When the things are hard in life, I'll never give up, I'll start again because it's okay to not be okay."

576,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I know we were just halfway of the year but for me this is already the best drama of 2020. When the lead actor said that we will laugh, cry, laugh, cry 'cause of this drama, he didn't lie. I'm just glad this show was made, jinjja jinjja ""human healing drama""!"
577,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,This drama would be our best K-Drama of the year. It elucidates mental health. The visuals are impressive. Not your typical ROM-COM dramas. This drama is everything you need (Perfection).

580,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Am pretty old for this.However I've registered this accnt.for IMDB just to rate this Drama. & this Drama is Unique & portrayed well. As I would rather say that ""I have an elder Brother who's been A Psychiatrict patient for more than 35yrs. & it's not because he wanted to,' its because he could not over come it"". Anyway , Kudos to all the Cast specially The Trio ( Seo Yea Ji,Kim Soo Hyun , Oh Jung Se)who made the whole story meaningful. Its A package & Beyond Expectation!👍👍👍. CONGRATS HOPE TO SEE THIS DRAMA IN UPCOMING AWARDS."

584,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I've seen a lot of kdramas before and this one is by far the best. Unique female lead character which is well portrayed by Seo Yeji, and I like how strong her personality is. It's not your your usual kdrama female lead. Kim Soo Hyun is as usual, his over the top acting, he wouldn't have had those daesang awards for nothing. Every emotion can also be seen in his eyes, which is sooo amazing. Actually all the three of them (SYJ, KSH, OJS).. I was laughing, crying, then laughing again.. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions. And I love how the tables have turned at the last episode hahaha, that was epic.. I hope KSH and SYJ will be paired again in the future which is impossible since they change partners in every project they do.. IT'S A MUST WATCH KDRAMA. YOU WILL NOT REGRET WATCHING IT."
585,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The best kdrama I've watched so far. It's message and the topic about mental illness makes it much more worth it to watch!! Highly recommended!

587,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Best actress and actor. Without Ko Mun-young , Moon Gang-tae can't perform perfectly! It's a perfect pairing! The chemistry of them in the drama is just awesome. Every part of their acting and dialogues is worth watching. And Sang-tae's exceptional performance in every episodes, he is so good. Not forgetting all the other actors and actresses in this drama, and especially the director Park Shin-woo and writer Jo Yong. All of you will be recognised for your hard work and efforts!I am sure this healing drama touched all our hearts and we want to see more of Seo Yea-ji and Kim Soo-hyun! Also Oh Jung-se! We want more of this!Pls sell your merchandises! (If can, even the books with Kor and English words)A fan from Msia."
588,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"If there is 1 notable good thing that happened this 2020, it is this drama release! It surprised and healed me beyond expectations and measures. I thought everything about this year is heaviness and tears, but I was wrong. And in my 20 years of watching Korean series, I can confidently say that this is one of the best - from the offbeat actors, to the cinematography, screenplay and soundtrack. Not everything is perfect but if you're into character-driven story, this is going to take you to another level if watching!"

You will definitely fall in love with them."
591,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"First of all,I watched this k-drama without expectations.But when the two episodes were on air i decided to watch it .So the introduction of the story with creepy animations wow hooked me inmediately .The three characters whose performance was amazing , made me fall in love with the story.The meaningful fairy tales were a plus to love the whole K-drama.As the actors said it's a healing drama which people could feel identified by the story.I cried many times,sometimes i felt like ko Moung young and sometimes like Moon Gang tae .In addition,the excellent performance of Oh Yung Se is undeniable.But i feel identified more with Moon Gang tae since he's ordinary like many of us that apparently we are okay but in reality we hide our emotions ,we're suffering and struggling with our past demons.Finally,the edition,OST and the strong chemistry between the protagonists made this show my favorite .So that's why this k-drama deserves everything in the world .If you are not hooked with the story, you can try to watch the show later beacuse i think a k-drama has its magic at the right moment.When you're suffering what the protagonists went through ,that's the right time to watch this amazing show .Definitely you must watch it!!👏👏👏👏❤🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋"
592,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I've watched a lot of Korean dramas and this is by far the one that hit me hard right through my heart. I can relate to Moon Gang Tae a lot. Everyone deserves a standing ovation if it was a theatre play. Every aspect of the drama from cinematography, animation (can i just say that the animation was like from a Tim Burton movie), story, ost, lead character's chemistry, award-winning acting from the casts, everything in it deserves a recognition. i love it so much and i'm rewatching it every now and then."

612,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's ok to not be ok is a HEALING DRAMA, It is not even asking us to like the characters. It is not asking us to approve of their actions. The most it is asking is for us to push the limits of our empathy, so we can understand where these characters are coming from.At first you may not like attitude/action of main lead(specially the female lead),I put myself to understand these character why they became like that, I am curious and I am not going to put the blame on one character to another.Story might be simple, but the acting really incredible!!kudos to the all cast and production of these drama.Overall, this drama really has placed in my heart, it hits me a lot maybe because we can be all like Gang-tae, Sang-tae, and Munyeong in real life. 100/10"

637,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Master piece.
Kim soo hyun's acting is amazing
Storyline is so good
Moon young beautiful
Sang tae cool"
638,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I rarely watch on-going dramas but this drama is too good from the first episode.
really recommend everyone to watch.
all the casts are perfect- Oh Jung Se really potrayed Sang Tae well that it makes me think he really have an autism irl haha
Seo Yeaji no doubt, been following her for so long and she did very well potraying mun yeong. you can feel all the pain through her eyes. she cried, i cried. bascially, they cried, i cried.
Kim soo hyun, this is the best character of him, for me. This is the most matured character he played and i really love kang tae.plot wise, kuddos! seriously, worth watching and worth my 10 stars!!"
639,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the best Korean Drama I've ever watched. The atmosphere, the soundtrack, the essence it's unmatchable. You can basically call it a 'Dark Fairy Tail'
Now it may feel a little bit stretched out around the 9th and 10th episodes, but that's okay. And the minor antagonist doesn't pack any punch at all. The performances are great, not the best. The cinematography, one of the best you'll see in a South Korean show. But the traumatic memories and them being healed throughout the show is just mesmerising. To put my rating into a context, Breaking Bad is a 8.9/10 for me, so you'd know where it actually stands. But then again, it's just my opinion yours must be different. But I hope it helped."
640,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't have any word to describe Greatness of this series
I laughed, thrilled, scared, surprised and cried too.
After completing 16 episodes the hangover of this series the experience of this series will stay for long time.
A MUST WATCH SERIES for everyone
Thank you"
641,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"In the beginning it was bit scary. And then i become intrigued of the story of the writer and so with the caregiver. Their story resembles alot in real life situation. I cant find the answer to my questions in real life, their story can give you a boost and hint. Thumbs up. I had watched them twice in a row. 😂😜👏"
642,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,My own opinion this is the best kdrama i have ever watched for this year... or for the whole decade
643,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Best drama for me next to The Queen's Gambit :) love the plot, cinematography, the actors and their acting are superb!"
644,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Story is very nice i love the character of ko moon young.
645,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Of all dramas i have watched so far, this tops the list for now. All the actors including the side actors and not only the main actors have completely justified their roles. The way of illustrating emotions through books was beautifully shown. A must watch! Lot's of love to the team for creating a master piece!!!"
646,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This was the first kdrama i watched and i was completely pleased. The story and the characters were written and portrayed so well, and all the cast members had the best chemistry so it was amazing and i got really attached to it. And i have been craving a second season ever since. 1 is not enough."
647,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It reminds me of wizard of oz. The OST music, lighting, way it's filmed, acting, character development was superb. The topic of unrequited love, jealously, anger, resentment, loneliness, lost of love ones, ptsd, guilt and a bunch of other emotions. The actors perfected portray the characters."
648,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Love this drama a lot since the first episode. Love for the characters Ko Moon Young, Moon Gang Tae, and Moon Sang Tae, our three main leads. Love the romance side, also love the sibling's side."
649,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I was looking for something a bit different and stumbled across this. I'd heard about it but had no idea it was a Korean title so ended up being my introduction to Korean TV and really, the review title sums it up, 'just wow'. This was an emotional rollercoaster from episode 1 right through to the very end, the characters really draw you in and make you part of their journey from being so well scripted and well acted by all.Thank you to all involved in this production."
650,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Loved it , it will take you to a tour with amazing direction and acting."
651,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This was my first time watching a Korean drama and I have to say I am very glad I did. The cinematography is simply stunning, and the parts were all played very well. Definitely worth a watch."
652,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,LOVE THIS DRAMA OMG😭👍 love Gang Tae and Munyeong
653,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Each character is unique and clever. The acting is superb especially Kim soo hyun portray moon gang tae character is amazing. This drama is funny yet heartbreaking, I also cried and laughed at every episode. Overall, this drama is worth watching."
654,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Wow. What an outstanding drama, and one I am so so sad to have finished. The acting, the music, the story, the atmosphere - everything just worked so well, and it quickly became one of those 'ach we'll just squeeze in one more episode' shows that my partner and I watch (despite each episode being roughly 1 hour 20!). I ended up getting so attached to each character, and their individual stories, and thought that the way this programme handled mental health was so beautifully done. The acting was excellent from all, but especially from the actor who played Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) - his acting was nothing short of phenomenal. I only wish I was watching this magical piece of art for the first time again."
655,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Beautifully written, the actors were great, the storyline was excellent. I loved the unique take it had on fairy tale stories. It was a masterpiece loved it as much as kill me Heal me"
656,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I do not know how to describe my feeling now, i just wish the story will never end. Love the couple and the reserve characteristic for both the main role. Feeling so unacceptable for the drama has already ended that quick. (sob)(sob)"
657,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I love this show Is Have not watched something like this before.... Misterious... Funny... Awesome...
658,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Best korean drama ... I have ever seen...I love it
659,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I'm not a K-drama fan, and it's certainly not a typical K-drama. The drama captured me from the very first episode, and I started to wonder the stories of each character. Each character is unique in their own way but realistic at the same time. It's really a healing drama, while the characters are trying to heal themselves by taking power from each other, I felt like their journey was also healing me with its warmth. Besides the great plot, acting is just outstanding. I fell in love with Seo Yea Ji's acting, so pure and natural. She reflects Ko Moon Young's character development so well and she shines through the whole drama like a queen. Kim Soo Hyun is amazing too, and his chemistry with Seo Yea Ji is just off the charts. I haven't watched such a good couple for a long time. Oh Jung Se's acting is awesome too. In addition to all, I loved the cinematography, so neat and elegant. And lastly, it gives really good messages with the its little stories and dialogues are quite well written. OST is great too! I strongly recommend."
660,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Love it so much this show got me back into kdrama its so different just my typeee.
661,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"A perfect show with everything perfect. Whether it's acting or cinematography or storyline, the show has always gave us a perfect episode. The ending was soo satisfying. I strongly recommend the show to those people who want to watch something extraordinary, in its own way."
662,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is one of my favourite series! One of the best Korean series that I would recommend.I honestly watch this series because Seo Yeji or Ko Munyoung in this series. I really love her cute face and her deep voice. I hoped she would get more main role in series. And yes!! She got a very nice one.Since they got very famous actors and actress, I really expect it to be fun. The trailer is interesting enough to catch me. I decided to watch it by not wait until the series end. I usually watch all episodes at once. But this series made me waiting for the new episode every week.I didn't expect such a good art work. The footages and montages are really wow for me. Creative team of this series have done a very good job. First few episodes really catch me with good editing. Farther episodes, I focused on the plots that getting more intense. The opening animation is very nice. I just love it. I also like some songs in this series.The characters of Mun Sungtae, Mun Kangtae, and Ko Munyoung are very interesting and new for me. I like the story behide their characters. I really pride Mun Sangtae acting skills. He killed it!The plot is very interesting for me. I want to know more and more about their story. I like many Ko Munyoung 's books. All drawing in Ko Munyoung books is nice and have characters. I want to follow the artist of that drawing. The story she wrote have hidden meaning and moral that really touched me.This series is quite drama but they also have funny parts and romantic parts. The funny parts are real fun. That is my vibes. They also got very nice costumes for all characters. The costumes support the characters really well. Ko Munyoung make up is very suit her. It was so great.For someone who haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend this series if you usually like Korean series."

681,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I personally believe that the drama could have shown the more elaborate relationship between Ko-Mun-Yuong and her father. I felt the storyline of the lead actor and actress is 50% complete because I felt they didn't actually recovered from past and their process of healing is not complete. I was expecting atleast 2 -3 more episodes to complete the drama. Moreover, they hid the fact that Sang-Tae is now not interested in knowing who was that woman actually who killed his mother.Therefore, through this platform, I want to request the writer and the production team to please release the 2nd season to unveil the above, explain what happened to the actress's childhood after surviving from her father, how will she see her father now; how will actor, his big brother and actress start to socialize with other people (because the most important part of healing process of any mentally challenged person is the ability to communicate with the world BOLDLY) ,what will happen to mother-daughter relation, how will Gang-Tae will proceed to his future life and guide and mentor his beloved to face the world. 2 more things, will ko-mun-yeoung EXPLAIN WHAT IS A 'FAMILY' and CAN SHE ADMIT THAT SHE SUFFERED FROM ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER?Overall, the drama was good, but I will cut 2 stars for incomplete father-daughter relation, some elements which led significant deviation from the drama and inability to deliver some key elements of human values.PLEASE MAY WRITER CONSIDER THIS COMMENT."
682,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Such a beautiful romantic mesmeric movie i have ever seen.
683,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It's wonderful drama.With very good actors and actresses
This drama have many psychological lessons

has got mystery,romance,comedy ,critics,and the realities of life.......just beautiful and realistic........No overdramatic scenes......"
685,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Must Watch Series literally this series was healing your body 🖤🖤 Best 2020 Series
This My First K drama Series and now i am waiting for Season 2. Best Storyline Best Romance."
686,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Directions of this story was excellent and I was never bored for see this series yes I was late but believe it was an epic love story . This story lead role characters doing there work from their heart and this is my first review ever . But believe me I'm very happy that I watched it .
687,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"As someone with a sister with a mental disability similar to Sang-Tae's, I was very pleasantly surprised at the different personality traits they got spot on for the character. It feels like the actor and writer really did their homework, before creating this character. Things like him watching the same thing on tv to the point of memorizing every line, or his fixation on age, and what it means to be an older brother, or younger brother. These are traits that my sister have as well, which made the character very relatable to me.And these small details made every emotional scene with or about them, so much more impactful for me. I shed at least one tear (often more) to almost every episode.The two main leads also did a fantastic job throughout the whole series, with everything from the humor, to the romance, and to the emotional scenes. I had a hard time seeing how they would make Go Moon Young likable enough for a lead female in a drama, but after a few episodes, we got to see past her cold exterior, and saw her more vulnerable side.With Moon Gang-Tae, I felt he was lacking in variety when it came to facial expressions in the beginning, but the actor still nailed it everytime it really mattered. The character has learned to put on a fake smile, to not worry his brother, but when Gang-Tae was genuinly happy, it was easy to see because a much more genuine smile appeared on his face. So what I at first thought was a lack in variety, was him portraying the fake emotions.The story felt a bit drawn out near the end, and I honestly believe the whole series could have been an episode shorter, if the pacing had been a bit better throughout the whole series.Some side characters were pretty good, and some I weren't as fond of, but for the most parts, I enjoyed their side stories as well.I give it a 9/10, But I also realize I might have a slightly biased view because of my personal experiances. And I am relatively new to K-Dramas, and dramas in general, so I don't have much to compare it to. So take my review with a grain of salt, like any other review ;)"
688,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Amazing story and amazing acting this drama can give you little joy with happiness and tears in your eyes I would just like to say that this webseries forced me to watch the korean drama.i am obsessed with k-drama now.
689,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the worst programme I have ever seen, it's ridiculous. Unfortunately it does nothing to advance or educate the masses on mental health. The main character Ko Moon Young was awful. She had no redeeming features whatsoever and behaved appallingly. She was a control freak and all her characteristics were never addressed. As long as she got what she wanted.... As for Moon Gang-tae, he appeared to enjoy being some kind of victim and allowing himself to be used and abused. How this programme was ever made is a mystery. Truly awful and a wasted opportunity to show some kind of understanding of mental health issues."
690,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I ended up binge watching this in one weekend. The chemistry between Seo YeJi and Kim Soo Hyun seemed so natural and you hope they find love with each other. Their lives along was Oh Jeong Se was intertwined with terror, heartbreak and loss of a childhood. Superb acting along with beautiful scenery kept the viewer entertained throughout the series. Will definitely be watching it a few times.
Hope there is a part 2!"
691,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I like Moon brothers characters. Cz its really hard to have a Autism Family member. All the members suffer . Their character Portrait Very well, nd their ending was good. They start living with a new perspective. But what about our female protagonist. She remain still same."
692,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Agar Aapko Ji bharke Rona hai to ye series aapko andar se rulyegi. Isme Family drama hai,Jo aapko Ek accha experience degi. Sabhi Character se aap 1st episode se Jud jaoge."
693,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I got so attached :(( I love everything !! , the osts , the storyline , the life lessons , the acting and etc . It was such a comforting drama ^_^ . It's okay to not be okay y'all !! :**"
694,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Many users find the series healing, and I can see ways that it heals. I would like to sing praise for the hospital and the wonderful philosophy of its so called 'quack"" director -- which, in themselves, are healing to viewers.One thing this series had that I like in Kdramas generally is portrayal of camaraderie among its characters, including secondary characters. Through good dialogue and often humor Kdramas entertain and also illuminate the personalities of the characters."
695,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I really enjoyed this series, seen all in one go.Acting at the highest levels, especially the autistic brother! Magnificent.Seo Ye Ji very good actress that I will follow from now on, I like her style too much and also her voice.The themes covered by this series are very touching and interesting, moreover the dark atmospheres combined with the cartoons have a fairytale-like feel."
696,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,Such a wonderful series. Artistic and emotional and surprising! Addictive!!
697,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I watched around 200+ korean dramas and i'm so amazed by this drama. Excellent cinematography, editing, animation, directing, writing and most of all acting! The performances of the actors are one of the bests i've seen in a kdrama. Kim Soo Hyun, deserves to be the highest paid actor in south korea with many acting awards for the past 10 years of his career! (baeksang best actor and 4 Daesang awards)"
698,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I've never written a review before, and I have watched so many titles that I haven't even finished rating them yet. But this series is so unique that I had to put it in writing just to help myself remember how it felt the first time I saw it.Everything about this series is enchanting. The story, the characters, the script, the set, their clothes, the music, everything. Not an episode passed by without crying my eyes out, some happy tears, some sad. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I will let you experience it on your own. Please clear up your mind when watching it and embrace the possibility that it's always okay not to be okay. Do not be embarrassed to show your feelings, take off your mask and feel everything at once or nothing at all.This series will forever hold a place in my heart and I promise to myself that every time I feel separated from the world I will re-watch it. Hopefully I will forget everything about it so I can watch it all over again. Enjoy!"
699,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The storyline is so engaging. You'll love the world created in this series. You are definitely gonnaove the whole cast. A must watch. Wish it never ended.

705,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show is one of the greatest shows i have ever seen.It is one of those shows that after you watched it, you wish you had amnesia so you could watch it as the first time once again.It mixes comedy and romance with intriguing and unique characters, and it also blend some elements of storytelling in a very unique way.
Which really gets you hooked.
The first episode is used as a complete setup for the entire series and characters, which is very risky but it certainly paid off.
The chemistry between the cast is so intense that it really hooks you right in.
The script is magnificent and the music fits perfectly to every scene.
If you like a good story and being emotionally grabbed, this series wont disappoint in the slightest!!A clear 10/10 from me!"
706,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,And I didn't even forward 10 sec of any episode and it is my first korean drama
707,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"English is not my first language but I'm trying to put into words the amazing kdrama this is, it made me feel a lot of emotions and empathize with the characters, it's the best kdrama i've watched this 2020, Netflix did great with this, i'm grateful i started watching IOTNBO, the ost, the actors, storyline, everything's perfect."

Beautiful from every aspect-- every angle, I can't find any faulty even its already half episodes. Appreciate for all the team!"
715,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I'm not an expert in K-dramas but I've watched a decent number of dramas. ""Psycho But It's Okay"" has to be my favorite. The chemistry between the leads and the brilliant ideas in every episode amazes me every time. and most importantly, they educate the viewers about mental illnesses and it's normal for people to be this way, hence the name of the drama. I totally recommend watching it if you haven't already done."
716,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,The English OSTs in the drama are so good. Makes the drama even more unique. The adaptation of the fairytales are done so nicely. And Seo YeJi did a marvelous job. She made ne almost tear up many times

719,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I hardly give any reviews or should I say close to none at all. I have watched gazillion kdramas and to be honest it's very hard for one to penetrate in my top 10 list and this just barged right into my top 5. The narrative, the score, the cinematography, the casting, the plot and the direction, everything was flawless. The actors brought out the role of their characters so well, the score gave the perfect feel during the moments and the fairytale graphic was an ingenious idea that made me emersed into the story that it felt like a vivid dream. This is not just a drama, it's an experience that I'm glad I did. It's a slice of life and I honestly found place in some beautiful scripted dialogues and especially the name itself couldn't have been more apt for this drama. It's okay, to not be okay."
720,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"First of all I love love the main actor Kim Soo Hyun because he is just beautiful!! But he's a great actor since I've seen him on ""The Moon Embracing the Sun"", ""My Love from Another Star."" And seeing him made a cameo on Hotel de Luna and Crash Landon on You, I just couldn't wait for this series!!!
And I must say this one definitely doesn't disappoint at all!!! His chemistry with Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se just phenomenal!!
The story just keep on your seat and keep you wanting more. It fills with all the right elements. Enjoy!!!"
721,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I love this mix emotion you feel.. Great job the the cast and crew.. Director and scriptwriter good job.. Excellent!!!!
722,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Sorry I am help less because. No words to describe
Ever elements of life included,
It's a master piece, like a recipes with 100 spices but all in perfect %."
723,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"It took me a few episodes to be gripped but now I am obsessed and have watched them all again. Stunning acting - all of them, especially Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se.

724,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Absolutely LOVING this drama. Everything from the writing to directing and actors/acting, Just amazing. By the way just found out it ranked No. 6 in Neflix world TV drama Jul13. Hope more people can watch this drama. Best KDrama so far this year."
725,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,For almost 10 years of watching kdrama this one is my top on my bucket list.amazing
726,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Best k drama
Wouldn't change a thing about my review ."
727,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't know how i can explain it, but this is best Korean drama ever. You know that story line, story idea is so interesting and anti mainstream. In every episode we get sad, happy, scared, curious, cuteness and many more. The actor and actress also so good. Oh god wish Saturday came so fast. Okey bye, i hope this drama also the actor get achievements"
728,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"What can I say? I am in awe!!! The first episode alone got my jaw dropping! Up to the ending, I am left speechless as to how the story remain true to its uniqueness. This drama is one of the best story written out there, and in my opinion one of the best that I have watched not only for kdrama but I would say for movies and drama series in general. This is a stand out, not your typical clichè romance comedy. Every episodes with title adapted from fairy tale stories is so unique, offer relatable life learning experience and will leave the audience with lots of quotes to ponder. To tackle mental issues and show perspective from those suffering from it was done beautifully. And to mix it with a unique love story between three main characters is something you don't see often. It is dark, mysterious, sweet, serious, romantic, comedic, healing with touch of fairy tale lovestory that is so rare and refreshing to watch. I cried, laughed, resented, giggled, and made a lot of realization. Great script, wonderful story telling, and the casts are simply amazing. The chemistry between Seo Yea-ji and Kim So Hyun is off the charts! Seo Yea-ji was born for this role. She nailed it exceptionally at each episodes as a beautiful be""witched"" fairy tale author with anti-social personality disorder but at the same time you will be moved by her emotional vulnerability, child-like attitude as her healing progresses. Kim So Hyun as always is amazing and very effective in his role as a caregiver who gave so much sacrifices for his brother, look so strong and emotionally stable from the outside but finds himself weak and still lacking in so many aspects as he thought otherwise. He chose the right story as a comeback drama series. Oh Jung-se, as I have heard is one great actor in Korea and he has proven effortlessly in this story as a 35 yr old male with autism. Their journeys to emotional healing is so touching and will leave you with feeling of sadness, happiness, joy, and the realization of what life brings us unexpectedly. Everything in this drama series is beautiful. Cinematography is exceptional, the intro at the beginning of each episodes is not to be skipped, overall the animation and visuals is so stunning, and the OST is to die for! This is a drama series worth rewatching a thousand times to constantly remind us not to judge and that everyone has a back story. To summed up, It's Okay To Not Be Okay is just simply WOW!!!"
729,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,One of the best masterpiece. Not even missed a single moment of seeing it. Its very interesting story. Great acting by lead roles as well as support roles persons. One of the best i ever seen .
730,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This story is one that will stay with me forever. The fairytale themes made the atmosphere magically beautiful, the main couple has amazing chemistry, the actors deserve all the awards for their amazing performances, the OST is incredible, everything is just perfect.It's easily my favorite K-drama of all time. Everyone should watch this :)"
731,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This was my first Korean Drama, gotta say this show is pretty amazing!!!"
732,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Combining fairy tale in the real life, the cinematography is so satisfying. I've been watching kdrama for more than 10yrs and this is the best I've ever watch. Try this"
733,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Excelent story.. Excelent actors. Excelent photography and quality
Every character has a special and deep story to tell us...and all of them are great
This is one of the best Kdramas y've ever seen"
734,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This master piece will change your life.
You will get really motivated if your life is not going in the way u want.You will become different."
735,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"The story revolves around a hard-working man named Kang Tae whose older brother has autism, and Kang Tae alone has to solve his older brother's problems and sufferings, and at the same time make a living.All the problems, in addition to the memory of the murder of a mother who makes her brother nervous, go hand in hand so that Kang Tae's character dedicates his whole life to his only property, his brother.In this muon, Kang Tae meets the beloved writer of his brother, Kang Muyung, who is a bold, reckless woman with strange and exaggerated thoughts and exaggeration.In the first place, the strange relationship between Kang Tae and Muyung comes to the viewer's eyes, and this is where the story begins. Muyong is looking to take over Kang Tae because Kang Tae, unlike other men, stands in front of him and is an interesting creature for Muyong .Screenplay process:The story begins with a fantasy theme. Storytelling whose stories are contrary to the usual narrative process. Old myths such as Cinderella and Snow White and all the old classic stories that have long conveyed a message of goodness and love to the reader, are completely questioned. He looks at them from another angle, and it is interesting that the viewer realizes that yes, he can look at the stories from both positive and negative points, and we ask ourselves really why he has ever looked at this story from this aspect. We did not look, and basically, why is this instrumental and clichéd look repeated from the past to the present?The words that Muyung says in all honesty and sincerity are scary for the viewer. Because the beautiful world changes and changes our childhood dreams.Kang Tae, on the other hand, is a man who constantly runs away from Muyung because he has his brother's problem. His life is hard enough and he gets involved with Muyong and the past that is hard in his mind and for this reason he starts to run away, but Muyong knows Kang Tae is an interesting creature that he wants to get to tempt him. To control his unbridled thoughts and minds.Character buildingA series in every sense of the word. Because the characters had exactly all the details and points they should have. Muyong has a scary past and his father intended to kill him as a child. On the other hand, he saw the murder of his mother and lived in a strange place and strange thoughts were transmitted to him and made him a strange unrestrained woman. Someone who only pursues his childish desires. Kang ta is one of these desires.Unlike Muyung, Kang Tae is a very simple man who even has repetitive clothes that do not fit him at all and only involve his brother's problems.On the other hand, we have the autistic character of Kang Tae's brother, a man who witnessed the murder of his mother as a child, and this has caused him to show signs of panic and nervous movements by seeing signs.These three main characters guide the story well.positive pointsI think it was one of the brainstorming stories that came out recently. I liked the idea behind the story. Two different characters, like two sides of the same coin, who unfortunately both had some kind of mental and subcutaneous problems, and these problems had made their lives difficult.Muyung is an unbridled girl who was raised as a child with high self-confidence. Being superior and on the other hand being obedient to her mother had made a strange potion that this character appeared every time with an accident. This woman has an exaggerated and special behavior from head to toe. That all signs of inner personality. Well done to the author. At the beginning of the story, I thought that the director had just given Cinderella-like clothes and strange make-up and haircuts to Muyong to show her beauty, but the further I went, the more I realized the director's trick. The director has shown high self-confidence and lack of attention to Muyong. On the other hand, because he did not like her as a child, he does not have normal social behavior. Do not worry about the discomfort of those around you and be frank. And Jon, a mother with a mental illness, had strange thoughts surrounding him. Interestingly, this character has used this weakness and now he has become famous and rich. Now, in the midst of all this, he is facing Kang Tae.Kang Tae was also a man who grew up with a bitter reality as a child. ""You were born to take care of your brother."" And this case has involved Katg Teh all his life and made him a very self-sacrificing man who, if he wants to take a step away from this sacrifice, will suffer a pang of conscience. And this character is now acquainted with Muyong.Screenplay process:The story had good skeleton and skeleton and had a good theme and plot. The part where the author creates stories as Muyung was very interesting to me. Different from all the children's stories I have ever read. Each had a different message, and these messages were clearly visible in the text of the story.Like the story of a mother who does all the work for her child and when she asks the child to walk and do something, she sees that the child has neither hands nor feet. This was one of the most meaningful stories I have ever read. The concept of beauty means that we must allow children to explore the world on their own.Or the story of a child who ate meat. The first mother starts giving meat to the animals of the village and sacrifices her hands and feet when there is nothing left. But he sees that the child only wanted a warmth of love from his mother.Congratulations to the author on the stories being extremely amazing. A concept from Muyong's past life in which his mother played a major role.The illustration space was very rough. That cursed castle with that basement or sanatorium is not a problem. Well, it has a good reference to the name of the story.I also liked the humor of the work, despite the fact that it has sharp and bitter parts, but it had interesting humor, such as Kang wearing a suit and Muyung making him jealousThe actors were extremely good at portraying the story very well. Especially Kang Tae's brother, who played the role of an autistic man well.The music of the work, except for one OST, I liked the rest of the design and it sounded goodExcellent directing and editing. I loved editing the work immensely.The episodes that were cut were attractive to the viewer or the combination of animation with the story gave an imaginative and dreamy atmosphere to the story space that did not bother the viewer in any way.end of the storyI would prefer that both characters be completely cured. That the characters become good with love is nothing more than a myth, and some of the psychological problems that have their roots in people's childhood are not easily solved with love. Even if it is solved for a short time, it still shows itself after a deeper period than before.But in general, because the series was fantasy and sweet, I reject this point as a sub-syllable.In the end, I will gladly give this series a score of nine and a half, and I will definitely recommend it to almost everyone as a good psychological series."
736,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,I will never forget this show. But I also want to forget it so that I could watch this masterpiece again for the first time.
737,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This show has absolutely changed my life in view on mental health it was astonishing amazing brilliant emotional cunning!!!!!!!!!

738,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"I didn't want to watch this drama at first. The first episode was quite boring. In the end, I can say this is definitely the best TV series I've watched so far!!! So so powerful, true, it shows different aspects of life in a unique way. I just loved it so much. I even miss every single character because they are so good and I'm so sad I finished this!! If you're looking for something different, true, powerful, well made and even fun, watch this show. It's worth your time!"
739,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"This is the first time I'm writing a review and man I just can't stop myself from writing one.

740,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"You guys must watch this drama, this one really out of the box, how they talk about mental illness is no joke.

742,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Almost flawlessThe storyline is not so common
The script is just sooo good
Well written
And the cast delivered it well
Im very impressed with Sangtae character development but i love all the characters
The casts did a really good job
From such a small character to the main lead, theyre just perfect
Not to say the chemistry between Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji is beyond the earth
The chemistry of all the casts is actually beyond the universeJust a little bit disappointed with the plot

m still wondering it tho
But ill just forgive it since im very satisfied with the endingThank you for creating such a masterpiece"
743,It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"Almost every line is meaningful in this drama. It was like a rollercoaster of Emotions, Heartfelt, Fun, Romance and about Mental Health... Also it has all the Genres:-Comedy, Romance, Bromance, Dramedy, Suspense, Thriller (Kind of), Horror(it feels at some points). I guess not even an single character was ignored, story of Lead cast as well as Supporting cast was well covered and ended, all of them have done a great job. So just go and watch it with full expectations."

1344,Our Beloved Summer,"Korean Drama ""Our Beloved Summer"" is a slice of life love story that founds its success in the lingering feelings between two exs who have to work together after a long time.The drama does a great job creating the perfect atmosphere, with the use of lighting being on point, the scenes were beautifully shot and executed and the OST was brilliantly selected. And true, the game between the two main characters was an intriguing one, with the yearning for them to be back together being the force prompting the interesting factor. However, when that one was taken out of the equation, the drama got tiring and lots of scenes were added that were unnecessary and only there to fill in. So, yes, the drama started pretty strong, but it got predictable and boring towards the end. It also left out the family situation of the main lead out, which was a plotline that could have been explored in more depth.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast, which was consisted of an all-star pallette.So, overall, 7 out of 10."
1345,Our Beloved Summer,"K-drama yang mengulas cinta pertama di bangku SMA hingga kesempatan kedua di dunia kerja dengan pendekatan beda. Kim Yoon-jin sukses menerapkan konsep dokumenter dalam film, alhasil kesan raw dan realistisnya sulit ditampik apalagi didukung skenario apik.Kekuatan lain yaitu performa Kim Da-mi dan Choi Woo-shik yang berhasil menjelaskan pahit manisnya cinta lewat tahapan coming-of-age yang juga believable. Chemistry mereka mampu memantik emosi penonton tanpa berlebihan. Sajian musim semi dan kesempatan kedua yang terekam sempurna sambil menghadirkan elemen nostalgia."
1346,Our Beloved Summer,"A romance drama about two grown adults who had their documentary shoot 10 years ago and relationship thereafter, which ended eventually. After 10 years, it happens once again and yes it feels nostalgic in every way.The best thing about Our Beloved Summer that catches the eye is the cast. The charms of Kim Dami and Choi Woo Shik, who radiate youthful energy, fill up the screen, and the chemistry between the two naturally leads the story. The drama emphasizes the images of summer and thanks to this, the play's overall atmosphere is full of freshness. Also it might feel relatable to many viewers' teenage life they lived.The cast, whether be the lead or the supporting, had a great connection. The soundtrack is soothing and melodious which fits the setting of the drama. The story had depth, but it was fairly executed, if not efficiently. Also the supporting characters weren't given much exposure as one would have thought. Although it doesn't come close to other feel-good romance drama (like Hometown Cha Cha or When The Weather Is Fine), Our Beloved Summer manages to hold itself through freshness and nostalgic moments of reminiscing the good old teenage life.To summarise, Our Beloved Summer ends itself as a dama that conveys the sweetness of love and the freshness of youth at the same time. It's effective enough to catch viewers' attention with it's fair, if not excellent story and screenplay.My Rating : 6.5/10."
1347,Our Beloved Summer,"A documentary film is made of two students, one being the best in school the other being the worst. Years later a catch up is filmed and we see if there is still a spark as they separated with animosity after the first show. A heart warming drama with excellent leads and a good supporting cast which looks at how we develop as individuals and how the right people meet at the wrong time. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the series I think the stories with the supporting cast should have been fleshed out as I felt some of them were just glossed over and I was interested in them as characters but felt shortchanged."
1348,Our Beloved Summer,"On the surface, ""Our Beloved Summer"" is about two unlikely high school students who are paired together for a documentary. Yeon-Soo is the top student in her class. She's driven and determined to be the best. At the other end of the spectrum is Choi-Woong, who is dead last in his class. He appears to be lazy, uninterested, and lacking in any ambition.On a much deeper level, ""Our Beloved Summer"" is about the pain we all carry around with us. Much of it has to do with the past and how people are treated, whether it be from parents, other friends, or people from relationships. Pain is inevitable. Suffering, however, is optional. And it's amazing how much we suffer by holding on to the past. Yeon-Soo bitterly states in one episode, ""Facing the past makes me feel trapped in it."" This is because the past needs to be released. Especially the pain. And much of this series is about that: letting go of the pain, and thus, coming to peace with the past.Yeon-Soo is a woman who appears confident and doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks about her. This makes her appear cold and indifferent. However, this is what is on the surface, because underneath, she's a young woman in turmoil. She pushes everyone away from her because she feels she not worthy of being liked or loved by anyone. The irony of pushing people away in order to avoid pain, is that the person we really end up hurting, is ourselves.Choi-Woong is similar in his pain. However, instead of pushing others away, Woong chooses to barricade himself in his house, focusing on his art, and having little contact with others. Why? Because he's been abandoned by those that should have loved him and been there for him. And so, just like Yeon-Soo, he also feels unworthy. And when Yeon-Soo breaks up with him the first time, it reinforces his feelings of unworthiness all the more. Woong is also a gifted artist. However, he draws only buildings, which seem to mirror his own feelings of trying to maintain emotionless and distant from anyone else. We come to find that is true masterpiece of art is finally revealed in the very last episode!Ten years later, Yeon-Soo and Choi-Woong are asked to do another documentary, due to the success of the first one. Reluctantly, they agree. However, the more they begin to spend time together, they not only realize that the feelings they had for each other never went away, but they're able to finally confront their own demons from their past and put them to rest. They do this by acknowledging their fears and realizing what's been holding them back. They also realize that the goal of a relationship isn't to change the other person, but to change yourself. And this is why their relationship ultimately works.The world is full of Yeon-Soos and Choi-Woongs. People who build up defensive walls, or hide themselves away because they believe what others have told them: that they are unworthy. Feelings of unworthiness truly rob us of our chance of having a happy, fulfilling life. And they exist only within our own minds.This series is truly beautiful and uplifting in depicting the pain of these two lovable characters and watch their healing finally begin to take place. What's more, is that they also learn how to lean on each other when needed. They begin to trust their own love and strength and use it for each other as well as for themselves.I cannot speak highly enough of Kim Mi-Da and Choi Woo-Shik. Not only is their chemistry undeniable, but they are able to give us deep, complex characters using subtlety as a powerful acting tool. A look; a smile; a falling tear...all brilliantly showcased to make us feel every emotion that they are conveying.I was also thankful that the writers didn't succumb to a ""typical"" ending in the last episode. I love it when writers dare to follow a more realistic path that suits the characters and the situation rather than force a ""happy ending"" that is contrived and unbelievable.I rarely speak of the music in my reviews, but Kim Kyung Hee has quickly become a favorite of mine! His title song is something that I've found myslef playing over and over again. I also loved his songs from ""Crash Landing On You."" He seems to perfectly capture Yeon-Soo and Choi-Woong in his song. I can't listen to it and not think of them!This is one of my all-time favorite series involving ""young"" love. I cannot say enough about it. The series was cute, funny, heart-breaking, inspiring, touching, provocative, necessary, and deep. How many series can I say that about in over 45 years of watching shows? Not many."
1349,Our Beloved Summer,"I really enjoyed this and there wasn't a dull moment in the show. The pacing was good and this was so easy to watch. The story flowed really well and I felt like each episode finished too quickly - a result of good writing honestly. Amazing performances by the entire cast and especially by Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi, they breathed life into the show and had incredible chemistry with each other. The soundtrack in this show was amazing too, they evoked so much emotion from the viewer."
1350,Our Beloved Summer,"This drama cannot be boiled down as just a romance drama.At its very core,its a drama about how people deal with loneliness and the feeling of abandonment and simple human emotions. Everything about this drama feels so human. They all grew from the people they were at the beginning. Their progression felt so natural. That is the beauty of the drama, it takes simple human emotions and presents them so vulnerably that we all can relate to some part of it.It is very well directed and written. The cinematography is exceptionally beautiful. It's very hard to find a drama like this where everything just seems to fall into place naturally. I find it to be so comforting,like a warm hug."
1351,Our Beloved Summer,"Our beloved summer.Was love at first side,but ended with a blunder.My pride and ego got in the way.And I had nothing more to say.Just give me a second chance if I can stay?!This is nu poem about this serie. Like if you agree?"
1352,Our Beloved Summer,"TBH, I was debating whether or not to watch it (slow-paced romance isn't my cup of tea), but when I heard V singing Christmas tree, I told myself I should, and I didn't regret it at all. The story is AMAZING. I'm not saying there are many plot twists and such, but it keeps you interested. The directing and writing are both AMAZING. It is always a difficult task to tell the past and present at the same time. The balance between those two timelines was excellent. The pace of the drama, in my opinion, was slow. However, with a good storyline, I can overlook that fact.I love the character design for Kook Yeon Soo and Choi Ung. They were unique yet relatable. The drama involves us so much with the characters that you slowly start to understand their POV, decisions, habits, etc. You start to live the characters. The conflict between the main two leads is so great. It's like the saying OPPOSITE ATTRACT. They both are extremely different but it's heartwarming to see them keeping their differences aside and embracing each other as they are. I liked the documentary that played a big role. Also, it helped me understand how two people can have different memories and perspectives of the same moment.Don't even get me started on second lead Ji Ung. I felt sorry for him. I can badly relate to him. He had a difficult childhood and yearned for love and family. But, as they say, all's well that ends well. I like how they wrapped it up with all of the art pieces together.Overall, Our beloved summer is full of romance, heartbreak, patch-ups, and levity. The new love story will make you feel butterflies, while the sad moments will make you cry. In the end, it was a great adventure for me! And I wholeheartedly recommend this drama.PS: Tae's voice has the ability to amplify emotions. When the OST ""Christmas Tree"" played in the background, the entire scene became more romantic and emotional."
1353,Our Beloved Summer,"I love the aesthetic of this series. The camerawork is great. The acting and casting is really good too. This series had many very deep and genuine scenes, which I really liked. I also really liked the side characters' stories, I think I even liked their stories better. For me, there was just something missing from the main characters' story. I don't know if it was the lack of chemistry or something else, but I wasn't really drawn to their story. Other than that, it was still a decent show."
1354,Our Beloved Summer,"This show tells us that as long as we are alive we can be happy no matter what, we can forgive, we can try, and we can love.Main Characters were just so good...they had their own struggles, they had their own way to deal with their pasts and they dont want to make the other one suffer. That's what makes them special.The chemistry of both the leads are incredible. Choi Woo Shik looked soooo damn cute and Kim DaMi looked perfect with him.I just loved the pacing and how the story progressed. I am a sucker for slow-paced drama. A slow-paced drama can actually heal you and teach you a lot of things and this drama did it for me!The best thing I like about this drama is that the writers did not delve too much into every character's past but dealt with it in enough detail to give us context.Not a single character in this drama made me feel horrible. All the characters had their own purpose and they fit in perfectly. It was just a perfect 10 on 10.The character developments were perfect for every character. Like literally every single character was developed by itself by the end of the drama and I loved it!Also I will take this opportunity to praise Park Jinjoo again, cause she is a Queen and always nails her roles. She makes the drama more watchable and funny.I can truly say that this is the best rom-com for me this year I have enjoyed this beautiful series to my heart content. I laughed and cried throughout the drama had my heart broken and fluttered in the same episode itself. Hometown Cha Cha Cha and Our beloved Summer..on the same table for me.All the 'couples' here are just so love(i do not have the word to describe them really).OST, epilogue, every detail was perfect!!PS: Tae's voice can magnify your emotions.Whenever the OST ""Christmas Tree"" was playing in the background, it made the whole scenes more romantic and emotional."
1355,Our Beloved Summer,"Let's start by saying that the cinematography is just amazing, the colors and the shots were perfectly in harmony with the plot and the characters. Good choice of the main actors, they really have an amazing chemistry and their characters are very well developed, they will make you fall in love with their story. Each episode consider the different points of view of the characters so that everything always make sense.They will warm your heart (I need Choi Ung to be my boyfriend is so caring and perfect). You'll also cry a little or a lot but it's all worth it!"
1356,Our Beloved Summer,"I watched this show from start to finish as it was airing to keep up with the trends. I enjoy Twitter discourse on kdrama tv shows and this one was getting a lot of buzz. However I frequently found myself having absolutely nothing to say at the end of each episode. To be fair, they did a great job evening the playing field after starting the show with characters who have already broken each other's hearts. It can be tough to rebuild a relationship when the audience already is biased towards one partner. However, the pairing wasn't my problem. These two are great together (though I preferred them both in the Witch) and are fun enough. But all the side characters could've been removed and the story would be no different. All the characters besides the main couple had no life and no understandable motivations. I didn't even care for how any of their storylines wrapped up in the last episode cause I was just happy it was over. I like slice of life dramas but every character should be fleshed out as much as the main ones. It was boring to be frank. I don't see the hype. I really feel like I'm missing something that people find special about this drama."
1357,Our Beloved Summer,"PROS: The poster of the two actors looking disappointed and helpless was what attracted me to this drama. After watching it, it was confirmed that the two lead actors did a great job portraying Choi Ung and Kook Yeon-Su. Their quick-paced jibes at each other were funny, but their shyness towards and tenderness for one another was moving at the same time.Another actor who deserves praise is Lee Joon-Huyk as the arrogant but astute Jang Do-Yul. His character was well-written, used effectively to create tension and humour whenever it was needed.CONS: NJ, played by Roh Jeong-Eui, became an unnecessary character about 1/3 way through. Her storyline of all the bullying and unfair treatment that she got as an idol singer has nothing to do with the main storyline of Choi Ung and Kook Yeon-Su's romance. When the story made it clear that NJ was no competition for Choi Ung's affections, her character should have been written off the script just like Jang Do Yul's had been. The continued focus on her irrelevant storyline was simply annoying by the end. NJ is the reason why I'm giving this drama an 8 and not a 9 or 10."
1358,Our Beloved Summer,Words can't express how much I really love this show. It talks so much about real life stresses but it's also very lighthearted and funny. Wooshik and Dami really did a great job and I love them both as actors so much. Would 1000000% watch this over and over.
1359,Our Beloved Summer,"It is a good drama. But there are better ones. And watching the drama and seeing a 8.6 rating, i don't think compatible. Here is why: don't evokes emotion with the script, it's repetitive (especially when they stop bringing the couple's past which was kind of funny and curious to watch), not only the story is repetitive, but the action of the characters and they waste good characters... Anyways, good points: beautiful cinematography, great actors, good start. It's what I describe as familiar and confortoble, but sometimes it's just too long, too empty and makes me feel indifferent. I would not recommend to anyone. It deserves some credit. However not so much. Go watch ""twenty five, twenty one"", if you want something meaningful, toching, warm and with nice rhythm that it is going to keep you interested."
1360,Our Beloved Summer,"This is one of the best summer romance drama.It is All time favourite for me.I like the whole script, setting , characters, main leads' acting.Production design also great ! Main leads have strong chemistry between them !!"
1361,Our Beloved Summer,"Everyone did a good job in this second chance romantic drama, but it felt like there was a lot of filler, repetition and padding out. The secondary characters were wasted but there was genuine poignancy in the pain and burdens that the three leads carried.Prefer Kim Dami being edgy than the vanilla version we got here but if you came for Choi Woo Shik he delivers with every gorgeous smile, perfect outfit and criminally long eyelashes. Continue to watch his career with great scholarly interest."
1362,Our Beloved Summer,"I enjoyed the first several episodes, but then it started to drag on A LOT. The only character development was the male MC. While I empathized with the female MC at times, I found her incredibly frustrating because she treated her bf like absolute garbage for no reason. She came across as emotionally manipulative and it seemed like 5 years later, she never really grew up and loved to belittle Ung. I also didn't even get a sense of her personality - it was bland tbh.I actually really loved NJ and Lee Sol Yi, though.And lastly, I actually don't think Kook and Ung should have ended up together in the end."
1363,Our Beloved Summer,"I stopped watching kdrams since the story lines and plots were dragging in almost every kdrama i watched . But this one is so fresh and unique concept , the heroine is not a clumsy shy person instead she can make decisions for herself properly . No stupid antagonist timeline and no stupid parents drama . The only great thing was it was focused solely on the love story between the two main characters, side stories were not dragged and were purposeful . Every character was well written and executed by the actors . Its a must watch ! If you are sick of the stupid lame story lines , then this one is for you !"
1364,Our Beloved Summer,This kdrama explores multiple people's psychology as they go through life in a lighthearted but also serious way... its not too exaggerated and not too over the top and for that reason exactly its wonderful to watch.
1365,Our Beloved Summer,"This series touched my heart deeply. It was very engaging, loving, charming, heart warming, can't help but find yourself rooting for the lead couple all the way through.It will grab you by the heart and drag you all the way to the end. That's how powerful and beautifully written the story is. Couple that with one of the most moving OST, well ladies and gentlemen, you got winner. NOW GO WATCH IT. 😊😊👏👏👏"
1366,Our Beloved Summer,"This drama is the best, the chemistry, cinematography, ost, all that involved in this drama give their best so we all can enjoy this masterpiece. Woong yeonsoo story that we will always remember for a long time.Wooshik and Dami please be happy forever and meet again in another project."
1367,Our Beloved Summer,"Love this drama, it will always be in my heart. My comfort drama and I also learned many things through OBS. I hope we get more dramas like this in future.Not our usual kdrama I would say. I really really mean this drama is so creative, I could say an art!Please I want to see dami and wooshik in another drama again😭 really they are so natural with each other, they are perfect."
1368,Our Beloved Summer,"Everytime i decide to watch a romance kdrama is bcos i want to fell in love with the couple, but I don't feel the chemistry.. both actors seem like a couple that was force to look like they are in love just bcos the script said so. My heart is not fluttering at all.. i dont even smiling alone watching their romantic scene.."
1369,Our Beloved Summer,"Good watch with some interesting characters like NJ. Can be slow at times with the back and forth with the main lead love story and the documentary filming scenes. Episodes start to pick up towards episode 6 and becomes more interesting when the characters start to interact more with each other. Kim Da-mi's best performance is still in Itaewon Class.Episode 16 finale felt a bit rushed and stitched together. Overall, series is worth a watch as there are some feel good moments. Also, the OST is amazing."
1370,Our Beloved Summer,"Totally my view and my opinion, Ung's manager, NJ, the female lead's friend, the jokes and the meaningless funny scens and vibes they make, seriously ruining the show, I love meaningful scenes such the producer's scenes, with his friends, mom, and Ung's parents and even his junior are kind of the best scenes, maybe I'm not in the mode for comedy but really the unnecessary comedy scenes and characters are so unnecessary.Well the main leads are absolutely magnificent."
1371,Our Beloved Summer,"It's just perfect!!! Everything in it really made me fall in love. This is the definition of those who fall in love but I am the one who is pounding. AND, BECAUSE OF THIS DRAMA, BSRU THIS TIME I LOVED AND WAITED FOR MONDAY!!!!!"
1372,Our Beloved Summer,"I haven't seen the ending, but i rewatch the entire series each week ahead of new episodes, which should say something. The series has just, so far, brought so much joy that i can't stop experiencing it."
1373,Our Beloved Summer,"Our Beloved Summer is so beautiful and heartwarming. It might not be filled with action and agony towards the solving of a mystery, but it holds a lot of agony within how each character will heal their hearts, grow up emotionally, and reach their happiness. That is a complex thing that takes time, and proper communication, so it's very real in that sense because it portrays exactly that. It doesn't romanticise toxicity, or build unrealistic standards making it appear like an old fairy tale. Because of those reasons, it's a very beautiful and mature show, without being heavy in any way. Anyone that enjoys heartwarming shows filled with raw emotion and genuine real relationships of kind souls will enjoy Our Beloved Summer. I recommend it, without a single doubt."
1374,Our Beloved Summer,"I really enjoyed the 1st episode. Kim Da-Mi is the cutest. I loved her performance in Itaewon Class.Can't wait for more episodes, it wish they released all episodes at once, but I have to wait for weekly episodes now, but it's satisfying in a different way to wait for episodes every week. I'll have something to look forward to."
1375,Our Beloved Summer,"And I'm very critical when it comes to Korean Dramas for some reason! But this one managed to tick all of the boxes. It's very warm, cute and comforting, it leaves feeling good and content.This drama managed to avoid all my major pet beeves; the over the top acting, the cringe dialogue and pointless plots. It wasn't trying too hard to be something, instead it was so believable. The writers did an amazing job, it's not really telling a story that haven't been told before or anything, but the execution was PERFECT. Huge kudos to the cast as well! Woo Shik is one of my favorite actors! I loved everything I've seen him in! Can't wait to see where he goes from here. Also, the documentary theme was so intriguing right from the start, I was invested immediately.The fact that my least favorite trop is love triangles, yet I loved this drama so freaking much, even-though a love triangle was a big part of the plot, says a lot!!! Again, it's the execution! You understand these characters, you feel for them and you see where they're coming from.And it's not just a love story, even-though it's the main plot. Each character is dealing with something on their own, and that gives them so much depth.The final episode was perfect. It made me so emotional, because you are not sure how it's going to end up really. The writers keep you on the edge of your seat. I cried few times, it was just so touching, moving and so damn beautiful."
1376,Our Beloved Summer,This series experience was so good lovely story beautiful acting.i am watch all Korean and Chinese drama I from India but I love Korean and Chinese drama shows.
1377,Our Beloved Summer,"We just finished the last episode. This is perhaps one of the most wholesome, cohesive, heartfelt, and beautiful Korean Drama that I watched so far.The chemistry the between the actors is top notch and the story is just great. The resolution of the story is just right.If your looking for a feel good series with great balanced comedy, romance, and drama with great cinematogrophy, this story may be just right for you."
1378,Our Beloved Summer,"Loved the show. All characters are well written, romance is well paced. You love the main leads as you watch the episodes. Chemistry of main couple is just absolutely beautiful. 10/10 for acting and the story, grateful to have actually watched this while ongoing. Has the happiest ending ."
1379,Our Beloved Summer,"I've been watching dramas for a very long time and I've seen way too many of them. Even if it's only on the 4th episode I can say that this one is different. Choi Woo Shik really is a naturally talented actor and their chemistry with Kim Da Mi is just amazing. Everything about them; their lives, relationship feels so real. They really did a great job that every scene make me feel comfortable and warm, it also makes me smile. I'm in love with the artworks and the art studio shown in the drama."
1380,Our Beloved Summer,"Da-mi Kim and Woo-Sik Choi have awesome chemistry. I hope they can work together again. Actually, I even wish they can be a couple in reality.What's more,they have an amazing understanding of the script and the characters. I love them so much.Besides watching all the episodes, I also enjoyed behind-the-scenes which made me even more attracted by them. Thanks to 'our beloved summer ',I meet the two outstanding actors. I also watched The Witch:Part 1. The Subversion ,a thrilling action film. The film is great, and they work together for the first time and get to know each other because of the film. According to their interview,they have been friends ever since. That's one of the reasons why they act in this play --'our beloved summer'. Da-mi Kim's Iteawon Class and Woo-Sik Choi's Parasite are worth watching as well."
1381,Our Beloved Summer,"I've been so into with drama and movie since in Elementary School. I wrote some review abt the past movie that i watch. I might not a pro. But, since it almost 11 years, means half of my life enjoying to criticize a movie and drama. I can see their bright future in this entertainment. They seems a fresh look, for a future actor and actress. They act so well and i love how they potrait the character so natural. Even, their chemistry give a natural and comfortable way to look. This drama is so unic too, looks simple yet so meaningfull. I can see the plot twist in Choi Woong character, how Yeon Su fight for life and other cast give a good impact. The rom-com and youth genre is a right choice for them. The director pick a great cast!! I really appreciated them for real. Sorry for my bad english, I hope u guys enjoy and appreciated this drama very well too❤.I want to give a credit to tingfied from asian wiki fans who wrote abt this review,
""The storyline and writing are also really great so far - I love how the plot has been progressing each week and how we slowly get to piece the full story by seeing everyone's different POV. I really think the way they structure the episodes is super cool and unique - a mix of documentary, flashbacks, present moment, different POV, etc. The cinematography is also great!"""
1382,Our Beloved Summer,"This is so good, it makes me waiting for the new episodes every monday. The actors are so talented as well. I think it can be the best drama in 2021.every single episode can't make me getting bored, maybe i get addicted to this drama."
1383,Our Beloved Summer,"Our beloved summer looks like a cliché at first, but the more you watch, the more you see that it's a deep psychological/emotional analysis of a couple pre/during/post break up, and the interactions between the cast behind and on screen are so wholesome! The scenery is WOW. The filming/cinematography/editing deserves so much appreciation. It's so much more cinematic than the usual K-drama. The color grading and lighting are perfect. Each setting and time represents a season, and, of course, there are the beautiful OSTs like Drawer by 10cm and Christmas Tree by V of BTS. It's simple yet complex and detailed at the same time. I'm loving it so much and am eagerly waiting for each episode!"
1384,Our Beloved Summer,"I've been a Kdrama addict for a while; Our Beloved Summer is no doubt the finest production since The Coffee Prince. And that is a long time coming.As perfect as a kdrama script can be; there are things that are obviously out of place. The writer portrait the male lead to be the quiet under-achiever that can comfortably recites Nietzsche's theme of Eternal Return; somehow the same person would fail to see the economic hardship that his partner has been enduring for 5 years. Did he tried helping? He's either stupid or he didn't care. For that, I gave this 9/10."
1385,Our Beloved Summer,"This movie is like a cure for heartache. It is gentle, profound and empathetic. Besides the love story of the two main characters, it is also the story of each character line in the film, in everyone's heart contains an unnamed sadness that cannot be shared with anyone. Reality is not always easy."
1386,Our Beloved Summer,"Though most of the episodes may bring down tears, the acting of all the characters were portrayed so well. Emotions were deeply immersed by the actors themselves and I was so impressed!It has been a long time since I was hooked to a romance kdrama. The last time I got hooked was actually Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo! Little did I know I would be in love again with another pair's chemistry (Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi) <3Cinematography and OSTs are just chef's kiss. I really like how they used the concept of the seasons to show how their love changed as they grew older. It's just so beautiful and I was reminded of the lessons I learned from dating my first love hahaha.The storyline was very realistic as well. It showed how important honest and open communication is in making a relationship last. I remember my first love wouldn't be open to me, and since I was young, I wasn't patient enough to wait. However, as the years passed by, I noticed each character's development and I am so amazed! No one is toxic either, in fact, they all deserve a happy ending!Because of this kdrama, I was able to learn so much about what loving a person is truly like. It's not the superficial things such as looks or money, but accepting the person fully despite the flaws. I also learned about the different love languages and how important it is to inform your partner about it.Thank you for such a refreshing and well-written kdrama :) I am hoping for a new project where Kim Da Mi and Choi Woo Shik work together again. They have superb acting skills and talent."
1387,Our Beloved Summer,"Relying on the trailer, it appears that this will be similar to those teen dramas. However, as the episodes progress, you become engrossed in the characters as well as the plot, the transitions of each character, and the significance of those around them. This drama reminds me to always appreciate what I have and to be grateful for the little things in life. Yeon Su's line really compelled me, ""We are the only ones who make our lives pathetic."""
1388,Our Beloved Summer,"In was, first time you laughed. Middle part your crumb to dilemma and sad. Ending you would be big smile, fluttering, and happy. Your emotions would be bumpy."
1389,Our Beloved Summer,"I'm compelled to write this review because I believe everyone should watch this series. However, if you're new to Korean drama, don't start with Our Beloved Summer, there are a lot of high quality KD, but OBS is on a league of its own and it sets the bar high.STORY:
How can a simple story be told in such an exquisite work of art? The writer, Lee Na Eun, had a vision and trusted a rookie director, Kim Yoon Jin, to execute. No details were spared, from the cell phones used in the life stages of the characters, the books borrowed from the library when they were in HS, then as adults, and during the proposal. The place where they broke up and where Ungi said the magic words to Younsoo. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the beautiful cinematography of ""Our Beloved Summer"". The series showcased the beauty of each of the four seasons.ACTING/CAST:
Choi Woo Shik and Kim Da Mi are exceptional actors and their chemistry in OBS is un-matched. We can see why their co-star, Kim Sung Chul, referred to it as a national treasure. Choi Ung and Yeon Soo's characters are typical of any Korean dramas and so is their story. What set them apart were the actors who played them, give all the awards to Wooshk and Dami now. They weren't even on my radar prior to OBS, I watched IC but didn't care for Dami then; and decided to watch Parasite in between OBS episodes.OST:
The music of ""Our Beloved Summer"" pulled everything together. The story, the characters, each setting, each scene, were all made more beautiful because of the soundtrack. This is the first OST that I purchased, and I had to pay more for shipping than the actual products - I can't wait!REWATCH VALUE:
I rewatched most episodes while waiting for new ones to be released. I'm planning on rewatching the entire series, with less anxiety of how it will end, and more appreciation of its artful storytelling."
1390,Our Beloved Summer,"This drama is a very realistic love story drama from the point of view of all the actors, a story that you will find and feel in everyday life. Kook yeonsoo and choi ung are told like a couple who heal each other's wounds. Very beautiful from the storyline, ost and cinematography."
1391,Our Beloved Summer,"Maybe some ppl will think the plot is really slow, but this is actually show how human feelings that are tugging. How they started falling in love, break up, the second meeting again, started to missing each other, try to against their own ego, and finally confess their feeling to each other."
1392,Our Beloved Summer,"Funny how armys in the are saying they use taehyung when it's literally the artist decision whether they choose the project or not, afterall obs is still the most watched netflix korean tv series."
1393,Our Beloved Summer,"I've been watching Korean series for more than 10 years now and I must say this series offer a different take on telling an ordinary story.If you've watched a lot of Korean series, you're probably familiar with some of these common elements present in most of them:
a rich aloof guy (a son of a chaebol; or an heir to the throne if it's a period drama)hateful villain/s, could be a second FL/ML who will throw in all the possible challenges to the leadsa revenge plotNone of these are in the plot or story line of Our Beloved Summer.This series offers a breath of fresh air from all these kdramatics.The male and female leads are someone who you'll find in real life, and this series tells us their love and life journey. Sounds ordinary? Yes. But the gem of this series is how the following elements were played well to create an extraordinary experience to its audience.+the lead actors organic portrayal of their characters; the layers of emotions that they bring into the scenes are exceptional. And I think this is rare in most Kdramas which sadly have been saturated with popular good looking actors with mediocre acting skills.+ the heartwarming script; the lines were effectively delivered by the actors, even the narration, you can feel the emotion of the characters, at some point it felt like I'm listening to spoken poetry.+ the OST is well and appropriately added in the scenes. The songs somehow made the emotions of the scenes linger and stay with you.This drama's incredible storytelling drew me in and with this somehow I felt invested with the two main characters' storyline. That's why I feel that the series should have focused less with the story of the 2nd male lead and more on the female lead POV. As an audience, I felt that there were airtime that should have been about the two main characters."
1394,Our Beloved Summer,"I am the type that nit-picks shows I would watch. I dislike wasting my time on dramas that would not pique my interest and stimulate my emotions consistently; and if I don't think that the casts have chemistry or suitable for their characters. My mood towards any series has a short rebound rate so I either skip clips and episodes or I abruptly drop them off forever.Before I even started watching Our Beloved Summer, I already held Choi Woo Shik & Kim Da Mi in high regard for their chemistry and acting skills. I kept watching their interaction in The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion. Thus, I had high expectation of this romcom drama and they did not fail me! When I saw the first episode, it gave me back the same feelings when I used to watch Princess Hours, Goblin, Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok- Joo, It's Okay Not To Be Okay, and Start-Up (Some of the K-Dramas I like that are top-tier).Despite not being in relationship since birth and never being in a break-up situation, I could still overwhelmingly relate to the story. The tension going on between Choi Ung And Yeonsu, the mishaps of life on one of the characters that caused traumatic experience to the both of them and the backstory, their POVs, their extremely cute knick-knacks, and the character development are straight masterpieces. The transition and the presentation of the four seasons in the progress of the male and female protagonists' relationship was insanely and carefully established so that the viewers would immensely grasp and feel the moment that everyone has been waiting for- just halfway through the ending. However, this series is far from just being a feel-good show. It still contains realistic hardships that every couples in real life could be going through, but I hope lessons would still be imparted 'til the last episode.Nevertheless, I have been in a rollercoaster of emotions because of what's going on this K-drama and because I'm trying to be patient waiting for the episodes. Thus I am speechless, how this series has only been gaining more support internationally than in South Korea. I wanted to understand why foreign viewers would become an avid patronage of such outstanding drama, but not the locals. I think Koreans like those dark- themed shows that tends to become overly stressful to watch."
1395,Our Beloved Summer,"I like the drama so far, the first episode is so cute, beautiful OSTs and great cast! Looking forward to the upcoming episodes. It's been a while since I watched romantic comedy dramas so this one looks promising."
1396,Our Beloved Summer,"What i like the most from our beloved summer is they don't have unnecessary lines or scenes which sometimes would make a drama feel prolonged. I realizes this around episode 14 and somehow it felt refreshing (maybe it's just me tho)
Overall very enjoyable drama those heartfelt scenes really warm your heart!Happy watching!!"

1450,Melloga Chejil,""" Be Melodramatic "" just didn't work for me.Although the start was pretty good and the characters interesting, the drama got boring. They lacked the spark to keep everything interesting. Plus, the romance was corky which didn't help. Though, the characters were original, real and realistic. The performances were really good from all actors and actresses in the cast. Some of the side stories were interesting for a while as well. However, they had just too many stories to follow and they keep them entertaining for long.So, overall, five out of ten."
1451,Melloga Chejil,"There are about 10 couples in this kdrama including the couples with two partners (one with a ghost), the gay couple, the parents, the side kick and even the little kid has his own love line. I only liked the writer-director. I give 8 out of 10 for the witty and comic lines of the director-writer couple, the couch conversation, the mom and daughter convo and the kid. I like the realistic acting of the director and the funny side kick/friend of the director. I also learned how arduous the work of a writer and director are and the product placements managers. They also showed the difficulty a person experienced from losing a love one. The song about the ""shampoo scent"" is catchy and gives good vibes."
1452,Melloga Chejil,"The start and the ending of this series are not quite catchy but what's in the middle is just perfect with a mix of melodrama and supreme comedy. The series was well-acted and shot. I just wish they too, more effort in closing this series. It felt very open as if they were keeping a door open for a second season. It would have been better to see a conclusion to the various relationships this series portrayed. Still, it is worth the watch. I recommend it."
1453,Melloga Chejil,"To simply put, this is a coming of age, female centric drama. It touches unique issues which can be hilarious or extremely heart wrenching, but give possible solutions to them too. The drama has an open ending to most of the main characters so, it's up to us viewers to give our own ending for them, however, at the end of the drama you will definitely feel light and good about it. Especially if you are turning 30 soon!Don't miss it."
1454,Melloga Chejil,"I didn't really have high expectations from this drama. It has a strange title (it makes scense once you watch it) and the synopsis didn't make me want to watch it at first. But I have to admit, that it's very good. It's literally the first kdrama, from the many I've watched so far, that did everything right. I know that most kdrama fans will disagree with this statement but let me explain. Good acting, good music (and most importantly not overused), good scenario, nice humor, nice dramatic scenes (but not to the point you want to cry all night long). I like many kdramas, but even my favourites lack on something. For example, ""Something In The Rain"" is one of my favourite dramas (not ony kdrams), but I have to admit that I grew tired of listening to ""Stand by your man"". Believe it or not I rated ""Something In The Rain"" with 8 stars instead of 9 because of that.To be honest this is not one my favourites. It's not the type of dramas I like to watch and it was hard for me to watch more than 2 episodes at once, unlike other kdramas. But I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like, is some parts of the fast conversations, but only because I've watched its with subtitles and I didn't have time to properly read, so sometimes I had to pause or rewind. And some conversations were a bit weird, but this could be probably poor translation. This is,unfortunately, a problem,when watching a drama or a movie in a language you can't understand.By the way, it's not really so close to reality as some people wrote in their reviews, but it's ok. This is actually for the best because it's humor works better this way. There are so many things I could write about this drama (social critisism, witty humor, making fun of product placement etc), but I think I wrote what I needed to write.Edit: I forgot to mention that although it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, it focuses mainly on the everyday life of the characters (worklife, life decisions etc) and if anything it's mostly a comedy."
1455,Melloga Chejil,"This unheralded show deserves a full measure of praise. I am not sure why I started watching it but it's really terrific.No major name brand actors and an utterly conventional set-up featuring three heroines who are hitting 30 and angsting about their middle class single lives. So far, so what? Well, for one thing, this has a wonderful literate and inventive script, peppered with wit, sly (and sometimes laugh out loud) humor, and wisdom and insight. There are a host of well-acted supporting characters who engage our attention, no out and out villains but rather so many people striving to do well and occasionally to do right, stumbling as they go. The entertainment industry setting has a certain self conscious sense of ironic navel gazing, but it really doesn't matter. You yearn for our heroines' success, in work, in love, in life, and you follow their adventures with a mixture of anxious anticipation, sympathy and a wide smile on your face. A producer once told me that the reason people watch a television series, as opposed to a movie, is that the characters are being invited into the viewers' homes. In this series, please, extend the invitation.Before acknowledging the actors and writer in more detail, I want to offer particular thanks to the subtitle team at Viki, where I watched the series. Since this show is set around the genesis and pre-production of a drama series, it has many references to other Korean shows, including impish allusions to the very popular Reply 1988 in which the male lead, Ahn Jae-hong (here playing a successful but put upon drama director called Son Beom-Soo) also appeared. The subtitlers added translator notes to these and many other cultural allusions. In addition, despite the complexity and rapidity of some of the dialog, the translations were literate and almost error-free. A superb job.Now to the actors: The three lead actresses give wonderful, nuanced performances. None of them are Hallyu royalty, although Jeon Yeo-been, her career launched by her standout performance in After My Death and now (2021) starring in the Netflix series Vincenzo, seems on her way. She plays Lee Eun-jeong, a documentary film maker whose career is on the rise but who continues to be traumatized by the early death of her fiancé from cancer. Chun Woo-hee, previously perhaps the most prominent of the three, leads the way as Im Jin-joo, the scriptwriter who is getting her first shot at having her pilot script, ""When You're 30, It Will Be OK"", turned into a 16-episode drama. Finally, Han Ji-eun delivers a strong turn as Hwang Han-joo, the single mother whose stock in the marketing company she works for is rising. The three (as well as Han-joo's son) live comfortably with Lee Hyo-bong, Eun-jeong's gay younger brother, sympathetically played by Yoon Ji-on. The scenes among the four, as they confide in and comfort each other, are warm and often hilarious. I especially liked the scene where Han-joo, just to see their reactions, teasingly implies, to her roommates' horror, that she is considering going back to live with her good for nothing ex and the father of her son.Surrounding them are a substantial cast of other actors and actresses who infuse their characters with depth and substance. It seems unfair to single anyone out, but I feel bound to give it up for Baek Ji-won, playing Jeong Hye-jeong, as Jin-joo's former boss and herself a famous screen writer, whose tough exterior gradually collapses in the face of romance.This drama was underrated. I can't think why. For a refreshing peak inside the world of KDramas, with a stellar cast at every level and a truly witty script, go for it."
1456,Melloga Chejil,"This drama is one of the best k-drama i've ever watch.The acting is good.The story good.The joke is amazing.Alot of value.Good writing.Good and memorable dialog.
Character development is good enough."
1457,Melloga Chejil,"I can really relate to this movie. Very interesting. Somehow in the few last episodes, it kind of getting slow and losing its rhyme by showing too many characters and their love life rather focusing on the 3 main characters. It will be great if they dig deeper on the emotions. Still it is a fresh and interesting drama to watch. Most of the actors/actresses are amazing and have good chemistry. Except for Han Joo character, it is very hard to watch the unnatural act from ms Han Ji Eun. But she has many rooms to improve in the future."
1458,Melloga Chejil,I've been in Korean dramaland for 20 years (I'm in my mid 20's) and I've seen countless dramas.This is one drama with scenes I've never come across before. The whispering scene and unique slap dodging scene got me rolling on the floor. The PPL scenes were creative too.I didn't find the first few episodes interesting so I dropped them only to go back to the drama because of how much the Koreans were praising it. I'm glad I did because it only gets better.Similar drama: Age of Youth (slice of life drama)
1459,Melloga Chejil,"The characters were nice and good lookingBut I'm sorry i feel the story is poor and the act is cold
I felt so bored from the first episode but i told my self to continue may the story get suspense but I still was borrd so i stopped watching at the seventh episode ."
1460,Melloga Chejil,Good drama where it explores relationships in deeper level
1461,Melloga Chejil,"Why I just watched this drama this year?! Why this drama just shown up right now? I LOVE IT! The reason I watched this drama just because it shown up at viu list. I start watching this drama without knowing either the casts and the synopsis. And because of that while watching this drama, there is no expectation at all and GOD I LOVE THE VIBES OF THIS DRAMA. The concept that their always having night talk together just somehow give me a slight dream to have someone beside me like them wkwkThe interesting part of this drama is, I got to know little bit about the process of making the drama, and its fascinating!! Its makes you to be part of the team wkwk Last but not least, the soundtrack. I love how this drama just having 3-4 soundtracks but still perfectly match with the storyline. You just need to watch this with no expectation and enjoy the drama~~~"
1462,Melloga Chejil,"This one should go in the modern classic section.
That's how good the show is.The characters in the show are really well fleshed out.
Their dynamic with each other is fantastic.The show is funny when it wants and has a very fresh take on comedy compared to other k dramas.
The show displays pathos In such heartful manner that you deeply root for each character.It's really a very funny showIt's literally a show with no bad characters. Not one!
There are no black or white textbook characters,
They are human and have their flaws and even the stupidest character in this show make some sense in terms of their motivation towards their actions. And they all give a sense of comfort and security.Generally the female centric shows kind of repel people a little cuz it can lean into being preachy.
But this one's a breath of fresh air when it comes to dealing with those tropes.Acting was great too.
Han Ji Eun gives life to the amazing character Han Joo with her innocent caring and yet strong n competant mother.Jeon Yeo been playing the stoic Lee Eun jung is witty and poignant.Lastly Chun Woo hee was the most relatable as the writer Lim Jin Joo with her trivial struggles in Daily life.This one. For sure. Will stay with you."
1463,Melloga Chejil,"Wow. I loved this drama so much. For me, it comes under the category of the more realistic ""slice of life dramas"" like 'Hello My Twenties' or 'Because This Is My First Life'. It was witty, fast-paced, heartbreaking, hilarious, cute, embarrassing... all the things you feel in life. It was like watching my best friends live their lives on screen.Yes, there were many couples in this drama, some significant and others not, I do feel they equally shared the spotlight and everyone's screen time was evenly distributed. However I will say that one couple I would have loved a deeper breakdown of, was our LGBT couple.  Would have loved to expand on their story as I know it would have been a very interesting one.All in all, I immensely enjoyed this drama and I will definitely be watching a second and third time! Do not miss this!!! It's worth it."
1464,Melloga Chejil,"U took a full episode talking about farting , and ended all the series in one episode !! Didn't like the ending at all."
1465,Melloga Chejil,"What a journey this was by the way. The actors, brilliant. The writing though even more so. They somehow managed to make a show full of life and unbelievable self awareness especially in the product placement bits. So creative and incredibly witty. The rapid fire conversations were a joy to behold in real time. The characters had so much depth and displayed such humanity. I'm amazed this isn't spoken highly enough. The cinematography was also good too nothing outrageous. But the story as light as it may appear had so much going on. The lives the women lived and the trauma they went through in the first episode (that set the tone for me) was gut wrenching but amazing to see how they fared and sealed with it. I'll give it a 10 if it was only 2 episodes longer just to see more of them god damit!"
1466,Melloga Chejil,"This series plays like an audio book. The dialogues are fast, witty and rich in philosophy. The series is full of surprises and twists. It deals with relationships where comradery, love, friendships are explored in a deeper level. It does not follow typical k-drama cliches. You are expecting one thing to happen but something completely surprising and insightful occurs.If you are into the contemporary Korean language and want to learn more of literary devices such as alliteration, onomatopoeia, pun and etc, you will not be disappointed with this series. The current translation cannot convey all of it, but does a decent job."
1467,Melloga Chejil,"Korean dramas are known for their stereotypes. The overarching story may change, the genders might be revered (figuratively but in some cases literally), the girl might be rich instead of the guy, the witch may get the man instead of the princess, but the major beats are always the same; guy and girl are meant to be, blah blah gets in their way, they get together in the end.
True that some of the recent entries have tried to shatter major stereotypes (take Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo for example) but no kdrama breaks stereotypes the way Be Melodramatic does. Most kdramas start off funny and light hearted, then quickly shift to the same gear that every other kdrama does with over the top melodrama and sadness, oh so much sadness.
Be Melodramatic has surprisingly managed to balance the tears-in-your-eyes comedy, heart throbbing romance and poignant melodrama that never goes over the top in such an effective manner that I doubt any other kdrama comes even close. The fact that this is such an outlier in the cookie cutter world of kdrama might be the reason behind it's low ratings. In being so different, it may have alienated some of the typical audience members for this type of media. But if people aren't hyping this kdrama up to the max, they are making a mistake. This drama is awesome.
To those who are skeptical of this show, just watch episode 1 till the end. You won't regret it."
1468,Melloga Chejil,"I definetly recommend this drama, it so unique and well written. I love kdramas but most of the kdrama creates a virtual ideal reality that u will get a happy ending just like the leads or u will meet a handsome cute loving guy/gal etc.....but guyssss this will never happen..even if it did what happens next after that- this drama will show u the reality..please watch."
1469,Melloga Chejil,I loved the low eyebrow humor and the dialogues. I have been desperately looking for a kdrama with as fewer clichés as this one has. I can't remember the names but none of the three couples went through the same predictable stages or were rushed to some forced endings.
1470,Melloga Chejil,"It's everything you can ask for there is drama, comedy romance.
You will easily get attached with all of the characters finally a reality drama that you will relate to 100%A bounce
you must bring a tissue whenever you are watching because it will sure bring you to tears imma tell that you will cry an actual cry"

1492,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Korean Drama ""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" is a heartwarming drama with a stellar cast.What makes this drama special are the side characters. Everyone in this small, seaside village is a family and they can easily become the publics' favorite not only because of their strong bond but also because they are funny, dramatic, sweet, and lovable. The setting was also a strong plus of this drama along with the great performances.However, the drama had a predictable story that was pretty much not nearly original, had superficial main leads, who did have chemistry though, and a boring love triangle. Which lead to many boring episodes that were only saved by the side characters.So, overall, 6 out of 10."
1493,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This is one of the most romantic dramas I have seen. I loved being able to watch the development of their relationship right after they decide to date. All their romantic scenes and kiss scenes are beautiful.Hong is a ""countryside"" guy who is simple while Hye-jin is a dentist who is more into the city, glamour, prestige. Hong doesn't care about any of that. They are opposites but so perfect for each other. Hong Du-sik is so handsome and his personality is cute - I love his ""okay"" replies! I wish to find a partner in life like Hong.Gam-ri, the elderly woman who eventually passes, is an inspiring character. I love what she says the night before she passes away. She likes being old, she looks back and knows she ate lots of good food, spent time with lovely people, seen beautiful things - what more can she ask for? Everyday is like the excitement of going to a picnic.The drama has normalization of taboo topics. A character is a lesbian; the main characters are implied to have had premarital sex; Hong's duties on the contract include cooking and cleaning."
1494,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,K drama-decent acting all=even the3 old ladies r superb=its funny/sad/etc just hope get the ending well ending i want--and Shin Min-a is not just a grt actress but she is beautiful too.
1495,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Laid back K-drama in beautiful seaside village that will make you laugh, cry and appreciate life as it happens. Dimple couple, Seon-ho & Min-ah opened up the series nicely with charming introduction and showed endearing chemistry through reasonable process.Every Gongjin characters (from young to old) have purposes in their own stories, how to overcome challenges and let go of the past. Despite few dragging parts, Yoo Je-won gave enough time for them to grow on audience alongside soothing music and beautiful cinematography as well."
1496,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Hometown Cha Cha Cha is not a love story, but a story full of emotional moments. It's all about love, pain, sorrow, happiness, regrets and every human emotion that can be expressed.Without divulging much, it is impressive how Hometown... attempts to go beyond a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy as it explores grief, guilt, loss, and healing. While this is dealt with in a mature way, it would have benefited the show more if the intense themes weren't all packed into the final two episodes.Kim Young-Ok as Gam-ri, an octogenarian grandmother who Du-Sik is closest to, once again proves why she's the best K-drama grandmother. Hometown excels at slice-of-life goodness and wholesome romance of the best kind.My Rating : 8/10."
1497,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,A disillusioned city girl heads to the seaside and meets up with a local popular character who she clashes with initially but over time they come together but he has issues from his past that could tear them apart. A great cast with superb performances and side stories make each episode enjoyable. Anything with Shin Min-a in is always watchable because she plays an adorable love interest like no other. The chemistry with her co stars is always believable and in this series Kim Seon-ho as her partner puts in a sterling performance.
1498,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Shin Min-a has never made anything that i thought was remotely interesting this probably will follow suit, in 74 min there was like 10 min of dialog its gonna take more than her cute dimples to get me to spend much more time on this. It has the making of something but the writing is subpar.This has ran its course at episode 8 it's basically unwatchable now these are almost 40 year old actors acting like their 17 but that's KD today I'm downgrading this as it deserves it, this also has the most fake reviews I've ever seen, so many 10 ratings with this being the only review they have
posted.Two fairly decent actors in this are stuck with a D script. Ive wasted too much time on this loser."
1499,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"We've seen a lot of opposite atracts shows, series, and films, but not many of them are drawn up quite so wonderfully and heartfelt as this one. Much of the success of this series has to go to Mina Shin and Seon-Ho Kim with their incredible chemistry.Dr. Yoon (Mina Shin) is a successful dentist who loves living the good life full of fancy clothes, expensive cars, and everything else that goes with high-end living. She makes no apologies for her lifestyle. Perhaps it's because she's really known nothing else.Upon leaving her job, due to conflict with her boss, Yoon leaves for the small seaside town of Gongjin. The last place she felt happy as a child. There, she meets Chief Hong, a man who seems capable of doing literally everything! He works a slew of jobs, all for minimum wage. In short, he enjoys the simple life of service.Of course, at first, these two opposites do not get on very well. Yoon finds herself stranded in the town on her first day without money or even able to get funds due to a power outage. She's soon at the mercy of Chief Hong, who ends up putting her to work pulling the guts out of squid with the local women. You can only imagine how well Yoon is able to adapt.Without a job and a town without a dentist, Dr. Yoon decides to open up a dental clinic. The series is much about Yoon learning to appreciate a different lifestyle that is very different from anything she's ever experienced. This, of course, includes Yoon learning how to be a team player and adapt to the locals as well as the town itself. ""Grandma"" Gam-ri all but steals the show and our hearts.As you can imagine, Yoon and Chief Hong soon become attracted to each other. However, Hong has a dark past that he soon finds is catching up with him. The question becomes: will his past destroy things with Dr. Yoon before they've even started?Dr. Yoon represents those people who can only think about themselves. She comes off initially as fussy and conceited. However, the longer she spends in Gongjin, we see her begin to learn how to love and appreciate others. And Mina Shin has that million dollar smile and those golden dimples to brighten our days with!Chief Hong is a man who is a complete opposite. He thinks mostly of others, even at the expense of himself. In short, he doesn't believe himself to be truly worthy. And he has no idea just how much he's loved and adored by the people of Gongjin.Both are two sides of the same coin. Both have to learn how to adapt. You cannot love others without first loving yourself. And you cannot love others at the expense of yourself either.Of course, as Chief Hong's secret is uncovered, only those who see him for who he is--by his constant example of a man with a good heart--we know that he was not responsible for what happened. Those unable to forgive him are simply cowards who decide that it's easier to play the role of the victim rather than take any responsibility. I was slightly disappointed in Dr. Yoon's reaction to him; that she didn't seem to know him nearly as well as those he's lived with in Gongjin. Everyone else tried to check up on him. She didn't. It's easy to be there for someone when things are good. It's challenging--and even more important--to be there for someone when things are difficult. Also, one should never put pressure on someone to reveal that which they are not ready to tell. Yoon was quite selfish in her demands. Fortunately, she wisely realizes her mistake and tells Chief Hong that he can tell her when he's ready.We get a lot of laugh out loud moments as well as some truly touching ones that are sure to tug at your heart. Koreans are masters of incorporating both elements into their stories. The people of Gongjin will surely warm your heart and perhaps make you even wish that you lived in such a community!All in all, this is a fantastic and delightful series! I loved and adored all sixteen episodes! And it's proof that you can have good and likeable characters still, in world that seems to want to bombard us with dark ones. This show was refreshing like a wonderful day at the beach, which only made me wanting even more!"
1500,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Romantic Comedy with 16, 60 minute episodes. Alternatively known as Seaside Village Cha Cha, Seashore Village Cha Cha and Fishing Village Cha Cha.Yoon Hye-jin's (Shin Min-a) life takes an unexpected turn when she decides to stand up to her employer for overcharging their dental patients. After outing her employer on social media she find she has been blacklisted in the Seoul dental community and decides to take a trip to Gongjin, a coastal town where she had found memories as a child. Once there fate seems to step in to keep her there as she loses access to her money and her car suffers mechanical difficulties. A city girl with little skill for country life she finds she has to ask the go to guy of the village, Du-sik, for favor after favor. Hong Du-sik (Kim Seon-ho) is not only the top bachelor in the village but also an indespensible member of the village community. If it needs solved Du-sik can likely solve it, and if it is broken he is most likely to fix it. One thing the village lacks is a dental office and Hye-jin is a dentist that needs some work. Not only does fate decide to continually throw Hye-jin and Du-sik together but it also has landed her in a town in need of her skills. Will this sleepy seaside village be that little something in Hye-jin's life she didn't even realize she was missing? Is there a future for these two very different souls that fate has thrown together?I rarely find a drama near perfect. There are just so many out there and always aspects that could use improvement. But I have to say, on this one, it is near perfect. I liked how the characters were complex and showed good character growth. The various stories of the people in the town kept it interesting. The romance was very heart warming. They are both amazing actors and had good chemistry. I did not feel too bad for the second lead even though I liked him a lot. It ended well and was neither too drawn out nor lacked in completing the story. The one very minor thing I was not a huge fan of was the romance with the 2nd guy and his writer. She was just a very flat, and I felt, somewhat cold, character. I could not get behind their connection as she seemed like someone that was not very compatible with him and all it seemed she did was nag at him a lot. It was clear she was jealous and a lot of her behavior was around her. If you want a feel good, slice of life in a small town, romance then this would definitely fit the bill."
1501,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have seen many Kdramas but this has got to be my new favorite! The setting of a dentist going to open a clinic in a small country city is cliche but works. The nosy but fun neighbours you grow up on. I didn't think I'd like all of them, but did, especially the there old ladies! The sea side and views are amazing. I loved Hye-Jin and her groth to love Gongjin (as did I). The chemistry between her and Chief Hong was amazing, and loved how they were the opposite sides that fell in love with each other.My only complain would be the Du-sik drama that was painful to watch (looking at you episode 14&15) because i loved him so. His past could have been less painful but, even so, they did do it well. Hye-jin was the one he could open up and be his rock. The part where he told the story to Hye-jin was my favorite also.Overall, a must watch, cheerful and sometimes cheesy drama. I laughed and cried a lot. But you will fall in love with it and love every second."
1502,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This is probably my most anticipated kdrama of the year and I am glad to say that I enjoyed every second of it. I usually stay away from romcoms because they tend to have the same formula but homecha is different from the rest.Yes, there was romance and there was comedy, but there were more layers and depths to it; the complexities and simplicity of different types of relationships (romantic, platonic, familial, friendships, etc), the sense of belonging in a community, living life the way you want to, grief and guilt, etc. I smiled, laughed and even cried while watching this.And I love the found family trope in this show, it was so heartwarming how everyone became a huge family and supported each other. The cast was incredible, and thanks to the great writing, they brought so much life and variety to the show. On that note, I have to mention that Kim Seonho and Shin Min-a have amazing chemistry and honestly, the person who casted them deserves a raise. This show is a gem and kudos to the entire team that worked on it because they created something that touched many people's hearts."
1503,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The acting is superb, the central relationship is very likeable, the community setting is engaging.But the series begins to meander half-way through, with a couple of fillers to pad out a gap between the central couple declaring their feelings and the onset of the challenge to their relationship that we know is coming. Then the final episode drags terribly.Perhaps this is less noticeable if you buy-in sufficiently to all the other relationships on offer. But I think I did buy-in to those, yet still felt the loss of momentum when the core couple are not driving the pace.I still enjoyed it, but think I can only recommend this to those already loving Korean romances, as I do."
1504,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"A typical Korean drama with romance, comedy and tear-jerking moments blended to bring viewers a pleasant watch. It stars Shin Min-a as Yoon Hye-jin, a dentist who lost her job in Seoul and becomes the only dentist in a charming seaside village named Gongjin. She meets town handyman Hong Du-sik (played by Kim Seon-ho) whose dashing and outgoing personality hides secrets that even his friendly neighbors dare not ask him about.She plans her future and makes lists like ""100 things to do with boyfriend"". He lives for the moment, going about his days wearing different hats, from realtor to carpenter to painter, etc, charging minimum fee for his services.How these two seemingly opposite characters find each other in this idyllic place inhabited by interesting and lovable characters who care for one another is a joy to watch."
1505,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The actors are just amazing, outstanding performances, the script is well written, the scenery and locations.The beginning is very drawing and gets your attention quickly, it's funny and it has lots of sweet and cute moments.The pace is good, even with longer episodes than usual, and you really want to see what happens to the characters ( even the secondary stories are very interesting and told in a fascinating way).But then the mid and last episodes are not as strong and everything that happens you can predict.. Then the whole drama is filled with clichés.Still is a very well made series with fantastic performances and very heartwarming.You will enjoy it."
1506,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I am not a big fan of content like this but started watching it because a friend mentioned it. From the beginning it was a strangely compelling opposites attract, will they or won't they drama with a great supporting cast.What makes this show work though may be the cinematography and editing. The pacing of the series is really well done with multiple secondary storylines that round out the show."
1507,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Like how the romance develops in this drama. For once there is no unnecessary betrayal, evil & despicable people! It's a nice change!They butthead in the beginning but without her knowledge, he has already attracted & fall in love with her! She changed because of him, the town & its people! Great influence! They have a beautiful chemistry together!Not in favour of the leading actress/Hye-Jin in the beginning, she is snobbish & conceited though kind-hearted. Her bestfriend is so understanding! Even her found her soul mate who is sweet, kind & a little dense!I-jun the 9 year old is so cute, respectful, sweet & is a Saint! The girl Bo-ra is also adorable!Felt so sad for the demise of Ms Gam-ri, she is definitely the heart of the town & her 2 bestfriends! It's so nice to see the leading actor/Du-Sik ends up being good friend with Seong-Hyun, who is actually his rival! It's even nice Hye-jin gets along with her step-mom!What a wonderful external family in that town of Gongjin!Perfect ending! Worth watching!Might binge watch again!"
1508,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This started out really good with a lot of fast paced fun going on, then it fizzled into a bit of a yawn-fest and the storylines just kind of blahhed on. The last episode was a snore fest of tying up some loose ends and some of the worst series of blatant product placement I have ever seen. I get product placement pays the bills, but that was just ridiculous.Watch it, there's nothing bad about it, but it slows to a depressing cliched nothing towards the end."
1509,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I loved this drama from the first frame to the last. It's a beautiful story and the whole cast is fabulous! I loved every minute!! Very meaningful and healing. Our dimple couple are too cute for words! It's funny and worth watching for sure! Loved it!!
1510,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It had all the sentimentality, drama, hurt, pain, laughs and joy that you want in a Kseries. At least the writers had a happy ending that fit.Pleasantly, good fun."
1511,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This was such a chill-out, light-hearted, and unproblematic drama that was shot near the seaside area, so had AMAZING cinematography. Every shot was picture perfect, the colours were well balanced, and the captures of nature were absolutely breathtaking.This is like a photographer's dream.That being said, the overall drama is quite nice. It's easier to take into the mind too. After a stressful day, you can watch this and be at ease. The drama doesn't have any heavy plots that keep you thinking about it throughout the week. While it's not a boring watch at all, it doesn't have the thought-provoking or intriguing aspect to it. So, we can watch an episode, feel good, forget till the next episode.Everything about the drama is very predictable from the get-go and the characters are not deeply fleshed out. Everyone's a good person too. Therefore, not much difficult acting is required. Which is quite fortunate because the main cast were mediocre actors.As much as I love and adore Shin Minah, her acting range is quite limited and if you binge-watch the episodes, there is a probability of you getting a bit annoyed with her ""baby talking"", and the same three expressions for everything. Kim Seonho on the other hand displayed good acting in the latter episodes even though he was very stiff in the early episodes. This could be due to the way his character was written as a too-perfect guy at first (which tends to be quite boring) and then later we find he has a bit of layer to him which makes him more interesting. Lee Sangyi is a new addition to my drama watching and I have to say he's a fresh find. I've already seen him in Prison Playbook but I did not know it was the same actor who played the murderous bully in Prison Playbook and is now playing the nicest guy in this show. He has an amazing singing tone and seems to have great potential as an actor too. However, he still needs improvement which I'm sure I will see from his future acting jobs.Other than the main cast, the supporting cast does a decent job and their stories are very interesting that keep you engaged in the drama. I for one watched the drama mainly for the stories of the others especially the story about the two divorcées and the teacher, their child's reaction to their relationship, the ex-star singer's story, which I found quite compelling.To conclude, I recommend this drama for you if you like a peaceful watch without many complications. The mesmerizing sceneries will be an added advantage!"
1512,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Short story:- It got me hooked from the very first episode.Long story:- I am someone who have watched plenty of Kdramas in the past and so my standard is pretty high for rating a show as positive. Any show which gets me attached and hooked from early on is straight away deserves 10 stars.Lately at the time of writing there is so much negativity and depressing stuff going on in the world and in our life, i was looking for show which can bring smile on my face after hard day at work. I started few Kdramas on Netflix before this and was struggling to find a decent show.About this show, first of all it is believable, the story I mean. It's so simple yet so beautifully crafted. It's relaxing and doesn't stray away from the story much. The rural setting makes you wanna retire to some place like this in your future. The setting of the town is picturesque and full of colours. Both the lead characters are cute looking and instantly lovable. At times, the show will teach you valuable life lessons also. The romance and chemistry between the two characters are pure and angelic. You know they are made for each other.This is so far my analysis of the show after watching the first few episodes of it. Can't wait how the rest of the story will unfold. So interesting."
1513,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"A very nice serie. It is a serie that you can watch for a very long time. It's obvious what's going to happen, but I can't stop watching. I always get excited about the food that is served there haha."
1514,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" is a pleasant drama with a lot of funny moments. Characters' reactions and dialogues seem to be realistic and that's really enjoyable. There is also a nice chemistry between the main couple. The only negative for me was the boring love triangle and the storyline concerning the director Ji Seong-hyun."
1515,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This started off so good, but for me by episode 12/13 it went downhill.Before that it was cute how the two main characters kind of hid their affection for each other and there was abit of a love triangle.Yeo Hwa-Jeong - wouldn't have taken back Chang Yeong-Guk after the woman he has liked so long rejected him Yu Cho-Hui, so he basically went back to her (showing you as him realising what he didn't see her doing all that time for him).For 5 years we are wondering what Cheif Hongs trauma is, turns out, the firm he worked for, the security guard tried to kill themselves (and he seemed to blame himself for that) saying he should have picked up the calls.Truth is in the stock market industry no one cares about people, he even offered to pay the bills and his wife was rude. I just felt offended on Du-sik's behalf.When him and his friend were driving home, where his friend was driving - his friend took his eyes off the road and ended up in an accident. For some reason he blamed himself when it wasn't his fault.Did they even get the truck driver?!I found it annoying how Yoon Hye-Jin, shin-min a, was kind of getting annoyed that du-sik wasn't opening up to her so fast.There could have been some more focus on Choi Eun-Cheol and Pyo Mi-Seon relationship and comedy aspect. The part where she had to ask him out and him being slow was comical.Also there was the unnecessary death of his gran.Overall it was going somewhere good but episode 15 was annoying, obviously in the end they get married though."
1516,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"100% entertainment guarantee worth watching.. story, screen play, choreography, everything perfect and also great actors.. this drama definitely makes you feel happy, music and soundtracks are too good. The content of this drama unique, fresh, classic feel. I'm really addicted to this drama.. this drama made me feel something special,happy(sad emotions) ..
why some people gave low ratings🙄100/10."
1517,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have seen this show with smile on my face everytime. Love the vibe of this show, from location to cast to their clothing. Everything is on point. Good show to watch."
1518,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Drama has a lot of great reviews and I can see their point of view, but from a real life scenario how can these situation really happen. I get that dramas bring us to fantasy but the chemistry between the lead actors is fake and it is obvious on screen. Not a top drama as certain scenes are not believable and thus adds to an average review. If you are looking for a romance drama with a some humor that is realistic then this id not the show for you."
1519,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I absolutely loved this series, it's a really warm and beautiful story. This k-drama will make you laugh and cry in the best ways possible. Over the episodes you get attached to the characters, even the side characters. It was lovely seeing them all grow and change during the 16 episodes. What I like most about this k-drama is the fact that it manages to deal with heartbreaking and somewhat taboo topics, all the while still keeping the storyline sweet, romantic and happy."
1520,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I think hype is the main reason why I am so curious to watch this K-drama, but I can't deny the main casts are also very charming there. This drama is very light and easy to watch. The conflicts are also pretty simple, so it is very obvious that the story is also pretty average for a K-drama. Despite the average plot, this is still a star and charming in a certain way. It is able to deliver the heartwarming sensation after watching it.On top of that, I also love the dimple couples there. Well, maybe some people think that their love scenes are very cringe, but I still love it though! I am not a fan of cliche love story, but I just love the chemistry between both main casts and I still consider it as a cute one.Oh, don't forget about the popular ""la la la"" song for the soundtrack. I think everyone can play the song over and over again in their head. This ""Romantic Sunday"" is very suitable to this drama, especially whenever the scenes between main casts are coming out. It's just perfect with an excellent cinematography from this drama."
1521,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"HOMETOWN CHA-CHA-CHALike the characters in this drama, my family is not ideal or perfect.I cried buckets on the last 2 episodes! This is a drama of love and healing. Bravo to all the actors! 💖9/10 for me!#HometownChaChaCha
#ShinMinAh #KimSeonHo #KimYoungOk #KiEunYoo."
1522,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This is a fantastic love story, heartwarming, real, with a cast with good chemistry. But it's also about how a community can be a life-saver, how a tightly-knit neighbourhood can be like family. Lots of crazy characters, so this is a show that will have you laughing out loud a lot. Unfortunately, it's dragged down by too much, too obvious product placement, otherwise it'd be a heartfelt 10."
1523,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I don't know what people are smoking these days, but this is not a 10/10 show. Max i'd give it is a 7 (but that's dropping the series at the end of the 6th episode)The show mostly shined with its characters. Sadly that was it for me, and when they stopped shining I stopped watching.The story is basically city girl meets country boy.Their social status isn't as different as she might think, so she can date him >.> Too bad, he doesn't like her like that, but he better watch out, her ex is coming to town.It has all the cliches, all the tropes and the right amount of cheese. A typical romcom, and it all works cause the writing is done well. Well until it didn't (at least for me). Adding a love interest to just create angst between 2 characters that obviously have feelings for each other is very lazy."
1524,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"No wonder everyone loves this show because it is one of the best ones of our time. The most positive aspect of this show are the characters, in those 16 episodes, you literally see the lives of all those amazing characters from a really, really close perspective, thus when they smile you feel like smiling and when they cry it breaks your heart. It is not only a feel-good show, but it's so much beyond that. It has a subtle touch of every genre in it, and the more you watch, the more you delve into the story. After two, three episodes I felt as if I am one of the members of Gongjim living together with all those sweet people *I wish it were true :,)*I really love it so much It's a MUST-WATCH."
1525,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Sunday, 17th October 2021Just finished with HOMETOWN CHA-CHA-CHA
.The last 2 episodes were really one heck of an emotional roller-coaster. Undoubtedly one of my most cherished Kdramas ever! Had the perfect balance of Romance, Comedy and Melodrama. Very heartwarming, the characters portrayed in such a way that you'd love to come to visit it every now and then. Indeed the best Rom-Com Kdrama of the yearAnd glad Kim Seon-ho finally had a happy ending!My inner 'Start-Up' rage is now at rest."
1526,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It's impossible not to fall in love with the character of Hong Du Sik. He is a total Renaissance man: capable, accomplished, considerate, humorous, athletic, and very good looking.While the characters seem at first glance to follow a standard construct, I am anticipating that the story arc will continue to be intelligent, as it is touching on a number of contemporary issues to do with prejudice and assumptions. The writer seems to have developed considerable back stories and subtext for the majority of the characters, although we are not yet privy to all of them (as of episode four).I'll edit and update as the season progresses."
1527,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I know this series is beyond popular, but I cannot get beyond Kim Seon-Ho's lipstick.Makeup on a man has to be very subtle. It isn't here.The plot is so-so. Everything seems to be predictable. Romcoms can be better than this. Some subtlety to the characters maybe.But ,,,,, the lipstick."
1528,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"So I had high hopes for this one. I love both main actors. I'm so disappointed, especially with the character of Hye-Jin. She's been portrayed as a clingy, selfish and teenage woman and its ruined the whole thing for me.So Du-Sik didn't open up to her about his trauma- HIS trauma- that he's seeing help about within the first week of them dating...apparently that's worth taking a break over?? Also when she semi finds out about what he's keeping to himself...she's the one sobbing and saying she's not okay????? I hated this aspect of it, it made me really not like this drama.The subplots were very good and Du-Sik himself was an excellent character but the show has been ruined for me by the female lead."
1529,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"To be honest this series could have been easily compressed to be a 10-12 episode series instead of 16. Total waste of time towards the end to be honest.No doubt the cast was nicely done, the story is simple and heart warming. The star of the show is the lead couple, especially Kim Seon-Ho. I also liked the title track 'Sunday'. Nice.While watching the series I got so bored that I watched two other series and finished it and one Hollywood movie. I somehow managed to finish the show in the end.There is no way this series deserves a rating of 8+. A 6 is appropriate.Also even after watching this series I don't understand what the title means - Hometown Cha Cha Cha. What does this even mean?!"
1530,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I liked it. Upbeat and lighthearted. Easy watch when you don't want to handle heavy and sad storylines. The only thing i would give this show a negative review about is COSTUME design. Seriously who the hell picked the clothes for this show they are freaking ugly and unrealistic to what a 34 year old interested in fashion would wear. Everything clashed and was just Hideous. It was like 1970s American prom. Yuck. Please never work in the fashion industry again.
1531,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,The romance and the story behind it was amazing with really good comedy with it. This show is about a guy who lives in his hometown and is the guy who helps everyone in the neighborhood and about a girl who met him in that hometown when visiting there as a memory of her mother and she is also a dentist. As the show goes all the other characters also have their character development while fighting their back stories. It's an amazing family show too. For the genre of rom-com this one is a superb one.
1532,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This drama revolves around the romance of the main couple and it was very disappointing. Every obstacle: city girl vs. Small town man, remorseful hero, hero not cultivated enough for the heroine... go from weak to absurdly solved, rashly solved or plainly forgotten.The subplots have no better luck. Sadly, the adorable people from Gonjin are not the neighbours in ""Reply 1988"": It takes some talent to turn an ensemble cast amusing. The singer turned coffee owner, who had the story with the most potential is the one whose story is the most underdeveloped... Silly, silly drama that not even Kim Seon-ho´s charming smile can save."
1533,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This is only the 2nd Korean Netflix Series I have ever seen. I noticed the main male actor in the leading role Kim Seon-ho in the previous Start-Up series and had to search and find more which led me to Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha. It turned out to be one of the cutest Romantic comedies - I just loved how it is so innocent, sweet, lovable with a sense of humor. The leading actor Kim Seon-ho is the perfect person to play this role - you just can't stop watching it. You are laughing one moment, and crying the next. I love how all age generations are portrayed in the sea-town - the older generation giving wisdom and I love learning more about the Korean culture. I am not sure how true to life any of this culture is since I have no previous experience watching these type of series, but if even an ounce of it is true that is so wonderful."
1534,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"First the good things - this is relaxing to watch, it has a unique setting, great cinematography.This drama reminds me of so many other overhyped dramas in kdramaland. It's a faux pas to say it out loud, but the fact is some dramas get rave reviews not because they're particularly great dramas, but because they touch on certain subjects people like. For example, people just love dramas featuring autistic leads. It is what it is. In this drama, people are swooning over the pretty beach setting and the way the ML dotes on little old ladies. Seriously, that's a huge part of the show.It's true. There's nothing particularly excellent about this drama except those unique things that set it apart. There are no high stakes, no stakes at all really...nothing really happens in every episode except characters talking and going about their lives in this town. There are a few dramatic moments for sure, but not many. I found myself fast forwarding scenes of talking that had nothing to do with the plot and wishing for more drama. I also don't find the FL likable, she comes across as a snob. The ML is great.If it sounds like your cup of tea, go for it. It's not bad by any means, just way overhyped."
1535,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"No other way to explain the 9.0 rating of this show. It checks every single cliche you can imagine. There is nothing new or surprising about this show. You have seen it all many many times before. We already know how this is going to end regardless of the unnecessary forced love triangle half way through the story. Some scenes and stories drag on. Too much filler content to stretch it to 16 episodes.I was reading the reviews and people are calling it ""refreshing"" (imagine that) and someone was complaining how she can't hold on to a relationship because she compares every man she meets to fictional Kdrama romantic hero. Good God. With audience like this no wonder this show has almost perfect score. 😅"
1536,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"After going through some reviews (giving 3 and 4 ratings and calling it hype) i thought i should give it a try. Best decision i would say.This show is so refreshing I'm telling you.From amazing character development to beautifully building up of romance, everything is perfect.Location is so refreshing that you want to get out of your hustle bustle and have a peaceful life.I was never bored, this show kept a grip. You will get some life lesson.I believe that those who rated it overhyped were looking for a thriller climax. Sorry to disappoint but sometimes simple is beautiful, like a storytelling."
1537,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"After 8 episodes, this is Just a beautiful show. The main lead actor is perfect ! Some of the town neighbors are a little annoying but that's the only knock I have. But some of them are very good. How come South Korea can keep hitting it out of the park with one wonderful show after another? I just don't see the warmth and heart felt stories in TV series from the West. Bottom line : Another wonderful romantic show brought to us from S Korea."
1538,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I enjoyed it right from the start even though some of the actors did annoy me at first. At first! But man they all came into their own as the show went on. This was a brilliant funny Heartwarming story. The lead actor is phenomenal. It deserves a 9.0 on IMDb . The Koreans are killing it. So many wonderful we'll thought out story lines with depth and humanity. This one in general I'm going to really miss. So happy I found it on Netflix. Thank you.
1539,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I can say one of the best kdrama I ever seen. Main actor and actress acting is superb . Nice love story and no boring story , comedy romance drama . You can definitely watch. Nice script and couple is awesome."
1540,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This series started so good! A strong female protagonist standing up for herself, moving to a new place and starting her own business. And then... then it just all went downhill for me when Hye-jin started dating Du-shik. She was portrayed as strong, level-headed, ambitious, smart, independent and whatnot, BUT she couldn't cook and she couldn't clean but Du-shik HE COULD DO IT ALL - help everyone w/ literally EVERYTHING, he could and LOVED TO CLEAN AND COOK AND YES WAS A FREAKING GENIUS ON THE SIDE.I couldn't actually watch certain parts and skipped them because of how Hye-jin acted - she was very VERY annoying by the end of the series. I became much more invested and interested in other characters and relationships."
1541,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"What a charming series! One of two most lovable K-dramas I've seen , along with «Crash Landing on You» (I've seen 3 digit tv-series, so far!). You will be absolutely addicted once you watch it (the epilogue of each episode are incredible!) ... and will fall in love with the leading stars, especially with Kim Seon-ho.Kim Seon-ho is making a storm in K-drama world these days! «Home Cha-Cha-Cha» is doing great. Fans of him are going crazy how good he is in this TV-series and the very lovable chemistry between him and his leading lady, SMA.I think, it actually began with his role as Han Ji Pyung in «Start-Up» where he totally outshined the leading actors.I can explain though this on-going phenomenon. Kim Seon-ho is gifted with a baby face which is sweet, innocent and handsome... and a youth-looking body (hoping he stays that way and won't be pumping much muscles like most actors do) with an amazing physique like an athlete. Just watch his remarkable performances in 2 Days and 1 Night... he stands out in almost every task he does! His charm... Wow! Who doesn't melt seeing him smile or laugh? Add his dimples too!What impresses me most though is his acting skills, either with or without dialogues. He is such a natural talent! Every facial and body movements of his give significance to his role/character. Need I mention, «micro-expressions»? The way he delivers his lines is beyond perfect. He owns the stage/screen when he performs! He steals the scene/show from his co-performers and he absolutely captures his audience! We smile, when he smiles... we cry, when he cries.I hope I am not being unfair to the remaining cast and to the crew, being so focused on Kim Seon-ho. The leading lady, Shin Min-a is totally captivating too on screen. She's so lovely and a fantastic actress. She and KSH act so naturally that definitely make the viewers to believe they're a real couple. As I said, their chemistry is just great! This «dimple couple» has created an unforgettable screen-sweethearts. So heartwarming scenes of them! The supporting cast are adorable too!The producers, the very delightful script/plot, the beautiful cinematography, the admirable soundtrack/OST, the director's fantastic job, the enchanting setting, the commendable film crew/production team and all the lovesome actors and actresses make «Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha» a huge success! Congratulations!"
1542,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I gave a review before, after 12th episode. Now, I am more confident to tell my opinion after watching the last episode.«Home Cha Cha Cha» is a very heartwarming drama that gives so many insights to our existence: birth/death, love/hatred, happiness/sadness, braveness/fear, marriage/divorce, youth/old age, village life/city life, poor/rich, loneliness/togetherness, etc.I am very aware that this series is fictional. Yet it gives the feeling of being a part of the show. The characters seem real. We share their worries and their laughters. We sympathized with them. We see them as members of the family. That is exactly how I felt when I was watching this 16episode-tv series. When the finale came, you just wish the drama continues and stays longer.Those who are trying to put the rating down, are being unfair to the writer, the director and the actors and actresses who gave their best to give the viewers a wholesome tv experience that they can both enjoy and relate. «Hometown Cha Cha Cha» is one of the best K-dramas I have seen so far! It is entertaining (Thanks to the director) ... it is beautiful (Thanks to the cinomatographer)... it is healing and rewarding (Thanks to the screenwriter and songwriters/singers)... it is loving (Thanks to the awesome cast) and it is definitely Kim Seon-ho's (Thanks to his charming personality, his looks, his chemistry with his leading lady and his undisputedly good acting contributed to the overwhelming success of this series)!My best wishes to Kim Seon-ho! «Fighting!»
Love from a Mama/Grandma."
1543,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This was a total surprise for me as I dont watch much kdrama but love real human stories of the heart. This does that better than anything I have seen in episodic TV in a long time.The small town life is utterly charming and the characters are wonderful even if a bit over the top ... they still trade in real relatable and believable secrets of the heart in a natural way that makes you care about what they feel. Chief and Miss Dentist are over the whole series incredibly adorable so you have to cheer their success and its this caring about everyone that is in this little town and their tribulations that reach the heart in such a real way.If you enjoy stories about the depth of everyday humanity and the trials of love, this series can NOT be missed."
1544,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Man what a fantastic show. I laughed my ass off, cried a lot and had a fantastic emotional journey. Ofc there were some cringe typical Korean romance but that's normal in Korean cinema. Trust me indywood is more cringer. But the show maaaan."
1545,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Feel good series.Best Korean series I have ever watched.You will cry smile.Became happy sad
You will be emotional towards the end.I felt like why this series ended within just 16 episodes and why not series goes on forever.I became a part of the town..need to visit that places at least once."
1546,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Very slow-paced and boring kdrama - sadly. Went downill from around ep 10. I like the triangle and three mysteries, but i feel like they were building it up so much for such a long time only to reveal boring answers in the last eps. Also.. unnecessary death of grandma, cringy script and a lacking character development (apart from a slight adjustment and clarification for yoon hye-jin actions). This one was a no from me."
1547,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Are these people high when rating this?, i saw this drama's promo and it's really interesting. Then the show drop and offer something special.The Cinematography with beautiful scenery of seashore was great but they only presented that in the beginning.The story and plot was too cliché and cringe and predictable and something like that, no interesting character, C-class acting. Overall i only can give 5/10 because the great start, and i don't understand why this drama can get 8.9/10 while other great and far better than this trash only get 8.4-8.6/10 (D. P. and Move to Heaven)."
1548,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,It's all fun and good first few eps but it's not appropriate to have sets of eps to watch them singing / dancing as if it's an opera.They are also trying so hard to reach 16 eps and create a conflict with the leading actor. It's so shallow and lame - pretty overacting.Don't be misled by the paid reviewers.Only positive in this drama is they hired a bunch of seniors. Appreciate that thet gave them jobs during this Pandemic.
1549,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Story and script importance not given especially actress like #Shinmina not given enough scope in story. Wherever she comes on screen, she deivered her performance well. Side actress performance is another key area to be noted here."
1550,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It's so sweet that it saddens my heart to realise that I will never have this kind of love .Nobody will buy me tangerines when I am sick , nobody will eat my porridge even if it's bad , I will have no one to run to if somebody is following me. Nobody will smile at me like chief doesSo I have decided to live this love so sweet through this masterpiece. I hope Kimseon Ho keeps smiling ,he is captivating, teaching kindness wherever he goes and Shinmin-a has never disappointed me, she is exquisite ,you will know if you have seen ""oh my venus"".I don't want this series to end and I want the writers to keep the humour alive , thanku for goodnight dreams,. I think I will never get over this."
1551,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"So far I have watched up to episode 8 and it has been amazing, the characters seem very genuine, no unnecessary chessy stuff till now. It beautifully portrays how people are like a big family in a small town and most importantly the view all along has been great. I am very satisfied till now and really looking forward for coming episodes."
1552,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I absolutely loved this show. It made me laugh, it made me cry. The ending was perfect, in this drama/romance I didn't have to try and figure out what the ending meant as in most Korean dramas !Thank you for such a wonderful show- I loved every single episode, the sweet romance , the funny stuff but mainly our main couples great chemistry - thank YOU ! Loved... loved.. loved it!! Absolutely loved it!!"
1553,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This drama story seems simple but give some nice twist on every episode. Humble story, nice story telling but give lots of message in life."
1554,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Honestly, I never thought of that I would like this one, since I was never a big fan of romantics. But this one was just that magical, the interactions between the leads were sweet, never too much and natural, all of these made this series more enjoyable."
1555,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I love everything about this K-drama!!! Just finished watching this and still having separation anxiety. Definitely gonna watch this again. I'm also inlove with the soundtrack.
1556,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This drama will give u cringe vibe in every way!! How come in 2021 still cliche romance storyline is coming in Director's mind don't know!! Drop it after 2nd episode cause couldn't handle bearing KimSeonHo's overconfidence type look !! Sorry guys he need some acting skill badly 😴 and there is no chemistry between the FL and ML !! They look way more siblings thn lovers :3 don't wanna waste my 16 hours in this sh*t rather thn I would watch the Movie version of 2 hours.
1557,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Old fashioned love story
So real natural and with people next door
A closely knit village community.Great performances by these good looking actors
Awesome cinematography and locations."
1558,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"In Hometown Cha Cha Cha, community is family, and this story is truly slice of life, giving a window into the lives of various people living and working in a small coastal town in Korea.Many K-dramas fall into the romance trap: that is, focusing only on a romance between the two leads while foregoing all else, and all other characters. Hometown Cha Cha Cha, similar to Vincenzo, doesn't fall into this trap at all, but seems incredibly aware of the importance of a cast with chemistry and equal character development.The characters are real, they make mistakes, they grow, they evolve in their relationships. The audience slowly learns more and more about the townspeople and gets attached to them just as much as the main leads.This K-Drama was incredibly wholesome, cute, and progressive.Featured heavily are feminist principles such as a working woman as the female lead who often takes the first step to pursue the male love interest, who doesn't fit into the stereotypical mold of a working man, but instead is carefree, troubled, complex, emotional, and sometimes even weak.Additionally, later on, audiences will find out that a side character is gay, and see her history of alienation for it, but also acceptance by townspeople when she comes out about it.These themes and more are what make Hometown particularly wholesome, but also unique in that it is not afraid to tackle hard, nuanced, and complex subjects in ways that most K-Drama fans are not used to. 9/10."
1559,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The plot might not be all new and some of the events are almost unbelievable or even unrealistic. However, it's quite refreshing that there are many perspectives on the different characters here, which were given much thought and depth.It's the healing we need to remind us of our humanity, especially, in this pandemic. It is truly a light-hearted gem.Good story! Great work you guys! 😄"
1560,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Not the typical storyline although the plot may seem simple at first glance. The characters have a lot of development throughout the drama and the cast has amazing chemistry. Beautifully executed.
1561,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I look forward to watching every new episode. I feel warm and comforted by the story they are telling. I look forward to spending time with this cast week after week. It is the perfect ensemble cast. The cinematography is gorgeous in the seaside village of Gongjin. Hye-Jin and Du-sik have unbelievable chemistry and when they smile, huge dimples. The whole cast is an extended family and community. This heartwarming story will make you smile and laugh out loud and sometimes bring you to tears. I loved it."
1562,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The first thing that struck me about this show is that each character is independent, mostly self aware (of course there is room to grow) and making course correcting choices for a work/ mental health balance. Our leading female, Hye-jin is self-driven, stubborn, and self-accomplished. Our leading male, Du-sik, is a savant jack of all trades choosing to live a simple small town life filled with meaningful relationships vs a profitable city career. The episodes are still being released so there is more to unravel, and of course a love triangle, but this show is filled with tender moments, hearty laughs, and a harrowing sorrow for what is beyond our control."
1563,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This is Extra-ordinary. WELL this K-Drama is nothing different or new but felt EXTRAORDINARY because of more ordinary things , people and story.Show setsup a world and stays true to that world. There are cliches, there are expected things happening but it seems very authentic because of the right presentation of characters and their story.It doesn't confuse you much with lot of twists and bringing in unnecessary characters to keep the curiosity or make it forcefully interesting,
At the same time it doesn't get bored, though its almost the same characters that you see in every episodes. Characters are presented in an authentic way and also showing their past playing a role in what they are today.All actors have done their part well, but Best part is of course the acting between the leads - Ufff Sparks fly and they make us feel the chemistry is real but unlike some other Dramas there is no much overacting here.Negatives - So far None , have finished watching 10 episodes. Will update my final review after the final episode.If you are looking for a feel good rom com drama, then watch it for sure. Breeze of romance and goodness will definitely hit you with this show :)"
1564,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Having seen a number of K dramas, you begin to notice that there a certain premises that appear frequently. This drama has the new girl who loses her comfortable life and begins an unfamiliar life in a rural town. While I've seen this premise many times, each drama was be uniquely different based on the location, characters. Storyline and most of all the chemistry of the lead characters.So far, I'm only two episodes in and I'm loving this one already. The scenery is beautiful. I recognize most of the supporting cast who portray the close knit, supportive and colorful community. The leads have an opposites attract thing going on that is more respectful than antagonistic, which I find refreshing.Often, you will see dramas take a stereotypical moment and put a new spin on it. Just wait until you see who gets the piggyback ride in this one and have it melt your heart. So far, there's been so many heart-warming moments and it's just getting started. This light and breezy drama was just what I was looking for."
1565,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Pacing is kind of slow. I will give it an 8 or 9 if the show pacing was faster. I watched most of the show at 1.5x speed and still found it slow. Most of the actors on the show are very good and I like the message that the show carries. Btw, the romantic ending scene at ep12 shakes like crazy. Wonder why."
1566,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This was my 3rd Kdrama after watching Squid Game and My Name (both of which were great). Definitely a reprieve from those other two heavy-feeling shows.This is a light show but full of heartwarming stories and a bit of a lesson on living your life to its fullest. The two leads are great with good chemistry, but it was the supporting cast and their small-town antics that help propel the show to another level. I docked it a star since the overly dramatic romantic slow-mo scenes can get obnoxious and cheesy.... but that's par for the course for a Kdrama romance.Please watch and enjoy without thinking about it too much."
1567,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Very slow drama . Flat , no climax .. just go along with bad acting from main actor and actress .. they don't have chemistry. The script was bad as well . The only saving grace , the visuals were not bad . A waste of time."
1568,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"No ups or downs . Just flat story the whole way . Acting was mediocre , and the leads had no chemistry. After a few episodes , I felt it was such a waste of time . The only saving grace was the kids in the show and it had some pretty decent visuals . I was more interested in the side stories but they never built on that . The main characters didn't commit at all to the drama . Don't waste your time."
1569,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I refuse to give poor ratings to TV series or programme, however if a Series or movie impresses me, I am more than happy to give credit where credit/merit is due. I wanted to rate this programme below 5, however I had to remind myself as a Greek Australian dude, perhaps I could not connect with this series because I am not Korean. I have seen quite a few Korean productions on netflix in the last two years. However, as much as I was highly anticipating this show, I had to sadly let it go after just two episodes. It is quite common in Australian/UK/USA productions that episodes run between 30-50 minutes per episode, so if the first episode or two don't impress oneself, one is willing to give the series another go for a few more episodes. But when the drama consists of 70minute episodes, and you realise you have been there, done that, sadly interest is lost. I just couldn't invest another 70 minutes of my time because... In just two episodes... we have two different characters bumping into each other consistently in a city of ten million people... we have the all cliched orphaned main characters, the leading female character slips and falls into the arms of the lead male...we have the two leads staring into the ocean alone, whilst thinking to themselves out loud...which, really, let's face it, noone does this ever in real life... and we have flashback that the leading two characters have met before, albeit thirty years ago as children. All these scenarios have been exhausted in so many other drama's. Upon realising this, I sadly decided this was going to be yet another drama following a somewhat popular recipe or formula."
1570,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Great looking guy of course (who seems good at everything - including rolling up anywhere Shin Min Ah is within 5 minutes - irritating) - her role feels weak and it seems like she's just the cute girl he's going to drive up the wall until he doesn't. Doubtless he has to have flaws so probably a dramatically sad backstory - but it all feels horribly predictable. In fairness I decided to bail near the end of episode 2 - but it had no feel up until that point - and in my experience kdramas usually grab you pretty quickly and then start dumping all over you from about episode 8.... I can't survive that long. I just can't see anything in this I've not seen 10 or 20 years ago, and with better hooks near the beginning."
1571,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Dropped it after epi 3 !! Male lead and Female lead got no chemistry!! And definitely it's not a 9/10 drama but look at the ratings misleading the potential viewers!! They'll have high expectations frm the ratings and will end up getting cringe vibe!! So use brain and come out frm over emotions and give ratings rationally.
1572,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha is for those who're looking for a watch that's going to keep them warm for a long time. I started watching the show with similar expectations, and man, i wasn't disappointed. In fact, the simplicity with which this family drama has been made gave it an unusual charm. Away from the citylights, the little town in the countryside and these two beautiful souls meeting and exploring themselves and each other in the process was emotionally powerful.More than Shin Min Ah, whose calibre I've always got to experience in her previous dramas, i'd give brownie points to Kim Seon ho. He's not only evolved as an actor, but seeing him taking the lead this time surely proves that he's capable of some challenging roles too.Hometown Cha Cha Cha is wholesome in its simplicity and surely a watch that won't disappoint on any count."
1573,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Jus wow the chemistry is phenomenal, the cast is amazing the storyline gets even better. Poor writing but I'm okey with that
Overall one of the best kdramas on Netflix."
1574,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It is slow, cheesy and full with good feelings.Quite enjoyable if you don't focus on too much details.We could use cheesy feel good series every now and then."
1575,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Utter Waste of talented actors, expensive production and viewers time.. Show starts. - Nothing happens - the end.. Unnecessary hype and buildup in social media over absolutely nothing."
1576,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"If you need to see something to make you feel good, you're in the right place. This isn't my first ""healing k-drama"" but definitely is one of my favorites. I loved the chemistry between the actors, how the story was told, how it was filmed... Every detail was made with love and to make you fall in love with the story and their characters. I recommend this in 100%."
1577,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The only reason I can think why there are so many high ratings is due to the good looking leads and the idea of idyllic seaside town.The story contains every cliché in kdrama. The leads act like high school kids going through a high school romance for the first time. Of course, there is not only one but two love triangles. The storyline is weak and simply boring. The gushing, googly eyes is over the top. I've dozed off during several episodes. Still, I will watch to the end because I like the male lead. Maybe something will happen."
1578,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Cliche plot and nothing surprising, but the mood of the series is comforting and easy to enjoy. You fall in love with all the characters almost especially that old lady😂, but the episodes are lengthy and some dialogues are completely unnecessary."
1579,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"After being unable to finish another K-Drama sponsored by Netflix, 'Was It Love', I was pleasantly surprised by how polished this show was. It is literally leagues better than 'Was It Love', in terms of casting, writing, and directing.'Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha', or HCCC for short, stars Shin Min-a, who is a veteran of romantic comedies. I knew what to expect from her, and she more or less delivered. Her performance however, was upgraded by the fact that the leading man, Kim Seon-ho, complimented her very well. I've never seen him in a drama before, but he definitely knocked it out of the park.The main leads chemistry is palatable, and it was genuinely fun to watch them together on-screen. They also provide ample structure for the minor characters to eventually develop and shine. Though I do have to say that I don't like, and probably will never like the cafe owner's daughter - she is insurable.Being 43-years-old, there hasn't been any new shows that provided me with any surprises or intrigue. I've seen enough TV shows and movies to predict where any plot might go. HCCC isn't any different, because it has scenes you've probably seen in plenty of other K-Dramas (i.e., sleeping in the same house). However, the main leads are so likeable, I genuinely wanted to see their rendition of the typical K-Drama tropes.In conclusion, I watched 10-episodes in 3-days easy. The main leads are the ideal pairing, the minor characters are passable, and the drama is very well written and directed. While the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable, this drama will be one I'll definitely re-watch in the future.Highly recommended & binge-worthy."
1580,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Feel good drama, Korean drama has top notch cinematography and this drama comfortably fullfill it. Great acting and story telling, best chemistry i had seen so far.Over all Hometown cha cha cha is a must wach Romance Drama."
1581,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"So far I am up to episode 6 and this drama surprised me!The two leads are fantastic together, great chemistry, but their individual stories are also great and how it shows both points of view throughout is great.So far I have found no faults at all, great story and all acting is great!I would highly recommend watching this show if anyone is hesitant, it's good from the very start."
1582,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Personally, not much experience in watching rom-com Korean dramas, yet alone series/dramas in general. Always been labelled as someone who is into their action and crime horror viewer, but Hometown CCC is a breathe of fresh air, especially from the most recent kdrama series I've watched which revolve around deception, killing, and getting on top of one another. Hometown CCC highlights the warmth of a neighbourhood community and points out flaws of each character, yet they are all lovable and show their compassion for one another.Given their long length episodes, majority of characters have a decent to in-depth background so that viewers are able to relate better.The show incorporated different character ages, ranging from young, middle age adult to your elderly seniors. A lot of what was done right were their romantic/quirky friendship relationship circles. The main characters were written well, well enough to cause tears even from e1.The background setting was a wise choice given that it would not have pulled off if this was done in a city setting, etc.Overall, yes, there were some episodes which were too slow but they were required to build the story and towards the end, it became predictable especially with storyline's. But I would give this a watch if you feel like crying to romantic circles and friendships."
1583,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I enjoyed the first few episodes. It was light, warm, funny, and had excellent leads and supporting characters. It started to turn sour in the last few episodes. The female lead did not grow at all, never listened to the counsel of other characters, and kept acting like a selfish brat. The twist of the story is one of the worst ever written in a K-drama. The whole time, the male lead's mysterious issue is that he was guilt tripping over things that were never even his fault. He took all of the blame for something that an idiotic and greedy security guard did, taking a risky investment, pouring all his savings and rent deposit on a volatile instrument which the lead male told him not to do, and that ended up tanking. So who ended up taking the loses and the blame? The male lead, his bestfriend died driving him to the hospital because the idiot security guard tried to commit suicide and failed. Then he sold everything he had and gave it to the security guard's family, as an act of apology Why? I don't get it. What a waste."

This light and breezy drama was just what I was looking for."
1585,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I love it why can't they do 5 a week - so disappointed to have caught up with the live releases. The bad guys get caught and get what they deserve. We still don't know the answers to the 3 mysteries!! Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah make a beautiful couple lets hope the story ends happily.All of the other supporting characters have really strong parts and they are great fun to watch. So many beautiful people and the filming is wonderfully done.I love the little bit at the end where we learn a little secret about one of the incidents we see in that weeks episode. Finally the theme music is a joy.. I only wish I understood Korean however the English subtitles are well written and make it very easy to understand the humour and the frustration.Praying that there are more seasons and many more episodes.
1586,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It makes you wanna fall in love, live, have lots of food with friends. Even during the sad scenes it makes you feel calm. I find it absolutely beautiful!"
1587,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Its refreshing. Hope they make a sequel or something because I want to see them more. (Tho Probably not a good idea to streach it because it ended perfectly)
1588,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Every Character in this show is a Kohinoor in itself. Its less about what story it tells, and more about how its told! If you want to just smile, feel good and be happy, go ahead with this drama. Even when you will have a tear in your eye while watching it, the very next moment you will find yourself laughing!!!"
1589,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I would advise you to ignore the negative reviews here as those people are simply impatient, yes the last few episodes may be have been rushed up a little but still I couldn't stop my tears.This drama really heals you and lets you feel love all over again, brushes up our mind to immerse yourself in living the moment and find ecstasy in everything and everyone around you.You'll learn ll over again how you gotta live your life to it's fullest. Please watch it you won't regret!"
1590,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have to first admit that I have watched a lot of Kdramas. But unlike some other Kdrama fans, I can still be objective about them.This drama is not ground breaking or even without cliches. However, it does succeed in giving that warm fuzzy feeling that some Kdramas manages to do.The chemistry between the main couple is pretty convincing and thankfully, their first kiss is not one of those Kdrama kisses where they keep their eyes open pretending to be shocked by the kiss.I have watched episode 10 so far, I just hope that it continues to be a light and sweet drama."
1591,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"At the beginning it starts boring, but I learned to be patient with series.So I gave it a shot, and I was amazed with the acting.The actor that I liked most was Du-sik better known as Kim Seon-ho. He is definitely my favourite because of personality, his voice and also dedication to acting.In general they Re all great actors, that even tge kids are brilliant! I love the series and I love the actors."
1592,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The drama is so beautiful! Each side character is well written ! The OSTs , cinematography is perfect . The main lead is the best actor in Korean industry now! Kim seon ho deserves an award for this ! Shin min ah as Female lead is great ! They both are super cute and are very good actors . They don't make it seem like acting ! A good weekend watch after an exhausting week at work !"
1593,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have found a strong appreciation for the romances in South Korean shows and movies. This is no exception. I expected this to be lighthearted, which it was enough of the time. I just completed episode 16 today and I need more! I laughed, I cried, I felt deep emotions along with these characters I've grown to love. Maybe not everyone watching had these connections, but I definitely did. I shall watch the movie this was based on. I do love Dr. Yoo but dare I say it, my favorite has been Chief Hong!! Jang Yi Jun and Bo Ra were fast favorites as well for me. I could have been content knowing about each and every character's life for years to come! Truly."
1594,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Well casted, beautiful aesthetics, great supporting cast."
1595,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Its so relaxing i was tired and stressed about stuff and just took a deep breath and felt myself being present in a countryside town with so many good people. Makes me realise the importance of a community which i lack and the main leads WOW love mina and seonho.
1596,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have watched several K-Dramas so far but none of them stole my heart like this one. There's just something very restorative, peaceful, funny and healing about every episode that just makes you feel recharged and calm after recent challenges in our real life.The actors are great and the dialogues and script so far were very entertaining and have given me a rollercoaster of emotions.I really enjoy the setting of this series and the slow-paced takes of cinematography.It's a real treat and I'm always looking forward to the new episodes on the weekends. I even watch the episodes over again because they hold so much details and character."
1597,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have never rated here. But I really wanted to rate this drama. This is one of the best korean dramas I have ever seen. Hometown cha cha cha, a drama that talks about every aspect. A story that was very close to our hearts. We will never forgot chief Hong, Dentist Hye Jin and the Gongjin village."
1598,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"EDIT: Now that we are nearly at the end, and as a viewer that has fully immersed myself in this drama right from the start to now (finished episode 15), I can say that this drama is definitely the second best series (after squid game) I've watched in 2021. I like dark dramas, and intense plotting, revenge against each other, weird monsters stuff, but every weekend exactly at 10pm, I find myself waiting impatiently for HTCCC to drop a new episode on Netflix, this is my perfect dose of relaxation. I don't know about cliche storylines or whatsoever, I'm watching because of the chemistry of the entire cast of this drama, the setting, how they are having fun on set. It was almost they were really living in Gongjin. I love how every single family in Gongjin has a story to tell, even right to the beautiful pre-school teacher. The stories were simple, but realistic. Eg, the pregnant store lady part, the little boy whose parents were divorced. I love to watch the two main leads going on their dates, so rarely we get to have 2 full episodes on lovey dovey scenes in k dramas, you know what's the real cliche for me? It's always when the two main leads going on lovey dates and then suddenly one of them sick or die or they just cannot be together. And it usually happen like 15 mins after they are happy. 🤣🤣 Like finally! We get to see my fav couple having a proper date too. Finally can I just say that the OST for this drama is PERFECT. My fav has got to be Here Always by Seungmin!Sorry the other unhelpful review here has prompted me to start an account here to write a proper review of this drama. There was definitely more dialogue going on, so I'm not sure if that reviewer watched the right drama.To start off, this drama has been touted to be a healing drama, and also finally we have Kim Seon Ho as a lead against Shin Min Ah, two dimples visuals here, so really, what's not to love?The first episode started off light heartedly, and I thought it was a great introduction of the fishing village that will likely be the main setting for the rest of the drama, we have Chief Hong being a know-it-all, and also gave Hye-Jin whose likable personality should be a great hit in the village soon after. The cinematography and natural acting of the actors are great and also in this pandemic, after watching several ""heavy"" dramas from TVN, this is definitely a refreshing change and now I can't wait for the next episode to be out!"
1599,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I don't know how to describe it but it's so wonderful. Everything feels so good and lovely and idk it's just amazing.
1600,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The story is laid out very lightheartedly and will make you feel good about life, not matter how stressed you are. It is presented as a healing romcom drama, and it surely is healing.The show's strength lies on its charming characters. It does does not only focus on the romance of the main characters, but also on their growth as a person. The supporting/side characters (villagers) play a significant role in the development of the leads. They are also surprisingly interesting to watch. (Also, all the actors nailed their roles.)HTCCC is definitely full of romance clichés, but it unexpectedly worked really well with the story. It has a lot of cheesy but heartwarming moments that will make you appreciate the small and ordinary things in life.Don't let its simplistic plot fool you into thinking that this is a typical romantic comedy. It's not. It's definitely more than that. Hometown Cha-cha-cha owns the romcom genre."
1601,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Damn you, for showing me a part of my soul I never knew I had.I never wanted to feel feelings like this, but I never want to stop feeling feelings like this.This isn't the review I wanted to write, nor is it the exact meaning I wanted to leave. But I'll never forget, the curiosity, the laughter, the good times, the emotion, the tragedy, and the feeling of being human, from someone who wasn't me.Life itself, I felt.Thank you."
1602,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This drama is just a rare masterpiece every single detail in it can put you in such a perfect mood
It's a healing and refreshing drama the atmosphere of it can really blow you away
Hong dusik character is flawless i really love it so much the writer wrote this character so smoothly in a way that i really wished if hong dusik really
exists somewhere in this world
Kim seonho acting was super amazing he is one of the few Actors that can make me cry
I cried a lot thanks to kim seonho prodigious skills he is absolutely my favourite actor, and he is one of the strongest actor in the Korean entertainment industry ,
Shin min ah who played the role amazingly i really love hyejin so much and i guess shin min ah and kim seonho are 100% hong dusik and hyejin .I can't help but praise everyone that was a part of this masterpiece
Absolutely it will be my favourite drama for million years ahead."
1603,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"They will break up at the end of the season. He is keep going farther away from the de twist due to his past trauma. He has a lots of secrets, no one knows what hat happened to him in those five years . She hates people who keeps secrets and lies in a relationship . She will find out that he has a kid and a wife in Seoul . She will be heart broken and leave gongjin immediately . She will marry director Ji and the end of episode 16 . Chief Hong will be alone once again or will be in a mental institution."
1604,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Shin min a is excellent...the roles r well crafted even for the sides actors..one of the best series I have watched..glued to it since I started watching.
1605,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Liked it because somehow feeling peaceful after so long since watched Reply 1988. Even watched the 2nd ep twice. Waiting for next.
1606,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This movie is the movie of the year !!! I love love it .. the amazing chemistry between the male and female lead is sooo good . The location , people ! Everything was perfect ! My best Korean series for me .... It draws out emotions from you ! I cried so much towards the end ... just watch it please ..."
1607,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I wasn't actually going to watch this at first (I feel like
I start a lot of my reviews with this sentence?) because it
seemed like too much of a cliché romance drama,
but after watching a spectacularly terrible romance,
I needed something to cleanse my palate, and
everyone seemed to love this.And yes, this is a super cliché romance drama - I've
seen someone describe it as a Hallmark romance
Christmas flick without the Christmas, and that is
exactly what this is. But that is not necessarily a bad
thing.It is definitely a light feel-good drama most of the
time, but it does become heavier over time, and it
deals with all the kinds of hardships you can come
across in life. This is also why I'm going to put a small
warning here, as they do deal with the thoughts of
suicide and death during the last two episodes. It
very much shows the beauty of life and all the good
things it can bring, but not everything in life is easy or
fair, and it deals with healing and trauma beautifully.People deal with grief and trauma differently, and
someone you could think is the happiest person ever
might just be hiding their pain deep inside. You never
know what someone is dealing with, so just be kind
and understanding to everyone.As for the main couple, I think they are super cute.Their dynamic actually reminds me a lot of CrashLanding on You; We have the gorgeous, successful female lead
who somehow ends up somewhere out of her comfort zone, where
she meets a local and very down-to-earth male lead. They annoy each
other a lot at first but keep having to deal with each other and their
chemistry develops from there. The female lead is at first presented
as someone who has everything they need in life when in reality they
are very alone, and the male lead is presented as sort of a loner but
is very well-loved in the community. I happen to like Crash
Landing more, though, which is why this drama won't
be getting 5 stars.That brings me to the small things I didn't really like
that much. The thing that annoyed me the most is
actually the pacing of the story. The first half of the
drama is well-paced, and we get to see them slowly
learn to care for each other, and then in the second
half, I feel like they go through a year's worth of a
relationship in what is actually only a few months.We get maybe ten or so episodes of slow-burn and
then two episodes sudden (and very aggressive)
fluff that seemed sort of out of place? After that, the
trauma storyline they have been building takes over,
and it all just feels so rushed. And everything in the
drama takes place in just over six months, which
does not feel like a long time considering all they have
tried to fit in there. I wish they had made it a bit more
even, gotten them together in the earlier episodes
(while keeping the same storyline but stretching out
the time she's there in the background), and then the
second half wouldn't feel so rushed.then two episodes of sudden (and very aggressive)
fluff that seemed sort of out of place? After that, the
trauma storyline they have been building takes over,

even, gotten them together in the earlier episodes
(while keeping the same storyline but stretching out

second half wouldn't feel so rushed.And the second thing that irked me - why, oh why,
is there always a love triangle? People told me to
just trust the drama and that I would end up loving
it, and yes, I do admit that it is not the worst love
triangle I have ever seen. They don't end up ruining
either of the male characters (which otherwise usually
happens), but I still do not see why it was supposed
to be there at all. Very unnecessary part of the plot if
you ask me.Otherwise, I very much enjoyed this drama! I ended
up watching it for all the background characters as
much as I did the lead couple, and that is when I
know I really enjoy a drama! Also, I cried a lot during
the second half of this, so get the tissues ready if you
are a crybaby like me."
1608,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It was a typical korean drama for the fist sight. After some episodes it became very deep and emotional, also with strong and indescribable relationships. The character development is deeper than usually in these dramas, the display of relationships are more real than I used to it in korean dramas.The storyline was a little bit slow for me, but I could enjoy every moment because of the good characters. All of them was loveable."
1609,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This series is draggy, predictable and full of inconsistencies. Not to mention the extremely weak character building. Our female lead is shown to be courageous and rightful - standing up for what is wrong even though it costs her everything - going out of her way to treat a little boy kindly - but she is also rude, overbearing, arrogant, ungrateful. She's a dentist exposed to every form of dental negligence in existence yet is too disgusted to accept food which has been handled using hands. She is every city-girl stereotype in existence. I can't fathom how so many people think that city people are hygiene freaks when you would get mocked for that kind of behaviour anywhere.On the other hand, our male lead is absolutely perfect in every way, does not have any flaws. He is hardworking, works practically every job, has time to surf and comfort the town people, and never seems to get any sleep. There is no explanation of the moral challenges he faces as a person. He is simply perfect. Our female lead learns a lot from him and he does not learn anything from her. He has to constantly save her from her mistakes. I am not claiming that it is impossible that this scenario occurs. I am just saying - it's overdone, cliche. Arrogant city girl goes to countryside, hot man has to teach her the value of honest labour and humility. Isn't it more interesting when both characters are able to make up for each other's flaws and teach each other new things, bring out the best in each other?Also, promoting hedgehogs as pets is really irresponsible, to say the least. They are already in high demand from owners who are not equipped to care for them, because they are 'cute' and seem manageable, and when they get too much, they are released into habitats in which they are not native."
1610,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Just this time i found a kdrama that i love it because of it storyline, friendship, relationship, teach a youth (especially a boy) to be a hardworker.I also absolute like a fresh background scene. 10/10."
1611,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"It has everything! Not just a regular melodramatic romance. It's accurately sweet and lovely. You'll get awestruck from time to time. Story with different perspective, plot is great. Watch it !!"
1612,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"If you need a healing drama, this will definitely satisfy your pursuit of such. Tearjerker which means it's more than relatable. Of all the KDramas I've watched, this will definitely embark your expectations. A phenomenal hit series."
1613,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Typical romcom it is but it doesn't feel like it. Rather you'll feel as if you're following the life of a village. Walking through the seaside you'll find interesting characters laughing,sharing caring,gossipping. Every one has a story to tell and everything blends in smooth nothing is felt forced. The progression make us want to know more about the characters.A usual storyline wonderfully executed making us want more. 10/10 it is!!!"
1614,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,There is nothing new. But it was a refreshing drama. I needed this soft-warm-hearted Rom-com. The cast done a great job. My all time fav Kim seon Ho is there and of course the beauty Shin min ah. I would recommend it first if u like soft hearted rom -com drama.
1615,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This isn't just a show, it's an experience, so it's hard to explain with words. The setting, characters and music together form a harmony that ""heals"". The plot and story aren't bad, but they come second to the experience. And its the experience that makes this special, and one that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Questioning your place in this world, or feeling like you are falling behind others, because you constantly compare others accomplishments in life and career with yours? Maybe this will help a bit, and enlighten a new mindset or possibilities. Things that will stick with me: The male lead character's philosophy on life, The music, and The setting."
1616,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"After watching first 2 episodes, i found this drama lightweight in storyline, heartwarming in storytelling, funny in between characters interaction. Plus, it's cinematic background just like I went to watch the place myself. 😍No big events & so heavy topics up until now, so i think this drama can be a healing ""me time"" after a long exhausted working days. It suitable to watch together with family too. It's gonna be fun relating Gongjin Villagers's story to our life too.For romance part, i think its like typical love story but maybe when the main leads start push & pull their real feelings, we will enjoying it more. Just like the drama title, i hope the drama will make my heart dance cha cha cha at every episode's ending.P/s: their first ost is very catchy! They got me lallalalalala after both episode!"
1617,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This drama is normal but awesommmmmmmme. How????Need more dramas like that. All actors were perfect.I love this drama so much and don't miss this. You will surely love hometown cha cha cha.
1618,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,It's like a fresh breeze in dense summer. Each character built so beautifully. A cute simple romance. So many lessons learnt. Kim Seonho is at his best. Our heart goes out to Dusik's character.
1619,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,What a wonderful depiction of the powerful impact of a community coming together to support each other. Each of the characters bring their own uniqueness to the overall story. It goes beyond the love story of the main characters. It is one of the best K drama shows I have seen lately.
1620,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"In this era of all dark themed dramas, This drama will sooth your eyes and refresh your minds💚
I expected this drama to be slow paced but this is not slow and evolves beautifully.💙
And the cast is just perfect. Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah really put their best efforts anf their chemistry is just adorable. Kim Seon Ho showing off his muscular body in some shots are 🔥🙈.The other charecters of the drama are relatable to all like we all have these kind of people in our lifes. They all have their own stories in their lives that makes this drama more appealing.In short the best healing drama of 2021.💚💙"
1621,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This drama is so fresh.it's so lightweight and gives the right amount of butterflies we need.i know it's early to say this but this drama has healed me.i needed this.this made me feel so loved and comforted.the acting was amazing.cinematography is absolutely stunning.peaceful and aesthetic.so far i'm loving this drama.
1622,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This is the best drama it's just so perfect it's unexplainable like omg the cast the story the side actors everything in this drama is just awesome!!
1623,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Deep in love with #hometownchachacha so much!Beautiful scenery, outstanding cinematography, excellent actors and actresses, love all the part of the drama so much! Thank you team for your hard work, you're doing great! 👏🏻👏🏻"
1624,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This drama instills a feeling of calmness and soothes our heart and soul. It truly is a healing drama in every definition.
1625,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I've been cutting down my watching drama habit for my own good cuz' it drives me crazy. Sometimes I feel inconsequential with beauty standard and about life. I was picky with my relationship and like I was not able to handle a good relationship before. I just felt my bf is not good enough even he has the prettiest soul cuz' I was compare him with the characters from the dramas. It's been a long time I didn't watch any drama for what did in the past. But I feel so stressed in this week. So, I decided to watch this drama but it's worth. There are lots of things that strike to my heart. And I can feel the scenery and it's awesome. Also their chemistry, it's a perfect match. I did watch lots of drama before but this one will be my favorite one. It gets me. I really appreciate the works of their whole team to produce this kind of drama series. I love it. It'll be worth it watch it. BTW, this is my very first time recommending a series."
1626,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I really love this drama. This drama brought up lots of emotions while watching. I was smiling, crying,being shy,sad when the casts do in series. These actors are so good at acting. I love each and every cast in this series. Each person has unique qualities in given character. I love ittt.. and of course the director of the series, this man deserves an award.. the way he taking this story is another level. That's why most of the people love this series.. it is an interesting and curious drama which will excite every viewers to know what will happen next when the episode is over. And now I can't wait until October 2nd. Mainly I love the main actress and actor. They have got a full of charm face which will bright up every viewer who is sad. Not only in drama but also in real life too.. I wish everyone for successful future ahead. God bless everyone abundantly. I loveeeee this drama and the cast."
1627,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This drama is so light and pure. Shin Min Ah and Kim Seon Ho's chemistry is so strong and effortless.
1628,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The actors nailed it along with the amazing storyline and direction. There is no complicated love triangle, no egoistic clashes, yet it touches the heart in more than one way. Loved it."
1629,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I can't say theres been many shows that have had me so excited that I count down minutes until episode releases. I dont tend to watch much TV series as I struggle to get hooked but this had me hooked from the get go! Such a fresh drama, not without cheese but its 110% the type you can't stop watching and the type you can never get bored of."
1630,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This rom-com series will definitely make your mind blow.
1631,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This drama gives off a refreshing vibe. I love how each character is balanced and how the neighborhood helps the main couple move forward.As you can obviously see, the main FL was picky when it came to finding herself a boyfriend. As she did say, the difference between her and the ML has a huge gap (Doctor - part-timer), but the more one gets to know one another, love has its own way.Though I am still currently in ep.12, and still don't know what the ML has gone through in the 5 years after graduating at SNU, I know this will add some development to the couple's lovelife if the FL were to find out.Again, everything is amazingly balanced, a typical love triangle, but that's okay. That ML triangle guy will eventually find love in the end.The side couple development is so wholesome and fluffy, i love it and it makes my heart flutter.The subplot nightmare of the main ML... how do i explain it... it's good...I've read novels wherein the ML has nightmares, and i do know how it ""usually"" turns out, but i hope this will be different.In short, 10 stars. TL;DR to proofread."
1632,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I never thought i would create an acc to write a review for any show but this show damm ""hometownchachacha"" is such a healing therapy for me,the storyline,actors specially kim seon-ho and shinminah are too good together."
1633,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"There's something about this show. You can't even point your finger on it because it's hardly explainable. We're always looking forward for the weekends because of this show which is something I've never felt before. We are emotionally devoted and invested with these characters and their stories because they almost mirror to reality. As the series grow, it's starting to become more real and authentic - real people with real problems and real people enduring real love. Shin Min-a and Kim Seon-ho are sort of a masterpiece paring on-screen - their emotive eyes, lovely gazes, infectious smiles and matching dimples are cherry on top. But what stands out to me the most are the pair's great acting chemistry that feels so natural and organic and the people around them that preserves the importance of sense of community that you can count on as your family. Shin Min-a and Kim Seon-ho's project together is a win-win situation for both of them."
1634,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I don't know how to explain on how much I love this drama. I can confidently say that I'm not usually romcom fan, I do give them a try but I always end up dropping them in the middle. I was expecting it would be the same for this but no, Hometown Chachacha always made me excited for the next episode. I love everything about it, the acting, the storyline, the cinematography, the osts and the chemistry. The story itself it's pretty simple but the writer did a really great job all the way til the ending. There will be some people who says this is cliche or boring, but I think it did a great job of executing the remake of the original movie (which I watched after I finished this drama), which may be the case of the """"cliche"""" storyline. Furthermore, I found it really refreshing that this drama add so many colours and layers to the main and the side characters, there is no one single boring moment in Gongjin. I recommend everyone who are looking for a relaxing and healing drama to watch Hometown Chachacha. From a drama that I randomly choose out of boredom to a drama that I will love forever, 10/10."
1635,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I'm writing this after watching at least twice the previous 12 episodes it has aired so far, and waiting in nervous anticipation for the next episode tomorrow (saturday, 9th oct) on Netflix.First thing first, true, it's full of cliches, but what dramas don't have them? Besides the cliches are being re-written in a fresh new way, almost 'laughing' at the cliches itself. If you watch it, you'll understand what I mean.Next, the cinematography is breathtaking. Simply panoramic and gives us that healing feeling we so desperately need (but refuse to acknowledge at times). It provides us multiple scenic views away from the hustle bustle of a city life.Next, of course I have to talk about the casts. I'm a fan of Kim Seonho, proudly calling myself a Seonhohada, but I'm a matured fan who'll say honestly if his project flops or not. Hometown Chachacha definitely doesn't. And he again proves his acting prowess, brought upon his many experiences from theatre plays and previous dramas, he actuallt gives me goosebumps at his acting out his nightmare.For Homecha (as we international fans nickname the series), Shin Min Ah as the romcom queen does a splendid jon at portraying the reality of a career woman, finding her way again, and trying to accept love. And of course, the supporting casts are just equally magnificent, each character so well-developed, that it is suffice to even say that they are also the main leads of the drama.And this, we have to thank and express our heartfelt gratitude to the writer who manages to write such a brilliant, healing and relatable drama amidst the mountain of other stress-induced thrillers. 😅
And of course also to the director who skillfully brings this awesome writing to our visuals, making us truly feel the drama deserves awards, and of course high rating here. And that is that."
1636,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"If you are having a hectic day-to-day life, then this korean drama will be a good companion for your weekend!It amazed me with the simplicity the drama has to offer, yet every scene is beautifully performed by the actors and is such well written scene. The wording is also carefully thought out, often radiates a warm feeling.Thank you, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha :)"
1637,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a real gem, worth every second to watch. Chemistry between main lead, Kim SeonHo and Shin MinA is on the next level. Hopefully wishing all casts and staffs hard-work would be rewarded, they deserve all the appreciation and recognition.The writer, Shin Haeun, said the drama is just the amplitude of the big and small disturbances and emotions caused by a human-to-human entanglement yet I think it is a healing and beautiful story. I've learned a lot from this drama. I hope we all can live a life of which, just like Hong Banjang, we can say,
""I'm content with this life""."
1638,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I love this healing drama with warm vibes. There are life quotes about relationships not only between lovers, really interesting.I like all the characters development with stunning Gonjin scenery as background.I fall for HometownChaChaCha villagers and of course our beloved HongBanjang who is multi-talented 😊"
1639,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Love the female characters and how it always tackles women issues. Without looking it up on the internet, you just know the writer is a woman. Sk has many women writer, but to use the platform to bring up women issues not only once or twice should be appreciated."
1640,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Don't get discouraged from the few people who rated this series badly. I know a lot of people find it cringey and too superficial but i find it healing --- this makes you smile and it definitely warms your heart amidst this chaotic world of all-knowing people --- its simplicity is its beauty.
1641,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I honestly didn't expect much from this show. Started it on a whim because things got intense for me watching other series. And stayed because this show feels homey! Such beautiful visuals, both the cast and the location. Story progresses beautifully, fills the hunger of wanting more from supporting characters. Like, there's not many dramas where it makes you feel like everyone is the main characters. Don't listen to all those saying, it's slow blah blah blah.. let me tell you.. don't watch this because you are bored.. Watch this show when you are Sad, it will definitely cheer you up, take your mind off of the bad things.. :)"
1642,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,It was a pleasure watching them every weekend.now I feel sad my weekend will not be as existing as it was. I really enjoyed their love story. They were so adorable. I learnt about things.you should not hold back your emotions too much. As time passed it becomes burden for you. Let the sadness out from your mind and body. Really loved the drama.will be missing them.
1643,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I hate it! It's a pure waste of time for absolutely nothing, it has a little comedy but total lack of a story! And a spirit! It was a very bad experience for me...."
1644,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I love how the story displayed that each person has each own battle/s..and the best we can do is to always choose to understand and be kind to everyone.I love all the actors, the Gonjin family and most especially the leads, Kim SeonHo and Shin MinAh. I admire their chemistry as lead couple. I enjoyed watching them and they made my heart flutter.Highly recommended drama."
1645,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"At first i was too hesistant to watch it... then, i saw the male lead character (kim seon ho).. gosh he's so handsome!! It was my first time seeing him in kdramas... then, i begin to enjoy the show... it's so funny to watch... it makes me feel good and feeling so inlove.. once you start watching this... you don't wanna watch toxic/violent series for a while..."
1646,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I loved the setting and the village characters I loved the slow-building romance with just a little bit hint of bedroom time. I was especially pleased to see a professional woman who wasn't a corporate witch. But then it started to fall apart. I hated the wardrobe for Shin Min Ah's character it ranged from matronly to juvenile and was very confusing i got really sick of the big puffy sleeves and knee socks. What made it hard to watch was when the two got together she acted like a person in their early twenties or even younger. I know she has a reputation for adorable but this was sickly sweet and didn't match the age of her character. However, when things got serious the acting really improved and I like the last two episodes much more than the ones that came right before them. I'm going to watch more of Shin Min Ah's work to get a more well rounded picture of her acting skills."
1647,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,The cutest yet healing love story. It will just warm your heart. Some may find the couple clingy but we all act childish around the people we love so it's all okay ❤
1648,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I watched HomCha with not much high expectations tbh. I liked the cast since I know they are all good actors, but this being a remake of an old movie didn't excited me a lot. Now after watched all 16 episodes I can say that I love this drama with my life, really. The writer did a great job adaptation the og movie storyline. There's so many iconic lines and iconic scenes that I'll never forget. I feel like I learned a lot watching Homcha. Ofc the script has flaws too but the top tier acting of the leads and the whole cast make everything work. The adlibs that this drama have are the best. I have a lot to say about this drama but I just gonna end this saying that Hometown ChaChaCha is a drama that I can confident re watch from time to time."
1649,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I've watched kdrama for 10years + now and Hometown Cha Cha Cha is THE BEST HEALING DRAMA I'VE EVER WATCHED 💯 love all the characters & their acting is superb. Kim Seon Ho did a really great job potray Hong Du Sik. His acting is in another level!
1650,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"In a world of ugliness and negativeness that we are living now, this drama can brings you peace and calmness and sweetness ...They put so much emotion and meaning in a simple storyline... it is healing drama... and I must say the actor kim seonho who played honbanjan was so realistic in acting .. his performance was top notch..so good."
1651,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I like the story it's a simple story drama.. All the cast very good..really a healing drama we can learn a lot.. Thank you hometown cha cha cha make me feel happy.. The best drama for me..
1652,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I have watched Shin Mina's other Korean drama series and enjoyed them all. Made sure to catch this one and it exceeded my expectations. A lot of Kdramas recently focus on fantasy or young romance. This series is refreshing as it centers around 2 mature adults who are very different and yet care for others in a similar manner. It takes place in a remote seaside village and the cinematography is beautiful. The bonus is there is a lot of character development for all the cast members, not just the 3 main leads. Without giving too much away, I highly recommend this series especially for those looking for an escape from your everyday."
1653,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"First I have to say when I started this I kinda questioned me whether I should watch this because rom-com isn't my cup of tea. But I was wrong I have to say after hometown cha cha cha I couldn't like any other k-dramas cause this was so good that I still can't get over the fact that It is over. This had everything. This had happy moments , sad moments,cringey moments everything..... one of the
best thing In this drama is the chemistry between the leads.damn they had chemistry more the periodic table. And other best part is the sub roles. They were perfect. Story is well written. And this drama gave us lot of life morals. One of the most memorable one for me is "" Life is not a mathematical equation....( watch the drama if you want to know the full verson)"" Give this a try definitely, this will be the best drama you have watched."
1654,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,I adore this series. It brings so much love and joy to the audience it's just my type of Kdrama to watch. Its heartwarming and can get quite emotional. The actors were outstanding and I loved how they worked together as a team with this masterpiece.
1655,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"A beautiful drama that goes beyond being just a romcom. I've watched it countless times and each time I've picked up something new watching the characters face various personal struggles yet persevere and overcome them.The sense of community and friendship portrayed throughout the drama in addition to the romance of the main couple is rather timely in a world where everyone is busy running an exhausting rat race and we no longer have time to spend quality time with the people who matter to us.Loved the chemistry between the main couple. Their acting was so natural and loved watching their relationship evolve through out the drama.Overall a wonderful, feel good, healing drama with romance as well as funny and serious moments in between. The entire cast did a superb job. Loved the story, the cast, cinematography and setting. It's simplicity is really the beauty of this drama offering a lot of food for thought."
1656,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Wonderful presentation of the beauty simplicity of country side to the international viewers.. wonderful actors everyone.. specially our best actor Kim Seonho ssi 💙 pretty Shin Min ah, halmeoni everyone poured their soul out , beautiful cinematography , very good direction, HOMCHA is the best🌊 healing drama.. will rewatch multiple times."
1657,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Homecha is the best K-romcom I've ever seen. This film is so healing, humance and perfect. I love Homecha, I love Sikhye and Gongjin too. And the actors Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah, they are so great. I hope they will have more awards with Homecha this year. Best drama. 10/10."
1658,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I didn't have any expectations when I first watched this.I thought just to pass the time. But little that I know, I fell in love with this drama wholly.The story is light and so relatable. The characters are not typical Korean drama characters. The love story is beautiful. Both characters gave positive impacts towards each other.I love the cinematography.I love how the neighbors are fussy but kind...
I love the morals and life advises they delivered.Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah played the characters very well, with their bickerings as strangers, friends and lovely bickerings, then their lovey dovey acts... Their actings are natural and sincere, masterclass actings.I love the closures of this drama, and how everyone live happily together, with a note that a typhoon may come, but it is okay as long as they are together.I would suggest this drama to everyone I know, for it is a healing drama, especially during this pandemic era."
1659,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This drama appeared at the exact right time. With the pandemic still going on, I was starting to lose hope. Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha reminded me of the precious human connections that we need in order to make life meaningful and enjoyable, coupled with the amazing cinematography and the beauty of their filming location.Each and every actor gave a brilliant performance, from the youngest kid to the oldest grandma. The main leads have oozing chemistry, anyone would have fallen for either one (or both) by the end of the drama. I would give anything to be able to watch this drama again for the first time. Until that happens, I'll just keep rewatching it."
1660,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Watch and replay many times and never get bored about story. It is like daily story that happen to all of us. Love kim seon ho and shin min ah and other actor and actress supporting this movie.
1661,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a healing rom-com drama. Never get bored with the drama. The plot, the scenery, the scripts and the casts of the drama really did well on potraying the drama well. Congrats Homcha."
1662,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,Wow Homcha was the only K-drama that hard to move on. I don't know how many times I rewatch it until I remembered the lines. It was actually an ordinary life that we miss so much in this never ending pandemic T^T and it heartwarming story will touch your soul..
1663,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Given the genre, I used to not expect much from this show. It was easy on the eyes which I like, and I thought that's about it. Somehow I ended up going in too deep, and finding myself journeying with the characters as they figure their own lives. I now understand why a lot of people fell in love with Hometown ChaChaCha. I'm glad I gave this show a shot cause it's been so long since I've seen a lighthearted drama deliver a storyline with this much justice."
1664,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This drama is a perfect break from EVERYTHING.It makes you go back to what really happens in REALITY, and give you break from all fantasy, suspense and thrilling scenes. Though the settings and the flow of the story is simple, there are parts that are still unpredictable. It perfectly REFLECTS LIFE that there are things that we can expect and things that come to us unexpectedly. That simplicity is what makes it more HEALING.I somehow relate with the male lead character, because there are really some moments in life where you just want to escape, and find a home that will comfort you. And I really wish to find my own Gongjin!The actors acting skills is a BIG BONUSSS! Great job to the whole cast and production team! Thank you for reminding me that there is beauty and genuine happiness in SIMPLICITY in these hard times! :)"
1665,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"What seems like a simple narrative actually delves into many facets of human relationships - how strangers become allies, friends, even family. There are no ""villains"" but there are secrets, heartaches, even trauma. OST is the LSS-type, scenes are postcard perfect, and the characters are quirky, warm, and genuine. It is a worthwhile drive to go visit and linger in Gongjin any time of the year."
1666,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This story is just so nice. The whole cast is good and has a role into making it funny, interesting and lovely. I don't think it is predictable, it has original elements well developed and the romance is not the entire focus."
1667,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Truly, this is my favorite show. It truly aspires me to be better than I am. This show makes me want to love and help others, and that's something the world desperately needs. <3."
1668,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The storyline is simple and predictable. If you expect something dramatic, this is not for you. All that matter in this drama is the dialogue and interaction among the characters. Although it is not all realistic, their natural acting makes this drama so healing and heartwarming. I highly recommend it to someone who wants a break from complex dramas/ world."
1669,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Unlike Hometown Cha Cha Cha's original source material Mr. Handy (2004)- a film that was riddled with erratic pacing, impassive sound design, underdeveloped characters and sexual assault tropes that absolve men and their crimes, on paper, this TVN adaptation sounds like a recipe for disaster. How is it possible for such a mediocre at best film in the 2000s to be adapted into a mini-series that remains both faithful to its source material yet at the same time creates so much more depth and nuance to its characters and story that in turn makes Mr. Handy look like the adaptation instead?The series begins on a similar trajectory as with the film- Yoon Hye-jin is a dentist in Seoul who quits her high paying dream job to start her own dental practice in Gongjin- a seaside town 3 hours away from the capital with no dental clinic of its own. There, her path coincides with an unemployed jack of all trades man Hong Du-sik (also known by everyone in town as Chief Hong) who challenges Hye-jin on her Seoulite attitudes and prejudice against the working class villagers.Yoon Hye-jin is a character that is written in an unusually unapologetic way for a South Korean drama female lead. She is a judgemental perfectionist with a high moral and ethical compass whilst also being an emotionally compulsive shopaholic, a monthly donator across various charities and a black out drunk. Her view of success in life revolves around the confines of having an apartment by the Han River, a prestigious education, a high-income paying job and the idea that meritocracy is not a myth. The complexities and contradictions of this character can become easily unlikeable and annoying depending on the pacing and the actress cast. Thankfully, Shin Mi-na portrayed each points of Hye-jin with layered nuances that made her relateable on her struggles in adjusting to village life but also at her protestations of the outdated views that still circulate in Gongjin.As the male lead, Hong Du-sik is a character that is seemingly written as Mr. Perfect whose happy go lucky attitude armed with his plethora of different work licences for his oddball jobs (and accepting only minimum wage) make him the go-to townsperson for everything they need help with. He surfs, cooks, crochets, fixes cars, reads Henry David Thoreau, owns a Leica IIIf, wears flannel shirts and even has a fruit plating license. He sounds about as unrealistic and pretentious as you can get with a hipster male lead; but due to the Shin Ha-eun's writing and Kim Seon-ho's modest acting, the end result is actually a subverted take on conventional hetero-masculinity that is rarely seen not just in South Korean shows but frankly everywhere.Labelled as a romantic comedy, I would actually say this is perhaps purely for marketing purposes to stage this show as a light hearted love story between two characters when really, it is a story about the lives of people who live in Gongjin and about overcoming grief. Yes, the leads are Yoon Hye-jin and Hong Du-sik, however the leads on average only take up about half the screen time each episode as the rest is divided and devoted to the supporting ensemble cast. The supporting characters do not exist in the story to serve the purpose of bringing the two leads together- in fact a lot of their problems do not relate to the leads at all, however, the realistic and often brutal and ugly at times dialogue that writer Ha-eun writes for each character gives us the sense that this picturesque idyllic town has its own problems just like Hye-jin and their stories are just as important as hers.When you compare Hometown Cha Cha Cha to Mr. Handy, the former keeps all the skeletal details of the latter and in addition, fleshes out all the unresolved and underdeveloped tensions in the storyline. Time is given for the cinematography to establish Gongjin as a character in itself alongside the cast. The acoustic guitar riffs between each episode set the tone of a rom-com but it also noticeably shifts to sombre piano notes as the series takes a melancholic shift in the latter part of the show. Whilst the show's ending can be said by some to be too ideally optimistic, the journey that these characters take to end up where they are is painful, harrowing, hilarious and bittersweet."
1670,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"The show had a very promising start but fizzles out towards the end. It relies heavily on lazy writing. It starts to feel like the story relies on overdone, over the top kdrama sob story tropes. A good story and plot humanizes characters and make them more relatable. Towards the end of this series you stop feeling for most of the side characters because they are so inhuman and unrelatable in the sense that they not only have over the top sob stories but also in that they react to their situations as individuals that completely lack common sense. The plot is saved by the energy and development poured into the main couple's love story but otherwise the last 5 episodes of the series feel like filler episodes written out to fulfill a contract obligation rather than being as a love letter to kdramas."
1671,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"This show tries so hard to sell a predictable fantasy..And Domino's Pizza and Kopico.Seriously though, it's like a tv version of a kid's meal. You know exactly what you're gonna get. If the cliche's didn't already, the flagrant product placement erases any semblence of believability.The first half had me giving it the benefit of the doubt, but then filler episodes and predictable plot ""twists"" just made it a drag.Maybe this is considered one of the better ones, but this is the first Korean Drama I've watched and I don't see the appeal."
1672,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,This show is my healer. Most heart warming show I have ever watched. Emotions are beautiful. I love to be part of Gongjin family. Each & every crew member given their best. I was going through a tough phase. This show helped me to recover from that tough phase. It has lots of smiles & tears. I think whole crew for this beautiful show. Everyone pls do watch. World needs such calm shows now to sustain the kindness in human heart. ❤
1673,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"If you are feeling low or if you are bored, just watch it you won't regret. Peaceful plot, great ethics, cute love story."
1674,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"So fun to see a fresh original show that shines with love and heart. You love the town characters, the grannies, the kids, the relationships and the quaint seaside town. Great script and actors made us want to return night after night for more. Maybe a sequel?"
1675,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"You can enjoy the story connect with people and sail through it , as it offers mixture of emotions beautiful secnery and it covered all the age groups. Shows every phase of life makes you understand how we miss the little things in the life and regret it later. It is subtle and enjoyable. It delivers a simple story and everyone can take whatever they like from it."
1676,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Loved this Korean drama, a complete rouser. Heartwarming, relaxing, funny, emotionally fulfilling ,cute.The characters are really lovable. A voyage to the countryside of South Korea. The music is really nice, I just cannot stop listening the soundtracks."
1677,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"I love such dramatic stories and I love this series, I like it very much."
1678,Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,"Right now, I am obsessed with this drama. Loved every bit of this drama. If you want to watch a good and soothing drama, go for it.I usually hate watching love triangles. But in this drama, they maturely handle the situation. Also, I appreciate the way the actress supported Du-sik the whole time.How can I forget about the side characters? From the youngest Bora to the oldest Miss Gam-RI, I loved everyone. Nowadays, everyone is busy. No one has time to check out their neighbours. I miss the old times.Everyone should watch this."

1866,Thirty Nine,This modern series features 3 girl friends aged 39. Their problems are those of grown ups like family and illness. Son Ye Jin looking much like she did in Crash Landing's Seri plays a dermatologist. The second girl friend is about to fall for a younger man. The third is terminally ill. The terminal illness thing was just done in Song Hye Kyo's Now We are Breaking Up. That's not the only similarity. The first episode also features a sexual relationship and then the couple starts the relationship from the beginning. I think this one is better. The dialogue is good and the relationships are mature and supportive. It's only 12 episodes so it shouldn't have become draggy but half way through there is too much about the terminal illness. The pace slows down too much. And they take a long time to say a simple thing. The writer is at fault. Also Yeon Woo Jin as the male lead is a bit bland.
1867,Thirty Nine,"What's in K-dramas that makes them so appealing? This particular film is no exception. Pacing is languid; it takes its time telling the story but, surprisingly, you don't feel bored because each new episode churns out something new. There's a lot of crying, which is typical in K-dramas, yet it doesn't seem melodramatic or absurdly hysterical. Rather it's an authentic evocation of emotions.The film portrays what ""best friends forever"" truly means. The three lead actresses resonate in their performances. Through thick and thin, in good times and bad, they stick together.Good actors all around. The script is smartly written, nothing is superfluous. Cinematography is fine.Watch this film to learn something profound about life as we know it."
1868,Thirty Nine,"I came on here and saw someone rated 39 as a 1 and labeled it a ""snore fest "" which literally made me fume so I'm reviewing despite the drama not being completed. I'd like to say that I am finding it real, funny and beautiful to watch! The friendship angle is fabulous! Please ignore the incredibly unfair 1 rating!!! Son Ye Jin is wonderful in this series!"
1869,Thirty Nine,"The writer & editor perfectly designed the storyline in fast mode. Jumping scene to scene is smartly connected with e.g phone call between one to the other character without loosing the story essence. This is great and as far as I watch kdrama this new at least to me.The acting of the casts to me are splendid, Main cast e.g Mido perfectly played in her role as semi girly woman which loving married guy and mostly put her shelf to backup her besties. The emotion, gesture & expression just perfect!Son Yejin, no doubt to me. In any movie and drama I seen her always brave to show different type of characters and successfully hypnotized me to join her anger with mido bf and in the scene brought me laugh with her silly face defence the farting was not hers.Kim Jihyuning as an innocent 39 woman made the friendship are just perfect and with the all characters compositionNot boring. I sense that because during the show, each of the scenes i followed almost 100% - afraid of missing important story, this type of style fit well on meWoojin, I knew him from this show as a sweet, caring & loving man I would say superb. Small gesture, eyes play, words already showing the strong characters of doctor which unexpectedly in love with mijoMijo sister is a show stealer even she has few scene but succesfully made this drama a great show.Looking forward for the next episode."
1870,Thirty Nine,"I love the camaraderie of these girls. I like the way the script jumps from the present to the past to show how our heroines got to where they are. Failed relationships and choices that have unintended consequences, just life. We know from the get-go that there is heartache coming. I appreciated how we see the raw emotions that we all feel at times, so well portrayed. Binged watch what I could so far. It reminds us that no matter what we go through, it is wonderful to have friends and family that have our backs."
1871,Thirty Nine,"I have never seen a line-up of reviews with tens in a row except for the snore-fest. But that's unfortunate.Sometimes, not often, we find a gem in Netflix, these days the gems come most often from K-drama. This one, is surely a gem. From every angle, it shines, from the acting, from the script, from the story, from the dynamics of the three friends, from the human-interest, I think you get my meaning. Those three friends, the camaraderie,, the banter, the jesting, the kidding, the ribbing, everything about them rings so true and so perfect. You forget you are watching a movie, you feel like you are eavesdropping on these friends, the script, the lines are so well written, so natural, true to life, the way those girls bring the lines from pages to the story, is superb. This is exactly the way three close friends interact.Hollywood has not given us anything close to this kind of spectacular human interaction movie in decades. The closes I can think of is Sleepless in Seattle. These day, Hollywood banks on their ace actors, Top Gun, Independence Day, Monkey men, action heroes, Marvel characters, Spiderman, Ironman, Batman, Superman, etc. When was the last time we had a movie from Hollywood that tug at our heart-strings, make us tear up? You get all these from K-dramas.If you want an example, check this out, and don't wake up snore-fest from his sleep."
1872,Thirty Nine,I've started watching Thirty Nine episodes in Korean Language with English subtitles just becoz of Son YeJin as I'm still having the hangover of YeJin's cuteness from Crash Landing On You.Even of the Korean audio I'm still enjoying this series. It's just craziness of YeJin.The story line up is good and all the characters justifying their roles.Till now I'm done with half of the season and looking forward to see more.
1873,Thirty Nine,Snorefest....the movie is only on its second episode...if you have been watching any drama..specifically Kdrama... the first few episodes DONOT REFLECT the whole Essence of the story... old school? Where have you been hiding? This current regular day life story...The 2 episodes gave a a bombastic scenes. I'm looking forward to the next episodes and wondering how this will evolve as the relationships and friendships is greatly affected by the news...Before you judge.... Wait until the end... you nincompoops...unless you are a movie/tv director and made such riveting movies under your belt...then you decide ... but wait until the end of the episodes.
1874,Thirty Nine,"Thirty-Nine tells the story of three friends aged 39 as they navigate love, friendships, life and unexpected loss. The trio has known each other since they were 18 and their bond has only grown stronger with time. The three ladies are Cha Mi Jo, Jeong Chan Young and Jang Joo Hee, played by Son Ye Jin, Jeon Mi Do and Kim Ji Hyun, respectively. Cha Mi Jo is demure and loving, Jeong Chan Young is bratty and blunt and Jang Joo Hee is timid and cute. The trio complement and understand each other, and have chosen to stay single.This drama really worth to watch. Love it so much."
1875,Thirty Nine,"I love how the story is real and relatable. Not to mention the chemistry of the 3 leads, Son Ye Jin, Jeon Mi-do and Kim Ji-hyun. Love them. This slice of life drama is worth watching!"
1876,Thirty Nine,"The storyline, actings and messages are delivered perfectly! The scene where Son Ye Jin (Dr. Cha Mi Jo) cries on the last scene of Episode 2 broke my heart sooo bad...
I luv the chemistry among The 39 Besties also. It's very worth to watch!"
1877,Thirty Nine,"It's a great drama!Very worth to watch. The chemistry among The 39 Besties (Cha Mi-jo, Jeong Chang-young and Jang Joo-hee) is undeniable. It has mix emotions in it. The storyline, actings and messages are delivered perfectly!"
1878,Thirty Nine,"I watched it wiht no high expectations and i love the storyline and chemistry between the ledies, its so much fun and the plot very fast 1hour and i enjoy it, but eps 2 the mayor plot have been out but i keep in going to watch this drama.. happy watching."
1879,Thirty Nine,"A simple but meaningful slice of life. Tells about friendship, love, and career. Teaches that life is about leaving or being left behind. The stunning acting of the cast makes us feel their emotions too."
1880,Thirty Nine,"This drama story is relatable for people in their 30s. Love the storyline of the friendship between the three and the romance between Mijo and Seon Woo.Not to mention the best acting of the three, each has a strong character. It's only started 2 episodes but their chemistry is already very strong. Can't wait to watch the next episodes.Slice of life drama that is able to make the audience's emotions go up and down; from happiness, sadness, warmth of friendship to butterflies in the stomach.Highly recommend this drama for those who like slice of life dramas!"
1881,Thirty Nine,"I saw her rating NABU 10 stars, some SHK fans are really low. The kind of antics people from a certain fandom are pulling to drag Yejin. Pretty sure this user hasn't watched a single moment of Thirty Nine but bitterness and hatred have consumed them. Why so bothered? 🙄🙄🙄"
1882,Thirty Nine,Intense acting of Ye Jin .. the actors have great chemistry i like Kim Ji Hyun character too. Cast shines effortless . The scene of both Mido and chan young makes me me cry an ocean .. CH character is such a martyr when it comes to love yet so endearing .
1883,Thirty Nine,Its heartwarming drama 1 and 2 episode all actors are impressive even the supporting cast were all amazing .. no boring scene.. the 3 leads were so adorable Son Ye jin cheerful to intense acting was amazing she the best actress for nothing.
1884,Thirty Nine,"All the cast are perect for each role , Mido versatility and Kim Ji hyun cute acting with the powerful and ins=tense acting of Son Yejin . The male cast were so adorable especially Woojin character. This such a healingd rama of friendship and relationship ."
1885,Thirty Nine,"I'm not even in my 30s or 40s but I enjoy this series, it is not about your age is.. It is about how you see life and people around you. Any age can enjoy this cause it technically about life. You can encounter some real life events, conflict and mistakes from each cast. As a fan of Son Yejin, I won't lie that when she confirm her appearance into this drama I feel like 'noooo.' cause slice of life is not really my thing but as what I said, this slice of life won't be boring, no way as in even a bit. Some people even says ""A drama's success is base from its genre."" but after this, I would go to ""It depends to the actors, on how they will deliver each scene.""A slice of life with a twist, something you won't regret to watch."
1886,Thirty Nine,The actors are excellent especially Son yejin...That's why she is called The Nation's First Love...Bravo SonYejin. I love also the way Jeon Mido plays her character. This drama deserve an award..Im pretty sure Son Yejin bagged another best actress award fo this show.
1887,Thirty Nine,"What a stellar performance from the actresses.. ..as an avid of sonyejin there no doubt in her acting powers . It's first time for me to see mido and johee.. and I'm quite amaze i. Their performance too.. the story line is so much relatable..... The emotions in each episode is a roller coaster ride.. i can feel sadness, anger excitement,, hope all in one episode.. i even smile, laugh and cry alone while watching this... Hoping for more episodes.... It's my first to sleep late at night to watch a drama...q."
1888,Thirty Nine,"The story is relatable very realistic nowadays..they potray it very well,..I cry laugh and cry again while watching Thirty-nine..they are amazing!..esp Son Ye Jin..really a great actress!... I hope I can find a friend like Mi Jo😊"
1889,Thirty Nine,"SYJ versatillity as an artist in front of a camera is always worth watching. This drama makes us wish that we too have friends like them who would be with us in sickness and in health, in ups and downs (rollercoaster/bumpy ride), laugh and cry with us, hit us hard when things seem not right. The casts are superb."
1890,Thirty Nine,"So far The plot of this drama is quite fast and not boring. The story is very realistic. The acting of the actors is amazing so the emotions are conveyed well. Many messages can be taken from this drama, especially in terms of friendship. Must watch!"
1891,Thirty Nine,"It's a drama that makes you think a lot about life.It makes you feel how important it is to protect and create precious people. Am I becoming such a friend to someone? Do I have a friend like that? I feel sad for the time limit of ""Chanyoung"", but I envy these women's brilliant friendship. All actors' acting is excellent, especislly Yejin's acting is admired. I completely fell in love with her amazing acting skills that flexibly move back and forth between joy, anger and sorrow."
1892,Thirty Nine,"This is a heavy and realistic drama. But, I like this type of drama. About adoptive parents/family (ChaMijo & Sowon). There are happy moments & emotional journey. Friendship goal between ChaMjo, Chanyoung & Joohee. They are always there ups and downs. From this drama I really appreciate all my best friend. I try to find quality time with them. This drama is real life situation. If u understand the story, u can feel it."
1893,Thirty Nine,Honestly one of the worst KDrama I have ever watched! No character development and the whole story revolves around Mi-Jo even though CY is the one dying.
1894,Thirty Nine,A slice of life drama with an awesome cast that is realistic and relatable at the same time. Not everyone's cup of tea but a must watch to those who knows how to appreciate these type of genre :)
1895,Thirty Nine,"I'm really loving and enjoying this slice of life drama so far. The take of this drama on life has been a breath of fresh air. It has portrayed a realistic & relatable take on friendship, life, and love that's gotten me hooked just from the pilot episode.The drama's style of story-telling is quite different, but it's actually made me more curious and excited to see how they approach the rest of the season. This is definitely worth starting & following!Can't go wrong with the cast as well - they did a great job casting Son Yejin, Jeon Mido, & Kim Jihyun together, and I look forward to what the rest of the cast & the drama has in store for us."

1926,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Nam Joo Hyuk does very well here so far. There's something about the way he uses his eyes that allows few words to be spoken yet the intensity of his emotions can be felt.Kim Tae-ri does well too, but needs to tone down her theatrical gestures and speaking. She'll need to remember that in a smaller screen, theatrical movements and delivery of lines can be off-putting and jarring.Story is refreshing. Can't wait for the upcoming episodes!"
1927,Twenty Five Twenty One,What else do u need to watch a drama !? This series a full package of everything u want!! And the cinematography of this series is extra plus point which make me hooked up with this series!! The starting of this drama was in a unusual way which was interesting to draw our attention..then the plot was totally like boom... this is what u were waiting for to watch!!Beck Yi Jin's struggles between dropping dream and choosing responsibility and Na Hee Do's determination for her game and the friendship of 5 struggling students in their early 20 nothing could be more better than this amazing plot !! After a long time Netflix brought us something worthy of watchingEnjoy watching 25/21.
1928,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Only four episodes have been released yet and I'm already in love with all of the characters! The story is so inspiring and wholesome. The leads have amazing chemistry. Na Hee Do is definitely a memorable character and reminds me so much of Doek Sun from reply 1988! If you're looking for a K- drama with a similar vibe to Reply 1988, this is it."
1929,Twenty Five Twenty One,It's only been one episode for me but it's brilliantly written and performed..excellent balance of humor and emotion. All about persistence in recovering dreams in the midst of a financial crisis.
1930,Twenty Five Twenty One,"A mind refreshing start of Twenty Five Twenty One!! Really enjoying till now !! Students at their early twenties dealing with theirs family problems and also The IMF crisis how affect their lives showing in this drama!!Cast :
Nam Jo Hyuk and Lee TaeRi the perfect cast ever I've seen as far now !! They both are playing their role so smoothly that it seems like we are really living in 1998 ! Na Hee Do's dedication towards her
sports is really ambitious.Hope it will continue being this good and make us feel more refreshed <3."
1931,Twenty Five Twenty One,"2 episodes released so far great start, nam noo Hyuk acting skills are on a another level, without a doubt this is gonna be one of the best kdramas of 2022 so far."
1932,Twenty Five Twenty One,"I loved the concept of this one , every character is crafted beautifully . But the only problem is unnecessary yelling by the main character Na hee do , she can't just keep calm . I had a severe headache after watching 2 episodes , you never know when she starts yelling at the top of her lungs . So im gonna watch it on mute from now on . Still the story is a must watch . Story line is intriguing. You gotta have to watch and wait for next episode to see what happens next to these characters and how their love story unfolds ."
1933,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Loving this series so far, the story, cast, editing, sound... its definitely worth watching. Joohyuk is a gem, he only gets better with each project and Im sure he will be making good for years to come. Taeri is a bit too much here, always screaming but I just figured its part of the portrayal. I have never been annoyed by a hairstyle, does it really have to be like that? I feel like combing or cutting it every time she's in the scene.I love the story and the message its conveying, the hardships, determination, being understanding to others in their lowest days. This is not a silly, rom-com piece, its a drama with just the right balance of fun acts. Overall its definitely something you should watch."
1934,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Different but very warm drama. Between the hyper girl and cool guy, comes the unique '90s vibes as well as the beautiful cinematography, coloring, and music to give us a great viewing experience. I hope it continues like this and I really expect that.."
1935,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Both main lead are quite Amazing, Both have descent and shy relationship and the way Nam joo hyuk is sensitive and Care a lot for his circle was amazing.Second leads are also quite hilarious and Internally sad like other teen-ager are.Overall quite unique and Smooth Series. Appreciable!!!"
1936,Twenty Five Twenty One,"This is a rare drama that comes up with well written storyline, beautiful cinematography (can we call it as an art? The details just wow!), I can invest in all the characters individually and also bond shown in this drama. Thank you for all of them behind this drama, for not focusing in the main lead, but gives everyone depth development. All emotions are so real and relatable. This drama just keeps on getting better and better in each episode."
1937,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Amazing!!!! CANT wait for the next episodes. It has romance,motivation,friendship,funny scenes and it is set in the 90's..what else could u possibly ask for??Koreans did it again❕❕"
1938,Twenty Five Twenty One,"For some reason ..whenever I watch a new episode of Twenty Five Twenty One..I find myself checking how long I still have left till it ends..not because I'm bored ..but to see how much more of its goodness I still have time to enjoy..it's that precious!A beautiful series with wholesome characters that deserve the world ! It fuels some nostalgia and makes you revisit those sentimental times of your first love..
It has one of the most gorgeous scenery..every frame feels like it's taken from a Ghibli movie!"
1939,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Very relevant to our lives, so many struggles. Most dramas are showing only the good side of life, but this one is not. The spirit of Hee Do n Yi Jin inspire me, no matter how much they've been dumped."
1940,Twenty Five Twenty One,"One of the best Kdrama i have ever seen Can't wait for the next episode In each week it getting interesting more and more The plot twist and flow of the story was excellent and mesmerising I love this series so much The romance, comedy, action, motivation real life truth shown in this series hits hard while watching it, I hope it ends on good meet."
1941,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Watching after completing stressful exams, it is so much refreshing. The whole casts are awesome from their parts, waiting for the upcoming episodes..Highly recommended."
1942,Twenty Five Twenty One,"This drama is very inspiring..
There are many moral messages that can be learned from this drama..
Good serial drama.. LOVE IT.Hope it will end with HAPPY ending.."
1943,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Yes it is for sure it would hit
And indeed it has something or I say it has everything to get so
Nomatter whatever happen but it is a cake that everyone one on their birthday."
1944,Twenty Five Twenty One,"10/10 for T5T1 and Nam Jo hyuk, Kim tae-ri and other supporting roles. I'm in love with...T5T1 right now. I'm badly and eagerly waiting for the release of new episodes on weekends."
1945,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Ongoing in high power.The story is set in 1998 and tells the stories of youth who find new direction and growth after having their dreams taken away. Two people first meet when they are 22 and 18 years old and fall in love years later when they turn 25 and 21.Na Hee Do is a fencing athlete whose high school team was disbanded due to the IMF crisis. Although her dreams appeared to have collapsed in front of her, she forged ahead into her future without giving up. Baek Yi Jin is the eldest son of a family that is torn apart due to the IMF crisis. Despite his difficult background, he works hard to become a reporter.Go Yoo Rim is a fencer who is on the national team, and the rival of Na Hee Do, who is the same age as her. Although she showcases a fierce charisma as a fencer, she turns into a cute and lovable person with a hidden steely core when she takes off her fencing uniform. Moon Ji Woong is a social media star who is aiming to become Today's Member (a highlighted user) on Cyworld, Korea's top social media network of the early 2000s. Ji Seung Wan is the top student at school who hides a secret wish to rebel."
1946,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Brilliant acting by the cast, takes one down memory lane. It feels alot like like Reply series minus the parents ofcourse. The struggle is real and its raw and emotions of youth. Highly recommended."
1947,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Very refreshing drama and really sweet, but what makes it stand out is certainly Nam Joo Hyuk! He is wonderful in every way. His eyes, expressions, body language... make every scene he is in so much more intense."
1948,Twenty Five Twenty One,"Twenty Five, Twenty One is such an inspiring TV show with heart-warming love&friendship stories and tons of humorous touches(the most hilarious show I have seen this year). Na Hee-do has the magic of reminding viewers of their days of pursuing the dream.""Despite all the failures, I want to do this because I still find it so much fun."""

1972,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"Entering episode 3 , i feel not excited .It may because the story was plain or no sparks between the main cast . I expect more as drama to watch over weekend."
1973,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"Yes, totally ruined it. Maybe I have too much expectations after coming from watching a good show like Hometown Cha Cha Cha.Negatives1) Age matters. The guy looks like a 20 year old kid and girl 40+. How the hell I am suppose to wrap my head around this fact. Poor chemistry hence forth.2) Visuals. Looks fake and too artistic, too exposed, too much lighting, too much white tone. In short unreal. Real South Korea is beautiful why try to ruin it.3) Getting laid. Too early in the show when the main leads have sexual encounters without any chemistry and that too when they are drunk, it takes the entire fun out of the romance.4) Stop copying west. Lately more and more Korean shows have started copying western romance genre. Please don't do that. You owe your sucess to the uniqueness which your shows offered.5) The actress. I know her from hit show ""What's wrong with secretary Kim"". But in this show she looked bland and expressionless in her feelings.PositivesNONEConclusionI will skip this show since I have already lots of amazing stuff waiting to be watched in my library."
1974,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"Show is heart fluttering. It is new for me to see Park Min Young giving orders and not taking so this is refreshing. And what to talk about Song Kang, who is bad for heart, either toxic ( nevertheless ) or hopelessly romantic in this one.I am liking this show. ❤"
1975,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"Most reviewers consider this drama boring due to its lack of dramatic ups and downs. If that's what you're after then you should indeed give this one a miss. So far I am liking this drama a lot. I like that there are no sadistic boss that screams at and tortures the staff non-stop; no friend or colleague to betray you at any step; no evil and all-powerful chairman whose only goal is to destroy our poor hero or heroine and no corrupt police chief to do his bidding; no serial killer lurking around either so far... What we have are pretty normal people with typical challenges in their lives that most of us can relate to one way or another. When it comes to the love lives of the leads and supporting casts, they are realistic. No one is perfect and each person comes with his/her defects or personal trauma. That makes them real. That makes them human. Yet if all this sounds too serious, IMO show somehow manages to bring a very lighthearted and positive atmosphere so it definitely feels like a comedy with many opportunities for a smile or two. We'll see how the 2nd half goes but so far I am really enjoying these sympathetic characters despite, or because of, their occasional pathetic behaviors."
1976,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"The lead actors Park Min Young and Song Kang's coupling is NOT sexy. There isn't any chemistry between these two actors. The decade age difference in this instance does not work. It feels like a mother and child relationship and when they kiss, yuck, I fast forward. The Bak Yoon and Yura coupling is the same age difference and similar story, because the actors don't have any chemistry and feels uncomfortable to watch. The leads were miscast. The supporting cast is good, but there isn't an interesting story for them either. This series is so boring and slow paced. The acting doesn't feel real and then the actors become boring and predictable to watch."
1977,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,The plot is dry. The lovestory is average.Everything is too...okay.I was hoping a lot more with Song Kang and the female lead. But sadly this time they didn't end up with a better write-up.
1978,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,Very good screenplay and great casting. The following drama will give you a glimpse of Office romance and give you the joy and enjoyment to finish the drama full. The lead character park Min Young and Song Kang played the role greatly and their performence will inspire you watch the full drama as well as to watch more melodrama genre dramas. And also this drama will change the thought of those people who think that melodramas are bornig . The director and writer will be able change the thought of people about melodramas . I really enjoyed the drama hope you will enjoy too.this drama was the best dramas i have ever seen. I highly recommend to see this drama to others. If anyone sees this review please watch the drama one time and you will understand what i am trying to say.
1979,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"Not worth to watch. No chemistry, the story is so boring, slow, n expected. This drama doesn't make me wonder of the next eps, not gaining my curiosity at all. Nothing special here."
1980,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,We're really enjoying this series so far. Great casting...Song Kang and Park Min-young are adorable and fun to watch as always and the series also has a stellar supporting cast.
1981,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,I really enjoyed their love story episode 6th was soooo good!!!!!!! I'm badly waiting for next episode. Meanwhile in episode 6th they will also clear their misunderstandings and they also start discussing to live together.... well see what will happen in next episode I'm badly waiting for next episode.
1982,Meteorological Administration People: Office Romance Cruelty,"This is drama that not always let your tears dries out.I know you want a Korean love story with deep conflict, but thanks god this is just different and feels good."

1994,Mr. Sunshine,"Joseon Korea began to be influenced by Japanese expansion in the late 1800s which is where this series & the story of our main character begins. It continued until the end of WWII, however, this series only follows its central characters into the early 1900s. As is typical for dramatized historical pieces found in most countries the host nation is simplistically portrayed as courageous & righteous - basically really good guys while the enemy is stereotypically mostly immoral, nasty, brutish, evil baddies. An obvious hard sell on patriotism. Our three main nation protagonists are the Koreans (half good, other bad); Americans (mostly bad, some good); Japanese (almost all bad).Six dvds (24 episodes) for those who have a lot of excess time to spend watching a bit of history packed with a lot of stretched-out, prolonged filler of conflicts & romantics. Acting, CGI, cinematography, sets, props all well done. Title could have been better chosen as it harkens back to a low consequence English lesson on word choices w/the letter ""S""."
1995,Mr. Sunshine,"Mr Sunshine is a long ride. 24 episodes long, with a massive plot, great performances and a tragic ending, this one is not one of the usual fluff k dramas. Now, I'm only a bit familiar with Korean history, so I'm not sure if this drama was historically accurate. But if you don't mind your dramas to be kind of fictional and you like to focus on the current story that you are watching, then you won't be disappointed with this drama. 
However, even though the story was good and very impressive, the drama had a slow start. It felt like it was dragging on for the first half. In the second half, fortunately, it picked up. The action scenes were more plenty and the plot thickened. Kudos for the ending as well, as it was bold to conclude things like this. 
Moreover, the performances were excellent from all the actors and they were many many characters in this drama, so it was harder to pull off concistant performances from all of them. One thing that bothered me though, was the constant changing of the language of the dialogues throughout the drama. But that might not bother everyone. 
Finally, the costumes and settings were really good and felt original and well made. Though the soundtrack wasn't that impressive, it suited the drama's mood well enough. 
So, overall, 7 out of 10."
1996,Mr. Sunshine,Very enjoyable series telling the early struggle of Korea to overcome Japanese influence and occupation. As with many Korean dramas we have lots of strong characters with fascinating back stories. All 3 male leads love a Korean noble lady who is also a freedom fighter and only one can win her heart. The series is well filmed and acted and the director wrings out the emotions very well. As it should be with all good series I was very sad to finish it.
1997,Mr. Sunshine,"I have been watching movies and shows for over forty years. And, yes, this show is THAT good! After watching ""Descendants of the Sun"" only a couple of years ago, I was wondering how long it would be before another grand series came about; a series that resonates with the heart and soul; a series with a crisp story and fantastic performances by the actors. And along came ""Mr. Sunshine.""I can only think of a couple of series that are on par with ""Mr. Sunshine."" ""Band of Brothers"" is one and ""Descendants of the Sun"" is another.What is truly sad is that much of the world is quite ignorant when it comes to Korean history, I'm sure. It's a country that always seems to be at odds with Japan, and sometimes China and Russia as well. Its turbulent history has too often been plagued by invasions or other countries attempting to gain control of the small peninsula.""Mr. Sunshine"" tells of the time when Korea was, once again, fighting against Japanese occupation in the beginning of the 20th century. With virtually no real army to speak of and a king with little power on the throne, Korea or ""Joseon"" found itself relying on rebel guerilla tactics to try and prevent the Japanese from a complete takeover.Several characters find themselves unknowingly intertwined with each other at the outset of the series. One boy finds himself quickly orphaned and making his way to America to begin a new life. He returns to Joseon years later as a U.S. Marine Captain. Little does he know how the turn of events would pull him into the conflict between his previous homeland and Japan.The story's focal point is on three men who all happen to have feelings for the same woman, Go Ae-shin; a woman with a background as terrible and wrought with horror as the marine captain's. And yet, she is the heart and soul of the rebel forces. It is admirable and captivating to see this woman spearhead the rebellion, as well as her willingness to do whatever it takes to help her country. Tae-Ri Kim is perfectly cast, giving Ae-shin tremendous depth and complexity to her character.The cast is simply magnificent from top to bottom. Every role, no matter how large or small, is handled with immaculate precision and depth. However, there is, to my mind, one who stands out just a hair above the rest. And that is Byung-Hun Lee as Eugene Choi, the marine captain. The man has a regal distinction that very few actors in history have been able to pull off with such ease. He may appear to be emotionless in many of his scenes, but to make such an assumption would be wholly inaccurate. I've said many times: an actor/actress who can say more with their eyes than with words, is a true master at their craft. Byung-Hun Lee is such a performer. I cannot imagine anyone else playing this part with the integrity and depth that he brings to Eugene Choi.This is quite literally a ""Do not miss!"" series. With 24 episodes, each at about 75 minutes each, you are in for a wonderful treat. This is a show to savor. One might be wishing to quickly move on to the next episode, but I found myself stepping back and letting each episode soak within me instead. Like a perfect French dessert, you relish taking your time and savoring each bite. This is such a series."
1998,Mr. Sunshine,"First of all, sorry for my poor english. Pl use more imagination and i think you still can get my idea. Casting-different from dots, male and female handpicked by writer kim. No doubt mr sunshine excel dots. Writer kim is bold to use 47 old BH Lee regardless of his extramarital affair. He did look tired towards middle of the drama, but this is compensated by his stablely superb acting skill and language ability. He has always no facial expression but his eyes are acting. Comparing to him, female lead is less stable, but i think is still up to standard.2nd and 3rd male lead are themselves male lead in their own dramas, and are younger and have many fans themselves. So this will balance out the age issue of the male lead. The fat maid of aesin shines through the whole story providing comic effect by means of her funny dialogue and expression.Storyline-the first 2 epd are confusing. But i stick to it because of its excellent cinematography. Before the middle of the story, there are virtually too many accidential encounter of our two lovebirds, making the story a bit unnatural. I think eugene and aesin should establish earlier their way of exchanging letters. Other than that, the storyline is great with politics, romance, war, invasion, revenge, bromance, sister romance.......an all-in drama that must have something to attract you. The many sudden twists are pounding my heart, like conversation on icy river, aesin's assignment to shoot eguene, death of joseph and Lord Go, destruction of Go residence, the new japanese colonel, aesin's proposal to America, hotel bombing........ Hilarious scene- besides the fat maid hilarious scenes are perfectly blended into the sad plot, giving us a moment of relief. Like, when a woman under interrogation points out eugene was in the lighting ceremony. Eugene responds by scratching his face. When eugene falls down in pharmacy hurrying to get letter from aesin. When he stops 2nd lead to order a big sashimi dish. He smells his uniform when hotel owner offers him to prepare a warm bath. And when aesin knows the meaning of love, she screams, and biting her clothes at home. The trio is another signature of comic effect. That the 3 idiots gather together from time to time illogically does not give us even a trait of oddness.Costume is terrific. Second female lead's dresses are so grand and pretty. That is a lot fascinating than ordinary historical kdrama which only has only korean dresses. And male lead's american suit and army uniform are splendid, making him look so smart. I heard that the production team has done a lot of research on male lead's uniform. 3rd male lead's beard is also enchanting. For 2nd male lead, i still cannot accept his japanese samurai costume because he is in my mind always a doctor in Romantic Doctor.Romance- is kind of a love with continence. I believe there is no kiss till the end. But this kind of love is still fascinating to watch. I never stop looping their first encounter in the lighted street, rooftop, fishing, boat talk, pier talk, hotel talks, pharmacy hugs, stitched notebook scene, legation interrogation, icy river talk, outside legation, horseriding, rickshaw riding, eugene's illiteracy, bridge talk, pair walk, exchanging of letters, putting on of shoes, tailor shop encounter, lord Go jailing news....love is conveyed through letters, possession of female lead's handerchief, stationery receipt, pandora box and merely touching of hands. This love with restraint is rare in kdrama. Role of lead actress
Except Goblin i almost watched all of writer kim's drama. All lead actress are career-minded. They excel in their job while seeking their true love. This is a major reason why i am in love with writer kim's drama. Her lead actress always set a model for us women fans to follow. I would say, aesin's specialty as a sniper is rare for women. But she is not particularly excel in her profession. In fact for many times she has to be saved by someone after her mission. Understandably, her background as a noble woman in old society prevents her from formal training. But in term of love romance she is the most proactive in kim's drama. She initiates the first hug. She writes directly to eugene that she miss him. She asks eugene to say a sentence begins with I. I agree that women, when coming across a man you love, should take bald step to secure the man. In a way, aesin is another model for women to follow. Music - as usual the series come out with splendid soundtracks and music, with some contributed by fans. The horsriding scene is accompanied by english song and it is not odd at all. Many piano solo are in youtube. Still awaiting free piano score to come out. Kdrama always come out in a package. After the showing of the drama, listening to ost or playing the ost is soothing and can help us recall some memorable scenes of the series.I am madly in love with this series and it should be entitled to many international awards. Hopefully, there is a season 2.
It is a breakthrough of writer kim comparing to her previous drama.Update : i have just finished epd 20. I am crying when eugene uses his deep and loud voice to beg aesin to stay. There is so much hope when aesin offers to go to America with eugene, even though everyone knows that it is just a delayed departure. At least, the two are together, even though the moment can be short.What is the choice of eugene? Staying behind or returning to Amercia? A torture of one week to wait for the answerI have just finished epd 21. Thanks god it is neither scaring nor too heartbreaking. Eugene's answer is surprising but sweet, quit his title and stay with aesin, as predicted from preview. At the opening, eugene ask aesin to at least say i love you and want to be with you so that he would be blinded by sweet lie. I like a more manly rather than a helpless eugene. And the proposal by writing LIVE on the flour, and a ring on the alphabet I, pound my heart. Only writer kim can think of such beautiful but sad proposal. Aesin will go to shanghai with minister lee. Will eugene follow? Epd 22My prediction is wrong. Eugene did quit the army but he was jailed for 3 years, before he returned to joseon. All 5 leads are alive except till the end of epd 22, when 2 female leads' life is at stake. Even if aesin is alive, joseon seems to be liberated in the 40s. So the ending must not be a happy one since now a and e are in joseon. Let us pray for an open ending. Writer kam is very cruel. She can do anything to surprise her fans. In us legation of japan eugene is about to kiss aesin but that is stopped when they hear soldier comingMust congratulate 3rd male lead. Seems he finds his Miss Right. His character is so good that he deserves a happy ending. The special epd is no more than a random clips of past epd. Not much thought is given in the productionEpd 23Every epd it is killing and killing. A death in the embrace of the beloved is already a sheer luck. Fat maid and the male servant could not hold their hand at time of death. Writer kim is determined to show the cruelty of the colony Joseong. But i still hope for miracle that lead couple could be alive and together. May i suggest an ending? Aesin is pregnant and had some complication and need to go to america to see doctors there. Probably a futile hope, though. Regarding the ending, i would like to talk about the life of chui zai bo, the original historical character of eugene. He fled to jp and learnt english with a missionery. He in turn landed us. With his hard work he became a doctor. For a while he returned to joseong, taking up a post in the court, and set up a school teaching lads democratic ideas. He was back to us and raised fund against jp invasion. He brought jp deed in joseong to us govt. He returned to korea at the age of about 84. He did not die young and hopefully eugene experience the same long life, with aesin. Epd24Absolutely disappointing, a sad ending that is ended in the saddest way. Death in front of the helpless beloved, the body tie to a horse....i cannot believe i am following a kdrama. Nevertheless, aesin remains strong, confident, beautiful and full of hope.Shake hand, exchange name, hug, longing, flower gazing, fishing, grilling fish.......i really miss rhe lead coue together See you 
I welcome any written comment of my review so i get improved next time."
1999,Mr. Sunshine,"A good try at merging Joseon-era palace and nobles with a more modern electrified world. Not a documdrama by any means and some liberties taken with the history, but also the producers have tried to insert real context and personalities into the 1900-era Hanseong. 24 episodes start out as a charming relationship story with some humour and grit, served with a multi-lingual and multi-cultural flair; there's a dramatic peak around episode 16, then settles a bit before the story and action gets darker and bloodier in episodes 19-21. And since it is known Japan does annex Korea eventually it can be expected everyone has a happy ending by the Finale. The leads carry it off well, but a bit too much freeze frame emoting and overall the odd unusual K-drama platonic love story taking place over several years. Supporting actors include a manga-stylized yakuza bad-boy and the rich, sensitive artsy-type, as well as a large cast playing recognizable stereotypes from other K-dramas. Depiction of the Japanese may be a little over the top, but hey, they have their own TV networks and shows if they want to tell their side."
2000,Mr. Sunshine,I just started watching Korean shows. This one is so good. I could go on and on. I'm telling you to watch this because it is so damn good. Maybe Hollywood should start watching Korean shows. They like to steal ideas. Steal the idea of making a good movie.
2001,Mr. Sunshine,"Being British I struggled somewhat with the array of characters with unrecognisable names in episode 1 but I stuck with it and was hooked by the end of episode 2. Each further installment dragged me deeper into this enchanting love story set against momentous historical events.Over the years I have watched many good television series. But this is the first time I have ever finished a series and immediately watched it again.P. S. I have just watched this yet again and still find it wonderful. Contrary to less positive reviewers, for me this series is packed with incident. In particular the last half dozen episodes fly by at a thrilling pace. I suppose the first half dozen episodes proceed more sedately, focused as they are on the beautiful love story at the centre of this drama, as well as developing the sparky relationships between the 5 main characters in this ensemble piece. But it is that love story and those relationships that bring so much emotional heft to the story. As I have already said I was captivated by the end of episode 2!"
2002,Mr. Sunshine,"It only takes one word to describe this series, Perfection... I don't even notice the subtitles. A must watch for the entire family. Enough said."
2003,Mr. Sunshine,"Byong Hu Lee looks like the 48 year old he is, while the princess love interest looks like a child. Poor casting of the princess, as they should have cast someone more mature looking. That, and the ultra long shots of Byong's stoic frozen face gets kinda old. (Yeah, he's gorgeous.). But give it a break!"
2004,Mr. Sunshine,"A sumptuously made 23 part drama about late Nineteenth Century Korea (named Joseon back then), where the Country was being pulled apart by Japanese, Russians, regime changers at home - and Americans.Story details the (back then) hierarchical society where the male Lords ruled,
and the peasants had no rights, cattle were more valued and how things changed slowly thereafter. The peasants' (slaves) life's were a very hard one, with multiple sad consequences - some tough scenes to watch at times.Led by an impossibly beautiful young Joseon Noble Lady named Ah-Sin.
She is in many ways naïve, yet is also resourceful in a Tomboyish sort of way,
and who (unsurprisingly) becomes part of a Love 'quadrangle', where her three suitors continually clash over her. She is a crack shot - so watch out.The male lead is a (former) slave boy who escaped the tyranny of his Lord and manages to get to America, where decades later he becomes a military officer and returns home to Joseon - for various personal and political reasons. Watch the series and find out why. He hardly smiles - definitely not a 'sunny' personality.Palace intrigue, treason, jealousy, battle scenes and xenophobia galore are all here. For those interested in a tad slower but very satisfying Asian TV, historical series, where there is also love, humor, great costumes and intrigue - this is for you. I give it an easy 9/10."
2005,Mr. Sunshine,"The absolute best KDrama I have ever seen. Everything about it was perfect: the cast, the setting, the heart-breaking storyline, the fact that this series was based on history. I cried many, many tears watching this series - and I laughed at times too;it's just that good! What a beautiful, courageous story!"
2006,Mr. Sunshine,Very boring series waited till 15 episode but nothing happened skip it till 24 story starts from same place but still boring .one extra star is only for showing old great times .
2007,Mr. Sunshine,As a f he couldn't have kept their rifles and told the soldiers to jump off the train over the bridge.A terrible time in history for the beautiful Korean people.
2008,Mr. Sunshine,"I know a lot about history, and how imperialistic the Japanese were for the first half of the 20th century. People forget that 14 million Chinese were killed with the same sort of imperialism that is show in this series where Japan targeted Korea. I look at Japan today and I see a country that seems more western than other East Asian countries, and has more acceptance by the west than other East Asian countries. The evil of the Japanese that is shown in this film is the evil of Western imperialism from the time of Columbus to the present time with the United States. And I see a Japan today that seems to be scared and antagonistic towards China, and nervous about Korea, and maybe for good reason considering the evil the Japan perpetuated upon the region. I see the patriotism and willingness to die for country of the Korean terrorists, or are they patriots? In the US we like to call them terrorists. That Korea has managed to survive through the centuries as a fairly small country says a lot about its people, and a country that was between the extremely expansionistic Japanese and Russians, and the Chinese. The way people that have been alienated against their country of origin still surrender their lives for their country, or really their culture. The film has an Korean American officer, and shows the country of the US apathetic towards the plight Korean people, but the US was one of the significant Imperialistic powers Not much happiness in this series since pretty much everyone dies,"
2009,Mr. Sunshine,"There's little I can add to the glowing endorsements others have already given this show, but let me just say, if I could give it 15 stars, I would. Even if you aren't a big fan of period pieces (which this is), it still sucks you in, compelling you to race through episode after episode, though reluctantly because you can't bear to see it all end. I became so emotionally invested in the characters, I was deeply disappointed to learn that virtually all of them were fictional.I dare anyone to get through this show without laughing, crying, cheering and marveling. EVERYTHING about it is just that phenomenal; the script, the cast, the cinematography, the costumes, the soundtrack (a feature in and of itself), and especially the two main leads. Even when they're not talking, they are still communicating loud and clear. It is truly a masterpiece, and the ending, though more bitter than sweet, felt realistic.For those who feel the story/emotions were lacking, I'm guessing cultural differences are to blame. Asian dramas in general are typically far more restrained and subtle than our western ""instant gratification"" programs. On top of that, a structural feature of Asian languages is sentence ambiguity (unlike English, for instance, which spells everything out). This ambiguity allows for richly layered word play, full of subtext and double meanings, which regrettably fail to translate. The scene where Eugene runs into Ae-Shin under the blossoming plum trees is a prime example. In short, if you try to skim through this show using the same viewing techniques that work for American shows, you will miss 75% of what is actually happening and being said.Normally I would give a romance-type k-drama a separate kiss/chemistry rating, but aside from the fact that there were no actual kisses to rate, in the context of this story, it also doesn't seem right. So I'll skip it this time.Lastly, huge props on the rifle vs sword duel end of episode 11. It was thrilling, s3xy and artistic, and ranks among my favorite girl vs girl fight scenes of all time (I half hoped they would fight again so I could see more).To say I recommend this show would be a gross understatement. Enjoy!"
2010,Mr. Sunshine,"So I just finished the series. And this is the first thing I'm doing, writing this review , because it's so overwhelming.I loved the show from the beginning, but it was a little slow for my taste, but understandably because it's set in 19th century. So I dragged the first 15 episodes for around 2 weeks(I usually finish a season in couple of days), but the last 9 episodes are absolutely a blast. It picks up pace so quickly and things get in motion flawlessly. Now about the show.It's a masterpiece, storyline, plot, character development, acting , background score everything is absolutely amazing. Hats off to everyone for making something so amazing, it's definitely gonna etch a mark in the mind of viewers. Recommended to everyone, especially to those who don't watch korean dramas. I have watched more than 100 shows from different countries and regions and this is among my top 5 shows.Like I said. OVERWHELMING!!!"
2011,Mr. Sunshine,"Look, I am all in for tragic endings. And throughout the drama it is hinted that none of the main characters would receive a good ending. Yes, but was the last 5 episodes justified? No.Not only the last 5 episodes were filled with 15 or more minutes of flashback scenes but also dragged unnecessarily with filler scenes that do not have meaning to the final outcome. Dong Mae died how many times exactly? And each time he was given a bigger and a longer focus than to the main story (However, he is still my favourite character out of the 5 leads).Good things:
Great cinematographyBeautiful scenaryGreat acting by main leads and general support staffThe chemistry between the leads are superbKim Heeseung, Go Aeashin's fiancé (this boy deserved the best!)Hina (badass lady)Dong Mae (His story arc, the actor, his delivery, the comic relief parts)Bad things:
The road to the endingEnding (Seriously, it makes you question the time you spent watching it)Romanticizing the villainsUnwanted characters like so many japanese that never got enough story length to be fleshed out. When they die you don't even know if they deserve it or not because you just don't know who they are by the end... there were too manyDong mae (what a drama queen! Just... talk in less cryptic ways and die once please. Thank you.)I have watched many Korean dramas now. And there are better dramas with less production value than this. I mean when you watch it, you'd see even the CGI is great for a 2018 drama. However, all that is for what? Such a bad ending. You will see if you decide to watch it."
2012,Mr. Sunshine,"This show started out quite well, though it took at least 3 episodes to understand what was even going on and where the story was headed. Or where I thought it was headed. Because this show can be divided into three parts and as a whole I couldn't manage to pinpoint what the message and the purpose of this show was.The first part is about the backstory of some key figures in this show and how and why their lives evolved the way they did. This part is really sad and bloody.The second part of this show nothing much happens. The story doesn't evolve much and you feel like you're going in circles because only small incidents keep happening but the problems with Japan and all really take a backseat in this part. So I'd say this is the part where the focus is on the main couple and the key characters around them. The thing is: even the relationship of the main couple didn't evolve much, they hugged three times and that's it. Don't expect to see a kiss either. It was kind of weird to see a story about a couple that was apart a lot and skipped most of the key milestones in romantic relationships but are supposed to be the loves of each other's lives.The third and last part is all about the Japan & Korea treaty and its consequences as in Korea losing their sovereignty and the so called righteous army trying to defend their country. Not much romance here either, only lots of blood and tragic deaths.So what was the purpose of this series? I don't really know. Neither the romance part convinced me much nor the historical part because major facts of how it even came as far as the treaty and Korea losing its sovereignty weren't well explained or depicted. The show made it seem like Korea and the emperor just sat back and watched until it was already too late. A quick research told me that this show has been openly criticized for having done poor research and not explaining and the depicting the events better and after watching this show I must say I agree.The heroism of some korean citizens, mainly the righteous army, seemed bittersweet in that context because you don't really understand why it had to come this far in the first place.Also, I hated the ending and not because it was bittersweet but because the female lead got more than she deserved in my opinion and because it was unfair to all the other amazing characters who deserved way better. But watch for yourself.Like I said, the cinematography was awesome and the OST on point.
Conclusion:
Great OST and cinematography, purpose/message of the show isn't clear, story lacks historical facts and better explanations of depicted historical events and how they came to be."
2013,Mr. Sunshine,"SORRY FOR A COUPLE OF SPOILERS, BUT I WAS ANNOYED BY SOMETHING AND CANNOT OFFER MY SOLUTION WITHOUT GIVING 2 THINGS AWAY.....but first.....Maybe you're aware of all the glowing reviews for this series, and perhaps not.People love it ( though possibly not a lot from Japan ) and that love is certainly justified on a number of levels.It's a grand, sweeping historical epic in the tradition of ""Doctor Zhivago"" ( that's a really old movie and these days you need the longform TV format for enough time to do a story like this justice ).Korea, like many other countries, has felt the brutality and violence of being a colony. Yet cruelty was not confined just to the Japanese occupiers, because the lowly peasant was also likely to be oppressed by the local aristocrat. Hence, double trouble : what a great life.We all like a story with emotional impact and there's plenty here. Central is Korean orphan - turned American emigrant Eugene Choi ( Lee Byung Hun ) and his relationship with a pretty young aristocrat ( Kim Tae Ri ). There are other significant supporting characters I need not expand on here; suffice to say that they're all interesting and tragedy is never far away from anyone in what is a large cast.I wouldn't expect the Japanese to be portrayed in a sympathetic light and they're not. The Americans and Europeans fare better, yet the name of the game for all colonisers was always the same : get in and exploit the place. Any story about people trying to escape the burden of such oppression is going to stir our emotions and you'll likely be, like me, a teary mess by the end. The writing is very good in general ( thanks Kim Eun Sook ), though some of the non-Asian characters get some clunky dialogue at times. It's also a VERY long series, though I was never bored or impatient : pacing and plot progress is handled really well.Now, if you're going to spend a LOT of money on a series ( and this one is supposedly the most expensive Korean production to date ), you better ensure the cast is top shelf. It is, and I don't want to single out individuals as the standard is uniformly excellent. Except for one or two Caucasians who are strangely allowed to be somewhat stiff/awkward once or twice. And as per usual for a Korean show, the youngsters are notably impressive.The other aspect money can buy is making the show look good, and the budget is definitely all on the screen. Production design seems impeccable ( though I'm no expert on period costumes ) and the photography is truly wonderful; I'm sure even Sir Ridley Scott would crack an appreciative smile at some of the images on display, and clearly the DP and the director ( Lee Eung Bok ) have an eye for visual splendour. The former should also be complimented on how nicely each episode and the scenes within flow; including astute use of slo-mo and dissolves. The music is also good, one song in particular with a high male vocal making me teary when I hear it.I do, however, have a small complaint regarding kissing and the main couple.As in, there isn't any ! ( so here is my first spoiler; sorry ! ).Yes, I know this isn't the standard K Drama where the audience waits anxiously for the leads to lock lips. But, there IS a substantial ( and infuriatingly platonic ) love affair going on here with real heat from the actors. And yes, kissing was probably unknown to the Koreans back then, yet I have a perfect and plausible solution to what is an annoying issue which I'm sure has vexed K Drama fans worldwide.....Eugene ! He went to America as a child, hence spent many years in a country infamous for its loose morals. So he'd have seen thousands of kisses and probably dispensed a few too ! And while his lady would be understandably ignorant, he might say to her : you know, they do something in America with lips which is very enjoyable. Would you like to try ? We know she's a keen learner, we get some laughs as they fumble the first attempts and then....ignition ! The kissing might even lead to something else ( suggested only, naturally ). Which would then set up ( sorry, second semi-spoiler ) a satisfying final scene, especially considering what transpires in the last two episodes : either show Lady Ae Shin addressing her students with a pregnancy bump, or she could have a young son or daughter say something to her ( depending on the relevant time frame ). And, the kiss issue is obviously made quite hilarious when you consider what the same actress got up to in ""The Handmaiden"" !There's a reason why kissing is so important to any story ( Korean or not ) concerning a couple in love : it's a very intimate act ( extremely pleasant too, BTW ! ) and signifies a deepening of the relationship. If we like and care for the people on screen ( and our main couple here have tip-top chemistry ), then we want them to fall in love and confirm that love with a proper kiss please.Oh, and I also like the title."
2014,Mr. Sunshine,Despite the high score of this serie. I think this serie is really building up too slowly. Which makes this serie lose my attention. I also think the serie changes too quickly from one scene to the next.also because this makes it look messy. So the story loses my attention as well. Too bad because I like the acting.
2015,Mr. Sunshine,"A great kdrama based on historical events between Korea ,Japan and USA. Outstanding direction suits perfect with the aesthetic soundtrack. And then, the characters. Every single character in this drama is unique and grow with a slow but very emotional way till the peak of the drama. The romance between the main couple is good too. Simple but strong feelings express with gestures, eye-contact and amazing dialogues. The whole script is just a masterpiece with so many moral messages about the war ,the love, the social classes and the woman's place in the society. A totally must watch drama will make you cry till the end."
2016,Mr. Sunshine,"Best show I've seen in a long time. Great acting, dialogue, story, scenery, cinematography, oh my! the list goes on. I'm in love with all 5 leads. They had great chemistry between each other. The characters were perfectly cast. And I almost broke my tv wanting to kill the villains (btw, played by wonderful actors who brought me to the brink of insanity). I was waiting fervently each week for the new episodes to air. It was torture not being able to binge-watch. Now that it's over, I think I'm going to have withdrawal symptoms develop soon.After being on the edge of my seat through the 24 episodes, I hated the ending, of course. But it was inevitable in this setting, I suppose. I didn't know much about this time period nor what happened to Korea historically (except the Korean War with US). And as the emperor lamented in one scene, no one in the world seemed to care about what was happening in this obscure part of the globe. No one knew. And those who did simply wanted no part in it. No one came to their aide. They suffered alone. I was so moved and compelled by the atrocities and sufferings that I had to google history to find out more. I only wish they had explained the title...it's a tad baffling.Final thought, just watch it--Don't miss out on a wonderful series. Much more meaningful than Crazy Rich Asians, imho."
2017,Mr. Sunshine,"Photography is great as has been mentioned by other reviewers. Too much in the way artistic shots with lingering emotional framing 
result in boredom. My mind wanders and i wonder why i am still watching. I couldn't make it through the first episode. No likeable 
characters but the beastiality of man is well portrayed."
2018,Mr. Sunshine,"It's a bit all over the place this drama, hard to follow the characters in place n time, I can see what they were at trying to go the big epic storytelling but it just falls short on that, I am only few episodes in who knows it might Pick up, if u can put all that aside it's quite enjoyable I suppose...."
2019,Mr. Sunshine,Every scene is like a painting and every conversation means something. I've never seen better cinematography (and lighting) in any series ever. And the characters just grow as it progresses. There is some very fine acting here. The 20 year gap between the leas just doesn't batter. Their subtle romance is entirely believableThe setting and history fascinated me. No idea if is entirely accurate but how could it be ? These are times that are like medieval times to us now. There sentiments and attitude are har for us to grasp.Can't think of anything else I have enjoyed more. Loved the music too.Watched on Netflix. .
2020,Mr. Sunshine,"Pitched about 150 years ago in what is now called Korea, a number of main characters who become interconnected, are developed from various societal levels, and foreign Powers, such as the USA and Japan, meet. As a foreigner (British), the first episode I found difficult to grasp, but subsequent episodes helped make connections, and form characters. It was interesting. However, sadly, the F-abuse was flung at viewers at about 1.5.0850.Yes, I knew it was a Netflix series, but I thought I'd picked up that it wasn't marriage abusive to that extent, even though ep.2 painfully flaunted the anti-marriage Ms-an anachronism, since that ideology to scrap marriage distinctions, only began, I think, about 100 years after the time period of the series. So, sadly, my enjoyment of it ended early in episode 5. For folk more able to withstand the attack, I would still recommend the series as interesting, and guess that it shows more of the Japanisation of Korea."
2021,Mr. Sunshine,"Oh my God.. what did I just finish watching?! A splendid but heartbreaking story about a brave girl Go Ae Shin with 3 special men eho loved her, fighting alongside fellow Koreans against the cruel Japanese during the beginning and the middle of Japanese occupation. The storytelling, the characters, the cinematography, the songs, the set, just everything, are beautifully done and captured.
This drama beats all of the kdramas I watched before, even CLoY. Sad ending it was for the story, but that's how it is.. a happy ending would be awkward in the times of war and despair. Credit goes to the director and the writer of course. Lee Byung Hun as Eugene Choi and Kim Tae Ri as Go Ae Shin, together with the samurai guy Gu Dong Mae, the rich young man turned editor Hui Seong and tye hotel owner Hina Kudo were like the perfect mix of happiness, sadness and togetherness.Totally recommending all kdrama lovers to watch this. Very honest and pure love. I watched this 2 yrs after the release because of the high IMDb rating that nearly matched CLoY's, both dramas I give 10/10."
2022,Mr. Sunshine,"Honestly this drama is almost perfect. Everything seems very detailed, excellent pictures, amazing casts, unforgettable soundtracks, which I can say this is a movie quality instead of a TV show. Even though the age gap between Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-ri is quite big, both casts are still so amazing to show their chemistry. Minimum physical touch and no kissing scene, which is very rare for a romance K-drama, but you can still sense the amazing chemistry between them. I love all the main casts, they all are so amazing. I don't know how many times I should say amazing to describe how amazing it is, but it is a very good one!The only downside to me is a bit slow, since I'm quite impatient with a slow-paced story, so I feel quite bored during the mid episodes and somehow I feel like the story is going nowhere. But overall it's still so enjoyable to me. I think this is the first time I've ever seen a K-drama with a movie quality, and I keep repeating the soundracks in my playlist, love it!"
2023,Mr. Sunshine,"Beautifully filmed with a great cast and wonderful writing, even with sub-titling. Very apparent that a lot of money was spent filming this. K-dramas are so much better than most American shows now and this is a prime example of a K-drama. Intrigue, action, romance, with some comedy thrown in. Byung-Hun Lee does an outstanding job with his acting, in three languages to boot!"
2024,Mr. Sunshine,"I just finished watching the last episode and am already wishing it hadn't ended. The show was beautifully done, whether the acting, costumes, music or the best, cinematography. Episode 1 was a little confusing but you quickly settled into the story and characters in episode 2 and from then on, you are enthralled and transported to the turn of the century, Korea. I surely wish the title of the show was something a bit different especially as it had no real meaning. It may keep others from watching. It would be their loss. Perhaps the story is somewhat biased in making the Japanese characters to be so evil but certainly from Korea's perspective, it is understandable. And that antagonism is critical to the heart of the story. Lee Byung Hun did an absolutely stellar job with his acting, in all three languages. But he is not alone with the acting. All of the main characters showed great depth, particularly when they were not speaking. Their looks spoke volumes. Congratulations to all those on the show and behind the show. It truly was well done. And a big thank you to Netflix for bringing it to us."
2025,Mr. Sunshine,There are no words to even describe how much I loved this series. I read in some of the reviews that they didn't think the two main characters had chemistry. I couldn't disagree more. Their chemistry was mesmerizing. I thought the casting was terrific. This was the first K drama I have ever watched but it won't be the last.
2026,Mr. Sunshine,This is clearly one of the best things I've ever watched. I finished it earlier this year and now I'm watching it again much more slowly - only one episode every other night. I'm haunted by the beauty of it and the love story that is so exquisite. I'm even playing the Korean music in my car. I wish more people would watch It. I also don't know how the lead actor isn't more of a star here in the states as he's amazing.
2027,Mr. Sunshine,"Thank goodness for Netflix, I am hooked on Korean drama , so polished, in every way . beats American stuff hands down"
2028,Mr. Sunshine,"I just finished this very long KDrama which is 1-1/2 times longer than the others. I'm not giving this show a very high score nor a low score...it's just about normal satisfaction to me. I find it quite dragging because of the long episodes.. It would have been fast paced if was reduced to the standard 16 episodes...so many scenes can be cut....There was no suspense at all that you will be eager to continue and watch the next episodes...it's tantamount to a boring show....The romance between the two stars seems to be awkward like a January-December or a father-daughter affair...the guy is 50 and the girl is very young at 30....I don't find it sweet or romantic...What I like about the show is the Cinematography, Costumes and I like the music theme Greensleeves. The show is realism and not fantasy and the use of flashbacks is limited only unlike other shows which consumes most of the time using flashbacks.....On the over-all, it's a good show and recommended if you have patience to watch 24 episodes."
2029,Mr. Sunshine,"Superb acting, incredible sets, with brilliant ensemble cast. I was thoroughly entertained. As someone who has watched quite a number of Korean cinema,Mr. Sunshine is among the best."
2030,Mr. Sunshine,"The drama is unfolding nicely and there is a lot of world building, which is always an enjoyable experience for great films and dramas. I'm enjoying the story progression but I am disturbed by seeing yet another romantic K-drama where the male and female leads have a large age gap. Playing off a 20 year age gap like it's just an everyday romance is a joke (even Jerry Seinfeld couldn't get away with it in real life!) These May-December romances are the exception and not the rule (unless the culture is very patriarchal or practices child marriage). Women want to date their peers not their fathers. I find this kind of casting to be exploitative of young women and I hope K-drama directors will pay attention to how unpleasant this is for members of their female viewing audience (especially for older women who want to reminisce about their youth--they prefer to fantasize about a young and handsome man!) Imagine a 50 year old female lead paired with a 30 year old male lead? If this sounds preposterous, then you know how some women feel about a much younger woman playing the love interest of a much older man. Yes, we find it disturbing and disappointing. It was uncomfortable enough (just like the ""Goblin"" drama) that I switched to another series with romantic leads that I can actually enjoy fantasizing about."
2031,Mr. Sunshine,"Plot: Mr. Sunshine"" tells you story of the time when Korea was, once again, fighting against Japanese occupation in the beginning of the 20th century. With no real army on the paper and a king with little power on the throne of ""Joseon"".That's all I am going to tell here, nothing more. You need to watch it to feel it.The cast: The cast is simply magnificent from top to bottom. Every role, no matter how large or small, is handled with depth. Every character arc is beautifully drawn. No character, literally not a single character is useless. You will be emotionally attached to each and every character.Writing: The writer managed to weave an epic tale of love and sacrifice. I never noticed the slow plot movement in the first part because I was so immersed in the path to get there. Each step is important to the overall storyline. The bromance was interesting, it was fun watching their relationships blossom. As for the two leads considering their age gap, they had amazing chemistry.Direction: What's more amazing is how they managed to direct such an amazing story to make it even better.Every single episode was meaningful and contributed to the build-up of the whole storyline.The cinematography- The location and the palates are beautifully done. You can tell that they really thought about what shots and angles they wanted.Leads:
I was blown away by the acting of all 5 main characters. So, I am not going to rank them.Female lead- Kim Tae Ri: She is strong headed, rebellious and extremely cute. She is stubborn!Female lead- Min Jung Kim: She is strong, intelligent, polite and fearless.Male lead -Lee Byung Hun: Eugene Choi is dreamy. He takes decisions by his own. He knows what is right and wrong. He loves his lady.Male lead- Yoo Yeon Seok: Go Dong Mae is scarred character. It will break your heart to know the life that he lived the way he did. He is a pheonix who rises from his own ash. He makes you want to hate him and love him at the same time. He also loves his lady.Male lead-Byun Yo Han: I liked how his character evolved from a rich playboy to the quiet observer and then to a man who learnt, in his own way, to do the right thing. Wow!!!! This is called a character development. He loves his lady too.OSTs: The OSTs are beyond what words can describe, got me emotional at all the right moments.It is great balance between the history, love story and thrilling action scenes. There's even a little humor and cuteness.Don't miss it. It is a piece of art...a masterpiece!"
2032,Mr. Sunshine,"What had started off as being just another rom-drama series for me, turned out to be one of the best executed series I've ever watched!!From the story to the production to the dialogues, everything was spot on!! If you're still confused about this one, PLEASE DONT BE, and go watch this immediately."
2033,Mr. Sunshine,"Maybe for Korean standards the series went good and interesting. I got bored with repetitive shots. The plot and story line seemed too week and the meetings of the two main characters by ""coincidence"" a bit silly.I liked that was no nudity in all the 24 episodes. Also too many things that were irrelevant filled the episodes - lacking substance. Probably the whole 24 episodes should have been concentrated into 10 good episodes.It was funny and irritating in the same time how the ""true westerners"", the caucasians in the movie that were supposed to be born and raised in the USA, were speaking English with such a terrible accent. Those ""real americans"" had in reality English as a second language."
2034,Mr. Sunshine,"It's not often that a series have a great cast all around, even less that side characters are just as flossed out and interesting as the main cast.
This series made me love and cry over all in the cast.
I most say I am so impressed with the actors, it's one thing to act a movie in one language, and just use subtitles to explain other languages. But this takes it way further, as the main cast uses 4 for the most part, and around 6 is used in totlal in the show (one lines for some like Russian). It makes it so more believable and real, and my hat is off to the actors for pulling that off, not even Hollywood can really do that.You will love and hate the main cast, but the best part is that they are mostly in the grey area, where you see the good and bad off them all, and why they are like they are. And this is carried over to the side characters too, where even the servant boy have great lines and meaning behind actions.
The story is really touching, and bitter sweat all the way through. I only hope the people some of it it's based on lived just a little better lives, because to think this was not the case is heartbreaking.
Not many series makes me forget time, yet here I do. And it's cost me many late nights, where I simply had to see one more episode before calling it a night. The feelings where also hard and real.Now many will say it's only a few episodes, but look again each one is almost a movie on it's own, and it's stunning how they have manage to get a budget for this show. It is worth watching, even if Korean dram isn't for you, it wasn't for me either. But I was wrong."
2035,Mr. Sunshine,"I won't say no more: For me, Go Ae Shin was the perfect symbolization of Korea, so many fought for her, loved her, die for her. I did no cry as I did in the end for any movie since I have known myself. I am a tough one, you know... but this was just too much."
2036,Mr. Sunshine,"First episode confused me as it introduced a lot of characters who seemed to have no connection with one another. After reading a bad comment in The King Eternal Monarch, I almost dropped it, but after a while, I decided to give it a go.And boy, was that a good call, for this show is a diamond. I wish I could have added ten other stars.Cons first.A lot of climaxes. Too many? I don't know. I enjoyed them all. I felt like a Joseon person, ready to give my life for my country. So, not really a drawback.Ae Shin. Is a cruel, selfish, heartless creature. But this is how she must be in order to achieve her goal. Not a setback either.I know what was wrong! Not enough romance. No chemistry between the leads, although both actors put on magnificent performences.The pros. My, it will take some lines.The scenery is breathtaking. The acting. OMG. I stopped often to just marvel at how any actor in this show was a terrific performer. For the first time after ""I am not a robot"" I saw Corean faces could shift to convey emotions. Hollywood actors could learn something here. As a consequence, I loved every character. My favourite one is actually useless, adding nothing to the storyline. And yet, my heart ached and twisted and fluttered for poor and incredibly handsome Dong Mae. Whenever he got in a fight, I was mesmerized. And scared to death, that anything might happen to him. The most beautiful scene I have seen on a screen, is the now famous ""skirt tugging"". You have to see this once in your life. The silk brushing against his hand is the most sensous, thrilling, flabbergasting moment in cinema since hands brushing in ""L'amant"". Chills all over. Congrats.(I edited my comment to say that I was wrong about Dong Mae being useless. Come to think about it, Ae Shin confesses that he and his cutting words were what sent her on her path. She joined the Righteous Army to prove him wrong.)I absolutely loved the bromance. Yu jin, Dong Mae and Hui Seong shoud have gotten a room for three and forgotten about the spoiled noble fool whose lover was actually a gun. Seeing how respect and genuine love grew between them was wonderful.I loved the translator. And Do-mi. And the Hotel owner, and Karl, and... and everybody. Even the King.The villains were perfect. The plot was neat. Fights and battles were epic. There was just enough fun. I did not fast forward and that means something.So many (good) things to say, I'd write all day.Thanks a million."
2037,Mr. Sunshine,"What a drama!
Story and characters are fantastic! It made me want to discover the history of this era.
I am very moved"
2038,Mr. Sunshine,I'm now on episode twenty and can't wait until the next episodes next week as the heading says the story just keeps getting better and better I cried because of what was happening the acting was so good those people who gave up watching don't know what they are missing I'd say give it another try I love Korean drama and this is one of the best along with goblin and descendants of the sun I don't know how they do it but you are left with so many emotions when these dramas end no other country can do it like Korea
2039,Mr. Sunshine,"I loved this series. I loved the friendship between the 3 men that love the same woman.
Great characters, great acting, great costumes.
Love the storyline.The actors speaking American their accents where really bad.But god damned. I hated the ending.
There already was much suffering during the whole series. Why don't let Eugene and Ae Sin come together?That's why it lost a point. A was pretty angry with the ending.A better ending would have been ( If they really want people to die) then let them die together. This sucked! Still wishing they would end up together in America.But it really is a good series !"
2040,Mr. Sunshine,I was hooked after the first episode and am currently upto episode 9 !Fabulous storyline worth the effort of reading the sub - titles
2041,Mr. Sunshine,"Maybe I was influenced by the glowing reviews, but I had so many issues with the main couple, who imo, had little chemistry (and an awkward age difference) that all their scenes were hard to enjoy. The woman was not a super strong screen presence when compared to the other actors and actresses. Also, I never got used to this over romanticizing where a couple who barely said a word to each other is madly in love. And why every man loves that insipid girl? Years pass, again, barely a word to each other and yet the main male characters are ALL pining for her. I was yawning, such a waste of time that could be spent developing other characters and side stories. There was an obvious pair with Dong-Mae and Hina, they built the tension superbly and gave hints, had good chemistry, and I thought at least when she died he was gonna realise that the one person he actually talks to and he actually know is Hina, they were in love all along. But no.
Visually, some shots seemed more pretentious and dragged than necessary. Of course this is a pretty decent show (with a lame title), and has more complexity and great acting than the average netflix production nowadays. I would definitely recommend to western audiences who are not yet used to watching kdramas. And I gave an extra star for the female characters, who in general had more courage and attitude than some of the men.Also, the guy who plays Dong-mae is obscenely good. He looks like a 16 yo irl, I would have never recognised him."
2042,Mr. Sunshine,"I have watch only the first episode and an half. I found it very hard to follow the events, and understand the story and who are the characters. It jump from a scene to the other one without explaining, and also the time jump are not explained, so is also hard to understand who is who.
Sorry for the bad grammar English lol"
2043,Mr. Sunshine,This is epic. One of the best series I've ever seen. The 2 main Actors are not only beautiful in appearance but they are great actors. This show has it all . And the minor flaw that I mentioned in the caption is very minor indeed and they have bit parts. But the rest is a 10. I don't give out 10's easily. So a 9 out of 10 is a must. This is the show that got me into watching dozens of K-Dramas. South Korea is now my go to on Netflix.
2044,Mr. Sunshine,"First of all The main actors are gorgeous and are stud actors. This is a definite South Korean Classic. The love story is sublime. The only knock and it's so minimal are the couple of American Actors . They're just reading lines , but they play bit roles or this gets a 10 out of 10. The set and the story line is superb. But the greatest attribute I think are the facial expressions of the lead characters. There is so much said without having to speak a word. I rarely see that in shows or movies. This one should not be missed."
2045,Mr. Sunshine,"I'd like my heart back please!What an incredible drama - let alone a kdrama! Each episode is shot like a blockbuster movie, the cast are superb and the story captivates you from start to finish. That it's based on historical events, makes it all the more painful sometimes.The the five main characters are superb and you love them throughout and become so invested in their stories.At 24 episodes this is a lot longer that the usual kdrama and sometimes the pace may seem a little slower than what we're used to in the West - however the investment of your time pays off in spadeas.I'm not going to mention anything about the plot as I strongly urge you to watch this."
2046,Mr. Sunshine,"Wow.. well that was a roller coaster ride of emotions after binge watching this epic drama on Netflix. The acting was superb from everyone in every sense of the word. I started watching Korean Dramas about 2 years ago and been hooked ever since and I am a Brit.
I take my hat off to Kim Eun-sook and director Lee Eung-bok.
I am not going to give too much away but what I will say is do watch it. You won't regret it."
2047,Mr. Sunshine,"The show is set in early 20th century Korea, few years away from being occupied by the Japanese Empire. The ruling Joseon dynasty has finally opened up their ports to Western powers and modernization is happening at an unprecedented pace for historically xenophobic Koreans. The setting is a playground for showmakers to flaunt the beauties of multiple cultures: Korean, Japanese, and Western. And they flaunt them masterfully, coupled with the beautiful Korean geography. For every episode I was overtaken by the aesthetics of the show.The show is also a subject of interest for history buffs. As Westerners watching the show, Korean history is probably the last thing we would be interested by. It is interesting to see how the show portrays adapting Korean people and how foreign involvements in Korea during the period played out. Also, the main character features a Korean-American Marine Corps captain. Sounds far-fetched? Surprisingly not, I have found. And, of course, the romance. I should not say too much, but I will say that the show will make you cheer for the male and female leads. In sum, this show offers no other show has to the greater international audience. I found Netflix to be quite dull when it comes to recent originals. But Netflix really outdid themselves this time around."
2048,Mr. Sunshine,"This had everything. Just brilliant!
But seriously, what kind of ending is that!?! I'm outraged, still crying."
2049,Mr. Sunshine,"Do not let the cheesy title of this series fool you. This is extraordinary from many points of view. Historically, it is based on an actual setting, something very few people in this country would know about Korea, Japan and the USA. Within that framework, the clash of cultures, where values are different and honor prevails. The aesthetics of the production are something to marvel at. And then, the characters, who behave in accordance to strict rules surely strange to us behaving in ways that are, ultimately, quite fascinating. The love relation develops strangely, slowly and far from any courtship you could ever imagine. That gets performed by the two main characters in rather fascinating fashion as well. I do not recall seeing a picture where a still face and a minimal movement could unload so much expression. Actress Tae-ri Kim packs more beauty and feeling in still silence than any actress I can recall; she deserves stardom just for such incredible skill.
I have seen five episodes, and I am mesmerized."
2050,Mr. Sunshine,"I was a bit hesitant to write a review for this series because no amount of praises is going to be enough for this brilliant series. It has everything one would look for - comedy, action, romance, bromance, grief and a perfectsad ending. The roles are tailor made for the actors, my favorite is Goo Dong Mae. Brilliant dialogues, great cinematography, fine acting.. it's all lietrally poetry in motion. Watched it three times, can watch it another twenty times without getting bored. With 24 episodes, it's rather long but it's a nice problem to have. At the end of it, you will struggle to come out of that world and will be left pining for more."
2051,Mr. Sunshine,"Rating seems higher than deserved.
Empress Ki still deserves to be the top historical drama.
This drama tho is star studded.
Story is ok but really hate the character of Lady Ae Sin - seems to get all the help she needs - noble fool living in luxury.
Comic scenes are really fun tho.
Young master character is good"
2052,Mr. Sunshine,"I can only hope people get past the strange title for this wonderful show. And also don't get discouraged if you are confused at the end of episode 1. It all starts to make sense.This show was just amazing. I learned so much about the USA and it's early history with Japan, Korea and Russia. But history aside, the stories of the characters is what kept me hooked! To say the last few episodes had me sobbing is an understatement. The candid pictures of the cast out of character at the end of the last episode made me feel better.Finally, the cinematography in this film has blown me away. I am not someone who talks about things like 'cinematography' when I talk about movies. There were so many shots that were absolutely breathtaking. I would love to have a coffee table book of shots from this show. The word spectacular does not do it justice."
2053,Mr. Sunshine,Watched this as it has high rating here. Started kind of promising with expectation to have various twists and surprise but it wasn't. No climax just the story kept going on.. i started to fast forward after eps where Eugene reveled his background and things drifted a part. So i started with the score of 8 and ended it with 6. But i have agree this is a high quality drama arts-wise and detail-wise.
2054,Mr. Sunshine,I was moody for a few days after finishing this drama. I can't stop wondering why even the title is Mr Sunshine in the first place? This drama is sad and has sad ending. It is very catchy but the sad ending makes me feel unhappy. Grr.. really sad. All i can say is this drama makes me sad from beginning till end.
2055,Mr. Sunshine,"The storyline till the second last episode will make you drool and stick to your sits...it's just fav..the intensity of action ,expression of the leads is beyond words..but I definitely did not like the way it ended ,it made me cry..saddest ending I would definitely say...still one of my fav dramas..but ending just made me cry .."
2056,Mr. Sunshine,"An actor with bright blue contacts and a terrible american accent was off-putting for a start. the fact i recognised him as korean didn't help the credibility of the series.i felt no chemistry between the two leads. their story was slow, drawn out and quite frankly, boring.i liked the chemistry between the three male leads in the love triangle. they offered a little bit of comedic relief.in the end i was rooting for the bad guy (who turned out to be Yoo Yeon-seok). he kind of stole the show in my opinion and i knew it wasn't going to end well for him so I stopped watching.nobody wants to see their hero devastated so it's his own fault for being such a good actor that i'm rating this series a 6.I wish IMDB would put the English titles of these dramas up. They are popular and deserve recognition."
2057,Mr. Sunshine,"Best Koreana drama series I watched, it's truly amazing, a must watch!"
2058,Mr. Sunshine,This drama is beautiful shot and easily gets you emotionally attached with the characters. Great storyline with surprisingly good action scenes. Each character story is beautiful addressed without losing focus of the main issue. The plot really gives one a good feel of what really could have been occurring during the colonials and also the rebels fight for independence.
2059,Mr. Sunshine,"I can't speak highly enough of this drama. It's one of the most incredible things I've ever watched, anywhere, period. A real masterpiece with jaw-dropping cinematography, outstanding acting, especially from Yeon-Seok Yoo and Min-Jung Kim who should win every award possible for their roles."
2060,Mr. Sunshine,"The quality is something else, a lot of scenes look like paintings by some great artist and the acting is solid all around.Could use more of the action scenes that they do so well tho."
2061,Mr. Sunshine,This is a must watch even if you're not into historical dramas. This series is just so underrated in the Korean drama World. The Cinematography is just breathtakingly beautiful. It has a little bit of everything. The characters are wonderful every one of them in their own way. I highly recommend it!!
2062,Mr. Sunshine,Episode 1 and 2 a very good story. The further the worse.
2063,Mr. Sunshine,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this film series. My wish would be for it to be in English. But my fear is that it would ruin the consistent poetry of the Korean language. It's eloquent even as it uses contemporary expressions in the subtitles. It would be interesting to hear the story in its historical context. For example, the series Deadwood uses such language that matches perfectly with the expressiveness of the language used during the pioneering era in the American westward expansion. The whole soul of a language is so very important and difficult, and Shakespeare proves that easily. There are long pauses in the dialogue which tries to emphasize the subtextual meanings in both the language as well as the scene itself. And the cinematography is elegant and filled with gracious wisdom, making the long pauses worth the wait/weight of the meanings between words. It is both an intellectual and spiritual experience. Some may say it is soap opera, but this is a masterpiece of historical costume drama with the most eloquent balance between all aspects of making a film work. The actors are so perfectly matched as they experience one another in character. My favorite balancing act in the project is the consistent humour that I've begun to recognize in great epic Asian film projects. Jackie Chan comes to mind when a dramatic moment astonishingly becomes the Keystone Cops and the wonder of Charlie Chaplin. The character actors are genius as their dialogues expand the story using the most powerful and long-lasting aspect of film theory/storytelling. These moments are climactic and as such get us ready for the next constellation of plot structuring. I guess I'm trying to say that I feel the intensity of effort and belief going into the project, and that alone makes it worth watching."
2064,Mr. Sunshine,"Tremendous acting and such a poignant tale. I felt like I was reading a beautiful novel and had a hard time waiting till the day was done and the kids were in bed to get back to it. I loved the length and thoroughness of the telling, and the time they took to incorporate beauty, love, heart, anguish and eternal hope. I feel like a better person for having watched it. I am inspired to research and learn more, and will be on the lookout for more from this cast and this creative team who wove a story so deep and so well, that I believe I will carry it with me forever."
2065,Mr. Sunshine,"I am a huge fan of Korean shows, and this one is no exception. It is a beautiful story, with just as beautiful cinematography and rich characters. As others have written, the first episode kind of goes all over the place, but it is worth sticking around, because you basically figure out who is who in the second episode."
2066,Mr. Sunshine,"I started this show not knowing what to expect and just 30 minutes into the first episode I knew this was going to be great. Everything from the directing and acting to the soundtrack and the costumes is extraordinary. If you're into period dramas, definitely give it a go!"
2067,Mr. Sunshine,"If you like to know about other cultures history,
If you like stunning landscapes and portrait,
If you like well filmed and good actor,
If you like a profound, forbidden and mesmerizing love history,
If you like some good war scenes,
If you know how to appreciate slow scenes, details, macro filming shoots
If you like wonderful quality and achievement on screen
If you want to be scarved in a good way
Watch this show. It's just excellently beautiful.
Hope I will never forget this story."
2068,Mr. Sunshine,"One of the best tv series I've ever see in many aspects. I'm in my fourties and have lived in 5 different countries so I can say it.
Everything is worth to watch and re-watch.
It's not a romantic show. It's a historical one and the romance is also different of you are used to see. This is also the beauty of it.
The actors are amazingly talented , so much things are talked in their eyes and expression without words many times.
Try it and see for yourself.
Need to be focused and no distractions to enter deep in the storyline."
2069,Mr. Sunshine,"Mr. Sunshine is a tale of a country in turmoil with amazing people in its path fighting for it. The story of Eugene Choi, the beautiful cinematography, costumes, and history that make up this tale are rich, full, deep, and important. The talented actors Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-ri, Yoo Yeon-Seok, Yo-Han Byun, and Min-Jung Kim bring intense life to each character. The writers weaved an intriguing tale, building layer after layer of subsistence with deep and poetic storytelling. As you root for the underdogs fighting for their heritage and land, you curse those trying to rob and destroy them. ""Greensleeves"" is forever to be heard a little differently from now on. This series left a stunning impression.SPOILER: The poignant ending is emotional, in addition to those characters that perish, devastating losses as they lived in our heart, but also the precious heirlooms left behind that were so descriptive of each one. Each piece held important value in their lives and were emblems of what their lives meant. The cast is superb. They made you laugh, cry, gasp, wonder, sometimes angry, confused, and in the end in awe of their being. This series plays like an epic movie that will be with you for quite a long time!"
2070,Mr. Sunshine,We were crying.. It was a very beautiful series. Very good characters. Very good storyline. Thank you so much for showing us a part of the history. We'll watch it again.
2071,Mr. Sunshine,"It's a spectacular masterpiece. I wondered why so many SBS shows would mention it even though it wasn't emitted from the same channel. If it's popular, it's really good. It happened the same with The Goblin and Temperature of Love. They are of extremely different genre but they wouldn't stop mentioning them on TV so their sentiment is equal to quality."
2072,Mr. Sunshine,"Upon a quick glance at the title and the promotional poster, you're probably already thinking wow, this sure looks underwhelming! Well, dare I say that those were precisely my first thoughts - but now, I don't even hesitate for one second when someone asks me whether this drama is any good, because my answer will always be the same, and that is: 'exceptional' doesn't even begin to cut it.Initially, I thought the premise was very lacklustre - set in the early 1900s, this mini-series focuses on Righteous Army activists fighting for Korea's independence against foreign forces, but the more I watched, the more I began to realise how fascinating this was. Not only did it act as a device to help viewers establish the rationale behind each of the character's motives, but it also contributed to the story's development in more ways than I could have imagined. The idea of a premise is that it lays down the most basic foundation of a writer's work, and just like a movie post or an illustrated cover of a book, it paints a simple image of what's inside, but not much more. And here's the thing, it's incredibly unfortunate to still see so many K-drama writers (whether old or new to screenwriting) fall into this rut when it comes to bringing an idea to life. However, for Mr. Sunshine screenwriter Kim Eun-sook, this doesn't ever appear to be a problem she faces.Kim is one of the most accomplished and sought after screenwriters in the industry, and it's a no-brainer as to why this is the case. In the last 10 years, she has written the script for some of the most commercially successful dramas: Secret Garden (2010), A Gentleman's Dignity (2012), The Heirs (2013), Descendants of the Sun (2016), Goblin (2016), The King (2020), and this drama included. Yes, she may have incorporated overused clichés in a few of her written work (e.g. rich guy-poor girl, evil mother-in-law, etc), but at the same time, it's evident she continues to develop narratives which are so unique and enthralling; a talent which is unsurpassed in the industry. Unlike many writers whose dramas flopped, each one of her projects has stood the test of time, and this drama is no exception.But the success of Mr. Sunshine ought to be shared equally with director Lee Eung-bok, whose creative direction and vast use of cinematic techniques in this drama was seriously not like anything I've seen before. Together, they raised viewers' awareness of Korea's history, and shed light on those deemed peripheral in society. Many with very little understanding or are quick to judge will say that everything portrayed is historically inaccurate or rubbish, but what these people fail to acknowledge is that these very cruel and tragic events did happen, and whether or not this drama perfectly encapsulated that 101% accuracy is irrelevant. Mr. Sunshine was a cleverly crafted masterpiece to simply put, and I have no doubt the producer called in a historian to ensure the historical and factual basis of the premise was presented in such a way that had more to do with the storyline and character development, rather than the accuracy value it would have added to the plot.The storyline was wonderfully perplexing, with each dramatic turn adding all these unexpected twists. It was fuelled with long-awaited revenges, political debacles, and palace shambles, all atop a crumbling social class system and a country's disastrous attempt at stopping the Japanese from invading. Unlikely friendships formed, loyalties tested, identities challenged, and moral compasses questioned, but till the very end, not one person flinched, nor did they flee their allegiance to join another simply for the sake of love or friendship. But what I really appreciated about Mr. Sunshine would be this: the delivery of a poignant love story without the need for any kissing scenes.I'm not going to lie when I say that there's got to be smooching involved to make the chemistry somewhat convincing, but even when there was none of that here, I wasn't the slightest bit concerned or disappointed. Because when there was grief, I ugly cried; when there was suspense, I went numb; when characters embraced, my heart melted; when a character experienced pain, I too felt my heart being ripped out of my chest; whenever a villain or antagonist appeared, my insides burned with rage; when a character showed their quirks, I chuckled with amusement; and last but not least, when a scene was so profoundly sad, it did more than just move me beyond tears.I also admired Kim's screenwriting, because instead of cheapening the plot with unnecessary exchanges, I found myself immersed in eloquent poetry and an engaging dialogue that actually built towards something, whether it was revealing important information about a course of action or disclosing a certain character's disposition. And every time a flashback or sentimental object re-appeared, I knew what purpose it served because the story behind it was so powerful that it became an etched memory (e.g. Lady Yun's norigae (ornament), ragged shoe floating in the well, wooden music box, red paper windmill, etc). The stunning cinematography was also something to marvel at; not just acting as a visual aid, but in creating this immersive historical experience. With a beautifully composed soundtrack to match, I was well and truly enchanted. (Two songs in particular which struck a chord was Park Hyo-shin's ""The Day"", and Baek Ji-young's ""See You Again""; both of which evoked so much soul, emotion, and lyrical meaning).But what this drama could really not have done without was the outstanding performance of its talented cast (whether lead or supporting). The main cast comprising of Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-ri, Yoo Yeon-seok, Kim Min-jung and Byung Yo-han all had a unique charisma and stage presence about them, and I'm so thankful that their talents did not go to waste when they auditioned for their respective roles as Eugene Choi, Go Ae-shin, Gu Dong-mae, Kudo Hina and Kim Hui-seong. To be able to see each individual connect with their characters by immersing themselves in the script was one thing, but then the ability to translate and deliver the right amount of expressive energy and a certain personality on-screen was another. Thus, it was really pleasing to see that actor was emotionally, mentally, and physically invested in whatever challenges their character faced.Not only did Mr. Sunshine record the 6th highest rating for any given episode in cable television (previously coming in 3rd place before the release of Hotel del Luna (2019), Crash Landing on You (2019-20) and the World of the Married (2020)), but it also netted an overall average rating of 12.955%, making it the second highest-rated K-drama of all times in cable television. What makes this latter figure far more significant than the first is because not only does it reflect the popularity of the series during its broadcast, but it also evidences strong audience engagement.No doubt that Mr. Sunshine is probably my most favourite drama to date (along with Crash Landing on You and Signal), but if you ever just need to know why again, please don't hesitate to re-read this review."
2073,Mr. Sunshine,"This drama gives life to your soul, and then somehow takes it all way and lot eave you shattered, kinda like when you break up with your first love on a cold winter's day. It's an emotional rollercoaster with so much to offer.The acting is spectacular, the cinematograph is so too. Everything about this drama was perfect. If you're into melodrama with an epic storyline, this one's for you."
2074,Mr. Sunshine,"As a frequent user of IMDB for years, I have never written any review and I created an account just to leave a comment for this show. After finishing the 24 episodes, I wanted to go back to watch them all over again. The world of the characters still lingers in my head. It's poetic, moving, romantic, informative and engaging. Every character is so distinctive. You cannot help but be drawn into their world. I am still literally missing Hanseong, where the story happens. The fate of 3 men, 1 noble woman and other important supporting characters intertwined together against a chaotic historical background. You care for each one of them. I cannot remember seeing a better ending in a movie or a TV series. The director just brought all the developments together in such a beautiful ending so consistent with the poetic form. A lament. An epic. A poem. A production and art masterpiece that can't be missed."
2075,Mr. Sunshine,"I don't like sad endings but am usually okay with it if it's done right. This series didn't do it right. Everyone died except for the lead actress. Why? I especially didn't like how Eugene Choi died at the end. So you claim there are no more bullets. Meanwhile Ae Shin just killed a bunch of soldiers. Why couldn't she or one of her teammates pick up a dead soldier's gun? Speaking about the teammates, where did they disappear? Why didn't Eugene demand the soldiers drop their guns? Why did Eugene have to go on the last train car as the enemy soldiers? Why couldn't he bluff that he more bullets? Up until this point in the series, Eugene Choi had been pretty sharp, outwitting his enemies. He had common sense. He completely lost it in the end. He panicked and broke completely out of character. I initially gave this series a higher score but dropped it after thinking about the ending."
2076,Mr. Sunshine,"A truly excellent series set in the run up to the Japanese domination of Korea from 1910 to 1945. Part love story, part history ...with a dose of humour ...and some great characters."
2077,Mr. Sunshine,"This limited series felt like I was reading a novel. A well crafted novel which didn't skimp on any aspect nor did it rush through any aspect and made it messy. It was just perfect.I have watched my fair share of Korean series but this was something else. The asthetics, the storytelling, the casting and a special mention to the music, I got immersed in every bit of it.The story moved layer by layer slowly showing us Joseon getting into grips of foreign powers and ultimately being toppled by the Japanese. You could feel every bit of despair the characters felt. You could understand each and every character's motivation behind their actions. And by the end of the series you would be rooting for the protagonists from the depth of your heart that maybe they could pull off the impossible. And that's what felt like a gut punch in the end (not in a bad way). It kept things realistic. It didn't tweak the story just to please the viewers and every death felt meaningful and justified. The sadness I felt with each character's death, I don't think I will ever feel such emotions at a fictional characters' death.Now to the casting. Each of the leads played their character to perfection. Special mention to Lee Buying Hun and Yoo Yeon Seok- I just got my best fictional characters of all time in them. Kim Tae-ri carried herself well and gave her career best performance. That last cry of Choi Yu-jin was just heart wrenching and is still ringing in my ears.To sum it up I don't think I will watch any drama which will reach the level of Mr. Sunshine (I hope I'm wrong). The close second that I can think of is Crash Landing on You. This is my fourth viewing of Mr. Sunshine and it still brings out emotions like I am watching it for the first time. Finally I decided I should write a heartfelt review which this story rightly deserves.Highly recommended to everyone !"
2078,Mr. Sunshine,"Just watched the last episode, and, goodness!!...I feel as if I have been put through the ringer! This gorgeous 24 episode series is full of wonderful acting, gorgeous cinematography and heartfelt music. It is a historical fiction of a young man who is forced to flee Korea because his life is in danger. He comes back years later as an American soldier and ready to take revenge on those who hurt his family. The drama that surrounds him sets the course in the path he takes, whether it ends in happiness or tragedy. I love films that make me care for the characters, even the not-so-good ones. The historical situations were fascinating. It has been a real pleasure waiting for new episodes to come out weekly. Watch this. You will not be disappointed."
2079,Mr. Sunshine,"I was expecting a romantic drama but what I got was a history lesson. The romance was scarce but feelings plentiful. What I enjoyed most about the show was the growing friendship between the three very different men and their bond over the love for the same woman. Was disappointed over the ending though and my first rating was only a 4, however after the first disappointment I appreciate it for what it was."
2080,Mr. Sunshine,"Probably the people who wrote negative reviews have misunderstood the true meaning of the story. This is not a romantic TV series, this is simply a genuine hymn to the beauty and strength of the Joseon. The romantic story between the lovers is only the frame of a splendid picture depicting the Joseon of the years 1870-1920. The real protagonists are the emotions and the ardor of those who have the strength to fight for the survival of their homeland, even at the cost of their lives."
2081,Mr. Sunshine,"All the plaudits given to this series are well deserved. The two stars whose romance takes its own funny time to get going are faultless and well-matched. But what makes this epic so memorable is the supporting cast. The ensemble. It's fair to say that this would have been a great show even without 'The Great Love Story'. I was especially impressed by the owner of the Glory Hotel. Kudo Hina and her traitorous father. Lee Wan Ik, one of the best villains that I.ve ever seen. But they are just two of a wonderful array of characters. Some baddies, some goodies and some funny and human. All of them attractive, especially the women and yet something unbelievable happens...................... The Great Love story is told without a single kiss."
2082,Mr. Sunshine,A very good television after a very long time....top notch cinematography...a gem of a series...i am glad i watched it...PURE ART !!! (A big thumbs up for the cinematography).
2083,Mr. Sunshine,"This is how a story should be. The excellent telling and the plot undeniably superb. But, typical of Korean Drama, the ending will keep you sighing for a better ending. Excellently done from beginning to end."
2084,Mr. Sunshine,Magnificent cinematography and storytelling. Each and every episode is very well written and superbly acted.No doubt this will be one the best series ever made.
2085,Mr. Sunshine,"An epic drama series with great cinematography, awesome ensemble cast and a touching Chosun Le Mis story."
2086,Mr. Sunshine,"Storyline is so unexpected that keeps you excited every episode. Actors are just wow. Whole serie dragged me to learn Korean history in Wiki, Korean language in Duolingo and Korean culture in YouTube 🙈 It's a drama mixed with romance, patriotism and comedy. I swallowed whole 24 chapters in less then a week. Loved it!!
Acting is really good, romantic scenes are making you cry... The only exaggeration I'd say is in Japanese characters...can't be uglier or eval (who knows, maybe it was their way back in 1900s)."
2087,Mr. Sunshine,"Set in 1900s,this story dwells on Japanese occupation in Korea and how the Righteous Army of Korea try their best to defy it.
This drama not really speaks of historical events much, but more on how normal ppl in Korea reacts to it. We saw different character development as the events unfold, and I can say the storyline that follows are one of the best I seen, something that Hollywood had fail to capture in many years.
Stunning visuals, amazing OSTs, strong characters, and great storyline. Definitely a masterpiece that will stood strong in many years to come."
2088,Mr. Sunshine,"I love every picture! The colours, the light, the angles - that alone is art!
And there is so much tragedy and emotion. I really feel sorry for the characters and that's something not every show achieves these days. Too bad it hasn't been translated, but after a while you don't notice the subtitles anymore.
The music is also great, albeit unexpected. It's a strange mix of something you would expect in a Sherlock Holmes series and American pop songs.
Anyway, I've seen the first three episodes so far and I totally love it!"
2089,Mr. Sunshine,"We just got done with the first episode, and my husband and I enjoyed it immensely. The cinematography work is stunning, the battle scenes are well choreographed and realistic, and there is some great acting in this show. The story line is shaping up to be an interesting one. There is a lot going on in this first episode, and you may find yourself frustrated at first, trying to figure out the timeline and characters, as there are flash forwards and more than one story line, but it looks at least for now, that they will start merging fairly quickly. I highly recommend this show.UPDATE: We have moved through the first 5 episodes, and this show just keeps getting better and better!"
2090,Mr. Sunshine,"Great acting, interesting weaving of history and fiction, memorable characters."
2091,Mr. Sunshine,"Lovely costumes settings and effects as usual for an historical drama. Unfortunately it's infested with the usual K.drama tropes, and some silliness. They double down on their dreadful time wasting obsession (we all know who gets who from episode one - they've NEVER broken the mould) with love triangles and seem to have a love quadrangle here (only up to ep.9 though....). It crawls (so far) with the usual silly coincidences and stupidity (e.g. Delivering a gun into enemy territory - why not just leave a message?), people that have just fired guns and changed clothes manageing to smell gunpowder on each other followed by long stares at female lead who puts her whole organisation at risk by opening up to the lead male and she can't seem to move without tripping over him - is this a one street town? I'd think he was a stalker if I were her..... Ages seem to make little sense either - to be polite some people must age very well when they move into their present day. I HAVE (as I said earlier) only watched to ep. 9 though - and may up or down the rating by a point.Having said that it is very watchable and is nowhere near as bad as many Korean dramas - but 10/10? I don't think so. What would these people give as a score for example for ""My Mister""Edit - up to episode 16. Changed my mind somewhat - it is very engaging - added a point but I'd say 7.5 - you HAVE to leave elbow room for the REALLY good stuff......"
2092,Mr. Sunshine,"First of all, the cinematography was incredible! The colours, lightning, camera angles, everything was beautifully put together. It must have taken a lot of time and effort to create the visuals of this series, but I think it all paid off because it truly enhanced the viewing experience.This show mixes history and fiction, which can be tricky, but I think it was a smart move in this case. They used elements of romance and humor in a very creative and tasteful way. The fiction helped drive the plot forward without overshadowing or making light of the historical events. The only critisism I have regarding this is that I wished they would have clarified which parts or the story that were fictional in last episode.The acting was really good (Yeon-Seok Yoo was a personal favourite) and I was especially impressed by how well the child actors managed to portray complex emotions. There were a lot of different characters in this series and at first I had some trouble figuring out how everybody were related and how they fit into the timeline. But as the plot thickened, I noticed how all the characters contrubuted to the storyline and I could no longer imagine the series without them all in it.At its core, I felt that this show was all about highlighting an important piece of history. Growing up in Europe, I never learnt much about the Japanese invasions of Korea. I knew that people would compare the rising sun flag to the nazi's swastika, but not much beyond that. To me, Mr. Sunshine became a learning tool.My final score is 8/10, mainly because the first half of the series was a bit slow for my taste. Overall it was a great show, well worth a view."
2093,Mr. Sunshine,This show offers you a very interesting piece of history set in a exciting way even if some episodes feel very slow in progression. However it also gives you not too much of the common Korean way of over-acting. The only thing I can really criticize is that the age difference of the two protagonists is about 20 years so a love story between them feels a bit awkward.
2094,Mr. Sunshine,"I cannot believe how incredibly rich this Korean Drama is. As others have said, the first episode seems confusing, but stick with it and it quickly falls into place. It's more profound than Shakespeare and all of the characters will become part of your heart as the show takes you through the heartbreaking and brutally cruel narrative of the Righteous Army, cultural hierarchy, friendship, love and war in Korea at the turn of the last century.
The Exquisite cinematography is captivating and powerful. So too is the directing, acting, writing, costumes and music throughout the 24 episodes. You'll be fluent in Japanese and Korean by the end."
2095,Mr. Sunshine,"Man, I would've given the show 10/10 if everybody hadn't died in the end. Took away 2 stars for all the tears I'd shed."
2096,Mr. Sunshine,"I love this series. The actors play their roles very well. And because of this series, i'm interested in history of joseon"
2097,Mr. Sunshine,"First of all, GO WATCH THIS! I stumbled upon this series on Netflix after watching 'Kingdom'. After ready the earlier reviews of, I was about to say basically the same thing. The story, the locations, the characters, cinematography,... all is perfect. There isn't a thing I found bad.For a series that has 24 episodes and where each episode last about 1h15min, it never gets boring. It starts bit chaotic but it's definitely worth it to stick around. There is a good balance between the romance, the drama, the fighting and there are some really funny parts.Whether you're a person that likes history/romance/drama/etc... You'll love it! The closer you come to the end, the sadder you'll get because it will eventually end. I can promise this, I will not be shameful if you drop a tear and the end.
The 8,8/10 is definitely a correct score and maybe should get even more. I don't understand why this series hasn't got more international attention because it beats Hollywood on every level."
2098,Mr. Sunshine,"It's been so long since great drama like this. Highly recommended. Beautiful setting, great plot and great and strong characters. Love them!"
2099,Mr. Sunshine,Elements of Japanese and Korean culture colours and beautiful photography sets! Captivating script ! Excelente !
2100,Mr. Sunshine,"Maybe it is just me, the combination of history, war, heroism, love, and ultimate sacrifice had such an impact on me. I couldn't get out of the story for days after I watched it. Lee Byung-hun is an amazing actor! In fact, the whole crew including all the lead roles and supporting roles are amazing. The side effect is that after watching this one, nothing else is good enough to watch."
2101,Mr. Sunshine,"This was a wonderful series with great actors and story-line! Even though the characters are fictional, the history of Korean and Japan in the early 1900's isn't. Wonderful filming and great cast. It's lengthy but the action picks up more and more as it moves on. Makes some of our video entertainment take a back seat."
2102,Mr. Sunshine,"First, the cinematography of this drama is the best in kdrama industry, no doubt
Second, the character development is too good
Third, the relationship between main lead could give me full feeling what they want to give and perfect
Fourth, the OST are amazing and the timing is quite perfect
Fifth, this is hundred times better than Crash Landing on you"
2103,Mr. Sunshine,"Nothing much to say about this master piece. It's the best korean drama I've watched to date. It's got the right balance across the story, politics, humour and the romance. The cinematography is excellent, the actors are brilliant, you can't ask for more. The ending is so unpredictable and beautiful. Worth your time."
2104,Mr. Sunshine,Very beautiful picture. Intrasting details and nuances of the Joseon culture. This is where all the pros end.A lot of extra episodes. The plot is drawn-out and chaotic. The protagonist looks like an embalmed terminator. There is no chemistry between the main characters. This is a relationship between a grandfather and a granddaughter. Frenzied patriotism in everything. I fell asleep on every episode.
2105,Mr. Sunshine,What a beautiful and moving production. I hated to see it end.
2106,Mr. Sunshine,"I can't believe I had this on my watchlist for a long time and didn't see this sooner. I can honestly say, in my opinion, that it had everything it needed to make this masterpiece; good actors, chemistry between them, beautiful scenery, action, drama, comedy, and most importantly a compelling story which is based on real historical events."
2107,Mr. Sunshine,I love this show! I never would have thought that I would get addicted to watching a Korean show with subtitles!! But the story is so sweet and the actors are great! It's a feel good story and definitely worth watching!
2108,Mr. Sunshine,"Was bored and disappointed up to episode 18 (slow, long, and not much happening), and from there, the build up of all my emotions came back, which explained why i gave 7 stars instead of 4. A story with great potential, however was let down by the dragging storyline and not so impressive choice of lead actress Kim Tae-Ri . Loved the last few apisodes, but could have portraited better through out. Actors Lee Byung Hun and Yoo Yeon Seok did a great job in this one."
2109,Mr. Sunshine,"Wauw just finally some good acting, some real emotions and just beautifully filmed."
2110,Mr. Sunshine,"Mr. Sunshine, what an absolutely Masterpiece.It is a historical drama that takes the background of the Japanese occupation in Korea, Netflix has succeeded in adapting this work of fiction as well.The plot is amazing, the acting is stunning, and most importantly the cinematography and visuals are beautiful and aesthetically. Besides, the romance between two main-cast of the series, Lee Byung-Hun as Eugene Choi and Kim Tae-ri as Go Ae-Shin make you mesmerized. Classy romance without any nudity and the dialogue between two of them so lovely.Overall, 10/10 rate for one of the most beautiful K-Dramas I've ever watched. This has become one of my all-time favorite K-Drama.Thank you for a great series and thanks to the writers, actors and whoever participating in making this series. Wishing you a great success!!!"
2111,Mr. Sunshine,"I've seen a lot of great movies and tv productions over the years, but none I've enjoyed more than Mr. Sunshine.All five of the main characters and the actors that played them were awesome, the story line engaging for the entire 30+ hours, the scenery incredible, the character development great and the drawn out cinematic effects appreciated. The music was also incredible and I find myself listening to the OST a lot.I watched the first 11 episodes by myself before I finally convinced my wife to watch the show. Then I watched them again with her. She doesn't usually like subtitled shows but grew to love this show as much as I did.The only negative thing was that it had to end!!! And it's spoiled a lot of other shows for me - like Better Call Saul - which I used to love but which pale in comparison.Ive told so many friends about this show that I'm sure they think I'm on some sort of commission from the producers or Netflix!!"
2112,Mr. Sunshine,"Everything about this series is superb!! The storyline, writing, directing, acting, cinematography, historical setting, etc. It grabs your attention and holds it so intensely that you have no choice but to keep watching. You are immediately sucked into this period drama, hitting you with every emotion! I have found myself laughing hysterically to crying my eyes out to wanting to exact harsh justice to desire for romance. This is one of the best series I have ever seen in my life! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
2113,Mr. Sunshine,"I got depressed, couldn't sleep for days. Couldn't stop watching! Nice story, beautiful scenes, great acting and it was just a wonderful show."
2114,Mr. Sunshine,"This drama got me. I'm enjoying it so much. It has everything I like: drama, suspense, romance, history, and even a touch of comedy sometimes. Most of all it made me look up on history books, but understanding that is not real, I found out that it's near to it. I can't wait for the last episode."
2115,Mr. Sunshine,"To place this awe-inspiring story in an earthly labeled box would be an injustice. It's an extraordinary, collective love story of interconnected souls---of the so-called ""good"" and ""bad""---that stem from the extremely rare, Unconditional, True Love (of self and others).Though the story also includes a love story between two individuals, it's not the typical one that's been diluted throughout the ages, and often based on the very common, conditional love and/or lust.When viewed with an OPEN mind and heart---aka integrated Mind/Heart of Soul/Spirit within---you will truly appreciate the showing of the FULL rainbow spectrum of human aspects that exists within all of us (to varying degrees), ranging from the contrast/duality/polarity of the so-called good and bad, right and wrong, light and dark, etc. As you pay close attention, you will realize that experiencing any form of duality helps us to deeply appreciate its opposite. For instance, we can never experience what we call Unconditional Forgiveness UNTIL we've experienced the opposite energies such as heartbreak, betrayal, anger, rage, hatred, and/or sadness; hence, even the so-called ""negative"" aspects have a Divine purpose to highly benefit interconnected Life, despite outer appearances.As collective humanity, our ego selves---conditioned by society since childhood---are often quick to judge everything, everyone and their mamas and grandmamas, and especially anything unknown or somewhat foreign. And this show can remind us to clearly see, and intensely feel, the bigger picture with an expanded perspective.Earthly labels such as race, ethnicity, gender, social status (e.g., slave vs royalty), positions, ranks, financial background, education level, family history, etc. gracefully move with the ebb and flow of Life as they play the game of separation consciousness vs unity consciousness, collide and then break way, and even gently and beautifully merge as One.I'm very grateful that the creators incorporated magnificent fireworks of all invaluable, human emotions (our inner compass revealing our authentic state) and feelings (language of the Soul), which are Divine, precious gifts given to humanity while experiencing the physical world on planet Earth.In this very fast-paced, instant gratification society that we live in, it's a breath of fresh air to experience highly creative cinematography and storytelling at its finest. This impressive series include some of the following soul-igniting themes that radiate humanity (and its significant opposites that make them stand out in the spotlight): fascinating, lovable and memorable characters, inner-strength, courage, determination, resilience, honor, loyalty, deep understanding, pure compassion, empathy, unconditional forgiveness, true friendship, outstanding teamwork, fiery passion, freedom to make a choice, wild adventures, intelligence (mental and emotional), patience, gratitude, deep appreciation, charisma, refreshingly honest communication, heartfelt verbal and nonverbal expressions (like gentle yet intense eye contact), joy in various forms (like free-spirited playfulness), inner-peace, wisdom, the dance between the material and spiritual worlds, and last but not least...profound, Unconditional Love.By the way, the creators also did an excellent job of integrating humor into various scenes in Divine perfect timing and order. So don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling, chuckling, laughing, and even rolling and/or holding your stomach due to hilarious moments. ^_^So far, this is hands down THE BEST Korean drama I've ever watched, and I'm a Japorean-American who lived in Korea most of my childhood, and was also stationed there for three years while in the Army. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to this amazing creation. You definitely went above and beyond, and I have no doubt that you will continue to Be a wonderful gift to this world, merging worlds, Galaxy, Universe, and beyond."
2116,Mr. Sunshine,The best korean drama ever. Highly recommended to watch.
2117,Mr. Sunshine,"Storyline: Do not expect much. Kinda messy a bit but not that bad.
Characters: Superb! High-class acting skills from all actors/actress. Ok here pls expect a lot 😂
Scenes: Too dramatic (in a good way). I wonder if I ever watched such an advanced cinematic experience on Hollywood films like this 🤔"
2118,Mr. Sunshine,"This is a work of art. Stunning in its storytelling, cinematography, costumes, soundtrack, historical references, action scenes, acting...well in just everything. This period drama takes place before the illegal annexation of Korea by Japan. It brings us the story of the will and strength of a country's people. It demonstrates the cruelty of colonization and it shows the cruelty of discrimination when you do it among your own and when outsiders pummel their way in to your land and discriminate against both the rich and the poor. The beautiful and provoking love stories are not just between the lead characters, but it's also the love story of the Josean people for Josean. Hollywood needs to watch this masterpiece and learn. 2020 has been a tough year and my discovery of the Korean television and movie industry has helped me through this year. Mr. Sunshine is outstanding and among the best in television dramas that I have ever experienced."
2119,Mr. Sunshine,"Always little bit odd when you start to watch something that is oldschool asian style combined with modern touch.
The overdramatic asian thearics with a cool modern cocky style.
Love the combination, puts a smile to everything.A great story with a truly spetacular cinematography and lighsetting."
2120,Mr. Sunshine,"This is literally one of the best things I've ever seen. The way its potrayed, the depth to characters, the overarching story, people's beliefs, etc etc.. everything is just right on point."
2121,Mr. Sunshine,Binge watching ever since I found it on Netflix. Lee Byung Hun is an amazing actor. I cannot get enough of Yu-Jin. Sad it is only 22 episode show and its already over half way.
2122,Mr. Sunshine,"Like many people, my exposure to Korean cinema has been Parasite and that is it. I came across this K-drama on Netflix and got completely hooked. Every aspect of it is top notch. The acting is exceptional and the lead actor and actress just breed chemistry despite having little physical contact. How refreshing it was to watch a gradual building of a romance. The cinematography was unbelievable. They found the most beautiful locations to film the scenes. The score and music fits the mood perfectly.I did not know any of the history portrayed so I researched it and the script was fair in basically criticizing everyone for what happened to Joseon. The screen writer built several fascinating characters and let us gradually get to know them. And every actor was believable in their roles. Special credit goes to Kim Tae-ri for being so believable as a pampered noble initially and then a freedom fighter for Joseon. Her beauty as an actress made it very real that she could capture the hearts of three handsome men and yet be kind to each of them despite their longing.I was so sad to have the series end. I could have gone on for weeks watching this drama. Thanks to Netflix for bringing this A+ production to a world audience."
2123,Mr. Sunshine,"Like many tv shows it starts off with great potential but falls into the trap of trying to milk every last ounce out of it. It could easily have been done in half the time. With hours spent staring blankly at each other, whispering then wandering off, only to repeat the same scene again, and again, and again. The plot needs to be a lot more fast paced and twice the amount of action. It could have benefited from getting some better quality American actors also as the ones used may as well be made out of wood. It still has several episodes to go so could rescue itself somewhat but now I'm watching out of some sort of obligation with very few enjoyable/interesting moments each episode as it's so strung out. Repeating the same scenes in the same locations...."
2124,Mr. Sunshine,"This is a TV show that focuses on the complexities of Asian history. It has also very complex characters, which make the story challenging and captivating at the same time. The period chosen is perfect because of the many elements and actors involved in social and political change in Eastern Asia. The cinematography is one of the best I have seen so far. Mr. Sunshine is a must see."
2125,Mr. Sunshine,"For a foreigner you have to do a bit of reading in Korean history to understand this series. But after one episode you are hooked on. The cinematography is stunning, the actors in beautiful clothes and the script is awesome. Linking back to previous scenes and qoutes, mixing with a few jokes, makes the series breathtaking. Hopefully the world will open up more for these type of k Drama."
2126,Mr. Sunshine,"Nice characters, very good actors and an interesting story. Perfect cinematography"
2127,Mr. Sunshine,I just wont to say thank you for this amazing Story. No words can say what i feel in this Moment. Step forword for all actors.
2128,Mr. Sunshine,"It is an age that there are countless dramas of love storyline. Among similar TV-dramas, the one ""Mr. Sunshine"" is a very high quality TV-movie series. Especially, the great performance produced by male lead Lee Byung-hun and female lead Kim Tae-ri are one of the delights of watching this drama. Mr. Lee is already a great actor well-known to the public. On the other hand, in my case, Ms. Kim first got to know her through this drama. The reason why I wait for this drama every weekend is her presence. Her beautiful acting and her elegant voice are one of the main factors that make the drama distinguishable from countless ordinary love story movies. Of course, the power of the drama script and the ability of the director are indispensable. The period of the drama is from 1990 to 1905. Nevertheless, the love story of the two lovers is moving beyond the times."
2129,Mr. Sunshine,"1) The main thing - It's a brilliant combination of international historical intrigue, action, and slow-burning romance, with a character for every perspective & ethical dilemma. Think Hemingway + Graham Greene + Korea 1900.
2) Jump cutting is very well-used, and I like the effect for sustained interest. But the 1st 2 episodes have scenes where we move quickly forward, often to a new character and/or setting, but get no explanation until a bit later. It's well worth an episode or 2 of waiting. Also, flashbacks occur briefly (15-45 seconds at a time) to remind us of some motivation in the current scene. A bit over-used, but it's hard to quibble with something that may consume a minute per episode.
3) I'm sensitive to the music, which is generally good, but about once per episode suddenly becomes an indie folk orchestral ballad in English. That really grates, ruins the mood & the realism. For me. =)
4) The criticisms are certainly minor enough that my overall rating stays high. I'm loving it!"
2130,Mr. Sunshine,"This is probably the best show I have ever watched.From beginning to end the cinematography is stunning. Even simple scenes are gorgeously shot, capturing the landscape and the people of Joseon exquisitely.The script and acting kept me enthralled in the storyline right from the beginning. The characters intertwine and relate so well that you are in suspense from the start. Many would say that this is simply a love story, but they would be wrong. Yes there is a love story entwined into the plot, and you could even say it is the driving force of the main story, but the motivation around the main characters are truly what drives this show home.This show had be sobbing one moment and then with tears still clinging to my eyelashes laughing the next. The characters are incredible relatable and well developed that you almost forget that you're watching a show.I want to encourage anyone who might be hesitant in watching this show due to it not being in English. It is, in my opinion, a work of art, that not only is entertaining to watch, but also completely and utterly emotionally grounded to humanity's compassion for each other.Spectacular."
2131,Mr. Sunshine,"Byung-Hun Lee is maturing an an actor, simple eye movements draws you in and gets you on his side in this new Korean love story...new on the scene actor Tae-ri Kim adds light and together these two portray a bygone era..."
2132,Mr. Sunshine,This is the most beautifully done series I've ever seen. Each frame of each shot was like a painting. The story is your typical historical k drama but because the cinematography is so on point it becomes like a beautiful story book. It's worth binge watching over and over again.
2133,Mr. Sunshine,This was a beautiful movie! I learned about some of Korea's history and it's people. Very good movie!
2134,Mr. Sunshine,Best of the best I love you South Koreans sarangae
2135,Mr. Sunshine,"Although a very long story, it is a tragedy. It is sad, heart breaking, and disappointing. The name Mr Sunshine could be changed to Mr Tragedy."
2136,Mr. Sunshine,"I've watched 15 episodes of this series and I just gave up because I found that the story was becoming boring and convoluted. I started disliking the characters after Eugene revealed to Ae-Sin that he was born a slave. I don't know why but it's really hard for me to like the characters. I didn't have a problem with them but there are just some weird interactions and I don't know if it's a Korean thing or what. I don't feel the chemistry between the two leads as much. It just feels like their relationship is something that's happening and not meant to be. When they shook hands and said ""Let's do it. Love"", I couldn't help wince. The storytelling is lacking because it's a little hard to keep up with events and there are too many filler scenes. Sorry to say this but I didn't like Hui-Seong because he felt like he didn't belong in the story. I'll admit that the scenery is beautiful and the acting is decent, but the foreign actors are a little off. The idea of a sheltered noble woman experiencing romance for the first time and an Asian-American perspective during the time period are interesting. When Joseph died, I only felt a little sad because we didn't really see Joseph that much so his death was a bit anticlimactic. I think this show should have explored the political and social relationships with America and Japan better because I felt like the main characters weren't as involved in the process as I would have liked. They should have expanded on the righteous army more and maybe they will in the next episodes but I was so confused when Eugene and Ae-Sin were recruited by the righteous army and were told that they couldn't see each other. The action scenes were okay and I know that Korean television tends to shy away from showing violence and they didn't have to show any but they just felt choppy. Also, the music is kind of inappropriate in some scenes, like when they play some indie song during a romantic scene. It's not a bad show but the editing can be choppy and you might feel lost at times. Sometimes it's hard to know what the plot is. I know that at episode 15, the American missionary died and Eugene is trying to solve the murder case and he knows that Dong-mae didn't do it. He suspects Yang-ju and that Wan-ik is behind the plan. The emperor wrote a letter to an American representative in Shanghai and he gave Joseph the job of delivering it but later he claimed that the letter was fake. I can't really tell what the side characters are doing. If you like this show, that's great that you can get enjoyment from it. :)"
2137,Mr. Sunshine,"Haven't watched such a good series in years! Every episode feels like a movie. The cinematography and visuals are stunning, the score is hauntingly beautiful, the characters are full of depth and you can't help but develop an overwhelming attachment to them. Amazing actors. This has become My favourite series of all time"
2138,Mr. Sunshine,"Watched it with the lowest expectations but it definitely exceeded it amazingly. Historical dramas aren't usually my favourites but with the mix of western & Japanese influence, it made it a unique and worth-watching drama. The romance is pure and light & there are a few scenes that I find unnecessarily long but the way the characters grow through episodes really made it worth every second. The story in conclusion is intense, insanely heartbreaking and filled with patriotic moments that I think is beautiful. Not to forget the humor! It created some of the iconic moments and since the writer is the same with Goblin, it has amazing storyline that I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I'm very picky with kdramas but this made it into my top 5 without doubt!"
2139,Mr. Sunshine,"There were some episodes that were just amazing. Others, though, really could have been combined into 1-2 episodes. Below are my thoughts on the episodes.Episodes 1-3. These are important to watch because they layout the background and key characters for the show.Episodes 4-7. These could have been consolidated into 1-2 episodes. If you want to save yourself a few hours, you can probably skip some of these episodes and not miss out on much.Episodes 8-10. There was more action and Go Ae-Shin shined more. She is such a tough woman and yet for so many of the episodes she was made out to be simply a lovestruck woman who needed protection.Episodes 11-17. These could have been consolidated into 2-3 episodes. I almost stopped watching at episode 14 because it was getting so slow and repetitive with the storyline. If you want to save yourself a few hours, you can probably skip some of these episodes and not miss out on much.Episodes 18-24. Go Ae-Shin and the Righteous Army really shined throughout these episodes. Based on what was laid out in the early episodes, it seemed like the Righteous Army would be a key factor in the show but for many of the episodes they were either not mentioned at all or were a very small part. I liked that the Righteous Army played a larger role in the last few episodes. To me, it gave the show more meaning.The good episodes mostly made up for the slow, repetitive episodes, hence the 8."
2140,Mr. Sunshine,"Good drama, good actors, beautiful scenery. Very touching story with a sad ending"
2141,Mr. Sunshine,"Having seen a third of the series, I realised THIS is what female gaze looks like. How realisations, emotions and decisions are displayed simply and extensively through the eyes of the actors, and done so splendidly. How strength is not constant, but also sometimes giving in to softness. How the ""bad guys"" are complete individuals, as well as the ""good guys"" with complex characters, making the viewer shift sides as the story moves forward. I dearly appreciate not knowing how this will end within the first 10 minutes of the show, which is too common in western media, with emphasis on what's made in the US. South Korea has so far never but exceeded my expectations and each episode of Mr Sunshine surpasses the previous. It does has its downsides, but all in all is a delight with its choice in versatile actors, lovely scenery, amazing costume and unusual pace."
2142,Mr. Sunshine,"It's one of the best dramas from Korea. Unlike the mainstream romantic dramas, this will leave you in awwww... Cause this drama gives u a feel which u can't even explain. Its painful, happy Ness and some regret. If u are empathetic, be ready to left out with a heavy heart.."
2143,Mr. Sunshine,"Beautifully crafted piece that will tug at so many emotional strings throughout the entire drama. Cinematography is amazing and actors are so well casted for these roles. Mr. Sunshine is a pleasant surprise that takes you on an intense journey while learning about the history of Korea during the late 1800s and early 1900s. It also captures the beautiful natural scenery of Korea (makes me want to visit so badly). You feel empowered by the amazing female lead who is not your typical weak, dependent and cute girl. She is a women of courage, strength and holds a touching story, wishing to fight and not back down. Her love story with the lead actor is so shockingly intimate despite the purity and wholesome encounters. I agree that the soundtrack is not the most outstanding but it is fitting for the drama. I love the acting of mostly all the people in this series, and you can't help but cry so hard with and for these characters. I've watched many Korean dramas and this is definitely at the top of my list. If you're looking for something that's a bit different from the typical popular idol dramas, then this is something to try out."
2144,Mr. Sunshine,"I wanted to watch every single episodes in the movie theater. It really was like a beautiful movie and couldn't be better than this. Not to mention it's perfect storyline based on the historical background, music, acting, cinematography, every single lines were just impeccable.. I strongly recommend to everyone. I was glad that I am Korean after watching this because first, I felt so bad that subtitles couldn't translate the very meaning of the lines very often and second, it was heart throbbing for us to see how we overcame all the hardships and become who we are now. However you don't necessarily need to be Korean to enjoy these beautiful pieces of arts. In fact you will be glad if you watch this masterpiece. Especially if you are interested in Korean or Korea for any reasons, this can be a good start to understand Korean sentiment. It will be very enjoyable for everyone and will give you some emotional experience as well.
Although the romance and most of main characters were fiction written by writer's imagination, each of them were showing the reality of Korea at that time very well. And all the sub characters were real as they show how they furiously trying to fight against Japanese imperialism. Also Eugene Choi Character is based on the real person name Ki-hwan Hwang who went to America when he was a teenager and worked as an US soldier, and also worked hard for Liberation of Korea. It was very impressive."
2145,Mr. Sunshine,"First time to rate 10 out of 10 a TV series and a Korean one. I was really impressed with the production, the script, best picture I ever seen so far in a TV series; the connection of 3 male characters and that twist of humor while their discover a friendship; the culture represented through other characters and their fight; that self-sacrifice love that pushes her to become better and achieve her goals. Really fascinating. Enjoyed it a lot. Worth watching it!"
2146,Mr. Sunshine,"Halfway on Mr.Sunshine now, I must say TVN series had never fail to surprise me. Had been watching a lot of old dramas that have very high ratings lately, first I have Reply 1998 topping my list , now followed by Mr.Sunshine!"
2147,Mr. Sunshine,"A must watch series, highly recommend to everyone. You will LOVE it"
2148,Mr. Sunshine,"Absolutely fabulous series. From the actors/actresses, to the costumes, scenery and of course history. Can't stop watching. It deserves a try!!!!!!"
2149,Mr. Sunshine,"This drama is a masterpiece on all levels, it's very sophisticated!! Every episode feels like a movie and every second is worth the time. This k-drama made me cry the most among all the dramas i've seen before.It's a must watch."
2150,Mr. Sunshine,"I'm so amazed of everything. I got attached to every actor in this series, especially yoo yeon seok! He looked so different comparing to his other characters in other dramas and his acting was fascinating..."
2151,Mr. Sunshine,"Everything about it was beautiful and heartbreaking at once
The story was perfect from start to finish. Chills, tears, smiles and butterflies were guaranteed. Every character was well-written and complex. Even the side character was important for the story. Perfect!It's hard to move on from Eugene, Aeshin, Kudo Hina, Dongmae, Huiseong~"
2152,Mr. Sunshine,The understated acting/writing/directing makes it a very powerful love story. Gorgeous to experience! Only halfway through but I don't want it to end. So intelligent and humorous as well.
2153,Mr. Sunshine,"SOMETIMES YOU LIKE THE SHOW BECAUSE OF CERTAIN FACTOR SUCH AS STORY ,ACTING,DIRECTING OR MUSIC BUT HERE YOU FIND PERFECT SCORE ON ALL GROUNDS ALL WHAT I HAVE SEEN BEFORE SEEMS UNIMPORTANT AND IT WILL B E DIFFICULT TO WATCH ANOTHER WORK ON THE SAME LEVEL I WILL SEE IT MORE AND MORE CAUSE EVERYTIME I WATCH SOME DEFFRENT CERTAIN GREAT PERFORMANCE WHICH CANT BE SEEN WATCHING THIS WORK FOR ONE TIME ONLY."
2154,Mr. Sunshine,Mr. Sunshine is amazing. Beautiful love story in a stunning decor. Take your time and enjoy the iconic series.
2155,Mr. Sunshine,"This is such a beautiful mini-series. I was glued. I knew nothing of Korean history so it got me to investigate. So if you know what happened to Korea in the late 1800's early 1900's, you know it doesn't end well. But still knowing that, I wanted a hollywood ending. Cried my eyes out. I was mad at what happened. But it was true of many who suffered in Korea at the hands of the Japanese. Even though the main characters are fiction, they represent what happened to a lot of Koreans. Now I was mad because the main character made the stupidest decision in the train scene. He could have achieved the same goal without doing what he did. There could have been at least one victory in the love dept. That being said, this was definitely a good one."
2156,Mr. Sunshine,"I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw, in Chapter 13, that Eugene was serving fish from a pull-tab can! Pull-tab cans weren't marketed until the 1960s! What ignorant young person placed that can in the shot? Was it, perhaps, an intentional prank?
I continue enjoying this wonderful adventure/love story, and will not give up on it over a tuna can."
2157,Mr. Sunshine,Absolutely fantastic. Slow but exquisite developing story.
2158,Mr. Sunshine,"So often we are served up bland bite sized portions of easily digested apple sauce programming; Mr Sunshine is life a breath of fresh air, a feast for the eyes and soul. Certainly I would agree with some that you have to be quick to read the sub-titles but the richness of the telling of the story, the beautifully sensitive respectful sequences and the gentle humor added does have a Shakespearean ring about it.For those that like simple food, pass this one by but if you're interested in a sumptuous experience this one is a must."
2159,Mr. Sunshine,"Yes, this is a romance but a wonderful non-gratuitous love story. Pact with historical themes, very interesting characters, class warfare, revenge and absolution. What I enjoyed most was the pacing of the story, it rarely gets ""stuck"". Also the cinematography was outstanding, capturing the highlights of the story and the beautiful set locations. I highly recommend listening to this in its native language because the rhythms of actors voices would be ruined by any ""dub"". Cannot say enough on how much I enjoy ""waiting"" for the weekends to get the next episodes of this show."
2160,Mr. Sunshine,"Everything about this series is perfect!From the cast to story line, the script is perfect, the direction, production, art, photography, the action... Everything is wonderful including the history behind it."
2161,Mr. Sunshine,"I can't get enough of this show. Everything about it is perfection. I dont even know where to start. The love stories, the friendships, the sense of community, and the heroism along with action and great lines make its near flawless. Not to mention the scenery is beautiful. I'd give it a 9.5 but that's not an option just because the name is cheesy and doesn't really tie into the story much and the first episode had some slightly awkward moments but everything after has been exquisite. I'm hooked!"
2162,Mr. Sunshine,An absolute feast for any lover of cinematography. The story is huge and based on historic events. A love story that evokes the senses.
2163,Mr. Sunshine,"This was a very good drama. It has beautiful cinematography, OST was perfect! Wonderful acting by all and the storyline was sooooo goood!!! Must watch for everyone!"
2164,Mr. Sunshine,"This series was beautiful and so classy. The cinematography was beautiful and does justice to the story,"
2165,Mr. Sunshine,"A very expressive fight about what we hold dear. The story line and the cast come to complete one of the most dramatic movie ever to exist. The ultimate love sacrifice, caried out with elegance to the last moment, made the moments spend in this movie to look like the events were caried in the front of your very eyes, succesfully draging you there, in the middle of the events, living every moment breatless.
A masterpiece in the very real sens of the word !"
2166,Mr. Sunshine,"Definitely one of the beat shows I have ever watched!
The cinematography, photography, writers, costumes, production, location, casting....
I could go on and on about how great every detail was taken care of.
And on top of it, without a doubt the tv show I have cried the most ever while watching.
You invest yourself so much with every single character and story and it gets under your skin.
This is my first IMDB review after pretty much spend every day slave to Netflix or before that every other tv show around and I wanted to start with a perfect 10, so if you are looking for something worth to watch in every way stop looking because you must binge this show right away!"
2167,Mr. Sunshine,"I don't think I've ever seen and I don't think I'll ever see another drama that compares to this one
This may be the first and last time that I'll ever rate a drama 10/10The story and its complexity 10/10
Characters, their backstory and development 10/10
Cinematography was simply a masterpiece
OSTs 10/10Sure, the romance might have been better, and sure the age difference between the two actors was awkward, but that's not the whole point of the story.
It is a story about people who sacrificed their all trying to save their country from colonization, people who sold their country, and people who got lost in between.The story shows how the Japanese slowly tried to take over Korea, starting with their economy, planting pro-japanese people in the korean government and eventually colonization. Some people found it slow paced or boring, but to me the pacing was just perfect. It made me feel as if I lived with them, it was a lesson in history packed with emotions, it showed me how history repeats itself in a scary way. No matter where or when, colonization stories are all similar in a way.."
2168,Mr. Sunshine,"I don't write reviews often, but I needed to after watching Mr. Sunshine. Even though I do not speak Korean, I was thoroughly enthralled with every episode. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2169,Mr. Sunshine,"I am thoroughly stunt and highly impressed. Korean movies has always been my Favorates, more than Hollywood ... But this one is beyong my wildest dreams.... Plz make some more of these Korea... Salute and Respect...."
2170,Mr. Sunshine,"From the very beginning I was breath taking by the beautiful filming the scene, the background. WOW..Solid acting from the smallest child to the eldest person there.The music drags you in to the dramatic events, action events, romantic events and the sorrowful events. It actually feels like I'm there.
This series is perfect in every way.Everyone who knows the history of Koreas fate knows the ending, but still to see ALL of the brave and good people in this kingdom fight for what's right, no matter what.... I have no word for that other then I'm in awe to their strength and courage. .
Thank you for creating this amazing series.Ps: A warning for the people who gets depressed easy, I wont recornent it to you."
2171,Mr. Sunshine,"This is an epic drama loosely based on the history of Korea from the perspectives of different but engaging characters. It is set in the time where Joseon (Korea) is fought over between different countries with America and Japan. The main character is played by Byung-Hun Lee, who is a phenomenal Korean actor and opposite of his role is Tae-ri Kim who is a newer actress. Byung-Hun Lee has many years of experience and is a well known Korean actor and he has appeared in numerous American films such as G.I. Joe and R.E.D. Both the actors bring fierce intensity to their roles with their well acted scenes and show such emotion through their lines, looks and even their stares. The supporting cast is also superb as they tell their own stories in this conflicted time. All in all the drama has great production value and truly keeps you mesmerized through it's weekly episodes. If you are a fan of Korean dramas or even if you aren't familiar with them, then this is a great series that you can watch."
2172,Mr. Sunshine,"F..k u,your scenario and your acting skills everyone.
I ve been crying the last hour like a baby since it ended."
2173,Mr. Sunshine,"Excellent cast ,good chemistry, setting excellent, cinematography excellent ,good story and bad ending .Hero can stayed on heroine trail and have shooted the pin to enlock the chain, there is possiblity"
2174,Mr. Sunshine,"I'm not one for words so I'll make this short and sweet. I don't know if I've ever come across tv that affected me this much. I just finished episode 24 and I'm speechless. 
I've never been so raptured by the characters, by the beauty of the cinematography, the acting in a show in recent recollection, maybe ever.The biggest compliment I can give this show is that I fell in love with the characters. There never wasn't a moment when I wasn't rooting for them, on the edge of my seat waiting for what came next. I laughed, cried, and couldn't stop thinking about the story for the life of me.I can't recommend this show enough, it might not be for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. 11/10"
2175,Mr. Sunshine,This is an excelent serie I have never seen one like this before.
2176,Mr. Sunshine,"Yes, you have to read subtitles but it is well worth it. The emotions and acting of the two main characters is great. It also has it's funny most moments. Don't miss out on this series!"
2177,Mr. Sunshine,"This drama is so beautifully shot, so much attention has been paid to making sure every emotion is being conveyed accurately. I also love the dialogue and the intensity of each character. I didn't expect to like this show as much as I do!"
2178,Mr. Sunshine,"Wonderful acting, epic story based on real history, beautiful OST and Cinematography!!
Amazing acting from all actors and actresses.
Unique story line.
Truly one of the best TV drama I have ever seen...
Production value is on par with the Game of Throne and Band of Brothers."
2179,Mr. Sunshine,"Stand out performance by the 5 leads,truly stellar. The many supporting cast was spot on. There is so much to see I have had to view it twice ,so far.
I am 85 and this gem is my favorite"
2180,Mr. Sunshine,"Fantastic historical fiction about turn of the century Korea. Acting, scenery, cinematography, subtitles are all exceptional."
2181,Mr. Sunshine,"I accidentally clicked on this Netflix show , I stayed up all night until the episodes were over. Fine photography superb acting by all characters. I am waiting for the 19th episode."
2182,Mr. Sunshine,"Excellent cinematography, history, script, direction, and casting."
2183,Mr. Sunshine,"This K-Drama proves that you don't need a kiss scene to express love, just how they look at and care for each other. Moreover, the plot, the Joseon history and also cinematography, OST was excellent. This is absolutely a must-watch drama, don't be lure by the press and give it a try and you won't regret."
2184,Mr. Sunshine,"I have to agree with dead_girl, wonderful series best i've seen in a long time. i recently finished watching it and, feeling this empty feeling. The acting was amazing very in depth, just said now lol. wonderful series"
2185,Mr. Sunshine,"Cinematography - Breathtakingly beautiful. They've captured the beauty of Joseon in an accurate but still visually stunning manner. Acting - Every single actor/actress is excellent in ever language they speak, every weapon they wield. Nobody is artificial. Everyone will make their case. South Korea's best talents in their best game. Dialogue - It's meaningful yet heavy prepare for that. Storyline - Stick to it, everything will make sense. Everyone and everything is connected. They do not waste time. Romance - Only the purest and most devoted forms of it, nothing less. If you're into quality entertainment with serious storytelling and excellent cinematography this your treat!"
2186,Mr. Sunshine,Has to watch it again straightaway because I could not get enough.
2187,Mr. Sunshine,"Both lead actors can transfer the forbidden love charactor by the face, eye and their conversation perfectly eventhough no kiss scene. Best historical romantic impression Drama in the threaten-colony era."
2188,Mr. Sunshine,The Korean cinema industry has been able to create great productions over the years and watch a lot of audiences. This series is definitely one of the best of its television productions and should be enjoyed watching it.
2189,Mr. Sunshine,"I dont think the subtitles are as good enough for the poetic script that they speak in Korean... if you understood Korean, almost every script of Eugene is like a poem. This is by far, the best written story i have encountered! This drama has the best actors that really play their roles perfectly... Although the progression and the story might be difficult to understand for people that dont know korean history and the language. The story is about the chaotic time in the 1900's just a few years before the japanese invade josun(korea). The time when everyone all around the world was interested in the korean civilization and the pottery that they produced... I would highly recommend this drama!"
2190,Mr. Sunshine,What a beautiful innocent romance without any nudity..I'm in love!
2191,Mr. Sunshine,"I love Eun Sook story. And I knew she would take me into this one, once again after DOTS, Goblin, & even A Gentleman's Dignity. Mr Sunshine plot soooo good. I love the way she explained the story from the beginning. And she HAS TO do another collab with Eung Bok after Mr Sunshine. They have the chemistry. Eung Bok can turn the story line becomes something mesmerized us. And all actors... After Jang Dong Gun (A Gentleman's Dignity), Gong Yoo (Goblin) and now we have Byung Hun, another mature actor..! Love it so so. And another thing from Eun Sook is all her drama has a good taste of music. Mr Sunshine OST so crazy...!! Big ballad singers name all in one drama: Park Hyo Shin, Melomance, Kim Yuna, even Lee Suhyun form Akdong Musician. Can I say that Mr Sunshine beyond perfect?"
2192,Mr. Sunshine,"Im ABSOLUTELY loving it. The writers did an amazing job with the casting( loved everyone role)and the scripts. It was, emotional, funny, educational, exciting, passionate, just a little of it all. The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking, the slow action parts bonus. First time I ever watched a Korean series with subtitle and it won't be my last. I can't say enough, but to give a chance, and watch it, and see for yourself. Thank you for a great series and thanks to the writers and actors. Wish you many more successes."
2193,Mr. Sunshine,"Omg, i can't wait for every episode of that much-awaited film, I love it so much not only because of its perfect scenes and dramatical amount of investment but also its heavy meanings wrapped in every light scene, every moment. It's such an awesome film I have ever watched <3"
2194,Mr. Sunshine,"To the writer, director, cast anf everybody who made this series possible, thank you for this beautiful work of art. It has given me hours of joy watching a memorable story unfold and each scene showed a lot of hard work and dedication and is a product of love from everyone behind this series. If i could only give an award to each one of you. I would as I know your heart and mind was in each and every scene. The best series! Thank you and may you continue creating these kind of art!"
2195,Mr. Sunshine,"I absolutely love Mr Sunshine. After watching each episode a number of times in their entirety I find myself watching my favorite scenes over and over while I wait for the newest to be released on Saturday and Sunday. The actors, the story, the landscape, the camerawork and direction are all perfect. I'm grateful to have stumbled on to it."
2196,Mr. Sunshine,"This is my first time watching a KDrama. I've been into Korean cinema for about 6 years now. I wonder if other KDrama shows are this good? That being said, this show is absolutely incredible, even for HBO caliber TV shows. The acting, dialogue, scenery, screen play is absolutely top notch. Some of the best I've ever seen. Lee Byung-Hun has been my favorite Korean actor for quite some time. His portrait as a U.S. Marine is absolutely incredible. I'm highly impressed on how much his English has improved over the years. This show is a must watch. Even though you really have to pay attention to follow the plot/subplots, it's still a 10/10 show for me."
2197,Mr. Sunshine,The story is beautiful. I'm a little upset about the week to week but it gives me something to look forward too. Eugene and Ae... so romantic.
2198,Mr. Sunshine,"It took me a couple of episodes before I got hooked but boy did I get hooked! I have gone back and rewatched episodes because I would miss subtleties on the first viewing and understand the smallest of details on the 2nd or 3rd viewing. Beautiful cinematography, wonderful humor, and great tragedy wrapped up in a historical bundle that will keep you wanting for the next episode.
On a personal note, I found it funny that ""Kyle"" grew up in Green Bay, WI. I grew up in DePere around the same time...good to know that such talent came from the frozen north. :.) I just want to thank everyone involved with this project...it has been a real treat and I have learned so much about this part of the world due to your efforts."
2199,Mr. Sunshine,"I had to create an account just so I could write a review on this show, I am from New Zealand and don't speak or understand a word or Korean/Japanese and to be honest I'm not even into love stories, let alone subtitled shows however in saying that the story telling in this TV series and the cinematography captivated me right from the 1st episode. I really felt connected with all the characters in the show and I loved how the director was able to show all the different sides/kinds of selfless love people can have for each other without any of the characters barley making contact with each other through the use of music and painting like scenes... it has had me hooked on this show for months! Thankyou for making such a heartwarming, dramatic show! It has been a refreshing change from what I normally watch and I dont want the show to end! I know it will have a sad ending but the journey has been truly wonderful so THANKYOU!!"
2200,Mr. Sunshine,"Their acting is so good that I want to kill all the villains myself. 
I highly recommend this drama for all the people who wants to get a glimpse of Korean history and why Koreans hate Japan so much."
2201,Mr. Sunshine,"This is by far the best Korean drama I have ever watched. I normally get bored of a lot of series and never end them, but this one was different. It reflected very well of how the Korean unknown heroes tried to keep and protect the name of our country Dae Han Min Kuk. I am so proud of them and realized the importance of the Korean history and how japan tried to destroy Chosen.
The actors are very well selected and not even one does the bad job. It was carefully written and I can really see their hard work behind."
2202,Mr. Sunshine,"SPOILER ALERT ~ The story is beautifully written and beautifully depicted, but after all the energy and effort, the ending just does not seem fitting. The acting was superb and every character beautifully represented, but the writer, Kim Eun-sook took a route in the end that leaves the dedicated viewers devastated. If you have to have a happy ending this one is not for you. I will eternally be a fan of the main characters, but have to give a lower rating based on the last two episodes."
2203,Mr. Sunshine,"Do you see the thumbnail above? That is how the two leads meet for the very first time except that they are wearing masks and pointing their guns at each other ! Mr.Sunshine has probably been the most exciting K-drama I have ever viewed. Its full of action, adventure,mesmerizing locations,an excellent story line and the best cast the country has to offer. A lot can be said about this show which still won't be enough. Once you start watching you can't stop binging. I rate it a 10/10"
2204,Mr. Sunshine,"Positives:
Beautiful costumes and setGood acting by most main characters (with exceptions)Beautiful cinematography, although some shots were overdoneNegatives:
Zero chemistry between two main characters, Kim tae Ri and Lee Byung Hun. The main story revovles around their love story, which can't be felt at any stage of the storyStory moves waaaaay to slow. The show needed a lot more action, twists, turns and more interesting dialogues/confrontations. There was so much potential with the historical context, that hasn't been used at all.Lee Byung Hun's revenge story wrapped up too soon/handled poorly. One of the few interesting elements in the story was written so poorly. His desire for revenge just somehow fizzled out and petered out to nothingEmbarrassing acting by all English-speaking actors, plus the French actor. Never seen so many poor actors in one drama. How can you can not make an effort to cast actual actors from America/France/Great Britain. I'm sure there are lot of talented actors that don't cost a fortune. Instead, it feels like the production team just picked up random foreigners they found on the streets of Seoul.Lee Byung Hun is a miscast. He knows how to play an action character, and I believed his rage when it came to his dead parents. Everything else (romance and humour) he just doesn't seem to be able to pull it off.Unncessary love triangle/quare(?). Was that really necessary? I guess so, since it is a K dramaToo many cliche K drama scenes (excessive use of flashbacks, soundtrack, and characters just staring at each other for long periods of time while they are about to cry)Overall: With all the hype, names, and money involved, definitely a huge disappointment. Regret having watched the whole show to be honest."
2205,Mr. Sunshine,"Just finished watching the last episode. Congratulations to the writers, actors and all the crew for producing such a wonderful cinematic experience. I will visit your country to capture some of the beauty portrayed. Thanks Claire from Western Australia"
2206,Mr. Sunshine,"I've been dedicated to this show from the beginning and for the end my heart was literally ripped out. I don't want to spoil anything but be prepared! It was beautiful, touching, great action, and most of all emotional."
2207,Mr. Sunshine,"Very good drama as long as I watch K-Drama Drama that teaches a sense of patriotism to the state, even though Eugene ultimately cannot persuade Aeshin to America but he can protect his beloved wife"
2208,Mr. Sunshine,I honestly don't know how to express myself when it comes to this show. It only had 10 star rating I only wish I could give it a 1000 more.
2209,Mr. Sunshine,"As a Korean-American watching this show, I wish everyone can understand Korean. So much gets lost in translation. The caption is good enough but nothing close to the actual meaning. Such an amazing show. I think Korean dramas are so much better than Korean cinemas. Check out My Mister."
2210,Mr. Sunshine,"For me, this drama is the best korean drama I have seen so far. High quality in terms of filming and details, the whole cast complements each other and good quality acting. I really enjoyed the story through these disturbing times... Overall 100 out of 10..."
2211,Mr. Sunshine,"I am so grateful for the hard work put in this series. Amazing story, actors, costumes, music, make-up, filming, directing. I loved everything about this drama from the first to the last minute."
2212,Mr. Sunshine,"I composed the following review midway through the series:""Forgive me: I am not familiar with Korean writers and the Korean literary and film tradition, so I speak from profound Western ignorance. I have to draw on the American, British and Russian literary tradition to convey my review and strong recommendation. If Jane Austen got together with Leo Tolstoy, James Fennimore Cooper, James Branch Clavell and Joss Whedon to write a television show about Joseon in the late 19th and turn of the 20th century, I would expect the outcome to look something like Mr. Sunshine. This is the most layered, beautiful and elliptical story I have ever witnessed, and the comedic interludes will have you howling in laughter. There are minor turnoffs for an American audience: for example, Teddy Rooseveldt speaks with a decidedly not-American accent as do many of the soldiers. The titles translated from Korean to English sometimes don't match the visuals. But the slight glitches from time to time are understandable and almost not worth mentioning. This is my favorite TV ever, subtitles and all.""Now that the series is over, I stand by the earlier review for the first maybe 18 episodes. For maybe the last six episodes, the practicalities of ending a TV show, as well as the writer's singular view of how to follow through on her repeated warnings about a sad ending (in keeping with the horrors/atrocities of history) drive the show forward to its conclusion. If, like me, you live the characters' love and joy and hunger and grief and loss, the last maybe six episodes indelibly etch lessons about history, but come at too huge a price to be considered ""entertainment."""
2213,Mr. Sunshine,"Without a doubt, this is the best film (i.e., TV series) I have seen in the past five years. From a technical standpoint, it has everything; great story line & plot; directing, blocking, the acting was superb, cinematography techniques (...I was particularly impressed with the use of the camera angles including the use of the Dutch Tilt, slow-mo, top-down angles; movement through and across the frame, tracking shots and rack focusing); and the lighting; use of colors; variation in the music content; sound and visual effects. From an emotional point of view, I was continually surprised by the manner in which the audience is led into the use of symbolism as the story unfolds (great writing!). For five days, I was completely obsessed with the next episodes and the sequential development. On at least five different occasions, I was brought to tears and the finale left me exhausted emotionally. I spent the next two days, doing research on this film hoping to find something that would mention the film's success and developing my comments. Obviously, this was a big budget production and I sincerely hope that the producers and all those that had a vested interest consider this production an enormous success whether the economic return met their expectations or not. Congratulations and thank you. From an artistic perspective, this film is worthy of at least an Emmy Award - if not more. This film truly moved my heart."
2214,Mr. Sunshine,"While Mr lee as Mr sunshine is very handsome and nice gentelman,it would be hard to beleive that he fell inlove with such not pretty like her.Moreover korean should learn as they broadcast worldwide their movies ,the minimum is to respect other nations and do not impose their not pretty lady on poor handsome and pretty korean gentelman.

2436,18 Again,"This well made and carefully crafted series. The story takes the premise of the Zac Efron movie and goes way beyond to explore many angles of the family relationships between a man and his children, his wife and his own father. Every episode has something touching and the situations don't seem contrived but evolve quite naturally. Of course the element of suspense about who and when he will be discovered keeps things interesting. It also feels even quite deep when he ponders his life choices in giving up basketball and the sacrifices of an early marriage and kids and later divorce. There is quite a lot going on in the story both in school and at the wife's work in broadcasting. This keeps the 16 episodes filled and even includes a sports bribery thing.
Lee Do Hyun is quite convincing at acting as an older man in a teenager's body. As the adults, Yoon Sang Hyun acts quite beaten down and sad at times. Kim Ha Neul does act like she had a hard life. Something in the Rain fans may recognize Wi Ha Joon as a baseball player. The kids are cute too. The soundtrack fits the emotional scenes quite well.
They really did a better than expected job with this idea."
2437,18 Again,"This series took me a while to finish, as I don't generally watch these type of slow, slice of life type of dramas.With that in mind, let me say what I thought this got both wrong and right.First of all, this is obviously based off the hit 2009 Zach Efron movie (which I really liked I might add). Enough time has passed that this felt like a fresh take on the idea. The first two episodes are like a carbon-copy remake in Korean, and then it moves into original territory. The show takes a more serious look at the base story, focusing on Dae-Young's relationships with his wife and children. The comedic aspects of the movie are almost completely traded in for a more morose and poignant tone, and for the most part this is actually a very good thing. I liked the way the show examined marriage and parenting and how Dae-Young was able to re-evaluate his life from the perspective of an 18 year old. There was a lot of closure for side characters that were totally blown off in the movie, and I really liked that they decided to get rid of the super cringey part of the 2009 movie where his daughter fell in love with him - wow did I hate that part!This show also had a really great soundtrack, with some stand out heart breaker songs and some beautiful piano scores.What this got wrong though is it really was too long in my opinion. The story could have been told in half the episodes, at the most 10.Overall this is a sweet and serious story that was really pushed through by Lee Do Hyun as the breakout star of this - while I have seen him in almost every thing else he has been in, this is his first main role, and boy does he shine! If slice of life/school/relationship drama's are your thing I think you should definitely give this a try!"
2438,18 Again,"Beautifully directed and very elegantly presented by all the actors. Soul touching and refreshing. It took me total 3 days to complete 16 episodes of this drama. Each episode is of about 1 hour. After completing this, one thing which I can very concretely say that this 3 days were really most beautiful for me since the start of the pandemic. The direction, quality of acting, script, screenplay, storyline, dialogues, each and every thing is a dimension beyond. A real stress buster and morally uplifting drama worth your time for sure. I will highly Recommended this to each and every individual reading my review. Please go watch this, you will witness the most beautifully crafted piece of art on screen. Deep, soul touching, full of concrete life lessons and heart melting !!"
2439,18 Again,"Most of the time I avoid family melodrama but this one is different. It shows the true love of family members for each other and everyone can relate with the story. I don't know about foreign countries but in India everyone mostly live with their family (basically joint family). Although this story shows the reality about how much our parents suffer to give good life to their childrens. Also when children's understand there parents feelings they also suffer so much and never open up infront of their parents.It gives the idea of real life lovable family there struggle and other things. Literally, it's very beautiful story no doubt; in terms of story and plot. But, the supernatural elements are little bit confusing as we don't understand what happened at that particular time. Specially, when the lead actor go back to his young age, we don't understand how this happen? And it feels like they take it for granted and never care about how this happen/possible. They don't even try to find out how this is possible that someone go back to his 18 yr old body? This makes little confusion over viewer's mind.However, this show is must watch in my ""Must watch list"" as this drama never disappoint you in terms of good and beautiful story along with amazing acting of actors."
2440,18 Again,"This is a drama that shall stay in your heart always. I shall always remember those moments when I cried and laughed watching it. 18 Again, it teaches you a lot about life and relationships. Just imagine if you are in your thirties on the verge of ending your marriage with the person you've always loved just because of communication gaps and misunderstandings that developed over time, and suddenly you become a whole new person and return back to their life to know you family in a way you never had before. Yes, it would surely change everything. I am so grateful that the makers decided to make this show. Thank you so much for teaching me so many important lessons. They shall always guide me in my life. Thank you so much!!It is a MUST-WATCH, nobody can question that. So please invest a little time of your life, to watch it."
2441,18 Again,"Eighteen Again, is a tearjerker, I came to say this upfront of a lengthier review down below! As long as you don't hate getting wet eyes, you will enjoy this drama a lot, feel sad and sad, and sad again, and cry like a baby, within every episode, every time the lead interacts with his kids, comforts his sweetheart and is reminded of his past, the flashbacks, the epilogues!STORY:THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY DRAMA! It's deep, relatable and heart wrenching!From the lead's relationship with his Father, with his wife's Mother. to his friendship/ father-kids relationships, to the heart-breaking relationship of him as a high school minor who is always there to comfort the mom of his two kids.
Each and every bond is carefully written and the result is something very precious. full of life lessons.Characters/CAST: Great job done! Kudos to LEE DO HYUN, I couldn't hold my emotions in check whenever I looked into her eyes, which were frequently red and in tears, yet sparkling as bright as a star other times!Kim Ha Neul was simply gorgeous, Yoon Sang Hyun very charming, Roh Jeong Eui cute and sweet, Ryeoun, calm and a bright star.I also want to praise the young actress portraying teenager Jung Da Jung. Her expressions were so sincere and genuine. Every time she was on screen, my heart felt her pains, and ached for her. She did a stunning performance! She deserves lots of support and love!Soundtrack/Music:Hello, I'm telling you
With a trembling smile, that I love you
Hello, that in these dazzling and beautiful times
It's you I will remember forever""I would rate the music 10/10 even if ""Hello"" by Sohyang, was the only song/instrumental piece used in the whole drama. It was such a heavenly beautiful and perfectly emotional piece. It's a legendary soundtrack.RE-WATCH: Surely, if I get times, I'll re-watch this, probably with my cousin who recently got into KDRAMA, and already have great taste.OVERALL: Surely there might be some unnecessary plot devices, cliche and even extended 2nd lead screen times, but it's just I don't care at all, I was so invested in these characters, and loved them sincerely and was rooting for them all along, I couldn't bring myself to rate it below a perfect 10! It's highly recommended, EVERYONE and ANYONE can get hooked as they're done with the first episode, and fall in love with it as soon as watching 3rd episode's epilogue.I can guarantee that. 99.0000000000000000%"
2442,18 Again,"I really love this drama and the cast a lot. Great work filming crew, making so good drama. People who did not watch it are missing out a fantastic drama. So watch it :)"
2443,18 Again,MC get 18 again and try to figure out what went wrong in his teen days. He became friend to his twins to understand them better. Watched his ex-wife how she handles her job. And he came to realization the mistakes which led to divorce.The couple find themselves in romance circle again and get to know each other better.
2444,18 Again,Da Jung keeps getting saved by men over and over again. It's cliche and it is a complete bore to watch. I can't bare to continue watching this show
2445,18 Again,"The actors are so good, the story is so good, and you will cry almost every episodes.There are scene which are supposed to be happy but it will make you cry like a goat.The only thing I'm looking forward is for their children to learn they are the same person but that's not a big deal."
2446,18 Again,This drama demonstrates hidden/ unspoken struggles in different characters. Either in between husband and wife or parents and children. Well written script. Very well done!
2447,18 Again,Great writing I became emotional often plot is also great.
2448,18 Again,"Ok, this is my very first attempted short review here for a foreign film (or any film for that matter). Right off the bat, this film differs vastly from the original save for a deceiving first couple of verbatim copied episodes. The fleshing out of hong dae-hong and issues of early age parenting is brought to the fore. Cringey jokes and obtuse attempts at humour ubiquitous in the 2009 film are fortunately done away with. The subplot of the love triangle is also explored well without delving into over-dramatism. A tv series format suited the story as the original had far too many unresolved threads and unsatisfactory goodbyes.My review : 8 stars out of 10.0."
2449,18 Again,"I am watching the last episode now. This TV series' each episode was funny and sad. It makes me so emotional but it was so good. I have watched Yoon Sang Hyun before, while he played Oska in Secret Garden TV series. When i saw him in this series, i was so excited and happy. He is a really good actor and also Lee Dohyun is awsome, i hope he will participate in most of dramas and movies. I hope he can gain lots of awards. He is really talented, his role is very difficult in this drama but he did really a good job. Also all cast was awsome, Haneul, Jeong Eui, Ryeun, Bomin, Inyeop... I hope we can see all of them more."

2464,Record of Youth,"Some parts of this show are interesting and different. The struggles and success of an actor are neatly laid out here. Also the support of his grandfather and mother, his father's opposition and effect of his success on the family members is interesting. The various problems success like press looking for scandal and opportunists are shown. Also the scrutiny they face when dating is quite real. The problem of military service is something not seen in other dramas. The grandfather's character is interesting.The family plays a big part. The main fault is the romance itself feels more like a friendship. The wealthy nice best friend is a change. Not all rich people are bad. The story telling format of jumping forward and then going back to fill in doesn't work well here. One good thing is the villains like the reporter and the jealous actor are quite realistic instead of over the top types.
Park So Dam looks better with black hair than orange hair. She seems a bit matter of fact in her attitude. Different from Parasite. PBG has a bad hair style in this show. His acting is okay but his hair style is too short. Military almost.
Some parts drag but the interesting parts now and then keep it worth watching. Just that the romance is weak."
2465,Record of Youth,"I'm torn whether this drama was good or not. It wasn't boring, but it had a rather slow pace; it wasn't cliche, but it didn't really lead anywhere; it had interesting cinematography, but a messy timeline.So, what drama is 'Record of Youth' ? It's a slice of life, family drama, with some romance and a bit of friendship genre into it. It contains two of the most popular nowadays actors, who, to be honest, could have worked in anything they wanted and yet they chose this drama(...). Simply stated, it's more like a drama about the life of Park Bo Gum with some fiction added to it.Now, for its components, the slice of life was okay, portrayed with interesting editing and a youthful outlook. The romance was refreshing, original, but, at the end of the day, will not be memorable. The family drama, however, was the driving force of the story. The dynamics of the three youngsters with their families were probably the best things in the drama, as they were real and one could sympathize or even identify with them.Finally, the performances were great and the atmosphere was spot on. However, there were multiple times when I thought that the story was just pointless and I didn't have anything to anticipate.So, overall, five and a half out of ten."
2466,Record of Youth,"Two ex models trying for success in the film world fall in love with a make up artist. Along the way they find success, failure, heartbreak and scandal. A well paced drama with excellent side stories involving family and friends. The question is will love find a way or will it end in heartbreak."
2467,Record of Youth,This show did an amazing job at showcasing how male actors in Korea are alws in a tight spot because of their career and nonstop military duty pressure! The struggle is real and this drama shows it beautifully. Only few episodes aired but I was hooked from the first episode and I m sure it will be another masterpiece of Park BoGum like reply 1988. Most interesting fact is that he joined military immediately after shooting this drama! Talk about coincidences!
2468,Record of Youth,"Watched this drama ongoing and stated liking from the first episode. The storyline is outstanding and I love how beautifully they showed the struggle of an actor. A bit slow in the middle though.I loved when he said I have alws wanted a room of my own so that I can cry myself to sleep! I CAN SMILE EVERYDAY CZ I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP! Loved this dialogue. Behind the dazzling k pop and kdrama world there's all struggle, hardwork, agony, happy and sad tears! South Korea has one of the world's highest suicidal deaths and this realistic drama shows that behind all that lovey dovey kdramas, their life is just like ours. Ordinary yet outstanding."
2469,Record of Youth,"I actually reallyyyyy enjoyed this drama!!!
The lead actor superrrr GORGEOUSSSSSS!!
Love the story line!!!!Only the romance kinda dragged longer then it should but everything else was perfect!!Super satisfying"
2470,Record of Youth,Please take off your hands netflix from kdramas How end.. how the waste all of serie I hate it
2471,Record of Youth,If you get bore from the fantasies and supernatural shows then this show can make you come into reality.No exaggeration is done in the show and this is what i love about this show.Good watch.
2472,Record of Youth,"I liked this drama because it showed how the star system works and how a star cannot really have a private life, or how his life can be affected by publicity.I also liked it because it showed that someone can be successful against all odds.I loved Park Bo Gum, because he had a great performance! His character in the plot was great too! Unfortunately the woman lead was not good enough for this drama, per my opinion. Was it the script that made her look quite cold? Was it the director? Or was it her own acting? I don't know. I did not also like the plot of their romance as it evolved during the last episodes (I refer to her part and what she did). It was a bit disappointing and her character looked somehow selfish.I found it a bit boring in some points, but generally it gave me food for thought about this specific way of living (the star system) and about the treating of other people.Generally good."
2473,Record of Youth,"This was a mediocre show. It was sweet and romantic, but it got very boring towards the end. I feel like the plot was starting to fall apart after the 10th episode."
2474,Record of Youth,"This series start with a bang -Park Bo Gum as lead and seems promising, but as the show goes on, it deteriorated gradually and eventually fade into oblivion nothing.First off, the choice of lead actress, Park So Dam as Ahn Jeong-Ha, the character was badly written and the role badly played. Ahn Jeong Ha overall is an unattractive character/person, often time, she is self-righteous and acts as if she is more superior to everybody. When she is not exerting her righteousness she is as cold as a robot, void of any facial emotion and feelings. The plot writes that she easily captured the attention and affection of two handsome established models the instant they met, which is very unconvincing, here is a simple normal girl with a very average face & personality. If they have cast a beautiful actress it would be a bit more believable as humans are visual, anything beautiful will capture our attention specially so for guys. Yeah, I maybe shallow but unfortunately such is human nature.The chemistry between the two leads is zero, there is no affection nor any romantic gesture. The plot overall is weak and no direction, the reason for the breakup is hilarious, it was as if they still live in the 70s where fans don't allow their idol to have any personal life. Hey, I am sure people nowadays has evolved and can fully understand.The actress who played Bo Gum's Mom is the best actress in the show.And the title ""Record of Youth"". Honestly I don't see how their youth are spent any different from yours and mine...Overall, a past time show which dont need your full attention"
2475,Record of Youth,"The two stars of this show, Park Bo-gum and Park So-dam, have a lot of charisma and decent chemistry but with a hopelessly unoriginal and derivative story and some of the most crass Subway placements ever, the show fails to deliver. (Subway product placements have polluted numerous Korean shows but achieve a new low in this one. For example, Park Bo-gum earns nearly $10,000 from a three day modeling job but is still working part time earning minimum wage serving sandwiches.) Some snappy dialogue, especially from Park So-dam, but otherwise a tedious love triangle with an entirely predictable outcome, the usual parade of parents spouting sophistries as they bully, badmouth and play favorites among their children, the usual bad guys getting away with it for as long as the writers think they can get away with trying the viewers' patience. Really, the whole thing felt like it was created by an unsupervised 3D printer programmed by a monkey on loan from the effort to recreate Shakespeare by random typewriting. Give this a miss unless you feel like making goo goo eyes at the Parks. But don't expect anything very tasty."
2476,Record of Youth,"Park Bo Gum brought me there, after I fell head over heals for the Prince in Love In The Moonlight. Boy, was I disappointed! His acting is good and he looks cute as ever. But EVERYTHING else!!!!No chemistry at all between the leads. Useless second male lead, I wanted to kick him. Lame side stories. Pointless plot (Is that even a plot?). I was tempted to just stop watching after the tenth episode, but I thought maybe there would be something worth my time at some point. Nope! Matteroffactly, I fastfowarded so much that I washed the last eight episodes in a couple of hours. Yuck!"
2477,Record of Youth,"Hmmm, I have to comment on the negative reviews stated against ""Record of Youth"". I felt they were a bit harsh.....the actors in my opinion were incredible. I would like to see the haters try to act in a tv series or movie.......I guarantee you won't be able to. I couldn't wait to see each show, I especially loved the close relationship between the grandson and grandfather. I could relate to the father and sons relationship and was very pleased to see that their relationship issues were resolved.......kudos to the director. Ok, now the reason for my score (8/10).......in as much as I LOVED this show, I felt the ending was a little weak. I'm a huge romcom fan and I love to see happy endings. When a tv series like this one builds you up to the point of sheer bliss, the final scene between the girl and boy should be just as exciting as the build up. I can't wait to see my next kdrama.......I am a huge fan, go fighting!"
2478,Record of Youth,"This is one of those kdramas you hear about and see on ""What to Watch on Netflix"" lists. I bet started/stopped this show 3? Times before I made it through the series. And, that's with fast-forwarding through some episodes because the pace is s-l-o- w with lots of unnecessary plot lines, uninteresting scenarios, etc.Like most kdramas they make 16 episodes when 10-12 well paced episodes would be 100x more enjoyable.The premise is good. A handsome young man tries to break into the acting world and the trials and tribulations of his journey.Pros: Han Ae-Sook as the housekeeper/mom to Park Bo-Gum's character and Lee Min-Jae, who played PBG's agent.Cons: Park So-Dam as the FL/love interest to PBG. Utterly forgettable as are too many of the players and their roles.Round it all out with the all too typical lethargic pacing and you've got a story that could and should have been much more fun to watch."
2479,Record of Youth,"Its OKAY for relative new take in KDrama but there is no story progression and heavily lacks character development. ""Idol falls in love with his fangirl"" at the speed of light and then they breakup over nothing solid. ""Sorry"" is the reason but they never show if they tried working their relationship out any point before that. Romance between them is so dull and unenthusiastic. I normally like Park So Dum but she is just too blant and forgetful in this show. I get that her character is maybe supposed to emulate this cold stone personality but even psychopaths show more emotions that this one! Bottomline is just about anyone could have done her role, she doesn't make it memorable. Park BoGum isn't bad as lead but then I believe its the poor script and direction that pulls him back from giving his best. Hes supposed to be very emotional guy but he barely questions anything or even fights for it. Only thing he fought was his old agent. Give him a star there. THE only people I enjoy are grandfather, brother (quirky) and his agent to some extend. The show is simply passable nothing impressive."
2480,Record of Youth,"So far no punch, acting is ok, location shoots during this global pandemic is weird. At this point I'm 50/50 on this drama. Need to update when this finishes..."
2481,Record of Youth,"This drama perfectly sums up the struggles young adults face when trying to pursue their dreams.Money, relationships, friendships, family and reputation. All these subjects requires your attention.The story is about people struggling to achieve their dreams: to be successful. Sa Hey-Jun, a young adult born into an ordinary family, tries to make it as an actor. He has been in the shadow of his good friend Won Hae-Hyo for far too long. When he finally start to rise to fame, Won Hae-Hyo, born and raise into a wealthy family, is shocked and scared that their positions will now be reversed. Now he stands in the shadow of Hey-Jun, which led to disapproval from his mother. He must do better.Kim Jun-U is also part of their friendship. He likes to start his own photography business, but it hasn't worked out yet. Later in the drama, he finds himself facing Hae-Hyo because of his relationship with his sister. Will their friendship survive?An Jeong-Ha faced some problems in her childhood, but she managed to stand on her own feet. She likes to start her own beauty salon. Her plans might change unwillingly when she ends up in a relationship with Hae-Hyo. How does she deal with this?As for chemistry, I love the relationship between the three friends. The interactions and development of their friendship is admirable. The drama also focus on Hae-Hyo's family. His relationship with his dad and brother is tense. They both disagree with the (career) choices he has made. Later in the series you see them growing closer to each other, which made me shed a few tears as I watched the ending scenes...However, in my honest opinion, there was no chemistry between the actors who played Jeong-Ha and Hae-Hyo. I found it awkward to watch. The awkward smile Jeong-Ha gave in response to Hae-Hyo's efforts to make her happy, no, it didn't work out.Although the drama contains some clichés, such as the exaggerated love relationship between Jeong-Ha and Hae-Hyo while Hae-Hyo also loves Jeong-Ha (a common thing in most K-drama series), it doesn't affect the storyline. Actually, it adds a little bit of spice to the series.Aside from all this, I highly recommend that you watch this episode if you are looking for a drama that keeps you busy for the next few days ."
2482,Record of Youth,"You need to be very masochist to watch this piece.A waste of time and talent. Park Bo Gum , usually a good actor is wooden here, all he does is pout and whine in his act of good boy. There are only dumb characters , the lines are stupid beyond imagination, the romance is corny, cheese, no chemistry between the lead pair.Highly annoying show."
2483,Record of Youth,"Its great to see parasite girl n Replay-1988 Taek in one screen. Story ,their acting fits perfectly.best of luck."
2484,Record of Youth,"Only three episodes in, and totally hooked. The poignancy of watching knowing that Park BoGum was on the cusp of enlisting. The casting is excellent. Can't think of a single character yet who hasn't nailed their performance and made their character credible. The undertones are palpable and a sense of pending drama. Superb job."
2485,Record of Youth,"I'm relatively new to SK dramas but, saved for a few, most dramas I've seen were incredibly unrealistic, overtly dramatic, and had exaggerated acting, which made me want to stop with the genre altogether! In that respect Record of youth is a breath of fresh air, it realistically depicts the trials and tribulations of young people with family, friendship, romantic relationships and work.
The cast is great, the outfits are on point, and the filming is very good!
They've really well represented the issues young people are faced with in SK, especially, as is the case of the three lead characters, when they are unwilling to compromise on their values.
In my opinion, they've also perfectly depicted how a new romance might unfold, how two individuals get more confortable with each other, how they learn about each other, how they try to support one another, etc. (a cute example of that is when they go to the movies really early because she has work and cannot do another time).
I've been surprised to read that people think the lead actors do not have chemistry, I wholeheartedly disagree, it might not be as intense as in other SK dramas, but they definitely have it, and I love how the romance does not overpower everything else in the series.
One of the best thing about the series for me is the fact that they have touched on many of the issues prevalent in SK society, i.e. star status, online bullying, the press' unaccountability, family and social pressure, toxic work environments, access to education, compulsory military service, etc.
I think people more used to fast-paced dramas with dramatic events and revelations every minute might not enjoy this one, but if you're looking for a cozy, light and realistic drama, this is definitely the one!"
2486,Record of Youth,"Revolving around a struggling model with an already successful model best friend, a make up artist who is hardcore fan, this drama sure will touch at least one emotion of your life.
Job, family, friendship, hierarchical stairs, love, acceptance, you will find it in this. Just watched the first two episodes, and I am already waiting for next.
Great sets, costumes and casting. The OST so far is good too.
Time is running out for the actor in this drama, it might not seem too drastic to people from outside, but the main lead knows how precious his time is, which is just slipping. To listen to others and give up? Or believe in himself and go on? This will sure make you remember the turning point you could gave faced in life. Give it a try. As I usually do, the review will be updated once again after last episode. Pretty sure, it will keep me hooked until then."
2487,Record of Youth,"This drama is at times enjoyable, but overall is quite a disappointment due to the bad script and bad acting.The lead actress Park So-dam, who got fame as the daughter in Parasite, showed surprisingly a lack of range. Her expressions: happy, sad, or angry were all bland and similar. I did not believe she was a real person. The 2nd lead male actor played by Byeon Woo-seok deserves some acting lessons. It was just aweful and painful to see him ""act"". His controlling tiger mom, played by Shin Ae-ra, was overacting and was unsympathetic not because of her character, but her annoying portrayal.However, some cast members were very good. Park Bo-gum, playing the protagonist Sa Hye-jun, was a strong male lead and brought his character really to life. The family of Sa Hye-jun was the highlight of the drama. Special praise in particular for his funny brother played by Lee Jae-won and the touching scenes with the grandfather.The mixed performance of the cast could be overlooked if the story was well written and the different plots believable and relatable. But you end up confused, not understanding the morale of the story, and empty-minded. Record of Youth is a record of disappointment."
2488,Record of Youth,"We're thru episode 6 and it's really tedious. Terrible waste of talented and attractive actors. The series is 50% about relationships but they really seem phony. My reaction: who cares? The other 50% is about building a career in fashion, TV and film. This is somewhat more interesting.
It also has the usual Korean monstrous or frivolous mothers if you're into that."
2489,Record of Youth,"Just saw episode 4. Very happy that the script And story are getting better and better. Good character development and great comic scenes, as at the clinic. Really enjoying the series."
2490,Record of Youth,"I gave 6 star because of Park Bo Gum
Otherwise its a 4"
2491,Record of Youth,"If not for PBG i will give 4 stars
Bad script... boring
I skip alot
I only watch because of Park Bo Gum"
2492,Record of Youth,"I watched it to the end because I liked the main two actors (the couple), but my god was the script bad. It was a waste of talent, really."
2493,Record of Youth,"Although the story moves slow-paced, there is still enough to enjoy from this series. The actors fit very well in their role, and I believe Record of Youth pinpoints some important issues/controversies from Korean daily life. It challenges traditional Korean viewpoints on social topics such as gender, and pushes a more progressive agenda. Last but not least, there are a lot of food scenes to be enjoyed (always a plus in kdramas according to my opinion)!"
2494,Record of Youth,Beautiful reflection of real life. So i disagree to the negative reviews. I did enjoy watching this serie.
2495,Record of Youth,"Amazing show! Equally amazing actors!
Thanks to this drama for my introduction to this larger than life, totally mesmerizing and captivating actor PARK BO GUM! Now, I am watching all his previous dramas and listening to his songs! Wow....I am a fan!!!! 🤗"
2496,Record of Youth,"People who expect unrealistic love affairs and over-dramatic acting, this ain't for you! Otherwise this was a decent show , lovely actors, logical storylines"
2497,Record of Youth,"This is my first Park Bogum's drama. His brilliant acting made me watch it until eps 8 (didn't finish it, though). Was expecting the drama to be light and realistic just like most of the kdramas nowadays, but i didn't expect it to be slow and flat. The girl's character and acting aren't impactful enough, either. It's supposed to be a romantic drama but I haven't felt the chemistry between the two. The girl's aura on TV is not for a lead yet. She would better fit a 'best friend' supporting role or something.Regardless, i look forward to seeing more development in Park Bogum's character in the drama."
2498,Record of Youth,"Overall it was fun to watch but the last episode was a complete disaster. The end was so terrible that I questioned my self why I watched this?
Really disappointed."
2499,Record of Youth,Good acting and a professional production. Most episodes were pedestrian but I stuck with it. The last episode was predictable.
2500,Record of Youth,"I only watch this because of Park Bo Gum.
I never fast forward on any Kdrama before but here, all i do is fast forward.
This is the first time i got very disappointed watching kdrama. I mean the actor falls inlove with the fan girl with a blink of an eye, and the girl is just stone cold? seriously??? no chemistry at all. they should have just focus on PBG pursuing his career."
2501,Record of Youth,This drama is just a scene where and how actor struggles if he has a poor background.. But when Love gets on your way everything is possible ... If you are in a relationship just support them instead of complaining of full filling your needs.... I seriously liked the Story but ya! Ppl who are reading this I don't want to discourage them by saying my disappointment at one point of time! You can watch this and ya! May be you can get inspired who knows !
2502,Record of Youth,"This kdrama is interesting and well built in setting and to show the dynamic of the entertainment industry but the story has its gaps ...... the worst is the end of the love story ... it doesn't have sense. The best thing is Park Bo Gum who seems to be representing part of his beginnings in entertainment. Relaxing and enjoyable to see, and enjoy Park Bo Gum."
2503,Record of Youth,"I really liked the first episodes, they seemed fresh and very captivating. The story hooked me straight away and I got excited. By the way it started it seemed like this drama would make it into my favorites. Then it all went downhill. Somewhere in the middle the storyline stopped developing and they left so many things unsaid or unfinished. The end... Well at that point I was already so disappointed so it didn't really matter.
It's a shame cause the actors and actresses are great# I also had a huge second lead syndrome"
2504,Record of Youth,Park Bo Gum's worst drama ever. I was expecting too much from this drama. It was boring and anticlimactic!!
2505,Record of Youth,This drama started off very well and I pray that it will be like that until the end. Park Bo Gum he is very good actor and sometimes overlooked actor. He is a versatile actor. We see his struggles and emotions in the first 2 episodes. I will recommend this drama for everyone to watch because it's seems like it's going to be a one of the best dramas
2506,Record of Youth,Have been waiting eagerly for this drama. First episode aired today and i am looking forward to the rest. Worth the wait and it totally met my expectations. Great start!!
2507,Record of Youth,The buildup was phenomenal but the finale was too anticlimactic and boring. A waste of time getting past all that honestly.
2508,Record of Youth,"Rather well told story of a few struggling characters from different backgrounds. Great acting and characters you can identify with. I wish there was a little more depth to the story and the friendships, but overall a nice mix of feel good moments, sad and angry moments. Enjoyable show."
2509,Record of Youth,"All the characters are so real especially Park Bogum, not only his dialogue delivery but also he his eyes speaks to the audience. I have watched almost all his movies and dramas and everytime I fell in love with all the characters that he portrayed and also all the supporting and small characters in all his movies and dramas addsthe perfect amount of talent and entertainment that you cant help but fall in love with the whole content."
2510,Record of Youth,"This is like an ""indie"" K-drama. The pace is really slow but the script does leak the ambition to help the audience slow down enough not just to name but to feel the intricacies of each tension (within and between the characters) - also, to honor how, as a literal ""record of youth"", many things are also yet to be seen or understood from the protagonists' point of view. When I switch to this mindset, I'm able to taste and enjoy the range of subtle flavors in this grounded work (and the courage behind following through with it by the whole cast and crew)."
2511,Record of Youth,"I loved the whole story by I'm very disappointed about the end, too incomplete and I was expecting more! I loved the actors, I think that every character is well done and related to real life. If you are looking for a very dramatic and romantic kdrama, this isn't for you. It's more realistic and 80% focused to the main character's career."
2512,Record of Youth,"This drama is simply overrated and has such a boring story i kept watching till episode 10 to see something good but it was just a waste of time. there is literally no spark or connection between the main characters there is no charm in the love story they portrait there were such childish romantic scenes. other than that this drama is just overrated because of ""cute cast"" that is all this series has. i am a huge fan of kdramas but i must say this one is the most boring one with no spark i have seen"
2513,Record of Youth,"It is the best kdrama series after reply 1988. The acting of Park Bogum and Park Sodam are natural, easy and immersive in these series. The delivery of the story is refreshing and attractive. It is a story about the development of youth, a story about family issues. I was amazed by how easy and fashinated the drama looks like while such deep and hard issues were discussed."
2514,Record of Youth,"I waited to watch this until it was all out on Netflix. I was enjoying it so much that I watched it in two days. The show is a real eye opener to the hardships that people in the public eye deal with. I thought this was a refreshing kdrama & didn't use too many of the typical kdrama clichés. It was slow at times but it's a basic concept so it was kind of expected. I did feel that Park So-dam's character was underutilized towards the end & that she was only a side character for the romance storyline. His family had more screen time than she did & she's supposed to be one of the main leads..
Park Bo-gum is one of my favorite actors because his acting is always phenomenal. This was my first time seeing Park So-dam in something apart from Parasite but she did a great job too. Personally, I thought their chemistry was really good..but PBG tends to have good chemistry with everyone. One of my favorite things was the amazing cameos of Park Seo-joon, Lee Sung-kyung & Lee Hye-ri!! I wish Hye-ri had a scene with Bo-gum so we could've had a little Reply 1988 reunion.
Overall it was a good drama. The ending was disappointing but the previous episodes made it predictable.
Now I'll anxiously wait for more Bo-gum content until he finishes his service"
2515,Record of Youth,"If you want to see the face of youth in Korea now, look at Park Bo-gum."
2516,Record of Youth,"Park Bogum carries it hard and he has proved again for his unlimited potential in acting any genres. It is delightful to watch how he grows to be a superstar actor despite all the obstacles. A superstar like Bogum himself in real. Lol. If you're watching in another language, you'll miss many fun points because the writer makes a play on words quite often. No worries. Bogum's stunning visual will make you forget everything else. Lol."
2517,Record of Youth,All I watch are Kdramas. This is the first one I just didn't get. No excitement and the script was bad. Its disappointing because Park Bo Gum is an amazing actor. It was the story line that just was blah. No chemistry in this one.
2518,Record of Youth,"I saw some comments about the drama being at it's worst. To me, this drama needs a lot of deep appreciation of the complexity of human relationship and interaction. There are so many layers to ponder on it. If you like superficial stuff, this may not be your liking. The pace of the drama allows viewers to reflect on those complexities and also on their own humanistic relationships and interactions in daily life. Pick your choice."
2519,Record of Youth,"Chemistry maybe lacking and some lines arent that intense compared to other kseries but saying it's weak is wrong. It's open ended finale sports the more common ending for a coming of age genre. More importantly, I appreciate how the lead and writer took the more realistic approach than fairy tale like story and how monologues were scripted creatively.Ps. It was nominated for best screenplay."
2520,Record of Youth,Boring since the start but I continued to see if it improves. No it doesn't. The lead actress was so bland. The rest of minor characters are also annoying. Nothing memorable happened in the 16 episodes. This drama was pointless.

2578,One Spring Night,This series is a disappointment. Something in the Rain was a masterpiece. The story was emotionally involving and devastating and the two stars had such a convincing chemistry that it just felt so real. So I was looking forward to One Spring Night which was by the same writer and director and had the same lead actor Jung Hae In and some of the parents as well. Look out for the evil mom from SITR in a opposite type role. Everything that was right about SITR was wrong here. Firstly Han Ji Min and Jung Hae In had very little chemistry. She looked stern and angry with him most of the time. When he smiles sweetly she didn't respond. She also looks older than him and they are supposed to be the same age in the show. It doesn't help the looks young for his age. They just did not look in love. The story doesn't feel convincing. Having a kid just doesn't seem that bad a stigma. Also her ex boyfriend being so obsessed with her and wanting to marry her after she loves someone else just isn't real. And the reason about losing out to an inferior guy is weak. The directing is strangely amiss - often there should be a close up on the face to show emotion and instead the actors shown from a distance and often in dim lighting. The music wasn't good as well. An annoying song Seasons Change kept playing. Didn't suit the story.Hope Jung Hae In will get better shows after this. Skip this one.
2579,One Spring Night,"For me, this series doesn't capture the range of Jung Hae-In or his full charm, as do ""While You Were Sleeping"" and especially ""Something in the Rain"", which made him an international star. In the first six episodes of ""Something in the Rain"" the writer created some of the sweetest scenes in Korean drama, unmatched in this one. But I think this same writer was after more of a slowly developed study of the major themes this time: obsession, misogyny, abuse, intrusiveness, and single-parent shaming. Within that sometimes maddening struggle, there is strength and devotion, friendship and love. But I do wish there was more of our main couple and far less of the annoying obsessive. Even the last episodes had too much of him. I'd rather he had been finished and we spent more time exploring the love story and that evolving family. In both her series, I feel this writer loses her way in the second halves and closing episodes, then tosses a rushed closure at the viewer, which she has been faulted for before. Still, this is a good series with an excellent writer, director, and cast."
2580,One Spring Night,"A librarian goes into a chemists to pick up a hangover cure but when she comes to pay she realises she has forgotten her purse and the chemists tells her to pay him later. This simple event leads to the librarian beginning a tentative relationship with the chemist, but she is already in a relationship and he has a son so will they be able to weather the storm that will come. A well written, well acted drama that approaches the romance side in an intelligent manner. The side stories mainly concern her two sisters and I personally would have liked more detail on those as they were both interesting. Entertaining series and the love the females of the family had for each other was heartwarming."
2581,One Spring Night,"8/10 iis my rating. This is a 2019 South Korean romantic drama with 26, 70 minute, episodes.After four years with Kwon Gi-seok (Kim Jun-han), Lee Jeong-in (Han Ji-Min) is wondering why her feelings toward her boyfriend have become lukewarm. Still, with family pressuring marriage, that would have been the likely result if a surprise romantic interest did not unexpectedly come into Jeong-in's life. Jeon-in is a librarian and Gi-seol is a banker who has family wealth and would be considered a ""catch"" by most. One spring night Jeong-in has a drinking party with her close friend and stops by the pharmacy where Yoo Ji-ho (Jung Hae-in) works to get a hangover remedy. What could have been a inconsequential meeting develops into sparks of interest when Jeon-in discovers she forgot her wallet and Ji-ho, immediately attracted to the vivacious Jeong-in, offers to let her pay later. After a series of missed texts, Ji-ho finally revisits the pharmacy to pay back Ji-ho and he expresses interest in her but she firmly tells him she is in a relationship so they can only be friends. Admitting interest in someone is not a frequent or easy thing for Ji-ho as he is a single parent who went through many years after heart break after his girlfriend left him and his son. In South Korea a long term relationship is a form of commitment and with both families in agreement for Jeon-in and Gi-seol to marry, it is taboo to break up, particularly to immediately enter another relationship with none other than a single dad. Single parenthood in South Korea still carries a lot of social stigma and Ji-ho has suffered derogatory comments since his son was born. So, while their situation makes it nearly impossible to be together, they find they actually run in the same social circles and repeat encounters lead to undeniable feelings developing between the two.
Jeon-in finally decides to end her relationship with Gi-seol and follow her heart with Ji-ho. However, not only has Gi-seol, who had been slow to propose marriage, suddenly decided he can't live without her, he also does not want to lose her to Ji-ho who he considers beneath him. With all the obstacles in their way, Ji-ho and Jeong-in have to constantly evaluate if their relationship is worthy and their feelings strong enough for each other to sustain their love for the long term.*spoiler alert. I liked the overall theme of this which is which was love can conquer just about anything. Jeong-in did not feel the fact that Ji-ho was a single dad to be a detriment to having a relationship with him. It wasn't that she did not realize it made things hard for them, because she did, she just did not personally care that he was a single dad. In fact, as someone that loved kids, she grew to like Ji-ho's young son almost immediately. The ex-boyfriend became extremely obsessed with getting Jeong-in back and it felt irritating at times because it seemed that he was fairly lukewarm about their relationship until he realized he had competition. Jeon-in's dad was very frustrating because he seemed to be more concerned about social status and appearances than the welfare of his daughters. It was very satisfying when Jeon-in stood up to him about not wanting to marry Gi-seol to help advance her father's career, and later when she stood up to him about her right to love Ji-ho. The music in this one was very antnoying. They played the main song loud and so frequently hat it became irritating. I understand the cultural stigma on single parenthood as we like to think in the United States that there is no stigma but, having been a single parent myself for awhile, I can tell you there is. Many people do not want to take on a ready made family and, for the single parent, you have to be very selective about who you would be willing to interact with your children. It did not suprise me that the main character was so accepting of Jeong-in's son as she mentioned she loved children and, since that is the way I feel about children, I understand it. I lreally like children so I know if I were in the position the fact that the person I loved had a child or even children would not deter. It also explored domestic violence and the feelings of shame and denial. It ended and wrapped up well. Recommend for those that like mature themes."
2582,One Spring Night,"After Jung Hae In's Kdrama with Son ye Jin in Something in the rain, I was really expecting another great serious romantic story. I got bored with the story as they try to make the situation super complicated. JHI is a great actor. Every time he delivers his line especially when he gets angry, I can really feel it in my heart. I just think that they don't have much chemistry the leading lady looked she was old for him. She also kept on bugging him even if he already tries to move away plot makes it annoying. I skipped a lot of parts about the other characters and I don't intend to watch it again."
2583,One Spring Night,"I had hoped this series would match or be better than Something in the Rain. Unfortunately it cannot compare with SITR, which in my opinion, was a realistic love story. I am a fan of Jung Hae-In, he is a great actor and he is the only reason I watched this series to the end. There were too many sociopaths in this series, including the female lead. The obsessive/manipulative behavior was very annoying. Just when you think things might work out, someone acts out again. Kudos to Jung Hae-In for his great performance in a disappointing series."
2584,One Spring Night,"The only complaint I have is about the constant reuse of the same song in every episode - it's a good song, but by the end of the show I was like, ""Do I ever actually want to hear this song again?"" That said, I love the song(s?) that Rachael Yamagata contributed to the soundtrack. All in all, music was one of this show's strengths.The acting and the 'realism' of the story was the other thing I loved most about it (same goes for the other show I just finished watching by this director, Something in the Rain, which I ADORED). Obviously it was a sweet romance, but unlike some K-dramas out there, it was a little more realistic in the sense that it shows more what everyday Koreans may go through as part of their dating lives (I say this as a non-Korean who is no expert on the culture/typical lifestyles).I can certainly see myself watching this show again, however it was fairly slow moving, and if you're into more action packed dramas, this one may not be for you. If you're into character-driven, realistic and relatable dramas about everyday Koreans (oh, and a beautiful leading man), then I'd certainly recommend it."
2585,One Spring Night,"If you have watched Something In The Rain (2018), then you have an idea what I mean by that title. This series even has 2 of the actors from Something In The Rain (2018). Like that series, One Spring Night takes a look at what culturally considered to be a taboo specifically marriage to a person with a kid, divorce and arranged marriage that is about raising one's social status. This series is not as stressful as Something In The Rain (2018), so don't worry about that. The writer did a great job with this series and the message is clearly an attack on those ignorant beliefs that are not in any way or form come from a place of truth. A series that tries to push beliefs that are built around shaming people without any reason or any form of logical whatsoever. And they say this stupid species is the only logical being to exist. If that's the case, then this species is the greatest failure of all."
2586,One Spring Night,"This show was pretty good. The story was well done and the cast did a good job acting out their parts. But the soundtrack was really annoying. They kept playing the same three songs over and over every other scene, especially the opening theme song which they played ALL THE TIME. It got really infuriating by the fourth episode, and after that it was enough to make me dislike the show. If I have to hear Rachael Yamagata's ""No Direction"" one more time I'll flip the freakin' table!!!"
2587,One Spring Night,"I've started watching K dramas only since last 2-3 months. It's very much like SITR but still the treatment is different. SITR has to be one of the best dramas in its first 6-7 episodes. Then it starts falling flat in someway. The characters start doing unbelievable actions in the second half and it has a rushed ending. People make comparison of One Spring Night with SITR. A lot of people actually started watching this because it's been directed by the same guy who made SITR. You may say One Spring is a mature version of SITR.I really liked the slow-burn relationship building of the main characters. The soundtrack is amazing. Palpable tension in the scenes are well depicted by Rachael Yamagata's 'No Direction' . When Lee Jung-in tells Ji Ho not to cross or when Lee Jung-in says sorry to Ki Seok and runs after Ji Ho, the soundtrack in the background really captures the mood of the scenes.Whether it's Ji Ho's vulnerability or Lee Jung-in strong willed personality, it's been portrayed perfectly by the characters. One thing I really liked was there is no over the top acting which you usually find in K-Dramas. The acting and the 'realism' of the story was the other thing I loved most about it. I can certainly see myself watching this show again."
2588,One Spring Night,This show is so realistic and deep. No exaggeration is done in this show. This series feels relatable to the everyday lives.Most importantly 'Jung Hae In' The Star Of The Show. He performed the character with so much depthness and piousness is visible in his acting skills.He always makes us attach to the show. Hats off.
2589,One Spring Night,"I have become a huge fan of Korean dramas with their great acting and beautiful, interesting story lines and I loved Something in the Rain, and thought One Spring night would be similar based on great reviews. To cut to the chase, the first third of the series was just toooo drawn out with way to much moping. There was a fair bit of moping and excessive drinking in SOR but once you got through that the lovely characters and brilliant acting made it worth it. I love the male lead and he made the series worth sticking with but the story had no interesting twists or heart warming sub plots. It was just a simple story line dragged out over 16 episodes. I can highly recommend Romance is Bonus Book and My First Love, but this one was mostly tedious with a few sweet moments here and there. The music was also far too repetitive, especially if you watch a few episodes in a row."
2590,One Spring Night,"I really wanted to like ""one sping night"", but I should have ""listened"" to my guts. As soon as I've read reviews comparing it to sitr, I knew it would be extremley difficult to be on the same level. But I didn't expect it to be so bad.Some dialogs are really bad. Who makes conversations like this? And of course the music...For gods sake...The same two songs in repeat. This was my main criticism in sitr, but it is much worse in osn. Jung Hae-In is a great actor but it's impossible to watch a show just for one or two actors.I managed to watch 5 whole episodes before realising I couldn't torture myself just to see what happens next. 4 stars for the actors trying their best to save what could be saved."
2591,One Spring Night,If you liked something in the rain you will like this one too. It's about woken up and releasing that it's not to late to choose what you want in life!
2592,One Spring Night,"As a guy who normally only watches romantic movies to accompany my wife, I created my account here after watching One Spring Night so I can write my very first review. While cheesy romances are not usually my cup of tea, unless they are really funny, I do like a good character-driven story that is interesting and hopefully believable. Despite being a longtime fan of Korean movies, I only started to watch k-drama several months ago and since then my wife and I are hooked. However, after almost a dozen shows, while the majority are very enjoyable, most of the story lines start to feel over-the-top and formulistic. After searching for a slower-paced drama I watched Something in the Rain. I loved it as much as I was frustrated by the flawed characters' unbelievable actions in the second half and the rushed ending. Despite its short comings however, I was still in the mood for another ""serious"" love story and was excited to find One Spring Night from the same writer and director.I was hooked by One Spring Night after the first episode. I loved the slow burn of the leads' relationship after their love at first sight encounter 5 minutes into the show. I liked watching the characters live as they chat, eat, drink, get drunk and talk some more. The actors are fabulous and it's hard not to root for them despite, or because of, their flaws. The male villains are annoying and pathetic, I find their character reasonably three dimensional (for a drama series) except for the elder sister's husband. I was relieved to find the subplots are not too convoluted or overbearing with unsatisfactory ending - though I would have happily paid the director to shorten the scenes between the ex-boyfriend and evil brother-in-law and give more screen time to the couple and the kid towards the end. Also, the lack of a truly psychotic and indestructible villain (like in Rain) meant our couple's up-and-down journey felt more organic and believable, as they don't need external help to create more insurmountable obstacles, a common trait in many dramas.Despite it's slow pace, Spring is ultimately uplifting in its portrayal of friendship, family, and, of course, the courage to trust the other person and to take risks in the name of love. It's hard not to be emotional when the sisters came together and support each other. While laugh-out comedy is mostly absent, there are many touching moments that would put a smile - and a tear or two - on your face. My favorites include the dinosaur-sticker-on-the-phone and proposal scenes. Priceless.Lastly, the cinematography sometimes remind me of In the mood for Love. The soundtrack, while repetitive and admittedly overused, are lovely so I am not complaining.To those tempted by this drama but are concerned by the slow pace, I'd suggest watching the first episode. You should know by then whether this is for you.To those hesitating between Rain or Spring, I'd say both are wonderful. To me, the first half of Rain is incomparably adorable. Overall though, if I had to rank them based on viewer satisfaction, coherence of the story line and character development, Spring comes out on top mostly thanks to the personality of the heroine. But the good news is, there's no need to choose. Go watch both of them if you haven't yet."
2593,One Spring Night,"I watched solely because of Jung Hae-In because I love his young, boyish, sweet character that is mature in thinking and able to take the lead in relationships when it comes down to someone he loves in romantic K-drama. This K-drama is different in that he plays Yoo Ji-ho, a pharmacist and single father of a 5 year old who is looking for a relationship. It is the Korean culture that we need to learn more about as in the US no one could care socially if someone decided to date someone with a child, but as we soon find out in this series, the librarian he meets is already engaged to a man that the parents approve of due to status and don't really care if there is love or not. The fact that You Ji-ho has a son obviously plays huge part in the series and that is different than other romance series I have seen. Jung Hae-In did his acting role beautifully as a father."
2594,One Spring Night,"I've ""bing"" watched this series 3 times and plan to many more times. I love it. The female sisters are so independent. Great role models. Han Ji Min does a great performance, without giving away the plot. I liked this story much better than his last series, ""Something in the Rain"". This also had a great message for single fathers."
2595,One Spring Night,"This TV show was refreshingly honest. The main characters are more mature and are living with real-life scars that they must accept before they can accept the other's affection. There is no chaebol drama, no formulaic unloved orphans, and no rags-to-riches background story. It's just two adults slowly, gently, funnily, stubbornly falling in love against the backdrop of their jobs and (intact!) families.
Don't get me wrong: I enjoy many of the other K-dramas, too, because I can suspend disbelief (people running into each other coincidentally in a 10 million metropolis? Rich young men feeling irresistibly attracted to poor girls rejected by their power-hungry families? One man successfully fighting off 10 hired assassins?), but for this show I didn't have to suppress my incredulity.
The sound-track was great, too. Oscar Dunbar and Rachel Yamagata are underrated singers."
2596,One Spring Night,"Anyone who has seen both these series will recognise that they are two peas from the same pod. They have same director, writer, and many of the same cast, albeit playing different characters.In my opinion they are both flawed masterpieces. Of the Romance genre, and should satisfy anyone that loves British period romances, because although they are set in the present, the oppressive nature of Korean society affords these series a subtlety that is similar to tone to Jane Ausren.The main flaw in both series is the repetition in the dealings with the ex-partners.SITR is further marred by the overbearing character of the mother, which seems just too over the top (Not the actress' fault who by the way is superb playing a completely different mum in OSN), and by the slightly muddled last two episodes..
However both series have wonderful acting, sympathetic protagonists that you will love, and numerous subtle and realustic.romantic set pieces.So which series is better?SITR has a better first half, with some of the most enchanting romantic scenes ever as the relationship between the two leads develops. It also must be said that it features a more beautiful lead actress (although both lead actresses are very good in their roles, playing characters with completely different personalities - one is soft, one is tough).OSN has a better second half and resolution.I felt that most of the greatest scenes in OSN are in the final 4 episodes, whereas there are great scenes in SITR more evenly scattered throughout.In conclusion... see both series...multiple times. I am yet to see any western made, present day drama/romance series as touching as these."
2597,One Spring Night,"Can't help but juxtapose this drama with Something in the Rain because it has a very similar feel and 60% of the cast of Something in the Rain is in this drama as well.I didn't think this matched the melodrama and frustration level of Something in the Rain. As another reviewer pointed out it didn't provide the range of emotions Hae-In elicit in Something in the Rain, maybe because his character in this drama was supposed to be more mature? In any case there is something about him that is very captivating.I found the female lead very likable, but her character lacked in many ways to develop or show any depth. I wish they did better with her. I really liked the actress.Ending was not memorable at all, I loved how Something in the Rain unfolded in the last two episodes and exploded in the end into something beautiful yet mysterious... there was none of that in this drama just gradually slow with predictable ending. Don't get me wrong I do not dislike happy endings just wished to be rewarded with some more loving scenes."
2598,One Spring Night,I thoroughly loved and enjoyed this series. It's amazing and better than Something In The Rain. I had to look past the cultural stigma associated with being a single dad but once I did that this series had my heart. Watch it and you will love it and come away better for it.
2599,One Spring Night,I actually watched this one twice already- I absolutely loved it- I how strong willed she was - she didn't care what anyone thought and went after what she loved- great story and I really enjoyed the ending- maybe bcus Im a single mom and even thought its just a movie but it still gives hope - wonderful story -it was my first Korean drama to watch and just fell in love with Jung Hae-in - so now I'm always looking for more shows with him-
2600,One Spring Night,"This is bit different than most K-dramas you'll see, as there is very little humor, and the awkwardness feels realistic. A young man & woman meet by chance, and share an immediate connection, yet try to ignore it. Both have complicated circumstances, (including a boyfriend for her) yet fate keeps bringing them into contact with each other, til they agree to be friends.It's not exactly smooth sailing, and many obstacles along the way, but it's an interesting look at two people who have their reasons to have given up on true love & idea of a soulmate, yet that desire is find these things is awakened. That's all I can say without spoiling anything, but worth your time!One interesting note, is that the director and half of the cast in this series are directly from ""Something in the Rain"", if you happened to have seen that one on Netflix. I did and enjoyed that one as well, and to be honest, it took me a little while to get used to all of these actors I knew so well as different characters from that drama in this new story. But, once I did, it felt strangely comfortable and I got used to seeing them as someone else.Anyway, If you are used to American mini-series, it takes some getting used to most k-dramas that take their time building their story, but once you've gotten deep into the story by episode 5 or 6, you'll appreciate the slower pace."
2601,One Spring Night,"I am totally blown away at how good these South Korean actors and actresses are. I just fell in love with everything and bingwatched everything what is availeble from this country on netflix between 2017-2020, Ye-jin Son and Min-Kyung Joo are mine favorit Actress, and I love the spontaneous output and vibrancy from Min-Kyung Joo, so in love, i wish i was korean and 20 years younger,.. keep up dreaming"
2602,One Spring Night,Waiting for season 2 hope coming soon very nice story
2603,One Spring Night,Wow!! Light hearted drama. The best part was that there were no emotional torture in this drama!!
2604,One Spring Night,"To feel or not to feel .. That's the problem
U may think u'r happy enough this way , everybody iis satisfied, u'r gonna make u'r family happy, live up to their expectations.
U feel like u'r someone's object and u'r fine with it.
And then he knocks u'r door and make u experience what true love is ... Make u courage enough to fight u'r way to u'r happiness .
They made us feel the love between them more then see it .
This serie made us learn that u'r own joy is much important than anything else ."
2605,One Spring Night,"And if you're lucky, grow love with new soil. Either way, you have to get rid of the dead leaves for new blossoms. This movie shows the reality of relationships and different situations we may find ourselves in whether it's a fresh start from stagnancy or leaving a painful situation."
2606,One Spring Night,"This series is best understood as not just about the possibility of romance of the main protagonists, but for others as well, and the different ways people act in successful and failed, love relationships, of parents and their children: considerate, devoted, jilted, obsessive, abusive, quirky.The story is grounded (maybe better: plausible and realistic). It's a slow build but it is a sweet story in which the characters have depth, can change and grow, show flaws and integrity. The story is brilliantly conceived, brilliantly played out.The acting is consistently brilliant and convincing. In particular, Spring reveals the immense acting skill of the person who also played a mother in Something in the Rain: such different characters! Bravo.Now that I have seen Spring after having earlier viewed Something in the Rain, I better understand what was frustrating about Something in the Rain. Rain is more a critique of SK society than a romance: lawyers who are psychopaths and sociopaths, work place sexism and denigration of women, drunkenness as remedying the distraught, social lying for personal convenience, social climbing mean mothers, social, family and workplace cultures that oppress women, class and economic bigotry. (Gosh, does the writer so dislike SK people or is it, dislikes people in general?) Into this mix is a male lead who is, romantically, with few exceptions, one dimensionally angelic. The romantic moments in the first 9 episodes of Rain were also more extreme than in Spring and truly moving and beautiful. Which leads to the problem in Rain. The last 7 episodes, after the initial hopefulness, get progressively sadder and Jin'a's shortcomings increasingly make her seem like a human emotional wrecking ball.In Rain, the character of Jin'a, taking the series as a whole does not deserve to be the girlfriend of a romantic angel (though who else would put up with her), and, what throws the viewer off balance, does not deserve to be so capably represented as cute and adorable by the immensely talented Ye-jin Son. The actress is so successful that the viewer is in effect conned into thinking better of Jin'a than Jin'a deserves. (Other reviews vary in their tolerance of Jin'a's behavior from indulgent to negative.) Was that the writer's intention, or merely incidental to the choice of cast?In summary, if you only had enough time for one of Spring or Rain, I would opt for Spring. It makes you feel better for having watched it. Uplifting done well."
2607,One Spring Night,I spent the most wonderful 16 hours watching this show. That's all I'll write here.
2608,One Spring Night,"Han Ji-Min plays a strong willed librarian who, just off of a withering relationship with the arrogant son of her father's employer, happens to meet a pharmacist (Jung Hae-In, Something in the Rain) and falls, head over heels for him, despite all the social conventions that would argue against it. She is very convincing in her portrayal of a wide range of emotions. Her true beauty didn't strike me until a few episodes in when she began to show the more vulnerable side of the character.This series adds an interesting complication to the usual relationship issues in K-dramas: the pharmacist has a son whose mother abandoned them at birth. There are also some intense side plots that explore Korean culture and the heavy toll it takes on women. One Spring Night gives more depth to many of the characters and paints an overall more somber picture.Half the cast of Something in the Rain seems to be in this series as well as music by Rachel Yamagada. Overall this series is a bit more mature, three-dimensional, edgy and more realistic than Something in the Rain, which is why I give it one more star."
2609,One Spring Night,"Three luminous sisters-the oldest one, Lee Seo-in (played by Im Sung-eon), is in a marriage that's gone from bad to worse; the middle one, Lee Jeong-in (Han Ji-min), is in a 4-year relationship that's gone sour; and the youngest one, Lee Jae-in (Joo Min-kyung), is a maverick who's not yet entangled with a partner-have each others' backs as they come to terms with themselves and the men in their lives. Their mother, Shin Jyeong-seon (Gil Hae-yeon) stands by them-and stands between them and the men in their lives, including their father, whose ideas about marriage are more traditional than those of his wife and daughters.The plot revolves around Jeong-in's internal and external conflicts as she tries to extricate herself from one relationship (with Kwon Ki-seok, played by Kim Jun-han) and forge a new one with Yoo Ji-ho (Jung Hae-in, who also was a main character in ""Something in the Rain""). Jeong-in seems to know where she wants to go with her life, but she can't quite find a path forward. Her performance is nuanced and evolves sweetly and strongly over the 16 episodes.""One Spring Night"" was directed by Ahn Pan-seok, who won awards for his work on ""Something in the Rain."" The cast of ""One Spring Night"" also includes several outstanding actors who worked with Ahn in the earlier series. Once again, the ensemble cast work together very well.In ""One Spring Night,"" Ahn seems to push the envelope for women even further than he did in the earlier series-or is he only reflecting ongoing cultural change in South Korea? The sisters are strong, wrestle with difficult choices, support each other, and are supported by their mother, who in middle age has begun to reclaim control of her own life. The sisters' female friends listen to them, share stories, give advice. The conversations among the sisters and their female friends are smart and sensitive. The men in their lives-many of them dressed in gray, black, or white-are often problematic, but some of them give sage advice and support to each other and the women in their lives.The soundtrack is excellent and includes several songs-Rachael Yamagata's ""No Direction,"" ""We Could Still Be Happy,"" and ""Is it You,"" as well as Oscar Dunbar's ""Spring Rain"" and Carla Bruni's ""Spring Waltz""-that announce and accompany scenes with no dialog in which actors are thinking, lying in bed, walking in the park, riding in taxis, etc. In several slow-motion scenes, the music is synchronized to the actors' steps.This is not a plot spoiler: Remember the rubber band in a drugstore scene in Episode 1!This series warmed me-heart and soul. Check it out!"
2610,One Spring Night,I looove this show. The characters develop throughout the first season and the plot is great.
2611,One Spring Night,"Great story - NOTHING about it is fantasy, everything in it can ( and probably does ) happen in real life.Not for kids. Strong social statements made for Korean women and it's culture.To make my point of how different this is ......she proposes to him."
2612,One Spring Night,"The best K-drama I've watched thus far. The story and characters are ordinary persons, as if this is a story of your family or friends. It's so well crafted that I don't feel it's too commercially dramatized but engaging enough that shows the desire, struggle, conflict, hope and love thy ordinary people like you and me share. Overall pace is slower than usual but if you are able to finish the 1st episode, most likely you will be attracted to it."
2613,One Spring Night,"Any show I have seen him in, he never fails to impress!!!
So worth watching..."
2614,One Spring Night,"""How a bunch of stubborn, self-centred and angry men try to tell women how they should feel and think"".
I sweet love story in it though."
2615,One Spring Night,Absolute masterpiece of a drama . The story is unique and gripping . Romance at its best .
2616,One Spring Night,"Enjoyed this show, but like so many other k-dramas the soundtrack is far too simplistic - when will they figure out that for 10-20 hours of video, you need at least an hour of music to go with it. Even better get a composer to do an instrumental arrangement without vocals, and save that single song for the title theme."
2617,One Spring Night,"So this is one of my favorite k-dramas. I love the storyline, the actors and the soundtrack. It is more realist than fantasy and shows the culture and expectations of life in Korea.The story follows Lee Jung-in played by Han Ji-min as the main character and her two sisters.Lee Jung-In has been dating the same guy for 4 years. They begin talking about marriage as culture suggest. They both seem unhappy in their current state. After spending the night at her friends house, Jung_in oversleeps and is running late to work. She runs into the local pharmacy for her hangover where she happens to run into Pharmacist Yoo Ji Ho played as Jung Hae-In.They are instantly attracted to each other. Due to their own complications in their lives, they stay away from each other. By chance after her younger sisters come home from school broad, they go to Jung-In's boyfriend's basketball game where Ji=Ho is there.They decided to meet up and discuss being friends to which they agree. The story follows them through their attraction and how they are to move forward with their relationship.The story is more on the slower side but I really enjoyed it all over. I keep watching it over and over again. Both actors are amazing in their roles. Def recommend watching it."
2618,One Spring Night,"Initial concept was good but they ruined it with the idealistic talks, repeated soundtrack, emotional scenes with no emotions and slow progress of the story."
2619,One Spring Night,A bit too slow and repetitive for my taste. Yet the story and characters are very realistic and relatable.
2620,One Spring Night,I'm a guy and I'm not really into these types of shows but I think personally it connected with me in a way. I was a single dad before so I can relate to the main character in someways. I really felt touched in someways because I know the feeling of being a single dad being scared to commit to someone after having a previous bad relationship. I think what actually made me get emotional in a way was when the main character tell his story of his previous relationship to his new girlfriend and how the mother of his child ran away. I have felt this feeling as well before and it touched me because it's a feeling that will never go away. What's funny about this is that I met my wife in a library which is what made me happy about this because my wife worked part time at the university we went to as a cashier. I'm not really into love story shows but when I saw my wife watching it reminded me of us in a way. I really enjoyed the show it was great overall.
2621,One Spring Night,The story is not developing well until episode 8. I like the actors though.
2622,One Spring Night,"Love Korean dramas mainly because they have such great writers and of course amazing actors and actresses. Please keep in mind that this review is not about their acting. It is about the story and this story was just dumb.While in a relationship, she falls madly in love with a good looking and charming younger man. She is a dominant, headstrong and stubborn person. The ""new"" guy is looking for someone who is good around his kid. But he is hiding his real self because he is scared to lose her. So she is suddenly going to become a mom to a kid from a different woman because she is in love? With that strong personality? How long will that last? He is not thinking about the long term welfare of the kid. They are totally not suited for each other.She cheated on her boyfriend because he wasn't paying enough attention to her. The original boyfriend doesn't drink, doesn't go to bars, is not violent or dangerous. His only mistake seems to be that he works too hard and he has taken their relationship for granted. She got bored of him, she can get bored of the new guy. Except now there is a kid involved. After the honeymoon, where do you think his priorities are?: his own kid. And everyone else is backing them because they are ""in love"". No logic or reason. And everyone is giving her dad a hard time because he is ""not making the right decisions"" but no one is giving him any of the facts. He is totally in the dark about all his children because everyone is hiding stuff from him. The mom didn't believe the eldest daughter's story until she showed her the pictures. Once she learns that, she is mad at the dad because he is not supportive... so many inconsistencies!Unfortunately the writers for this show twist things just to make their ""love story"" work.5/5 for acting. 0/5 for the story.Watch SITR, way better."
2623,One Spring Night,"I love this movie I swear it is in dire need of a season two. Season one left me wondering if everything worked out between the families & the friends. It was all so up in the air. I wanted to see if her father finally except his daughter's new reality, did her sister really do well with her pregnancy, did the other sister actually find herself and start a career. There were too many unanswered questions."
2624,One Spring Night,"Tried to finish watching it, but the story dragged
on too slowly for way too long, so I gave up eventually. The main female character is way too annoying, it makes you wonder why such a nice, youthful looking guy would ever fall in love with her.Her constant complaining and criticism are overbearing, not to mention her sense of fashion which is atrocious, worse than that of a ninety year old granny...
The guy looks ten years younger while she manages to make herself look ten years older, so you get the picture...
The use of a single soundtrack throughout the series grinds on everyone's nerves; why use just a single song, repeated ad nauseam?To sum up, a very disappointing series."
2625,One Spring Night,"I loved this one. The story was better than something in the rain and the side characters were fantastic. I would have loved the ending to be be better, seeing all the families get together at their wedding the father happy and her sister with her new baby and the sassy one too."
2626,One Spring Night,"Even though I've fallen in love with South Korean people, culture, cinematography, food, history and nature - btw I'm not even talking about Kpop and other mainstream products of this country - I just can't shake the negatives this society exudes in regard of how judgemental and materialistic they are. Viewing marriage like it's only a business transaction, blatant chauvinism, hard-core patriarchy, etc. And what's with viewing single parents ad they're damaged goods? That's apalling! I've also noticed even adopted children being looked down-upon. Those aren't ""values"" that's discrimination, and a reallly ugly kind. Listen, I'm not even from the West - I'm located in SE Europe which is primitive in its own way. But these are horrific ""standards"" from the middle-ages we're talking about. Fathers and mothers disregarding what their daughters want, with whom they want or don't want to be. Accepting men that mistreat them, asking them to stay in unhealthy relationships so they get material goods or to advance in a workplace. Generally it seems quite normal to say that a woman ""must"" stay in a relationship if the man doesn't want to break-up. I mean, what in the world??? Citing that one cannot break-up as a one-sided decision made by a woman is unacceptable in a relationship - does this sound normal or healthy to you? I may visit South Korea in the future as a tourist but I'd never live there. It's a toxic society and we're in 2022. Thank goodness we have a choice, regardless how many dumba$$es are telling us othervise."
2627,One Spring Night,The soundtrack of this series reminds me of 90s sitcoms. I didn't like. Also very stagnant and boring.
2628,One Spring Night,"Not every story is what you want it to be!! This series has a great message i think, those who didn't get it ended up writing it as unrealistic and No chemistry!! Seriously?? I think there chemistry works far better than most of the series...... However i love it!!"

2680,연모,"I love the cast and most of the series. It is true that at some points its narrative pace weakens, and there are some transition issues perhaps from time constraints. However, when this 20-episode drama is good, it's very good. Some scenes are delightfully hilarious, others charming or deeply moving: the makers did a great job of developing characters and relationships. I think if it had been tightened and trimmed into 16 eps, with a less hurried writer, the series would have been gold. Still, the story and characters are strong, and the themes of loyalty, protectiveness, devotion, and love are explored tenderly. The series never is boring unless one views the dark sides of historical sexism, homophobia, classism, jealousy, abuse of power, political intrigue, assassination, murder, and struggles for position or justice through combat and power plays as boring. Or one never finished the series at all. For me, the real excellence of the series is its belief in friendship, loyalty, and love that ""sees"" and embraces the beloved, no matter the shifts and even threats. It is the series' greatest theme, and the actors deserve praise for their gifted performances in telling their characters' often tragic but also triumphant stories. And the most important take-away is that ""Yes, she can."""
2681,연모,The story of a girl who is unaware she was born a twin to the crown Prince but once he is murdered she assumes his identity. An interesting story which is well acted by the leads and and all the supporting cast. I would have scored it higher but too much time is taken on recaps and what seems like hours of people staring into space whilst the romantic theme tune plays.
2682,연모,"Yes the Dude does look like a lady, very much so. High concept feminist-forward fantasy, odd modern touches thrown in like soccer and teen dating. Oh and with the usual K-Drama palace court intrigue, evil chamberlain, helpful maids and eunuchs. For a younger audience."
2683,연모,"There are many historical instances of women living their lives as men, but the unbelievability of such a beautiful and petite woman successfully doing so could well have been an obstacle to enjoying this series. Somehow it did not seem to matter. There are so many compensations with the usual Korean high standard of acting, skillful and propulsive plotting, believable relationships and rounded characters. No cardboard baddies here. Great!"
2684,연모,"The main key element who makes this show to fresh and original is the complete reverse of stereotypical gender roles. I know the king has to pretend to be a man but she never tries to act like one following ridiculous stereotypes. She never shied away from showing empathy and tenderness and at the same time she always proves to be strong, independent and fearless.Then there's the male lead (Rowoon's character) who throughout the drama is so loyal, confident and proud of his feelings for the person he loves, no matter who that person is, is just amazing to watch.I keep discovering Rowoons acting, I love the range of his late roles, comedy is where I enjoy him the most and this show makes his performance shine.I love how coherent all characters are, from start to finish, all their actions make complete sense and they are in sync with their personalities.This is not an overdramatized and exaggerated plot where everything is predictable so it will keep you interested until the end.Just didn't give it a 10 because towards the end the pace is a bit slow for my taste and I missed more passion between the main couple but this is a Korean drama so Im used to that.Good watch."
2685,연모,"I've just finished watching this series for the second time, and I think I may wait a few days and start it all over again. What a beautiful show. I sobbed like a baby just now in the ending, even though I saw it the first time a few weeks ago. The show is just simply beautiful, wonderful, exhilarating and many more adjectives.I loved all the leads, despised none except the grandfather, but he was acted exceptionally as well.I fell in love with the king (the prince/princess), Royal Scribe Jung, her love interest. Oh my that I was years younger and in Korea! As the crown prince/king, the female lead was wonderful. Her expressions, her mannerisms, everything was so well acted! And Scribe Jung - so handsome, and when he blushes or looks at her with love, you just want to melt.The acting overall was superb, and I cannot tell when I last enjoyed a show like this. I watch a lot of Netflix shows, I even watched Squid, and I watched Bridgerton twice, but I am in love with the King's Affection and have really been blown away.I gave this 10 stars and if I could have given it 20 I would. If you haven't watched this yet, and you love a good story with good drama, romance, love, action, fighting and excitement, then put this as top priority on your list, and then come back and write about it. I'm reading every review! I can't get enough of this show."
2686,연모,"This series manages to put Eun-bin Park, a petite woman that is not much above average Korean woman's height at 163 cm, opposite very tall Korean actors (average male height in Korea is 174.6 cm) such as Nam Yoon-Su at 186 cm, Kim Ro Woon at 189 cm, and Kim Taek at 185 cm. Just makes it look ridiculous that this is a woman that is supposed to be playing a man. And her acting never pulls off the tough image. It does not look like they even tried to beef her up for the role, a role where she is supposed to be practicing with the bow and sword. There are too many times where the ""prince"" is shown taking excessive risks if she is supposed to be maintaining the myth that she is the prince. Just way too unrealistic. And the show seems to just drag on a lot. It could have been done a lot better, with much more suitable selection of actors and the main actress to play the lead roles. Although still not the right type, Jun Ji-hyun (173 cm) has done a excellent performances in Assasination and Kingdom: Ashin of the North where she plays very tough girl roles. She may be a bit old, but just have a different actress play the young Dam Yi. Just too unbelievable and a weak script."
2687,연모,"I couldn't wait to finally watch this drama as the plot seemed quite interesting, though that whole gender switch thing isn't anything new in the drama world.And as it usually is with dramas I am more than excited to start watching, said excitement died down from episode to episode.Why?There weren't any big surprises in the plot. There is this typical power struggle between the royal clans, corrupt state officials and a rebellion. A second male and a second female lead exists too and the usual (ridiculous!!!) ""I need to break up with you to protect you"" is also included in the drama's storyline. And a parent not approving of the lead couple's relationship. And palast staff that makes you laugh. And...So far, the usual drama clichés.A few things were kind of weird to me, like the fact that two characters drink poison and the one who started drinking it and therefore who's body came in contact with the poison way earlier than the other character survives while the other dies. Umm... just because the producers wanted a happy end...?The ones who kind of ""saved"" the show were the actors who did a phenomenal job portraying their respective characters and the characters itself, with most of them being super adorable, funny and just to fall in love with (at least the good ones)."
2688,연모,"Very well thought out. I always look forward to watching this serie. It wasn't easy for anyone those days.such things did happen at this time. Not human at all, but power and status still come first.I think Eun-bin Park had to get used to her own voice again. I do think that if you're in your role with a different voice, it's a bit of a switch. I enjoyed your acting!"
2689,연모,"Don't let the title fool you, so far this one is a hidden gem. Like the story already. I wasn't expecting this show to be this good through the first two episodes. Strong female lead, longing and waiting for more to come!"
2690,연모,One thing i liked most about this drama is that male character did not startle whether he was loving a man or woman. This is a refreshing thing about this drama. I love the main cast and the supporting as well. Its visuals were awesome and the story was engaging till the end. Perfect Historical drama.
2691,연모,"A very good drama overall but has some flaws. Period piece set in ancient Korea, good acting almost good story.SPOILER:
So in what ancient era would allow ""different sex preference"" - none and with a prince/king in the mix. As the writers trying to show that ""homosexuality"" is ok set 1000 yrs ago it would haven it been accepted. Now yes but not then
That's why episode 7-9 is slow and not very entertaining. Perhaps a better direction for these episodes would have been to find suitable brides for the prince and the doctor and bring some comedy into the drama.If you can get past these scenes then the mystery, acting, skills and story gets better as the drama moves on.And with all of the past Korean dramas I have watched this ending is much better and more realistic.Writers did a good job with the final episode. Not like other dramas where everyone returns to their separate corners."
2692,연모,"I usually don't like historical dramas, but this one is different. It's an interesting story, with the perfect balance of romance and drama. I wish they had stuck with 16 episodes instead of 20 though. Halfway through, the story becomes slightly repetitive and slow paced. But honestly, the ending makes up for it."
2693,연모,"I have seen several KDramas and to this date, this is now my #1 tv series...edging my erstwhile favorites Crash Landing On You and Vagabond. This show has everything from Romance, Action, Suspense, Treachery, Humor and Tragedy. It's a Tear-jerker too from episode 2 up to the end of episode 20...You would need a lot of tissue or better a towel since there's a lot of crying for 19 episodes. The OSTs are so emotional and touching that whenever I hear IF I and I BELIEVE in a scene, my tears begin to fall..The show has the Greatest Love Story and the best last episode and ending..It's the first time I've seen all the cast but I immediately fell in love with them all, such a good chemistry and acting by the whole ensemble..You feel as if you are swayed and a part of the royal court....some of them you love, some you hate and a combination of both....but if I will surely protect my ""HIS"" Majesty the Crown Prince Lee Hwi...EUN-BIN PARK became one of my instant favorites and hearthrob.... she's so charming...I hope there will be another good show like this. LOVE IT.."
2694,연모,... because it's usually from the cast or family. It's okay. Honestly it lost me at the end of episode 2. The idea that an imposter prince (whos entire survival depends on maintaining her brothers identity) would cut her hair in feminine layers or bathe out in the open is so stupid i couldn't even wrap my head around it. Really unbelievable and poorly executed cast.
2695,연모,"I approached this drama with fear of it being too melodramatic. And it is melodramatic, and there are the typical clichés of naked torsos and ""unexpected"" embraces, but it remains interesting until the end. Besides, there's a couple of support characters whose arc is unexpectedly good, like villain inspector Jung Seok-jo, and the main actress is very, very good.Something I did not like: this drama's penchant for killing children. I could have done without it. But, all in all, very entertaining if a little bit sad at times."
2696,연모,"Best K drama I have seen so far. Great story telling, interesting twists and such beautiful main characters. All actors are very well selected. I hope to see more of Rowoon in the future.We cried our eyes out. It really hits your soul."
2697,연모,Wow...... Park Eun Bin's and Rowoon's acting surely knocked viewer's socks off. The story line was unique and beautiful without any unnecessary cheesy scenes. I can think this as an reminisce of love in the moon light!You should check this out if you are a true kdrama fan.
2698,연모,"I am speechless. This is so well written and acted, these young actors are some of the best in the business.This drama hits every emotion. Get ready for a ride that you'll find hard to turn off. I've been glued to Netflix for a week watching.I have to mention the fight choreography, so well done. The sword fights are so realistic.Just wow."
2699,연모,"Purely for how progressive this Kdrama was, it gets a 9/10.The good: the cast that I got incredibly attached to, the high level acting and character progression, the plot of a strong and masculine woman and a gentle and kind man being in love, the plot of the woman saving herself and others and not being saved by a knight in shining armor, I love complex female characters!The neutral: the pacing was average, certain plot points dragged on for too long while others deserved more time (like the ending), I felt like I wanted to see more happy moments instead of going from extreme happy and to sad and violent at the end.However, having said that, I enjoyed this Kdrama and I don't end up finishing many, but I finished this one! I was determined!"
2700,연모,"The serie self is good also the actors do great jobSadly the char that is women and need to pretend to be a men, the should have make it more look like a men.From the age after 10 years when she more grow up.You see it she is a women ,not shoulders like a men the could cover that with put some filling in the cloths.When not smilling you see already she is a women ,she is smal and her face looks like a women ,you cant cover it.You can deseve meabe the outside world ,but sorry if even her father & Grandfather or even that queen or whatever it is ,then the verry stupid and when she smile + her hands already revail that she is a women ,iam now on 10 episodes ,stil only her close friend seems to know who she is ,but for me even the voice ,size ,face and hands revail it so how her family not see it are the so stupid?But i give it a 6 becouse the charakters work in it is good and the story is good.Only i would find it more realisic ,when the son died that it came out then that it get revailed and that the had no other choice to revail that she is the doughter of them or ad least that the hole family knows it and that the storry then go on with her as princess."
2701,연모,"Really enjoyed this drama, from the interesting and unique story to the great cast. Just discovered Rowoon (Kim Seok-woo) with this drama and will definitely look for more of his work. I started to list the others, but just know that even the supporting roles are filled with great actors who flesh out the storyline. Well worth watching!"
2702,연모,I just loved this movie after you get past the subtitles. The cinematography was amazing! The leads were so interesting and were great at conveying a lot with just a look...I have rewatched it several times and pic up things I've missed.The ending is a real tear jerker...have tissue on hand.
2703,연모,"This is the best historical drama I've ever seen! Really be a fun year-end drama. The plot, and the combination of other elements really blend very nicely. The ending is very much in line with expectations. For Park Eunbin, she portrayed the character so perfectly, she deserves an award! The chemistry between the players is very visible. Each episode never fails to make me sad, tense, scared, and happy at the same time! My favorite character, Hyun. He is the definition of a man who is loyal and sincerely loves his girl even though he is not one with her. In essence, this is a very beautiful drama, I don't know how to move on from this drama :(, anyone help me huhuhu. Especially, I can't forget Hyun's sweet and sincere smile aarrghhh, his smile is really distracting my world hahaha I dare to rate 100/100 for this drama!!!!"
2704,연모,This was my the first historical drama and that show was very beautiful and the events were interconnected plus the leads were very cute next to each other with their height difference..
2705,연모,"You will cry sad tears happy tears, South Koreans make beyond awesome films, you will jump hoping from one drama and film to the next. Keeping you happy your partner happy. Don't be crying in a corner here, just bawl you're eyes out. But I'm not telling you the end that would be telling. Girls can do anything even when it's totally and utterly impossibly unfair. With no way out. Hang on in there it's worth every tear. Totally utterly awesome."
2706,연모,"I have watched 11 Kdramas so far, including this one and this one was the only one that I wasn't able to enjoy fully despite the unique and intriguing storyline and plot. Although there are many reasons that led me to feel this way, the most prominent one was that I simply didn't feel like Park Eunbin was fit for the role. She was supposed to play the role of a Prince in disguise and not only does her petite figure make it utterly impossible for you to take the Prince character seriously but something that I can't really put a finger on is seriously off about it.Another thing that seemed off to me was Eunbin and Rowoon's chemistry. The Jiun-Dami couple failed to send butterflies fluttering about in my stomach. Maybe it's because I had watched Extraordinary You before this drama and had gotten way too hooked on the overflowing chemistry displayed by Rowoon and Kim Hyeyoon.Lastly, the final underlying problem I had with this drama was the fact that Jiun fell for Dami despite him being under the impression that she was a man. Being raised and still currently living in a highly conservative society, I'm not entirely comfortable with these type of things and would much rather avoid watching dramas/movies that are based on them (No hate tho)."
2707,연모,"If you are a fan of this genre : boy meets girl, palace intrigue, secret to be unraveled, then this will keep you amused. Nothing outstanding and The Story of Nokdu and. Love in the Moonlight were in my opinion more enjoyable. Passes the time but don't expect anything groundbreaking."
2708,연모,"This is truly one of the best I've ever watched. First, amidst the historical portrayal on prejudices against women in terms of power, freedom, and societal status, the heroine is an epitome of someone who had proven this preconceived notion otherwise. Her phenomenal character stood out despite her predicament. Secondly, the story depicts how true love transcends beyond gender and status. Although the unconventional affection that was portrayed in the earlier episodes was a deal-breaker in a male dominated culture and era, the plot was carefully elucidated in a very realistic lens. I wish there's more of this.The story shows how power corrupts the minds of some, but brings out the best in others.The cuteness of the cast is overwhelming."
2709,연모,I had to subtract a few stars for casting a very feminine lady to play a man. We laughed over and over at the absurdity. They should have cast a tougher less feminine looking actress. We have watched 3 episodes so far but unless she grows a beard I'm not watching 20 episodes.
2710,연모,"I'm not going to waffle on, first review ever, Korean Drama is a recent discovery for me - even something as awful as covid lockdown has a silver lining - this is quite simply, unmissable........."
2711,연모,"This series is one of my favorite Korean series! Super interesting, it's that good.The casts are cute and the storyline is amazing. Highly recommended."
2712,연모,Cute show but the main character is useless.she starts out like she has the balls but by the end when it counts she's absolutely useless.side characters have better story progression.
2713,연모,"Acting when they grow up so awful, female actress and male actor.I stop watching the drama when Ep 5.I find interest when there are kids.Thank you."
2714,연모,"With just 5 episodes, I am loving each of the episodes so far. The acting are spot on. ParkEunBin is convincing as a man and monarch, and Rowoon is just too adorable as JiWoon. He is indeed what she needs in a cold and dangerous palace. I cannot wait to see how their love will blossom, how both will join hands to fight evil while remaining virtuous. Great story. Wonderful cinematography."
2715,연모,"By far, this is really the best historical drama i've ever watched. Like i invested so much time without knowing. All casts are really cute and the story is so catchy. Ahh i'm so hooked up with this drama and i can't wait for the next episode.I SWEAR THIS IS A MUST TO WATCH. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 100000/10."
2716,연모,"I really enjoyed this drama. The last two episodes were my favorite! I loved the very end. Wonderful job to all the actors, directors, and writers. Writers you especially came through near the end. With plenty of action, suspense, karma, and happiness. Great job! To my new favorite KOppa, who acted like a REAL Man all through the drama, you will recognize him when you see him, ladies. He lost his love but, won the prize KOppa, when your first love doesn't work wait for the second. Fighting!"
2717,연모,"There's romance, espionage, mystery, political wrangling and edge-of-seat ""OMG!"" moments in every single episode. The storyline (the writers should be knighted) and cinematography are both amazing - but the acting? Everyone is so good at conveying emotion with just their eyes. Each episode is so so insane - twists and ""just when you thought it was going HERE..."" moments not withstanding - but the last 10-12 minutes of each episode have been riveting. You want it to resolve, but don't want it to end! It will seriously have you talking to your TV."
2718,연모,For the first time watching a Korean show and am intrigued by the interresting storylines. You want to see more! Can't wait for a new episode or even a season 2 (yes please!) The main lead characters have so much natural chemistry you can feel it. Also Park Eun Bin is a very good actress for playing both male and female. Overall good camerawork and beautifull settings and costumes. It wants to make you binge watch the show!
2719,연모,Funny and sad. But the ending is great. She deserve a happy ending. The storyline is good. I think this is great K-drama this year. The king affection should win award!!!
2720,연모,"You must regret if ignoring this K-drama. To be honest, I have never seen any films before which is emotional and I still ""miss"" this film because last episode ended 3 days before. Not knowing Park Eun Bin or Rowoon, ... before so I think they are talented actors and actresses who can go far in the future. Must-see film ever, if given a chance, wish the cast can come to a joint project or a joint film in the future. Love all of you, a memorable period of 2021 I have been through. I have never wanted this film ended so if given a miracle, please release the season 2 of this extraordinary film."
2721,연모,"This is truly one of the best I've ever watched. First, amidst the historical portrayal of societal prejudice against women in power, the heroine's persona is an epitome of someone who had proven this preconceived notion of weakness attached to women otherwise. Secondly, the story depicts how true love transcends beyond gender and status. Although this type of unconventional relationship is a deal-breaker to a male dominated culture and era, the plot was carefully elucidated in a realistic multi-angular lens.The story shows how power corrupts the minds of some, but brings out the best in others.The cuteness of the cast is overwhelming. The soundtrack is phenomenal."
2722,연모,"This is the first time I am making a review because I have never been so impacted by a TV broadcast!By principle I run away from any type of addiction in my life but the King's affection not only got me addicted but also... obsessed!! LOL
I have so much to open up about that I will have to share several reviews to cover up all my take outs...
So this is episode 1 of my reviews 😂
First of all BRAVOOO to the entire team and to everyone that was directly or indirectly involved in this DIVINE MASTERPIECE!!! Everything was perfect and impressive: from the storyline, to the casting, to the acting, to the costumes, to the filming locations (beautiful views) and décor...
And the soundtrack!! Oh my God!Breathtaking ! So verily aligned and in rhythm with the storyline! Even without understanding this beautiful and so soft Korean language, the soundtrack especially ""One & Only"" and ""If I"" propulse you for a royal journey into the Palace and deep inside the story...
I listen to it everyday: has become my daily booster. Stimulates and keeps me happy. It ignites a warm fire of love in my heart. It makes me believe and trust that I can still love and be loved once again. Against all odds...
The last 2 episodes were aired late December in my Netflix zone. Then I watched the entire drama again and enjoyed it more because I was more relaxed and focused knowing about the happy ending! LOL
This is my favourite Christmas gift and I will keep watching it over and over all year long!! LOL
Last but not leat : this drama and the leads actors deserve a NATIONAL and INTERNATIONAL AWARDS!!!For me it is the BEST EVER!A special ovation to Park Eun-bin: you are amaziiing! A Majesty you truly are ! Now only the sky is the limit for you...
Till episode 2 of my reviews...Keep well everyone who is reading and be blessed!"
2723,연모,"Like another reviewer here, I fell in love with this series so much that I watched it a second time with my boyfriend, who also fell in love with it.I can't remember a time when a tv show has touched me so deeply. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, some of the shots you would want to frame they are so beautiful. It's honestly worth watching just for that.The love story is touching and heartbreaking, the presentation of Korean class and history whilst juxtaposing it with modern themes was excellent and notably progressive. The perfect weaving of Confucianism values throughout the script not only reflects excellent writing but also brings a beautiful insight as to how people used to have a closer relationship to Nature (by observing and learning through Nature's lessons).Plus it brings the perfect amount of Korean 'cheese' with some of the soundtrack choices and sense of humour - in the way that is unique to Korean culture.If you're looking to be straight up entertained then perhaps this one isn't for you. But I found the slower pace of the storyline added to it's magic and paired with the tranquility and beauty of the setting, it provides a well-needed rest bite from the real world which is already heavy enough as it is.If you're able to step a pace slower, and appreciate all that is mentioned above, then The King's Affection will transport you somewhere specialI laughed, I cried - I was gutted both times it finished. Just a beautiful story from start to finish."
2724,연모,"This drama makes my heart burst, tears flows and my heart flutters. I am dreaming about the characters, the actors are fantastic and so is the director and the whole production. Thank you for this, I utterly love k-drama, and this one is among the very best!"
2725,연모,I love this series! This is my favorite kdrama now. Watching it again for the second time. Always looking forward to the scenes of Dami-i and Ji-woon. Makes me fall in love over and over again.I love all of the characters except for the chief state councilor 😂
