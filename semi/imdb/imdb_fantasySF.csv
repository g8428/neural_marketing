0,The Uncanny Counter,The chasing and fighting of bad guys is done in very dim lighting. Hard to see what is going on. After 5 episodes it was quite fun to see him take on bullies and get his powers. But it is boring and confusing when they go after assorted villains. The angst is overdone and out of place.
1,The Uncanny Counter,"You are in for a treat. The first few episodes of most Kdramas are better than entire seasons of western shows! Around the halfway mark in the episode roster the writers usually throw in a lot of brand new plot arcs and twists. Kdramas initially specialized in romcoms, but now they lead in all genres. This specific series includes a wide range of themes -- horror, high school drama, politics, fighting -- you seldom see mixed together. Great TV."
2,The Uncanny Counter,"Korean Drama "" Uncanny Counter "" is a wonderful blend of action, comedy and family dynamics.The drama has a perfect atmosphere, almost like a webtoon, with perfect action scenes and a beautiful world built. The drama introduces the universe of the counters slowly and the viewer gets to know it at the same time as the main character. The family dynamics of the small group of the counters were perfect, emotional at times, funny at others. The story is also full of small cases that the counters had to solve, which were interesting and entertaining, while it follows the main 'big' mystery of the case that eventually involves everyone.The performances were great as well, and everyone had the perfect chemistry with each other. However, the main lead got annoying and tiring to watch when he was struggling to maintain the barrier thing, as it looked a bit fake and overacted. But the rest of his acting was really good. Also, the guys of the 'other side' were overbearing at times.So, overall, 8.5 out of 10 for this pretty entertaining drama."
3,The Uncanny Counter,"I eventually found the battles too long and redundant, and some of the evil stuff and bullying repetitive and over the top. But I enjoyed the cast very much. The leads had great chemistry and were endearing. Would definitely watch Season 2 because I like them so much."
4,The Uncanny Counter,In an imaginary Korean city murderers are taken over by evil spirits that then feed on the souls of those they murder. Luckily for the world there are a special group of people called counters who with their fighting abilities defeat the spirits releasing the trapped souls and bringing the human to justice. The counters in this city are an eclectic mix all with different special abilities to try to defeat the spirits. When web toons are brought to the screen I believe the stories are often less fluid but this flows really well and is very entertaining with good performances from the entire cast.
5,The Uncanny Counter,"Think its safe to say this is a good series and should be good til the end, acting and story are above average"
6,The Uncanny Counter,"Either I have been extremely fortunate, or there is simply a treasure trove of K-dramas that I have had the pleasure of watching that have simply been superb! Series from ""Mr. Sunshine,"" to ""Descendants of the Sun"" to ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" to ""Crash Landing on You,"" to ""Stranger"" and on and on. I have been exposed to the very best that Korean television has had to offer, and I'm still leaving out many others.On the surface, a viewer may look at this as a sort of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" type series where three individuals (which becomes four) run a Noodle restaurant, but on the side, they're catching demons, i.e. evil spirits. These people are called ""Counters"" as they are imbued with special, superhuman abilities from their ""sponsors"" or ""counterparts"" in Yung (a sort of staging area before moving on to ""heaven.""). To look at this series with those eyes is to short-change it dramatically.Like nearly all great K-drama series, this series is driven by great, and even deep characterizations with a rich story that actually has something to say; how to deal with bullies, both within the school system as well as within the corporate world; those who would prey upon the weak and helpless.Someone once said that evil tends to pervade when good people do nothing to stop it. Many consider this to be even worse than becoming ""evil.""The story centers around Mun, a young high school boy who's suffered untold and unspeakable horrors by losing his parents in an accident and also the physical disabilities that are the result. And yet, he never hesitates to jump in and protect his friends and those who are ""weak."" Where most people would hesitate or not act at all, he doesn't even think about it. He simply acts. And while he can be impulsive and wears his emotions on his sleeve, he is essentially fearless when it comes to doing the right thing.""The Uncanny Counter"" is a testament to the ideal belief that even the smallest person can make a difference. Yes, the Counters have special powers, but they are also only four people going up against a system. Much like Superman who always finds himself in over-his-head against Lex Luthor...someone who uses the power of the system against him.One of the things I love about K-dramas, is that they aren't afraid to allow their characters to demonstrate natural emotions. In this way, we are given deluge of deep, realistic, and relatable characters. We are also usually given something to really think about. In this series, we are presented with the idea that a person doesn't need to have special abilities or super powers in order to do the right thing; that, indeed, one person, no matter how small, can make a difference. It also conveys the truth that no one needs to stand alone. Bullies are cowards. All of them. And they are easily dealt with when people rally together to fight them.All of the performances in this series are fantastically done. Characters that will make you laugh, sniffle, and evoke raw emotion. I suppose there is a reason why I'm far more into K-dramas right now than American shows, which no longer seem to provide me with stories and characters that speak to me. Instead, we're given a barrage of CGI, wooden characters that have virtually no depth at all."
7,The Uncanny Counter,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020/2021 South Korean fantasy, mystery, thriller series with 16, 70 minute, episodes.Set in the fictional city of Jungin in South Korea, a group of Counters are charged with ridding the world of evil spirits. The evil spirits posses human hosts who have either committed murder or are evil to the extent they would be willing to. Being possessed by the evil spirit compels the human host to kill and ""consume"" the spirit of the victim making the evil spirit grow increasingly strong and more difficult to extricate and send on to the spirit realm. The Yung, God like inhabitants in a realm that exists between Earth and afterlife, team with people who are in the half living state of medical coma and allow them to live if they agree to fight the demons. The Counters are not only restored to health but also are given supernatural powers and superhuman strength. Ga Mo-tak (Yoo Jun-sang) is an older male Counter who is much stronger and more forceful than the other counters. As a former detective he is also able to use his investigative skills to hunt down the murdering spirits. Do Ha-na (Kim Se-jeong) has the ability to sense when a human hosting an evil spirit enters the Counter's territory. Choo Mae-ok (Yeom Hye-ran) is able to heal others and as an older woman is motherly and nurturing. To cover their real purpose, the counters run a noodle shop around their busy demon hunting schedule.
In the beginning of the series, there was a fourth Counter Jang Cheol-joong (Sung Ji-ru) but a super powerful Level 3 (Level one being weakest) evil spirit kills him and consumes his spirit. His Yung companion spirit, Wi-gen (Moon Sook) has to quickly find another partner spirit and winds up drawn to and pairing with a young, non comatose, teenager, So Mun (Jo Byung-gyu). This unique pairing leads Wi-gen to believe this young person, who is slightly crippled on one side, has something unique to offer. To convince the young man, the team offers to heal his crippling injury and allow him to talk to his parents who were killed in the car accident that injured him when he was only 11. Soon the team finds that they desperately need the help of this young man who proves to be the most powerful and diverse Counter of them all. As the team fights many battles together, their bound grows into that of a close knit family. They find that tragic events in their past also tie them together and compel them to risk everything to send perhaps one of the most powerful and evil spirits they have ever encountered to the afterlife.Spoilers*. I am a huge fan of supernatural and action dramas. I like strong male and female characters a complex yet easy to follow plot and lots of character development. This series had it all. The main character was such a cute and likable young person it was easy to understand why the group would so quickly and deeply take to him. The action scenes left me wondering if the actors were doing their own stunts because they were amazing and very fluid. There was a little romance sprinkled in although that was in no way a central focus. The central character's growing skill was fun to watch. We were immediately drawn in and hooked to the last scene. It ended well (not sad) and plot points were wrapped up. There will be a second season but do not think that means this one did not wrap up. It stood lone well yet has some elements that would nicely carry to the next season. Highly recommend this series."
8,The Uncanny Counter,"I truly enjoyed this show so much! I usually like to binge-watch my shows, but this one I watched week to week, and its format really worked and kept me interested and excited for every new episode.The premise is interesting and fun, and the characters are just perfect across the board. So Mun is such a perfect protagonist; he is cute and brave and charming in all the right ways so you continually love and root for him the whole time. His ""found family"" is the best mix of characters; the cold but protective Ha Na, the gruff Mo Tak, and the sweet mom-like Ma-Ok make a wonderful group of very watchable character moments. Also a shout out to the over the top character of Jang Mul, who was a total scene stealer!The soundtrack is fun and upbeat/heroic with some beautiful sad songs thrown in for an even toned mix. The cinematography was well rounded, with some very decent and cool special effects. The bad guys are successfully bad without being too over the top (although the end fight definitely gave me those vibes). There were some cringe moments and a few times where the plot felt a bit redundant, but overall this was an extremely enjoyable watch. I would definitely recommend and even watch again!"
9,The Uncanny Counter,"Ok...I am a Canadian white dude and because of the COVID silliness and the sheer lack of western shows I have started looking into some South Korean TV to fill the gap. My goodness, so far it has been a real treat! Korea is getting pretty good at making tv shows! Of course it's all English subtitles for me and some of the unexplained cultural scenes are lost on me, but those are few and far between. I have really enjoyed this show that is over an hour per episode! There is a ton of content here to watch and it was all expertly done for the most part.
Excellent writing is what has made this show so good. The directing and acting is decent too, but it's the writing that far outshines them all!
For entertainment value this show is great so be sure to check it out!"
10,The Uncanny Counter,"At least as good as any demon hunter series from Hollywood. I'm not into K-pop, foreign movies, or any pop for that matter. This doesn't seem to fall into those categories. It may convert me. I'm willing to watch more movies in languages I don't understand just based on the outstanding experience with this series."
11,The Uncanny Counter,"High schooler, Mun, has a new job at the noodle restaurant. It's not so much about serving noodles as it is training to go out and 86 some evil spirits.This is an excellent, action-packed thriller about ""counters"" who hunt down evil spirits. Mun is chosen to be the replacement for a counter who was killed while in the line of duty. He'd been left with a twisted leg from an accident in which his parents died. He is crippled and walks with a brace.When he is brought in to meet the other counters they give him the scoop on what the job entails. I appreciate them establishing some of the ground rules. There's a lot of Dramas that fail to do so, which often creates confusion, or the appearance that they're cheating- coming up with stuff as they go.What is a little confusing here is their strength. For Mrs. Chu: Is she three times as strong as an average man or the average older woman? Also, the way they're able to jump so high seems like more than the average person thrice multiplied. They clearly have different levels of strength to go with their different specialties. The team consists of 4 active fighters and a retired one who handles the funding.The team becomes a family unit. They must work with each other closely in extremely stressful situations. Clear communication and trust are essential to bolster the team's effectiveness.The mother-son relationship that forms between Mrs. Chu and Mun is so sweet. He had lost his parents, and she her son. Therefore, they can help each other.Even though using powers for non-counter situations is prohibited, Mun, whose leg was healed when he became a counter, begins chasing the bullies out of school with his newfound strength and agility. This will get him into trouble eventually.Mun also develops a crush on the pretty, but prickly Ha-na from the first moment she entered his line of sight.Early in the show the team encounters an extraordinarily powerful and rare ""level three"" evil spirit. The more people an evil spirit kills, the more powerful that spirit becomes. Conversely, the more evil the host person was originally, the more compatible the evil spirit will be with the host.After a kill, the evil spirit consumes and traps the victim's soul. Once the counters catch an evil spirit and send him to justice, those souls are released, but if the evil spirit is killed prior to the release, the souls are lost. Their strategy, therefore, is to always catch alive and release the souls.Mun learns the accident that killed his parents was no accident: It was murder. The perpetrator was none other than the 3rd-level evil spirit, whose host was a hitman.Hitman don't act on their own. The backdrop is a corrupt political system from the police to the mayor and beyond. The mayor had ordered the hit on Mun's police detective parents, and also on fellow Counter, and former police detective, Mo-Tak. The attempt on Mo-Tak's life left him in a coma, which is when he was recruited as a Counter. Most of the Counters had been coma patients: They are more willing to accept risks to get back into life, which makes for easier recruiting.Mun and the team start a race to save Mun's parents' souls before it's too late. Meanwhile, the powerful evil spirit starts recruiting his own evil team, making the Counters' jobs all the more challenging. Mun starts showing that his skills as a Counter are far from ordinary......This is yet another K-drama in which every element is excellent: The acting, directing, and writing all work well to advance the story. Special effects are good and support the plot instead of taking over as a centerpiece. The villain is really creepy, and really evil. It's altogether worthy of respect.The writer worked in a few nice set up lines. For instance, when Mrs. Chu announces: ""We won't lose anyone in this photo."" Soon after that..... Well, watch and see. Also, 7 yrs back, Mo-Tak tells Ofr. Jeong, when he insists on going to a dangerous mtg: ""Take your umbrella. I think rain is coming.""In EP 7 there's a crazy fight scene with an original concept. Ha-na has entered Mun's memory of the accident to help him remember more. The evil spirit actually materializes into Mun's memory of him.....and then they fight.......and then they fight while slipping in and out of other places, such as the evil spirit's home, and then back inside the memory......
O. H. M. Y. They should have built on that in one more scene. The concept was too awesome to be left hanging out there as a one-off.It's common for sci-fi fantasy entertainment to run into logical gaps. This shows has some. One of the biggies is: Why don't the evil spirits just bring a gun to the fistfight and drop the counters like wet noodles?? I don't recall them addressing this. Maybe they did. I didn't observe any flaws that were serious enough to affect viewing pleasure.And what a pleasure this shows is! You can count on it.Quote

12,The Uncanny Counter,"This is one if the best shows I have watched. It has everything, action, comedy, drama....
You will keep watching the episodes rooting for the characters to win the battle through all the deep emotions and events of the story.
I really loved it, I hope they make a second season!"
13,The Uncanny Counter,"I really enjoyed watching this one from start to end. I love all the fight scenes. I enjoyed how funny the series is. And, I enjoyed how this series really hits hard when it comes to emotional scenes. To me, that was the icing on the cake. A must watch!!!"
14,The Uncanny Counter,"So Moon is a high school kid who lost his parents in an accident that injured his leg. One day he comes across a group of people who runs a noodle shop in the day and hunt evil spirits in the dark. They are called counters and have special abilities. So Moon unexpectedly becomes a counter and joins the group. There he learns some shocking truth about the death of his parents and together they work towards bringing the culprits to light.It's quite a cameo. This can be put in the crime, horror genre. The show also deals with the life of these four people and shows glimpses of their past. It's actually very watchable and differs from the usual kdramas."
15,The Uncanny Counter,"You know you watch a good series if you have bingewatched 16 series and it felt like just a 2 hours movie. This series is one of that series. This series has it all: drama, action, love, family, friendship and even bromance, something that's rare depicted in Kdrama.Kudos to the screen writers and director, who manage to tie all lose end in the final episode. Even some minors issues that maybe forgotten because it's already 4-5 episodes before, was settled in the end, which give the audience total satisfaction. That's how serious the production team made this series.Definitely 9/10."
16,The Uncanny Counter,"I really enjoy this show, the story is good and the acting is not over the top (the tendency for Korean shows is just that) the main protagonists are well thought out and the thread that runs throughout is not a lesson in morality (again a theme in Korean shows) it's just a good tale that's packed with action"
17,The Uncanny Counter,"I can't even begin to describe how obsessed I am with this show. I'm eagerly anticipating season 2.Some of the bullying scenes were OTT but hey, it's a KDrama. They live for melodrama and I'm here for it.The humour, the action, the romance and drama are all perfect.Highly recommend if you're looking for something fun and dramatic but also deep and emotional at times."
18,The Uncanny Counter,"Oh man, what a fun and adrenaline pumping series! I loved it from start to finish! The story features a mix of human relationships and action, with a (mostly) great script, amazing soundtrack, and decent, yet low key special effects. Heartwarming characters and lots of a-list cameos round out the main cast, and make for a fresh take on the whole ""teenage superhero"" trope. Even the various baddies are well executed, each having their own unique ""flavor"" which sets them apart.Also, special shout outs to Ahn SukHwan and Ok JaYeon. ASH is frequently cast as a villain/antagonist (which he always plays well), but that only made it extra endearing to see him play a rich, eccentric lovebird/mentor this time around. I was tickled every time he made an appearance! :) And as for OJY, she has insanity down PAT! After seeing her in ""Mine"" on Netflix, I am firmly a fan of her amazing acting chops! This show truly has something to appeal to all ages. If they made a second season I would totally watch it! Highly Recommended!"
19,The Uncanny Counter,"I'm sort of new to Korean dramas, so I don't have a lot of experience with these. But I do have some, Memories of the Alhambra being a favorite. I've watched a few others that I've liked also. But this one is, hands down, one of my top 2-3 now. And to think I was avoiding it because there wasn't a lot of fantasy elements to it.The acting is fantastic to be honest. But what's even more is the acting. The acting was top notch, the casting, and their playful banter with each other was so fun. The script was very good also.I highly recommend this show!"
20,The Uncanny Counter,"I mean it's in every show and movie where characters are over the top bawling their eyes out. It's like watching Brazilian soccer players pretend they're hurt. Clearly it's a cultural thing and I'd love someone to explain it, but man, it's distracting. It's amazing none of the characters are completely desiccated after the gallons of water pouring from their eyes."
21,The Uncanny Counter,"The whole series comes across as a revenge p**n against the corrupt Korean society. Moral speeches are held and fingers wagged. Nothing is subtext. On top of that there's some pure EVIL rich kids bullying the protagonist, some evil spirits and a longing for his dead parents, Harry Potter style. Harry Potter is even name-dropped.It's also overacted and overly sentimental at times. With a bit of slapstick comedy - the tone is all over the place. Cliches are abundant, like Kill Bill music playing in action scenes. As a Westerner I roll my eyes.A couple of moving scenes and the playboy chairman Choi (how convenient that he's super rich!) make it a four star show."
22,The Uncanny Counter,"I absolutely love this one
I will be going back to watch it again and again"
23,The Uncanny Counter,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Each episode unravels more and more of the characters with each of them having their own unique life and personality.There are villains, rascals, goodies and baddies then wrap that up with a few evil spirits and a bit of magic - and I'm in. I would not normally watch something like this - and was initially interested in the comic style of the opener. I am glad I gave it a chance. I impatiently wait for the next episode on Netflix each week.Great work by the writer Ji-na Yeo and the director Seon-Dong Yu. And of course the actors who do the script justice."
24,The Uncanny Counter,"Just a highly enjoyable watch, good amount of action, comedy and suspense all round.Loved the characters too, it's one of my favourite shows."
25,The Uncanny Counter,"I don't watch a lot of kdrama because of the influx of romance themes in it but this show is gold, the action scenes are really done well, the plot is addicting.
worth watching"
26,The Uncanny Counter,"In relation to the main story I have no complains: very complete, well executed and captivating.What I did not like was the high-school part. All the violence and bullies are such a cliche and that just doesn't happen in real life so it gave the story a bit of a weird/cringe vibe at times.All in all the series is good and despite the 7/10 I enjoyed it over series with a higher score."
27,The Uncanny Counter,"There are lots of things to love here: you'd think it's just an action TV show, but you'll be pleased with how it fuses the elements of fantasy, crime fiction, and even political drama. The supernatural quality also makes the show stand out with its amusing interpretation of evil spirits and the afterlife. Characters are likable, and their powers are enough to put you at the edge of your seat. Many fighting scenes are just breathtaking, which to me are the highlight of the series. But it's also unavoidable to notice the unnecessarily melodramatic scenes--especially at the last episode, where everything wrapped up and resolved too neatly. It was too good to close the series, but at least it ends on a positive note. Overall an exciting show with some distinctive features, but it could have been less conventional and predictable."
28,The Uncanny Counter,"This drama is so good and fun! and i love the characters esp hana!!! she's the coolest fr! i hope she can find her closure with her family on season 2.. and i can't wait to see the new counter! the story itself is good even if some parts felt repetitive since they keep fighting the same evil spirit, but i enjoyed this a lot! i cried on the last ep when so mun net his parents;( i just can't wait for season 2 i hope they keep changing the villains instead of fighting the same one till the end."
29,The Uncanny Counter,Thoroughly entertaining I love every part of this drama I laughed I cried i screamed .. possibly could have a season 2 but grateful I came across a drama that sucked me in immediately sometimes those are hard to find.
30,The Uncanny Counter,"Except for Sweet Home, another awesome Korean success this has to be one of the best / most enjoyable flicks to watch.
Superb Acting, a couple of jests here and there, Good SFX , not over the top, Great Chemistry between the main casts, likable Characters, and finally, straight forward, simple, story telling.
Looking forward to Season 2 for both this and Sweet Home.Roll on Korea Flicks - Time to binge watch Vincenzo now.
9/10"
31,The Uncanny Counter,"First off, everyone's acting was excellent. It was funny and very lovable. The plot was great. I really can't remember any disappointments. There was character development. I could watch it 100 times and not be tired of it. I recommend for anyone looking for a fun, enjoyable, lovable show with some supernatural stuff."
32,The Uncanny Counter,"Honestly the action in this is incredible, the story is thick with mystery and good plot, the actors are fall in love-able and I've already cried 5 times!! This is a MUST watch for k show lovers!!!"
33,The Uncanny Counter,"Whilst I'm finding the idea of this drama really good I love fantasy shows and the Koreans are really good at it but I really can't stand the school bully's in practically every show that has a school theme there is always some poor kid getting beaten up with no teacher in sight or no action taken if it's found out because the bully is "" rich "" if this is how schools in Korea really work then they have a serious problem they already have the highest rate of teenage suicides in the world and to keep showing teenagers being treated in this way seems to be the norm I've lost count at how many dramas I've watched where children are driven to throw themselves off roofs it's ridiculous I know in this case it's so he can show off his new powers but come on enough already"
34,The Uncanny Counter,"I love this drama. Very unique and interesting to watch. The casts are also amazing. But then after eps12, i felt it going down a bit then i found out the original writer resign after eps12. No wonder it felt a little off but the ending is still worth to watch."
35,The Uncanny Counter,This is a hidden gem and Netflix needs to make sure there is a season 2. The characters and the story line is all awesome
36,The Uncanny Counter,"Had it in my list for a while, finally i thought lets watch an episode and see. To my surprise i was immediately sucked in and liked the main characters and the story and the execution :D."
37,The Uncanny Counter,So good! Well written and superb acting! Everyone was well cast and played their roles to a T! I really liked the interspersed humor. I would love to see another season of this!
38,The Uncanny Counter,"Sounds crazy to say have tissues on standby, when reviewing a action horror show...but this show is so much more...fully fledged alpha male who after watching a certain episode ran to my mother's to tell her how much I loved her.....I can't remember a show playing with my emotions like this one did...its not a horror or an action thriller its just complete...from friendships to relations to life to society to morals to action to violence to tragedy to fighting evil spirits this show has it all literally....and also has an uber cool look to it too..."
39,The Uncanny Counter,The over dramatic acting and constant whining and crying of the lead actor So Moon ruins the whole show.
40,The Uncanny Counter,"Im usually not into these movies with superpowers, but thought i will give it a try. Oh boy this show got me hooked and i couldnt stop watching. It's thrilling and funny at the same time. There's a good balance with all emotions and i definitely can recommend this movie! Loved it!"
41,The Uncanny Counter,I did not enjoy the show. Too many plot holes. The Counters weak tactics is what kept Sin from constantly escaping. But what really annoyed me with the show is Mun constantly crying in every fight. Uncanny Counter is the first Korean series I disliked.
42,The Uncanny Counter,"This show would be a 9/10 if not for all the crying. The main character is such a softy, and yet they try to make him look tough. I can understand him being depressed and grieving, but he cries over and over and over making multiple mistakes. It is a classic Asian sob story they stretch out the sadness too far. I have 2 episodes left and this kid is still crying, which is hampering his ability to get stronger."
43,The Uncanny Counter,"Yep, I said it. This show doesn't willow in teen drama about ""hey, I'm a teen and I have issues"". In others shoes this will carry on for atleast 1000 episodes before the real action starts."
44,The Uncanny Counter,"I was very entertained when watching these episodes! There are lots of feel good times in this series and I like the cast since they just seem to grow on you as each one is different in their abilities and quirkiness but they can get very serious when things get to the extreme danger zones.
Also his classmates the fat guy and the nerdy girl are also funny.
Whenever I see them get picked on, I get mad too.
Overall great series and episodes so far!
Thank you!"
45,The Uncanny Counter,Can't wait for the next episodes. Just wishing I have all the episodes lineup. Can't get enough it's that good.
46,The Uncanny Counter,"Yes, love this!
It was exciting, touching, suspenseful and funny!
I have no criticism at all and hope for a sequel.
Definitely a must watch!"
47,The Uncanny Counter,The heaven looks like from some classic movies they should create something new next time and don't adapt the common.
48,The Uncanny Counter,"This series is extremely over the top, Melodramatic and takes forever to get to the point.I am not sure how people can rate this 8. There is not enough substance to warrant 16 episodes. It just keeps on going round in circles and is too mushy.It seems the writer saw all the good korean show's, The ghost buster movies a lot of fantasy content and came up with this. It's highly amateurish and the only way to get through the show is to skip major portions of it."
49,The Uncanny Counter,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!! I've watched a ton of korean series and no matter how much I loved them there would almost always be moments where I felt the show was dragging the episode a bit. That was NOT the case with Uncanny Counter! I loved every single second of it!The story is done in such a way that even if the superpower/spirits element is not your cup of tea, you'll still like it! It doesn't get too complicated and I found the writting quite grounded even with that element mixed in.Oh my god, where do I even begin with the acting? AMAZING! I loved every character of the main crew, their writting was so good and human and adored every interaction between them. The actors did an absolutely amazing job!The visuals and the music of the show is also great and memorable and there is a particular song that is actually written and sang for the show from the actress Kim Sejeon (Do Ha-na in the show) which is absolutely breathtaking and adds so much to the scenes it is played!I recommend this show to absolutely everyone!"
50,The Uncanny Counter,"Like every goddamn k-drama i have ever watched in my entire life. They want to make the series as long as possible. In returned, it becomes unwatchable. The story got drag for so long, i don't even know what happened before the episode that i currently watching at that time. Boring. Also, making the MC cooler does not make the series better, romance does not make the story better, dear every korean directors ever. It will only look desperate. If it works, the it must be k-drama stick suckers."
51,The Uncanny Counter,"Well i binge watched the 8 episodes that have been released so far, and man this is so good. 7.5 rating doesn't do justice to this kdrama, it deserves a 10 or atleast a 9"
52,The Uncanny Counter,"Cannot fault this series honestly. I watch a lot of kdrama and some take a few episodes to get good, some are really promising at first and then just get repetitive, others have a few episodes in the middle that start to drag or there's those that are good all the way up until a disappointing end. This drama doesn't fit into any of those categories because it stays consistently amazing all the way through. The storyline is gripping and develops well as everything begins to tie in together. Acting is on point. There is the perfect combination of humour, action and emotional scenes. The characters compliment each other well and it is great to see their characters develop and relationships with each other build. I love that the ending left it open for a season 2 which I would most definitely watch."
53,The Uncanny Counter,"I'm not gonna waste your time with a lot of words here. 6 episodes in.
The show is really good; characters are likeable and well developed, story is fun, mystery is unraveling at a good pace. It's just what I needed.
I've been watching too much stuff with characters going through one existential crisis after another and it's so tiresome. This show doesn't take itself too seriously and I LOVE that.
It's funny and emotionally compelling. I just love it to death (no pun intended).
I'm stoked that I'm watching it after it was all released so I can binge watch and forget my troubles. 😂"
54,The Uncanny Counter,Spoiler alert. When Mun's leg was healed they said they can only do that because he was a counter but she healed the students broken bones anyway. When he tried to summon Sin (supposedly they are 3x stronger than humans and inside their territory which makes it 5x) and then a small kid tackles him? I could be nitpicking but these small details are important. It felt like they were extending it or poor execution of a plot twist.
55,The Uncanny Counter,"It was so good.Finally i've watched an amazing supernatural drama.
I'm now so happy because season 2 is coming!"
56,The Uncanny Counter,The show would've gotten a 8 if Mun wasn't crying and whining every scene he gets... It gets really annoying and too loud.
57,The Uncanny Counter,Love it so far i like the action and how fast paced it is and I like the comedy 😄
58,The Uncanny Counter,"I honestly enjoyed every bit of the uncanny counter, the cast are amazing and it's literally cringe free which is rare in kdramas. Great acting great plot and storyline so i'd def recommend it."
59,The Uncanny Counter,"I have rather mixed feelings on the show. Not a bad series to watch if you can focus on the relationship aspect of the drama. The last episode, rather, was a brilliant end to So-mun's struggle with blaming himself for his parents' death. I loved the end when it showcased the inner dilemma of the main cast, when he saved his parents and yet it was a struggle to speak out despie him loving and missing his parents after 7 years. The film captured the idea of friendship well and So-mun's upright character in his behaviour in school and even towards his bullies.Like many Korean dramas out there, it is quite a shame that the show allocated a lot of its scenes towards the action (of course, it's an action drama after all). However, the action scenes aren't well filmed, especially when it is coupled with CGI-backed psychokinesis. Many of those are also a repetition of 'when main cast A is about to die, main cast B jumps in to save him' and back-and-forth. One major downside of the show is its predictability, as anyone can probably tell from the start that the main lead will definitely be the one who is going to defeat the main antagonist and save his parents at the end. There are quite a number of flaws regarding how the action scenes are constructed as well - especially in the last episode, two of the main cast were on the verge of being punched to death, and yet could get up rather effortlessly to stop a van driving downhill. In other words, the action scenes, the logic behind how the counters carry out their ""battles"" and the general plot could use some improvements.If you are in it for the action, you would want to consider watching something else. If not, the message of the show and how it showcased the raw emotions of the characters and the relationships built around them are really enjoyable."
60,The Uncanny Counter,"Don't know where to start honestly. The story is perfectly put together, from the flashbacks to all the different story archs for each character. The acting is from a high standard with each of the actors giving us a perfect play.The visuals are strong, sometimes a bit on the 'fake' spectrum tho, but that is not so bothering. The fighting scenes are long, but well thought out and add to the story. They could've dialed a bit back on the high school bullying part, but after the first couple episodes that issue is done for.All in all a great action packed drama for all the lovers of 'magical powers' and people who are looking for new series to binge-watch. I HIGHLY recommend you guys give it a try!"
61,The Uncanny Counter,A good storyline with promise and some great acting. Let down midway just to add a whole lot of unnecessary drama. Looks like the the director wanted to make lemonade with watermelons midway. Why screw an interesting plot with lengthy unwanted draggy mash up of emotions. If only the director stuck with the plot. This would be 10 stars .
62,The Uncanny Counter,"I had to write a review for this show, since the show isn't that big outside of South Korea, but more people should watch it!I assume this is because it's in korean and not english, but after 1 episode you'll have adjusted to it being in Korean, and as a bonus the Korean language is beautiful.It is great, really great. Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect and it's not the best show ever made. It has it's flaws. Certain things here and there that doesnt make that much sense, and the first episode was in my opinion not that good compared to the rest of the show. It felt off and frankly a little gringe and weird, but the other 15 episodes were fantastic.The action/fight scenes and visual effects are great, but the story and characters are what made the show special to me. It's a drama, but it's suprisingly funny as well.
The actors did a very good job and there's a real chemistry between all of them.You won't be disapointed watching it, and should definitely give it a watch, it's worth every minute of spend."
63,The Uncanny Counter,"What this series does so well that many fail to do is tell a story well.In this series, we are introduced to complex characters and their motivations, fears, loves, losses. Each of the main characters is clearly fleshed out by the end of the series and that's what makes their successes and development so enjoyable. We aren't just expected to like them because they're conventionally good looking, we are presented with characters who are real. What many Korean dramas do is that they focus solely on young characters, and though our main protagonist is in high school, this does not take away from the complexities and the development that we get to see in the older characters, especially in Ms. Chu (I highlight her particularly because too many films and series will neglect the competent roles of women who aren't in their twenties).With well thought out twists and turns the story unfolds as the team works to catch evil spirits, but also fight against unjust city officials in Jungjin. If you're looking for a show that doesn't shy from the evils of people while also holding up the power of meaningful supportive relationships, this is for you."
64,The Uncanny Counter,"I could write a whole essay on how every aspect about the is show is great, but I'm just going to leave at this... Please, if you're reading, do yourself a favor and go watch it, because I'm sure you won't regret it. It's probably the best thing I have ever watched in my whole life. It's unique, so full of sentiment, funny, tense, and can even get scary sometimes. So you have it all, combined with great loving characters that will make your heart melt with their soulful ways... and OMG what an ending. Anyway, it's fantastic and I can't stress it enough ."
65,The Uncanny Counter,The series is not bad overall but what makes it really special is Yeaom Hye-ran portrayal of the protective team leader. She's sweet and powerful and oddly believable as a seasoned demon Hunter with a heart of gold. I am glad I didn't miss this show.
66,The Uncanny Counter,"Loved the concept. Watched 10 episodes. Enjoyable, fun, creative.But my head hurts from all the crying - nah, wailing and bawling - and screaming.Maybe it's cultural, but I haven't seen this much screaming in any of the 20-something Korean shows I've watched. It's farcical.All this crying doesn't create drama. Instead, it's annoying and disturbing. ""Skip ahead"" has become my fav button on this show, which is a shame. Some otherwise fantastic scenes are massively annoying to watch because the characters are bellowing, screeching and howling every. Single. Step. Of. Their. Way. Argh!!!To be honest, the bad guys' storyline is more interesting to watch because they don't cry at a drop of a hat, like the good guys."
67,The Uncanny Counter,"It is such a good series, it has a good storyline, and it keeps us on edge, the movie also has an amazing mix of genres, action, politics, mystery, crime, drama, and a tad bit of romance"
68,The Uncanny Counter,"Wow! I don't feel like writing up a huge text, but damn that I loved that show. I had a hard time following the political plot toward the end of the series but overall it was an awesome show.I liked the music and the character development. I would've like more Parkour scenes and some explanations of Mun's power though.I can't wait for a season 2!!"
69,The Uncanny Counter,"I really loved the story it doesnt make you bored after 10 episodes or such. Goodies, baddies, the superior and love lines it was a fun scifi to watch. However, the acting from main actor 'somun' was painful and irritating time to time. His clingy ""noo""s and long cries and yelling were pretty annoying during the season. I rated it as 7 as i really disliked the acting from main actor. Yet the story was great to watch."
70,The Uncanny Counter,Wow this show is great and I hope they have a Season 2. I got tired of watching American shows and wanted something different and came across this via Netflix. Other than the subtitles I had to read this show was worth it.The action and special affects are great. I hope to see more episodes in the future.
71,The Uncanny Counter,I didn't want it to end.Great story and the Uncanny Counter characters are so lovable..just wished they were creative with the uniform
72,The Uncanny Counter,"I have enjoyed Uncanny Counter so far. The only thing wrong to me is the emotions sometimes seem to put of place. This does not happen all the especially in the latest episode when Mrs. Chu almost died or probably in the 12 episode after the detective is found in her car. Like I said before though, some acting was just too over the top. Though this happens sometimes it is still a good show. I enjoy watching the characters created and then five together always makes me laugh somehow. I hope anyone who reads this just tries the show out."
73,The Uncanny Counter,"1 episode was good then 234 also seems good then i bored 😴 not interesting time wasting
😔😔"
74,The Uncanny Counter,"I must say that I only saw few Kdramas in my life - not about the actors/actress nor the language barriers but because of their great acting they have been showing intense drama sequence that I hardly handle... most of the time I got carried away! So, I am very mindful of what to see and binge myself into. The genre and theme matters for me! I want to see a combination of action, drama, and comedy all in the same place. This is why I love this series so much!! It delivers what I am looking for and it doesn't fail to give a hint of suspense and thriller - the actors/actresses are amazing... congratulations! This is the kind of entertainment I love to see."
75,The Uncanny Counter,"I got an imdb account just to leave a review for this to put it at a more deservable spot than 7.1
The show may try to push for waterworks one too many times, but the story is enjoyable and it has some good action mixed in as well. I've seen up to episode 6 at this point and so far, I would recommend it. There are too many trash shows out nowadays so gotta at least give kudos to the ones that are worth a watch."
76,The Uncanny Counter,"It's like Korean Men In Black, but everyone has powers and you're always crying10/10 - Season 2, let's get it"
77,The Uncanny Counter,"This show hits me right in the feels, starting with So Mun. He starts off with a crippled leg that he received from a horrible car accident that took his parents lives. (I won't spoil too much).Despite that So Mun always wears a smile on his face. Living with his grandparents, his grandmother has a mental illness often forget that her daughter died and sometimes mistaking So Mun for her.The genius behind So Mun abilities and the chemistry that all of the characters have feels very real.I love Ha-Na, Go Mo Tak and Ms.Chu. Let's not forget
That rich old man, their sponsor. This show has so many heart moving moments.I was invested the entire time from the corruption within the So Mun school, to the corrupted police force and politics. I never wanted to leave this setting, this brilliantly created world.Every episode was great and even still 20 just isn't enough. This show is more than a gem, so enjoy it."
78,The Uncanny Counter,"This binge worthy series is fabulous. The idea a the red string of fate tying everything together is handled in the best of ways...clues are found, pieces of the mystery are logically put together without being forced in an unnatural way. The chemistry between this strong cast of characters is clear from the start. But be warned, once you start you'll want to watch it to the end without stopping. And though all things work out in the end, have tissues ready. It was a really fun watch."
79,The Uncanny Counter,"I'm a language nerd who discovered Korean less than a year ago. I enjoy hearing the Korean language. The culture was brand new to me and is an added element in any Korean film. I have begun a few that were just too trite, or thinly plotted to make me go back after one episode. In this one, the main characters are well enough realized and sympathetic enough to make me care about them; the premise is novel enough that I hung in through the second episode.The show is a far cry in suspense and plot from the police/mystery videos I normally gravitate to (""Live"", ""Mr. Sunshine"" ""Voice""), but the likable characters and odd premise (very small group endowed with superpowers improbably arrayed against evil beings of unspecified number, likewise endowed) is interesting enough so far. With only two episodes out as yet, it's hard to tell if the writers will be able to maybe deepen the plot or produce some other element of interest to keep me watching."
80,The Uncanny Counter,"Its been a long time since I've seen a program that is as good as this, something which has made me incredibly happy and sad throughout the program.I convinced my 71 year old grandmother to watch this, she is quite open to world cinema and she couldn't get enough!If you can't tolerate subtitles, please give it a go!I can't wait for season 2."
81,The Uncanny Counter,One of my favorite discoveries in recent memory... This show is the first time in a long while that i have felt obsessed with a series.
82,The Uncanny Counter,"One of the best kdrama, if not the best of its kind. Enough said."
83,The Uncanny Counter,Been watching it lately during the holidays with my family. We love this series especially the characters.
84,The Uncanny Counter,"I wasn't honestly expecting anything from this Kdrama, never thought this would be my top tier favorite after watching it. The cast is really good, and portrays their characters very well. Every episode is exciting. I definitely got attached with the counters' relationship as they are very heartwarming to watch. :)"
85,The Uncanny Counter,Sejong is very good actor. She is the rising star now. This will show you the great counter team.It very good for who love action.
86,The Uncanny Counter,Not gonna lie. Its a cheesy tv series and this is what makes it amazing. The cast performs well including the supporting casts. Its like these guys had been working together for so long and it reflects in the show.Its basically a story about friendship and family and if you want a feel-good series then this is for you.
87,The Uncanny Counter,New ideas and Outstanding Directing.. Good choise for actors
88,The Uncanny Counter,"I initially thought this was going to be another action series loaded with martial arts and fight scenes. This show is so much more than that. Sure it has it's fair share of action but what really got me was the personal connections the main character Mun has with his team, his family and his best friends. This goes deep into the feelings of each and how important they are. In the emotionally charged scenes the acting was so genuine I literally cried. I was caught off guard by this show and I can't say enough how I've enjoyed it. Even when trying to explain some of the dynamics between Mun and say his grandmother for instance, I fell apart due to the fact I had the same experience with my grandmother as she was passing. This looks into relationships of all sorts and the complicated web we weave in trying to be acknowledged, loved, guarded, vulnerable and accepted. The story line is solid with great twists and turns, the right amount of comedy and action as to not be campy and the acting is superb. I highly recommend it!"
89,The Uncanny Counter,The best!!! I cant wait to see other episodes... I feel emotional when i watch this... The best the best the best
90,The Uncanny Counter,"This drama was so good, you guys must to watch this"
91,The Uncanny Counter,"I really love all of the actors, they really fit with their characters. I love the story, the fighting scenes, the humors, the line, the crying scenes. I love all of them!! Especially the OSTs!!! Omg. Must watch. Watch it! It's gonna be the decision of your life. 😉"
92,The Uncanny Counter,"This show is so good! Everyone should definitely watch this. The cast is very well-fit to their characters. Good execution of actions and emotions. Great job for the director and producers! Though they revised some scenes from the webtoon, they did it so well that the viewers are enjoying it so much. Maybe that's the reason why they have high ratings in Korea. WATCH THIS NOW!!!"
93,The Uncanny Counter,"Worth to watch it every episode. The plot, the acting, the evil spirit all are amazing! Fantasy but funny. Scary but Sad."
94,The Uncanny Counter,"The drama is great. Recomended. I love it
Kim sejeong😍😍😍😍"
95,The Uncanny Counter,Overall. I really like this drama. all actor and actris realy did great. Kim Sejong your acting very amazing. love you😍
96,The Uncanny Counter,"When this show first came out, I put it off for a few weeks because I wasn't sure this was a show for me. It showed up a lot so I decided to give it a go. Man, I wasn't disappointed at all. This is easily one of my top 3 K-drama! I'm sad it's gonna end soon, but at the same time I'm very curious to what will happen next. This is an excellent show!"
97,The Uncanny Counter,"This drama is so addicting, yeah i'm addicted to this drama and i can't wait to see if there is season 2. please have a season 2 of this drama, this drama is not like any other drama that have romance, it have more actions. i hope there is a season 2 of this drama where So-Mun and Ha-Na have a thing hahahhaha. IT IS REALLY THE BEST DRAMA I HAVE WATCHED <3 <3 <3"
98,The Uncanny Counter,"Really like the characters emotional honesty. Just don't get that in western productions as it would somehow be seen as un cool. Good action, funny and a well placed story."
99,The Uncanny Counter,"I love this kdrama. The actors are amazing and to those new to the kdrama world not all kdramas involve over the top cheesy romances. There are plenty kdramas out there involving psychological thrillers, suspense etc...you just got to put in the effort of giving these shows a chance. Don't let the kpop fangirls ruin it for you even their idols have a hard time keeping up with these kids demands and yes even the American fangirls are unbelievably awful to these groups. I don't blame the groups I blame the fans. I love the clean storylines in kdramas and the creativity and how they don't beat a story to death for years on end unlike American shows."
100,The Uncanny Counter,"In my opinion the only thing missing was some romance between Mun and Ha-na :)
Overall it's a good serie that's worth a watch."
101,The Uncanny Counter,"This show is awesome.
The action is out of expected and wordbuilding is super interesting.
Every characters even protagonist and antagonist have their own stories. It is not only a thriller movie but displays several aspects of the society, espcially environment. It is worth you every second."
102,The Uncanny Counter,I loved this one!!! Its literally a masterpiece!!!! Like i started it on Tuesday and finished it by Wednesday night around 2 am im literally obsessed the actors played their character really amazingly they portrayed the script so incredible!!!! Definitely in my top 5 list
103,The Uncanny Counter,"After watching this series 'The uncunny Counter' i can't enjoy watching any other drama nor movie, i want season 2....Please!!!!"
104,The Uncanny Counter,"Got addicted to the drama and binged watched it!!
Loved the entire drama, characters played their role well
Storyline was unique and outstanding!!
Ending was also beautiful
I would rate this drama a 100000/10 if I could
Best drama I've watched so far!!!"
105,The Uncanny Counter,"Wow
How bloody good is this program, you will laugh, cry, get angry and even a little scared in this rollercoaster ride of emotions that you don't want to miss.
What really got me was the fantastic story (not expected) and the chemistry between the main characters all of whom deserve great credit for their performances.
Do yourselves a favour and watch this now you won't regret it."
106,The Uncanny Counter,"This series is very thrilling, would give you a roller coaster ride of emotions. I love the main characters, each one of them are different yet at the same time you would feel as if they were bonded by blood. The flow of the story was also quite unexpected even if I've already watched a lot of kdramas before. Definitely a must watch kdrama series!"
107,The Uncanny Counter,"The main character's just a high school student which makes him admirable knowing he's got such a huge responsibility and pressure on his shoulders. He is definitely a cry baby which screams maknae a LOT lol it makes sense that he cries a lot as the poor kid had a traumatic childhood and had to endure everything at such a young age. But i think Mun being the maknae and ace at the same time adds such a cute touch (and a huge asset) to the counters as a whole. I felt like the way So Mun made the other counters' life brighter wasn't talked about much. And seeing So Mun grow up to be such a responsible boy made me proud of him. Some people only see So Mun as the whiny kid who cries every episode but honestly if I was in his shoes I'd probably not just cry every ep but go mad as well lmao. This kid is admirable, and definitely one of my favorite main characters."
108,The Uncanny Counter,I loved the acting and writing! I also really loved the characters and I also appreciated that there wasn't as much romance as a lot of other kdramas have cause that stuff is really boring/annoying imo. It has a lot of emotional scenes so I cried like 3 times while watching 1 of the episodes so prepare tissues😅
109,The Uncanny Counter,"This was a really fun show to watch. It's actually pretty similar to shonen anime and is full of superpowered battles. Many scenes are quite intense, and there are even some more serious emotional moments as well. Overall, this not a masterpiece by any means but is definitely worth watching for the great characters and super fun action scenes."
110,The Uncanny Counter,"I had a look at the rating before watching, I thought I would enjoy it since it's 7.6. And oh boy was I wrong.
The actions were so awkward and fake, the way they fought were almost harmless to their enemy. And I know they are super fast and strong, that's why they run instead of driving a car or riding a bike to avoid attentions or to save energy. But do they have to fight WITHOUT any proper weapons beside their fists? And don't get me started on those ridiculous red track suits, what kind of attack can that block?! Being 2 or 3 times stronger than normal human doesn't mean you should run thoughtlessly to danger without anything to fight them and to protect yourself. They are strong, yes, but their enemies are also strong. The whole fight scene is a child's play!! The plot was quite interesting and that was the only reason I put myself through the 1st episode. Finally, almost every production of South Korea that involves high school students, is addressing the bullying situation. I hope that the reality isn't as bad or the government really should do something about it."
111,The Uncanny Counter,"I like watching series that give you a good feeling. This series definitely does, i also like the humor in this series, its simple and still innocent a fresh breeze in these troubled times.
I enjoyed watching the series and can't wait till netflix puts on the new season."
112,The Uncanny Counter,"Great action, campy humor, addictive plot, excellent character building. You kinda need this show in your life to believe there's hope in taking down bad guys, especially corrupt politicians 😷 ahem, pardon my cough."
113,The Uncanny Counter,I love it so much this series hope this will have part 2. I love the stories from the start he's bullying catching the evil spirit
114,The Uncanny Counter,"I was going to delete my Netflix account and then...
I stumbled upon this. Why is this show uncanny? Well...it strays away from Hollywood (why else would it have so few ratings, & such a high rating?).Why hide this Netflix? I've gotten so bored of you. This show reminds me of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", but in South Korea. Way more in depth than Buffy, no doubt. I guess the demon slaying makes the connection, but I don't know why it reminds me of potentially the best show of the 90s. Could it be the badass fight scenes? The ambiance of a dusty library or delicious noodle shop? Maybe it's just that great.I think I've only written one review on IMDb until now. This show is that amazing, yet I never have time to write reviews. I don't know why it's nostalgic, that is uncanny...maybe it grew on me too fast and I need to rewatch it again?Does anybody read these anyway?"
115,The Uncanny Counter,Ok level with me. I'm a 42 year old Australian man and I'm only on episode three but I had to leave a review because it's that good. I'm not a huge fan of foreign films but this has a great story with some good feel good moments. There are some classic cheesy 'Korean film' moments but it doesn't matter. The acting overall is believable and good. I'm loving it so far.

232,The School Nurse Files,""" The School Nurse's Files "" was pretty quirky. It was like a magical realism book that you read and you don't know what's happening most of the time. But the main reason why I'm rating this with six stars out of ten is because the story felt rushed and unfinished. If this one has a second season, then the drama will probably worth seven stars for me. However, for this one, the story had potential, but it was moving too fast and a few things were actually explained, making things hard to follow and confusing.Other than that, the CGI were really good and didn't ruin the drama at all. The performances were also spot on, something that could have destroyed it, as the plot is pretty character centered.So, overall, six out of ten."
233,The School Nurse Files,"There is nothing to enjoy about this outside of CGI visuals. No story, no plot, no tension, nothing really funny even though it tries to be quirky. Pretty boring as I found myself on multiple occasions hitting the fast forward."
234,The School Nurse Files,"Bizarre and psychedelic, and not in an interesting way, I will not write a lot about the plot or the storyline, whatever it is, there is no content or any story, no explanation, no background and no sense. The acting is below the amateur level, it is drawn through a kind of theatrical-psychedelic - vague - uninteresting - bizarre approach. All in all if it weren't for those good visual effects this would be for one star."
235,The School Nurse Files,"This may be the weirdest series I have ever watched, overtaking shows like The Mighty Boosh and Legion, which were bizarre but had the advantage of either pure comedy or interesting plots to help them along. This show was just bizarre with absolutely no rhyme or reason. There is no plot, it is just 6 episodes that have random bits of story thrown together. Literally nothing is explained, ever.
I did find the characters interesting, which is the only reason this even gets a 4. It's extra disappointing because I think I would have loved a full, fleshed out version of this show with an actual plot line and character development. Also this series did have a fire soundtrack, and the design of some of the ""jelly's"" was really cool looking and fun to look at. However some of the ""jelly's"" took away from otherwise emotional moments, making people blow up into puffy jelly versions that were terrifyingly weird to look at.
Overall this was unfortunately a waste of an original concept/idea, and ultimately a waste of my time. Disappointing."
236,The School Nurse Files,"If you dont think Korean culture is not different ,then, this little show will change your mind.It is the definition of quirkyThe dubbing is quite goodThis over acted like a K-pop video and monsters are funIf you can get through the first episode you will love the rest."
237,The School Nurse Files,The animation style is rather trashy but the overall style of the show is quite fresh and outstanding. Personally I had problems getting into this show. The story seemed kinda random to me and things didn't really get explained. For me it was a bit too scatty.
238,The School Nurse Files,"Certainly meant to be bizarre in a fun way, but instead is bizarre in a ""makes no sense"" way. Somehow there is opportunity in this mess, too bad it was missed."
239,The School Nurse Files,"I have only seen the first 2 episodes, but I don't remember such a funny, crazy, entertaining, original series in years! I hope it gets a second season!Reminds me of Wonderfalls (TV Series 2004).and a bit like Reaper (2007)"
240,The School Nurse Files,"I like it. This's my first time watching korean drama and i love it; the story, the CGI , and other. But it's not that special seriesI really like ahn eun-young character and the girl always in ahn eun-young's room
With an 6 eps it's really worth and fun to watch."
241,The School Nurse Files,It's weird but really fun to watch.Maybe this series is not for everybody but its work for me.
242,The School Nurse Files,"I have to admit, I was confused as many while watching the first episode. Definitely quirky. Definitely not mainstream. Designed for the older tween market.Things didn't come together for me until I drew parallels with another quirky show, the 2017-19 series Legion. Then it all came together and made sense. Had the first episode explained the source of the superpowers giving only certain people the ability to see 'jellies', no one would have been lost. For me, it was simple, the protagonist derived her superpowers from schizophrenia, as did her opponents.My understanding is this program was based on books which may not have have had this intent, but providing different explanations. That wasn't brought out, so I prefer my interpretation. The story held together beautifully from that point forward.I can't say that this program was as well produced as Legion. Then again, they were produced for different markets. I wouldn't recommend this for a younger audience. They would just get conceptually lost. On the other hand, if you were a fan of Legion, you would love this. Many should pass this by if they are just looking for unchallenging pap.I only gave this a 6 because one simple line explaining the source of the abilities to see jellies was missing causing what I believe to be massive confusion. That said, I was highly entertained and look forward to a second season."
243,The School Nurse Files,If your into mind bending weird stuff than this is for you! The acting is top notch and the story is very original! I want too say more but than i would be giving stuff away. Go check it out now if your reading reviews its very very strange but i love every minute of the weirdness!
244,The School Nurse Files,"My wife is Korean, after we went through all six episodes together I was quite confused and asked her if there is some Korean culture things in this show that I don't understand. She said nope it is just weird and it's meant to be this way.
It's indeed really weird but at the same time kind of interesting and keep you hooked if you can at least make to episode 3. I do like some of the art direction. It's really not my kind of show and I can understand some people will just go ""what the heck is this?"" and change to another show, but if this is your kind of genre I guess you will really like it."
245,The School Nurse Files,"Visually it's very pretty but sadly i find that the story line wasn't told very well, meaning there were some parts that were lacking a bit or didn't make sense, but overall still okay. Still i'd recommend watching because the CGI Team did a fantastic job!"
246,The School Nurse Files,"Netflix actually had it in English audio which is good cause I don't have to read captions. However, what the heck am I watching?"
247,The School Nurse Files,The storyline was fresh not as always leads falling i love. They also gave some important social messages if you focused you must know. It was a bit confusing but yup i loved it. The message of this series was good unlike other kdramas
248,The School Nurse Files,This is quite interesting that the genre is like shamanism fantasy school drama. But it is also boring after the first episode because it is slow paced drama and not so much detailed explanation in the story. It just assume people to guess or ignore. I just wished this came out as a movie not a series.
249,The School Nurse Files,Its so refreshing and new and just Simply entertaining. Watched this in one go :D Too bad that there art only six épisodes but totally worth To watch :D
250,The School Nurse Files,"Started pretty funny, fantasy/supernatural and a bit quirky is just my cup of tea; but then it drags down like mud. Lost my temper and kept FFWD. Playing on mute watching this it's just boring and nonsensical. The weird music and very slow shots are a mismatch and therefore cinematically out of place. Interesting technics don't make interesting cinema, IMO. Could have been fun, just too bad it wasn't for me.."
251,The School Nurse Files,"It's a wacky, funny, emotional and action packed wild ride... Well, at least the first episode was, after that it devolves into something much tamer, and focuses too much on small high-school issues rather than a big issue like the first episode did.I didn't expect it to retain the same level of fun as the first episode did, just wanted something at least close to it, and sadly it wasn't.Still, it was wholesome and funny many times afterwards so I'd say its a good show, although the ending was a mess and I felt like it needed more episodes to explain a bit more what was going on."
252,The School Nurse Files,Intriguing drama with all the trappings of how we love to hate high school.
253,The School Nurse Files,"6 episodes will pass like nothing if you get hooked in from the first ep. Great cast and an interesting setting are overshadowed with some rushed storyline (i guess ill have to read the novel its based on). However, I am more than excited to see the next season (if it gets the greenlight) as everything is pretty much set up for another exciting season. You will realise the 6 hour-long episodes are frankly less than enough to really complete anything this show aims to do (which you can feel by the rushed storyline) and this also made me feel the later episodes to be ""too slow"". However, if you feel a knack for weird things and colorful jellies this show is definitely something to look out for on netflix!"
254,The School Nurse Files,"I give rating for CG and performer only.
Story , timeline and background are bad.
Don't have reason for add charactors and conclusion such as english teacher, basketball student, bad teacher and old friend."
255,The School Nurse Files,I really like nam joo hyuk that's why I watch this drama. But the plot is so bad it is like cartoon. U should respect the actor and actress.
256,The School Nurse Files,This one sticks out. I personally do not mind slow drawn out story as long as they present it well and this one checks the box.
257,The School Nurse Files,"Trailer pops up out of nowhere on my netflix.'The world is in fact full of jelly creatures, and there's this pretty nurse who fight the jelly monsters with a toy sword and a toy gun? wow'.It pumps me up with its creative approach to an original worldview.Decent actings,
Fine CG's,
The attractive ambience,
The charm of the originality of this worldview..This show has every element to possibly make a huge international fan base. I give you that.But there are too many unnecessarily long scenes, and that spoils everything.I watched all six episodes wishing to find what I felt from its trailer but it never happened.'Such a shame' is all I can say on this show.Perhaps cutting down the running time of episodes to 40m is the way to save this show."
258,The School Nurse Files,One of the freshest and best mixes of fantastical and the mundane
259,The School Nurse Files,"Why Did It Have TO Be Just 6 Episodes Atleast Would Have Been A Good One I Just Felt It Ended Too Soon Anyways A Very Nice Series The Acting Of Miss Ahn Eun-Young Was Fantastic I Really Loved Her Facial Expressions And The Way She Acted Was Superb I Really Loved The Way She Gets surprised And The Way She Reacts In A Very Cold Way It's Just Awsome,Superb,Fantastic I Really Loved iT....And Mr.Hong Was Good As Miss Young ....Mr Hong Was As I Felt Was A shy One But When He Met Miss Young Everything Changed And I Really Liked That Concept It Was So Good To See Both Of Them Falling In Love Without Realising It....I Could Really Feel It That's How Good Was The Series I Loved It...Cheeers
Just Waiting For Season 2"
260,The School Nurse Files,"There are lots of things to look at. Starts off visually and stylistically stunning. OST is quite interesting too. However there are two major issues with the series.One - lack of suspense. The show lacks any real suspense. The stories don't have you wanting more or have you wonder. Instead it is a bit of a drag. ""Things just happen, often without a sense of urgency or any suspense""(with the exception of ep 1)Two. First episode sets the bar, then rest of the episodes couldn't come close to it,
even in terms of visuals and style. It gets duller and duller stylistically and contents wise. In conjunction with the lack of suspense the episodes feel dragged out and slow paced.It could have been a stylish and entertaining, but the creators could only catch on of the two rabbits."
261,The School Nurse Files,"The world is super interesting, but it wasn't a good way to tell the story. It seems they tried to reduce the number of episodes, not explaining a lot of stuff. Anyway, I liked the main caracter and she is the only reason I finished the drama."
262,The School Nurse Files,"Have you ever had the perfect ingredients and ended up dinner because you messed up the instructions?
I feel they did the same to this drama. I don't hate it. I actually love it. It has all the things that I love, most of all the idea and the story were so good. Recently there is a trend in Kdrama where 97percent of the focus is on how much more perfect the actors can be and the aesthetics. While the story takes a backseat.
From the actors to the characters everything was superb but, they messed it up while putting it all together.
So many jump cuts? And gaps in the story that most of the plot does not work, it atleast half of it is Missing.
They tried to put too much in too little space which made the ingredients soggy and bland."
263,The School Nurse Files,"I honestly loved this drama so much it was unique and refreshing and a little bit very weird, I feel like it itched a scratch I didn't even know I had. Some people might complain that the plot and background wasn't very well explained but I actually really liked it like that because this whole series felt like a dream to me."
264,The School Nurse Files,"I love Nam Joo-hyuk, but his last two roles, Bride of Habaek/Bride of the Water God and this was the absolute worst. The drama was just plain weird and made no sense. I don't know if they were going for a live anime, but it did not work. Whomever is choosing these roles for him need to be fired and he has to revamp his career, because it's going down hill. Still hoping for great work from him."
265,The School Nurse Files,It's interesting and unique series and I enjoy it. I hope there will be second season.
266,The School Nurse Files,"OMG I absolutely love this show! I have read many mangas, and watched animes of this genre. I've always imagine what it would be like if those were made into live version with real people. And here it is! Many people said it is weird and they can;t understand the story line but I felt head over heel! It make absolute sense to me. The story line was clear but people might be distracted by weird looking spirits and jellies. They might also have an expectation of a typical Korean drama and this is extraordinary! I wish Netflix can introduce more shows of this genre in the future! And I need a season 2 pleaseee"
267,The School Nurse Files,It is visually stunning! I also love the message in the movie. :)
268,The School Nurse Files,The story has got no head or tail.Extremely disappointed.
269,The School Nurse Files,Really enjoyed the series. It was fun and interesting. My only complaint is there weren't more episodes.
270,The School Nurse Files,"If you have been watching kdramas for years and started to get bored, this one will fee like a fresh breath. It is quirky, weird, the characters are not your usual perfect clean brushed heroes we see in dramas. The awkwardness is awesome, the OST too. 6 episodes are too short !"
271,The School Nurse Files,"My master's degree was in Fantastic Literature and I totally loved this drama because expresses everything that we can see in this genre. It's just incredible. It was just my cup of tea and surprisingly enlightening.
Excellent drama with amazing actors by the way."

312,Hotel Del Luna,"95% of screen time is just close ups of talking heads. Two of which, our lead characters, give very bland not challenging acting. Obviously chosen for eye candy looks & the romance hook to increase viewer demographics. 2% of screen time is of a CGI tree. 3% everything else. Low cost production mostly in wardrobe, and very cheap makeup for zombie looking recently deceased."
313,Hotel Del Luna,"This South Korean romance fantasy drama reaches a new qualitative level of emotional fantasy romance about a hotel for ghosts to rest before going onto the afterlife. This 16-episode television series incorporates and enhances the best of both English and European storylines using great editing and lighting with performances based on a riveting script that offers excellent use of flashbacks and unexpected twists and reveals that hit all the emotional highs of gripping relational dramatic performances shot and directed with patience and skill. The script is finely tuned and balanced between The Devil Wears Prada (2006) dynamics to the well-executed shift between drama, comedy, and horror that allows the audience to enjoy the whole storyline experience. This television series with its captivating use of classical, soothing, and haunting music (reminiscent of brief theme music from WarGames, 1983) fits perfectly into the story. Except for an early unreasonable scene with the lead character finding herself alone in a chase scene and poor choice of makeup, especially eye color, and a worthy effort but not completely brilliant satisfying ending, this television series is among the best and well produced television production of its kind."
314,Hotel Del Luna,"""Hotel del luna"" was buzzworthy due to its cast and the visuals. They did a really really really great job with the costumes, especially with IU who was stunning. The make up of the ghost was good as well.The horror part was just enough to keep things interesting (but be aware that some scenes are scary). The ghost stories were entertaining and enough to spice up the main plot. However, the romance was not that good. The love story was out of the blue, as they were more like friends rather than lovers. Sure, they had chemistry, but they just fell in love too suddenly. The background story of IU's character was pure gold and it was nicely presented, though.So, overall, seven out of ten."
315,Hotel Del Luna,"Without any spoilers... I would have given this series more stars if it had offered a more imaginative and better ending. That was the major flaw of this otherwise well-done series. As it was, they lose stars in this review just for the sloppy ending.Koreans seem to really know how to tell a story. The characters in this are definitely not 2 dimensional cliche; each offers a major plot element in the story, with several unexpected plot twists. They did really well at keeping the viewer surprised.Be prepared for some gore-- this is after all a hotel for the dead. Also be aware there are a LOT of Korean spiritual elements in this, including ghosts, eternal souls, and reincarnation. I wouldn't recommend this for children, on several counts. (For one thing, some scenes will likely scare the blazes out of them and give them nightmares.)This series gets the viewer emotionally involved and holds attention throughout. It's too bad they just left viewers hanging in the last episode. It doesn't exactly make sense and doesn't provide an ending promised by otherwise excellent plot twists. I can think of about half a dozen ways to have ended this-- all better that what they slopped out in the last 10 minutes. (Viewer reviews had the same complaint with Memories of the Alhambra-- a riveting tale that just sort of dropped the ending in the viewer's laps).I am reminded of the TV series LOST; some people just loved the ending, but the vast majority of viewers hated it. Writers and directors really should work to do a better job of sinking that final putt. If they're going to go to the trouble of making a series this interesting, at least tie up the package properly."
316,Hotel Del Luna,"Tied to the bed and toilet, I thought I'd give this Korean TV show a go..let's face it, I'm not going anywhere else at the moment. So, I clicked play and once I saw the lead actress, I was like..oh my lordy, I'm in love..let's watch this bad boy for a bit more lol.I liked this show but man alive it's veeeeeery slooooow. It's 16 episodes with about 20 hours of content. Yes, 20 hours! If it wasn't for the food poisoning, I probably wouldn't have finished it. This could have easily been trimmed to 10 episodes.Anyway...it's filmed well, acted quite well, and has amazing sets and costumes. It has drama, sadness, comedy, and nice characters you can relate to. Plus, everyone is super good looking, the product placement is hilarious and each episode comes with about two songs of heartfelt, poignant staring off into the distance. Thank eff, Netflix has a plus 10 button! It's nice to see Seoul as well. I have to say, it even made me think about the futility of striving to achieve while missing out on the present moment..although that could have been the cocktail of drugs I'm on at the moment. Overall a thumbs up, 7/10 and as this is about reincarnation, I hope I can meet the lead actress in a later life and..also be good looking too lol!Now, back to dying!"
317,Hotel Del Luna,"I enjoyed the series but found it uneven and sometimes messy in plot. IU is of course gorgeous, but also super talented and charming. She owns this one."
318,Hotel Del Luna,"Ji-eun Lee has run the Hotel De Luna for over 1000 years, the customers are troubled ghosts who need to resolve their issues from life before they can pass over. Jin-gu Yeo is an ambitious manager at a top hotel but due to a promise his father has made has to work for Ji-eun. The story is well directed and the flashback scenes about how Ji-eun is being punished for her past deeds are paced perfectly. She looks stunning in every shot and a lot of thought has gone into her costume and jewellery. She starts as a shallow ruthless character but due to her interaction with her new manager starts to soften. The ghosts are sometimes quite scary and the side story of those and also the backgrounds of the other staff fill the episodes. The main story is still the relationship of the Manager and Owner of Hotel De Luna and will the end be happy or sad. Very enjoyable with excellent performances by the cast."
319,Hotel Del Luna,"This is well made and much better than the average silly kd,only complaint is the story has to many timely visits to the past.IU is amazing never seen her before.the music is fantastic in this series"
320,Hotel Del Luna,"Hotel del Luna is a hotel located ""in"" Seoul. It is not visible to just anyone and undergoes a complete transformation when night falls. Kang Man-wol (Lee Ji-eun) became the ""boss"" of the hotel when she was transporting some souls of people she killed to the hotel in an effort to make up for her actions. She is unable to find it until she drinks a mysterious liquor which curses her to be the proprietor of this hotel for ghosts. She had run the hotel for over 1,000 years when a human wanders in which is normally a death sentence. However he strikes a deal with her to give her his son 20 years in the future in exchange for his life. Ku Chan-Seong (Yeo Jin-goo), was raised by his father to avoid Man-wol and her employees and even lives outside of South Korea until he deems it safe to return. Avoiding his fate may not be that simple and he soon finds being the hotel's new manager may be a job he cannot refuse.This was written by the Hong Sisters who have written other good dramas like ""Master's Sun"" and ""You are Beautiful"". They definitely know how to tell a good story. It is somewhat reminiscent of ""Goblin"" In that it has a delightful blend of spiritual and magical. It also has magical and ghostly elements like ""Master's Sun"". I liked all the main characters and thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each one and their back story. It was like ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the way their relationship was transformative. Both leads were really gorgeous and their chemistry was really amazing. I would have given an even higher score but I'm not one that likes sad endings. It will be sad for some but for others it will not be. A lot depends on your beliefs and your own personal philosophy. If you like paranormal with twists of magic then you will really enjoy this one. I think everyone would enjoy it most of the way through. If you do not expect happily ever after it is easier to understand."
321,Hotel Del Luna,"The graphics and costumes are awesome. The soundtrack suited well. The actors are excellent. The plot is unique and creative. So why its a nine for me I had to to really think about it. I felt like there's not much chemistry between two the two leads. IU had great chemistry with the guy from the past better than the main guy considering it only shows as flashbacks. In the ending, it did not give me much of a heartache between those two leads when all the other characters who left made me cry. I thought it would have been better if the guy tried to stop her and tries to fight or wants to join her and at the end he must let go. A little bit of struggle would probably make me feel the intensity of their love for each other and feel their emotions. It was only IU who wants to hold on and the guy did not responded and just cry several hours after. It also don't make sense that they were together in NY maybe in reincarnation whether she remembers him or not. The Goblin ending makes more sense."
322,Hotel Del Luna,"This is a supernatural, fanstay, drama, ghost, life, friendship kind of story. The setting of the story is really pretty. The clothes, hair and makeup of everyone is pretty too. The hotel was super pretty. The show is super emotional in a good way. The main girl and guy had great chemistry together. I love the supernatural elements to it. I don't normally like many stories that have ghosts in them but I loved this one a lot. All of the ghosts were different and unique. I was always surprised at what the next ghost would look like and do. Some of the ghosts were more like horror characters. While some were more cute , more friendly, almost kid tv like ghosts in a way but not like Casper the ghost in a other way. When the main girl kissed the man dude for the first time I couldn't believe it. There were so many rooms in the hotel that houses so many different kinds of things so I never got bored with what was happening in the hotel. There was always something new to discover about the hotel. I loved the fact that since she had lived for thousands of years we get to see her during some of the past decades at times while seeing her in the modern times. I also loved every characters personality. When that had the soul wedding that was very difference then anything I have ever seen. Until watching this show I never even heard of a soul wedding. But I thought it added interest in the show. It was funny when he would talk to ghost sometimes and people would heard him say things and do certain movements but not be able to see the ghost like he can. I love how the tree represented how the ceo lady was doing at the moment like the happy and better off she was the tree would be becuse prettier and prettier until it died meaning it was time for her to leave for the after life finally. I would recommend this story to everyone for sure. You might not think it good at first but trust me it so freaking good that it a ten star for sure from me. I might even rewatch the show one day that how good it is."
323,Hotel Del Luna,This was so entertaining and all the actors were phenomenal in this show. This was funny and heartwarming and the romance that developed between Jang Manwol and Gu Chanseong was done at a really nice pace. I cried so much while watching the last few episodes and I'm glad that the characters were given a happy ending after all the hardships they had gone through.
324,Hotel Del Luna,"As another reviewer suggested, this show definitely had a similar vibe to Goblin (which was the reason I decided to watch it tbh), although it wasn't nearly as good. That being said, it was definitely a lovely show, full of symbology and poignant, tear-jerking moments. Wonderful acting accompanied by a fabulous soundtrack definitely made this show shine. The overall story was a little slow, and I think this was one of those shows you watch for the atmosphere rather than an addicting story-line."
325,Hotel Del Luna,"This has the best visuals and production value of any K-drama I've seen. The Costumes are amazing, the make-up and post effects are really good and the musical score really shines.It was slow for me though. 80% of each episode's run time was about some random ghost that is in effect a one-shot while the main plot is pushed to the background for most of it. I just didn't care enough about them too keep me hooked. It also felt longer than it really was because they wanted to show off all the visuals so the shots linger on the designs and details way too often."
326,Hotel Del Luna,"This is a magical fairy tale, which unfolds very slowly, inviting the viewer to succumb to its charms.Such slow paced dramas can build a solid foundation for either suspense or emotional engagement as the story unfolds. However, the dramatic climax which had been building passed quietly three episodes from the end. That left the possibility of an emotional climax in the last 2 episodes, which I fully expected to come to fruition, but for me at least this was also missed.While it is hard to shake off the feeling of disappointment, this was still a moderately enjoyable watch. But it could have been so very much better."
327,Hotel Del Luna,"After seeing Goblin I hesitated to find something of the genre that I liked the same but without a doubt this made me doubt a lot, I loved it too much, it is fun but very emotional, visually it is even more beautiful and I fell in love with Yeo Jin-Goo so they bought me ."
328,Hotel Del Luna,"Its not excellent but above average drama. 16 episodes are just nice, not too long and getting bored. There are not much story and only watchable if you want to pass time. Sorry, I amnot a fan of IU so I will not lie to convince you that this is very good. I review this with conscience."
329,Hotel Del Luna,"What A Delectable Diversion. HDL is a magical little fantasy tale about a hotel where the dead can rest prior to going on to the afterlife.While the hotel is magical, and regular slubs like us can't see it or its guests, it still exists in the real world. It's registered with the province, and a human manager is required to handle all human affairs.Enter Mr. Koo. When Koo was young, his father, in a fated encounter with Ms Jang, promised Koo's future to Jang as her next manager, in exchange for his life. Otherwise, Koo would be orphaned and alone. The good news is that HDL will now fund Koo's upbringing. So Pop takes him to The States where he, in time, ""pulls a Harvard"" in Hotel Mgmt.Even so, like all humans putting on blinders, neither dad nor child took it seriously. Koo came to realize 25 years later, that he could not shirk this obligation. Just when he had his dream job bagged, Jang runs interference.What plays out is a peek into this amazing world within our world. As Koo's training is OTJ, every episode we are treated to something new and imaginative.HDL is a visual extravaganza, from
the hotel to the fashion porn. It was filmed on location at the Hotel Seine Café, which is staggeringly beautiful. 'Dainties' are 360-round. The pool is actually a yacht-worthy ocean with sunlight-levels to order. HDL even has an amusement park. Who wants to go! Uh, wait a sec.... I can wait a while for that.The filming bolsters this gorgeous spectacle. Jang's got an outfit to go with every occasion, even one to wear when dining on ricecake soup. But don't expect spontaneity, however. If you want to go somewhere suddenly, and she's not dressed 'correctly', just fuhgettaboudit.Jang looks like a porcelain doll and is as feisty as a Tasmanian Devil. She's taken on petulance as a primary personality trait. She's also sealed herself off, emotionally. Devoid of emotion, we see her dismiss the former manager of 40 years with perfunctory efficiency. She is particularly lacking in compassion. Consistency long ago abandoned, she will say anything in the moment to satiate her abstinence.While Jang's assuredly badass, Ms Snark, Ms Clash, Ms Sourpus, Ms Ill-Tempered Ice Queen, is about to get a change of perspective, not just clothes. Koo might appear to be a feckless wimp (which is how Jang's been treating him) just the same, he is, as it turns out, tremendously courageous, and a problem solver of the highest intellect. He knows when to be reserved and when to step up. When he steps up, it's with every bit of panache that Jang displays.They close out one episode with him declaring: ""You are devouring all my nights and all my dreams. Admit it, he just laid down some lines. Another time Koo tells Jang: ""The view is much better, now that I'm with you."" He ain't weak at all. They show us the fiat of his masculinity when Jang, in an attempt to to coerce him into the cat print suit, threatened to take his clothes off if he didn't wear it. He looked at her and said: ""Can you handle it?"" She froze for a moment. He's so smooth he could write dating primers!Koo actually pursues Jang. She exposed the tiniest opening, and he wedged it wide and occupied all the empty space. He inspires a smidge of awe. Before long they are spending most of their time together, and they continue the trend Koo started by speaking metaphorically to each other. For example, when Jang says: ""The sea is beautiful tonight. It makes me a little sad."" She looks Koo in the eye and says: ""I'm sad because it's more beautiful than it was before."" They feel for each other, but they haven't fully acknowledged it to themselves, so they can't express it yet.As their feelings deepen, they both want to protect each other, and they also begin matching each other. At first it's just her nail polish that matches his outfit, and it grows from there. They match the most once she gets past wanting to kill him.When Koo was still running away from the job, Jang went out to retrieve him. He was passed out from a nasty ghost encounter. K- ""How did you get me back to the hotel""? J- ""Well, I got something similar to a handcart. All you need to know is that I got you back safely."" The way she actually got him back, however, was by possession.We see heavy foreshadowing in the rose he gave her: It's fragile & will wilt eventually. Some things are left oblique, such as the sex of the last Yun family baby, or an answer to the ""capricious"" dieties that don't seem to be fair.There's plenty of laughs. Mr. Koo is lurched far off-balance by the rush of new experiences. Out of fear, he frequently jumps behind Jang (who looks like she might reach 5'2"" in spiked Jimmy Choos), until he gets accustomed to dealing with ghosts.Once in awhile, live people can see the HDL and insist on checking in. They are placed in Room 404, the error number we've seen on countless computer screens.Koo finds out, after he starts putting his whole heart into the job, that he was the 3rd choice for manager. As he had been 'committed' to the job for 25 years & had believed he was indispensable, he's shocked. The staff calls him 'Mr. 3rd choice' behind his back.In EP10 there's a deft little scene. Koo and Jang are at a restaurant where people died from eating. She can't get enough of that. She's ticked off at him, but can't resist taking pictures of her food. Snapping away, she never diverts her fuming stare from him. She moves the camera around and clicks it but only looks at him. Hilarious.Jang's thank-you gift to Koo of a big-cat-print suit should evoke some chuckles.How could you say ""no"" to having a beer with the Grim Reaper? SANCHEZ!There's some head-scratchers & some glaring omissions, unfortunately. It was obvious they would be resolving grudges for the staff. It might have been better if they spread it out a little more. The ending is not to my liking. At all. Their relationship is priceless, and they have so little time together once they settle in to it.I get it: Koo let Jang go. He made the choice. The show creators could have constructed any ground rules of their choosing, however. Early on we're told the tree looks dead because time stopped flowing for Jang. She didn't die in the series, so why did she have to cross to the Afterlife? Why would Jang even be forced to pay a thousand year penance because she took out the rotten government that abused their power and her people? Jang's horrible circumstances seem worse than she herself is. Does Jang's punishment fit the crime as well as Koo's tiger suit fits him?I spent most of the series thinking that when Jang's time flows again she'll be able to live her life out with Koo before passing. In fairness, the vibe increasingly felt ill-fated. It's not like they didn't forecast the weather. I'm still going through 5 grief stages over it, nevertheless. Right now I'm angry. YO! It's a fairy tale, for cryin out loud!! Why can't we have a fairy tale ending!? :( looks like I'm sliding into the bargaining phase now).Mago straight asks Koo if she can do him a favor in exchange for the scissors' safe return. Why didn't he ask for more time? Mago used him to work on Jang. She set it all up 25 years ago, perhaps longer. SHE caused his broken heart. She didn't have to be so stingy, so dang capricious. They're making me hate fate.Don't tell me that meeting in future lives is a happy ending. One happy life now is worth a hundred possible lives later. If they do, indeed, meet up as kimchi and chicken noodles, is that happy? Doubtful. It's understandable that some would consider reincarnation to be romantic. The potential downside is that we could look at all the misery in this world as being deserved by the oppressed due to indiscretions in prior lives. If that belief system turns out to not be true, then that is too cruel to the oppressed. Every living thing could be in jeopardy within that philosophical circle. Compassion and empathy would only take on damage under such suppositions, also.Things went downward a tinge in the last couple episodes. EP16 was too slow, sappy, and drawn out. It's always sad when the wrap up of a great story is the worst part of it. The saddest thing is that I could be experiencing a warm firefly glow today, instead of anger.We don't see what happens to anyone going forward, which is another letdown.Finally, for Jang, running the hotel is a punishment, but it seems to be a reward for the next guy. CAPRICIOUS Mago winks at us again.Enough of that.This is also appropriate to watch with kids that are around the ages of 12& up, depending on how they handle some moderate scares. The feel is almost Disneyesque. HDL offers valuable lessons, such as forgiveness, and Koo is a walking ethics handbook.While you may not get 100% customer satisfaction, make sure to check-in anyway. This is a hotel, and a show, like no other. I'm a little angry, but also very bedazzled."

331,Hotel Del Luna,"I really enjoyed the first I guess 10? Episodes, but towards the end ngl it got a bit boring for me. However, I LOVED the storyline, the dialogue, characters, and also the outfit for every single episode. Now I understand why so much people enjoyed this drama."
332,Hotel Del Luna,"I really enjoyed the series overall. the love story was built perfectly and I enjoyed how it grew throughout the whole series. In my opinion, the ending could have been better but it was inevitable. There was no escaping it but it also made sense."
333,Hotel Del Luna,"Actually its rather good. Interesting, different type of love story. The CGI, graphic & effects make it interesting. Their love develop with time to the end.The only thing I don't understand is the ending where they meet in NY. It makes more sense if she is reincarnated but otherwise the ending part is a little mysterious. The last scene with Kim Soo-Hyun is just cool!If you like romantic comedy with some twist then this is worth watching. Friendship turns to love. Great leading & supporting casts!"
334,Hotel Del Luna,Why must u watch it? IU! JUST ONE REASON NEEDED. I m in awe of her. And also her costume. The story is nice and atypical too. Overall a fun watch even though the most confusing ending ahhhh
335,Hotel Del Luna,"The best K one so far memories of alhambra came into 2 Nd place and the Korean odyssey nr3 . series which gives u ghost bumbps, smile and make 34 old fire fighter cry :( I wanna belive in love again after watching this .last half hour was so difficult but worth to watch .now can't wait for hotel blue moon .jang mang wol probably best actress so far I have seen .she looks lovely with out make up"
336,Hotel Del Luna,"I recommend that you don't watch this if you recently lost a loved oneMs. Jang was the central character and rose to the challenge. A show about departed souls leaving their loved ones and forgetting all they know is going to be sad. This was well done as many chose the high road without concern of a reward, but because they could empathize with the people they were holding grudges against.I have not seen the last episode but I sense that this is a 'the joy is in the journey' type of events.I did end up hating the main soundtrack, as the two leads gazed into each others eyes, for what seems like 15 min in every episode.Their portrayal of the best case scenario for afterlife is quite dreary. I don't know if that is consistent with their religion or for dramatic effect but they needed it for the show. You cross Alzheimer's bridge and forget everything about your past life and are eventually reborn. This made the crossing over when a ghost decided to leave even more powerful because you knew you would never see them again. The best you could hope for was that a different version of you might see a different version of them. If you just go to heaven, there would be no drama.The deities were a good break from the sad plight of the ghosts
I felt empathy for every ghost, they succeeded in making me care for them."
337,Hotel Del Luna,"Omg I absolutely loved this drama !!
Each and every single episode was so so so exciting!!
Not once I got bored watching this !!!
The story line is absolutely AMAZING !! I reallyyyyy love it and 100% recommend watching this !"
338,Hotel Del Luna,"The story is wonderful. It is, indeed, one of the best dramas out there. It has everything: humor, mystery, beautiful actors and A LOT of romance. It's a must-see. Man, I cried at this show...I couldn't stop. Now I gotta do some ""soul healing"" with an action movie or something.PS: Its current grade doesn't do it justice at all."
339,Hotel Del Luna,"Emily Dickinson once wrote ""Because I could not stop for death, He kindly stopped for me."" The poem personifies death, softens the ever ominous notion into something very human. As I watched Hotel Del Luna, the words of her poem kept coming to me.I honestly cannot recommend this series enough and I love tell to those interested in this series to stop reading reviews (including this), ignore spoilers and just go watch this series unhindered.Hotel Del Luna meticulously mixed together horror, comedy, drama, thriller and mystery into every episode. The entire series are filled with twists that took me on a ride with jolts of astonishment at every turn. I found myself jumping in fear, cracking up from laughter, tearing up in longing and pondering in thought. If you enjoy a good plot, this is the perfect series for you but be warned it can be a little scary at times.The acting from the entire cast was terrific. There were some moments where I felt the acting fell a tad flat, but overall I was swept away. IU-in particular- surprised me, this was the first series I've ever seen her in. IU perfectly captured the tough and ruthless hotel owner full of struggles to which she keeps hidden. I adore IU's use of subtle facial expressions and solid acting performance. She is able to jump within seconds from jealousy to nonchalant to get-out-of my-face-anger to absolute joy.I loved the characters-every single one of them are well rounded. Each character plays part in the overall story of the movie and none of them were written as an afterthought. My favourite is Jang Man-Wol-main character. It is so refreshing to have a badass female lead who takes no nonsense from anyone and not a damsel in distress. Even more refreshing the male lead actually says Man-Wol is his protector and he feels safe with her at his side. Guys!! This alone was awesome!The set design, art work and costume are all beautifully created. The Art Deco style hotel, the mystical realms and the different flashbacks all worked very well together. The ever changing costume for Man-Wol was a trip on its own. As someone who works in the film industry, I have a lot of respect for how well everything came together.The ending felt dragged on a bit but this, for the first time, didn't bother me. I didn't realize it while watching, but slowed pace towards the end was an exact reflection of how I was feeling-I didn't want Hotel Del Luna to end and thus the show seemed to have slowed down to wait for me. Much like Emily Dickenson's poem, the series gently guided me through a rollercoasters of emotions to the conclusion, stopping periodically to check how we are doing. With that, 10/10."
340,Hotel Del Luna,"This was probably my 25th Korean drama, loved the show throughout 16 episodes and would have easily given it 9, because the acting of lead actors was quite good, the background score was apt, loved every time Done For Me played. The flaws ? Two major ones for me. The romance/passion was completely missing between the leads characters, not because of the actors but because of poor writing. There were some moments and build ups, but it never really turned to it's potential, for a character who has been alive and lonely for 1000+ years, finally falls in love, but that love and passion was never really displayed on screen, and the other one knows that he's gonna lose his love forever pretty soon, yet somehow that doesn't really come up on screen. Again poor writing and not because of actors. Their chemistry portrayed was more like friends and not like lovers, and that was a real bummer.Second major flaw. The ending. It's not much of an interesting end, if you're clearly told that this is what and how is suppose to happen to our leading lady in the very first episode and that is exactly how it goes down in the 16th episode. You expect some twists and turns, I don't mind a sad ending, that two lovers couldn't be together. But the end was really dull without a single turn of events in any way. And also very abrupt. The leading lady dies and the guy just packs his bags to leave for NY. That was extremely dull and abrupt."
341,Hotel Del Luna,"This series for me was really weird. And creepy. I will definitely continue to stream this on my phone but it was a nice change of pace.The first episode was so mysterious and engaging that I just had to keep on watching. For me, the first four episodes of a k drama you must watch before judging it.I am still following that rule. IU reminds of Nanno (""Girl From Nowhere) when she plays her role. Just a thought.Overall though, the romance and effects do play out. Now if I can only get those ads out of the way and look at the drama in peace...."
342,Hotel Del Luna,"Without a lot of overstated review points, if you like a good love story with great characters, this is your cup of tea.Get your box of tissues ready because you'll be weeping quite a bit."
343,Hotel Del Luna,"The drama was promising from the start despite the slow pace. But, it gets better from episode three and keep you engaged and addicted! That is till episode 13. After that, it's beyond bad. Actually I wish the entire last episode did not happen except for the final cameo.Too bad really. The drama had great potential and IU was beautiful in the awesome costumes. Yeo Jingoo too is someone I adore a lot. However, his performance was subpar compared to all his other dramas. The chemistry between IU and Jingoo was nice but I was not sold. Perhaps it was because he was in his later 20s while IU's character was 1000 years older than him.If I really be honest, Lee Dohyun's character had a better story with IU and ideally would have been the better pairing. That story and character was wasted.Also, the drama has so many repeated scenes that may have accumulated to 2 episodes. I feel like the drama could have ended by 12 episodes. It was draggy and nothing much was happening by episode 14.I will never re-watch this drama. However, I found IU to be really cute in most times. So, if you are a fan, give it a watch.Also, watch it for the awesome cameos of Lee Joongi, Sulli, and Kim Soohyun. But, without much expectations."
344,Hotel Del Luna,"Yes, I'm here to praise this excellent show, though you can probably work that out from the ten stars. I must, however, admit to some general pessimism before I started.
Why ? I'd recently begun to watch a newish show ( let's not mention the title in case you love it ) and gave up by episode two. It had yet another rich, handsome, arrogant A-hole thrown together with a pretty young woman with much less money etc and so on. What a VERY original storyline ! I'm so sick of these formula plots ! And it wasn't even well written, which would've been something. I've also been underwhelmed recently by boring new shows from established actresses, so I began HDL hoping really hard that it'd be good. True, the VIKI rating is 9.8, which is helpful, and now I'm done.
Relief. That's the word best suited to my overall impression ( ""pleasure"" is obviously close behind ! ). Relief to have found a quality series for a change, and such a relief to have a WOMAN as the lead character instead of some self-absorbed chaebol MAN. And what a fascinating character to watch. The absence of the standard K Drama clichés is also refreshing.
Ms Jang ( played by singer IU ) is the owner of the titular hotel, a place for the dead to rest and sort their affairs before the Grim Reaper sends them on the road to the Afterlife. I won't bore you with a lengthy story description because you can get that from VIKI or IMDB. What's crucial is the quality of the writing ( thank you Hong sisters ) and all the characters benefit. Everyone has a substantial back story and each of the ghosts passing through has an interesting tale to tell. The supernatural clearly plays a major part in the story ( especially re-incarnation ) and you'll discover the difference between a vengeful ghost and an evil one. As with all the best K dramas, there's a satisfying mix of drama, humour and tears here, as well as a goodly dose of the scary. Even the Reaper gets a cutely comical scene towards the end, and especially in the last third, a number of scenes surprise and delight with their creativity. And of course you'll cry a lot at the final episode !
Back to Ms Jang, and what a role this is. I'm sure every young actress in South Korea would've been chasing it because there's so many layers to the character. Being around for more than a thousand years enhances the scope, so we see her as a tough thief with a gang in olden times. That's where her bitterness arose, and a sword is wielded as well as a sharp tongue. In modern times, a rather jaded Ms Jang has become cynical and sarcastic and doesn't suffer fools gladly. She's also a dedicated materialist, lusting after yachts, paintings and expensive cars. There is, naturally, a good heart beneath the frosty exterior, just waiting for the right person to help it blossom.
Good writing needs a good cast to do it justice, and Yeo Jin Goo as the fresh-faced human manager Mr Gu is the perfect foil to the caustic Ms Jang. His natural affability was an asset in the recent ""Absolute Boyfriend"" ( which, by the way, was remarkable for confirming that Japan, Taiwan and also Korea couldn't quite get it right ) and his youth gives their interplay a bit of a cradle-snatching angle since she's about four years older in reality. The romance angle is possibly not what we might have expected, yet is nevertheless moving and heartfelt. K Popper P.O. is sweet as the bellboy, Bae Hae Sun is enjoyably maternal as the Room Manager and Shin Jung Geun is avuncular as the crusty barman. Also making a strong impression is Kang Mina ( another K Popper, from the group Gugudan ) as the managerial intern. This quintet are the central ""family"" of the hotel, and their backstories are extremely affecting. A group of other actors do good work in supporting roles, while Seo Yi Sook is excellent playing a variety of gods who seem to be related. Of the various cameos, the most obviously poignant is that of IU's friend Sulli, who tragically committed suicide recently. The role and it's outcome acquires a sad extra dimension with that in mind.
And so to IU. Ms Jang dominates the show as the planet around which everyone else revolves and the singer/actress pulls off all the many moods and emotions with convincing assurance. Whether it's the ferocity of a warrior in a fight or a girlish giggle or a moving speech full of emotion, this woman can do it all. It's also interesting for such a small and slightly built person to play such an alpha personality. The icing on the cake here is the outfits : IU is a beautiful young woman in her physical prime and the dazzling array of clothes she has to wear present a true combo treat for the eyes. And she looks particularly stunning during a scene set in olden times wearing a light blue costume with her hair coiled at the sides of her head. HDL is almost a demo reel for IU, as if she's saying to the world : here I am, and this is what I can do. The phrase ""A Star Is Born"" definitely comes to mind. Movies must surely be the next step; I was watching the excellent ""Parasite"" again and she could have easily managed the part of the poor family's daughter. As to the arty mini-series ""Persona"" she did this year for Netflix, it hints at a pleasing desire to take chances.
Director Oh Choong Hwan should be applauded for the smooth flow/pacing on display, and the show looks beautiful thanks to the DP. Not quite in the same esteemed league as the lustrous ""Mr Sunshine"" but lovely nonetheless and ditto for the production design of a hotel which is like a character in the story. And a nod to the music which is very good too.
Gripes ? Well, just a personal preference : since the camera is usually using a long lens in close ups or mid shots, the background is fuzzed out and so the gorgeous hotel and its décor are lost. Yes, I know this tactic ( the so-called ""vanity shot"" ) is designed to keep the performers front/centre and avoid distractions, but it's a waste here in my view. And.....who or what was in room 404 ? Hmm ? All Mr Gu had to do towards the end is open the door, peek in and say ""oh, it's you"", then laugh. Or peek, scream and run like hell; an explicit explanation isn't vital. Some closure would've been nice, or did they just forget ?
Anyway, do watch HDL. Put simply, it provides what we all look for : a good story well told. Actually, make that ""very"" well told."
345,Hotel Del Luna,"I gave this series a try because of the hype and good reviews but maybe it is just not for me (I am not fun of fantasy series).The positives : IU was awesome and she totally carried the whole story. Great acting skills from the lead characters and a very nice ost.The negatives: The plot starts good but as the episodes go by (especially after the 9 ep) it starts getting boring and tedious. So the plot is just tolerable. There were some plot twist that I found really stupid too. Also, the leads chemistry was so good ,but the role of male lead was so passive and shy and he did not take any initiatives. The last episode was also so slow for me and not satisfying."
346,Hotel Del Luna,"Absolutely fabulous fantasy, romance drama! Yeo Jin Goo and UI were exceptional in their performance as Chan Sung and Man Wol! Couple that with the most brilliant cinematography, and you have one of the most beautiful stories ever made! Loved it!"
347,Hotel Del Luna,"I lived with thisthis series
i laughed with this series
i cried with this series
i love IU Actress She is cutie beauty salty funny
That god Woman was nice actress too
ty for this excellent seriesif u like watch another nice korean series
watch Flower of Evil."
348,Hotel Del Luna,"The acting of most beautiful & talented actress Lee Ji-eun along with charming and good actor Yeo Jin-gu put their 100% to satisfy us (the viewer's). Literally, the acting was beyond expectations and the comedy are something which you love most in this drama. Specially the lead actress is mind blowing when it comes to comedy thing.The most beautiful and emotional thing is, this drama give you almost everything like - comedy, drama, horror, heart throbbing sad back story of all characters including the supporting actors and actresses. The horror elements are literally sometimes feel funny because of the situation of story but I'm sure that you'll definitely love that thing.So, I would definitely recommend this drama to everyone if you haven't watched it yet. Must put this drama in your watch list."
349,Hotel Del Luna,"Beautiful casting. And styling, acting superb.
Creative and elegant"
350,Hotel Del Luna,"I think those who are in the kdrama circle know who the special cameo is at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone else. I watched the entire show for that final 1:15 mins. That part was worth it-the show itself was not.The good: 1. Visuals- Two great-looking leads and IU's wardrobe deserve praise. 2. Atmosphere-cinematography, soundtrack, eerie/fairy tale feeling. This show definitely had a unique look. 3. The Cameo- I just need to stress this.The Bad: 1. Story development-if I were to draw a line graph of the plot progression, it would be flat and stagnant. It's not a heavy drama. I don't think it was trying to be; at the same time, it was not engaging to watch because it lacked eventful moments. Almost every episode they show a ghost and the story behind their death. It felt too formulaic, predictable, and honestly...boring. I wanted them to elaborate on IU's story more and her relationship with the male lead. I liked the flashbacks, but the writers didn't utilize them to their full potential. A lot of the script didn't make sense to me. It seemed like they were trying to come up with deep dialogue, but it was sometimes confusing because they kept adding new information about ghosts and the spirit world, so it ended up sounding like they were making everything up as they go with no clear direction. 2. Acting- I love IU and there are moments I find she really understands the characters she plays. She has a subtle way of acting; she acts with her eyes. But for this show, I couldn't connect with her character. Her acting was pretty flat here. She and Yeo Jin Goo were a nice pairing, but they lacked chemistry. I couldn't fall in love with their relationship, and when they said their ""I love you""s I couldn't feel it. They seemed more like friends than lovers on the show. 3. Not enough camera time for the cameo."
351,Hotel Del Luna,"Who would have thought that a tv series can have all possible genders? Horror, Scary, funny, drama, suspense, thriller, love and a loooot of sentimentalism. I cried my heart out in some episodes and especially in the last one. Sad, but not tragic, it's good that it ended that way. Also, I assume we're going to have a brand new season considering the ending, right ?
I give it 9 and not 10 because scary parts are not my stuff and also some episodes did not get me the feeling of ""Omg, let's move to the next one asap"". The narrative was pretty slow in my opinion. Anyway, a good drama but not the best!"
352,Hotel Del Luna,For those who like the supernatural/fantasy type entertainment this show is a good one to check out. Hotel De Luna grabs attention immediately keeps things interesting throughout.
353,Hotel Del Luna,"I just finished the last episode and i have too say this show is very very good. The main actress IU absolutely kills it but the main actor is just ok. The main actress and side characters carry this show they all work well together with full back stories. There is comedy, drama, action the writing for this show was well done. I took one star off because the chemistry between the main actor and actress just doesn't really move forward they really just stay more as best friends than a couple the show is trying hard to portray them as. Besides that the show is simply amazing i would def recommend watching this one!"
354,Hotel Del Luna,"I don't even remember how many times this series made me cry althroughout watching it. It still amazes me how these Koreans can always come up with a good story, and how they make us learn to like and love the characters that they introduce.The story is unique and injected with the right amount of comedy and drama. Although I'm not exactly a big fan of Ji-eun Lee, she seemed adequate enough to play the lead role. Overall the other characters were fit for their roles which made the entire series worth watching.I do hope they release a Season 2."
355,Hotel Del Luna,"1) IU: Her acting (as a strong female character) and her amazing outfits.
2) The great OST who fits at every moment.
3) The fairy tale vibes.
4) The cameos.
5) The Fx, stunning scenaries and how well shooted is!
6) The lovely story."
356,Hotel Del Luna,"This is one of the best dramaa I've ever watched.
The story is really unique and it's just so amazin.
You should definitely watch this."
357,Hotel Del Luna,Honestly I've started watching this only for Le-Ji-eun but i never expected this drama trun out like this and make me fall for the story too. Now I am glad that I did not miss such a beautiful drama.
358,Hotel Del Luna,Very good 😌 I love historical. The actors are the best.
359,Hotel Del Luna,"Hotel Del Luna was actually very interesting story. But to start off, it was a somewhat similar twist as in ""Guardian: The Lonely an Great God"".First, Man Wol, played by IU, was amazing in her acting. Plus her non-repeated stylist dresses was all beautiful. The storyline was great, having a hotel to house death people before they go to the afterlife. But the parallel story between Man Wol and Chan Seong made you wonder who he was in his previous life and why he is here."
360,Hotel Del Luna,"Disney movies and shows have always been about showing things in a beautiful manner visually and emotionally while imparting some important lessons along the way or towards the end.
This show is just like a Disney production, spectacularly set and lavishly comely to the eyes. But this one just keeps us reminding about the impermanence of such beauty. It establishes promptly that throughout its run, the theme which is gonna be addressed is 'to learn to let go and move forward' .While the stories of different guests were interestingly written while being emotionally deep, it is the main story of the leading couple which suffers from blatant inconsistencies and unnecessarily dragged to diminish the effect of goodbyes.It sets the show and settings really well in the first few episodes. The comedy works out well here and there. The romance of various couples other than the main one were not sidelined and were actually more interesting when viewed with their backstories and connections to the main plot than the main couple.As the show progresses the different guests and their issues which sometimes get infused with the main story keeps the show going rather the romance of the two leads.
Still it manages to make us give a little attention to the main story with its flashback sequences with classic viewer deceiving tactics.
The deception works because it keeps us reminding that despite all this extravagant and pleasing looks, there is so much tragedy and sadness within the main character.It has comically yet interestingly depicted the concepts of God, Heaven and Afterlife, It has meddled with those concepts to create serious and comedic dilemmas for the characters which was interesting to watch.Even though the side stories were thematically same, each of them had its uniqueness a sort of fresh wholesomeness to them. It was sad yet prepared us for the impermanence of life itself with unexpected variety of stories based on all living beings.While all the different stories of various ghosts prepare both the viewer and the main characters for the inevitable separation, some bad writing choices greatly falters in closing the show well. It subverts the effect of that inevitable separation just to prepare one of the characters to accept that split well.It also remains irritatingly vague after that particular decision in writing which actually disrupts the core theme of moving on. Thus it stretches out the main arc and also postpones some closure for characters to the frustration of the viewer.The most alluring aspects of this show is its music, OST, grandeur in sets and visuals.The inside of the hotel, costumes of the lead and depiction of different eras were splendid.The music and original songs were adding to the mood of the scene, comic and tragic. It really brought out the emotions which were hidden in the visual grandeur.A dreamy series filled with visual opulence driving home great message necessary for everyone who is alive faltered along the way to decrease the effect towards the end."
361,Hotel Del Luna,"I heard everyone recommending this drama so i watched it. i hardly tried not dropping it after first episode. but, it was just such a loooong advertisement without any thrilling story. i wont recommend it. there are a lot of better dramas out there in same genre. such as goblin, Korean odyssey, angles last mission: love..."
362,Hotel Del Luna,Just one of those flawless Korean dramas which offer a little bit of everything and then some... And are super fun to watch. Definitely worth the time.
363,Hotel Del Luna,"Funny, creepy, thrilling, romantic, sad, endearing!"
364,Hotel Del Luna,"Wow. Loveble characters and brilliant chemistry? Check. Comedy? Check. Romance and freindship? Check! Cool fantasy? Hell yes.
If you've seen Korean odessy- it's got the same vibe. If you haven't seen it- do it now.
In terms of visuals: Hotel del luna has got one of the most highest production value I've ever seen. The effects are top notch, the scenery and costumes are amazing- they've really spared no expense and you feel it in almost every shot.
Story wise: This was a very beautiful very moving story with lovely methaphors, but for those of you like me who like to know in advance whether this is a tear jerking heart wrenching drama that we'll leave you broken for a while I will say the last episode was sad, but beautiful sad, and the road leading up to it makes it totally worth it.
They managed to create a beautiful world with solid rules that feels natural. The only downside to this series are the first two episodes when they set up the world and it's rules- something about the pacing and the tone just doesn't really work there but I'm sooo glad that I continued to watch.
I gave it a -9 just because of the beginning- but please please watch it- you won't regret it."
365,Hotel Del Luna,"But this is one of the few shows I would willingly give a 10/10. Only a few shows I've watched were that good; Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Avatar, Daredevil, the first season of Stranger Things and of course, Spongebob Squarepants.Hotel Del Luna joins that niche. It isn't perfect in the same way Breaking Bad is, but the few, minute problems it has are completely outweighed by the overwhelming positives. IU and Yeo Jin Good have phenomenal chemistry and I actually think they work perfectly as a couple rather than friends. The emotional scenes are done perfectly and there's enough supernatural stuff to keep it interesting, aided with the history of Man Wol plot-line that is somehow even more interesting than the ghosts. Every character is insanely likable, to the point where they're Avatar status of likable. Even the side-characters like Sanchez, Detective Park, Mi-Ra, all of them are awesome and fleshed out. My favourite scene especially is when Man Wol meets Detective Park and then it flashbacks to Yeon Woo and his cancer curing smile. My first tears were shed during that scene.And you get to know the characters so well that it actually hurts to see them leave one by one by the final episode. Mr Kim leaving proudly, Hyun Jong happily reuniting with his sister and Ms Choi leaving free of any resentment.But of course, the hardest part to watch is Man Wol departing and Chan Seong knowing he will never see again, at least not in his current life. It's incredibly bittersweet to know that's the end for them currently, but many many years down the line, their paths will cross again. The goodbyes aren't even cliche: There are tear, sure, but each party tries their hardest to compose themselves. There's no overlonging goodbye, they just bid farewell and she leaves. One simple hug, not even a kiss. And when they're all seen together in that final scene, it just makes the current ending to Man Wol's story all the more bittersweet.One last thing: The OST is Godly."
366,Hotel Del Luna,"It was perfect. I fell in love with soundtracks. the actors played their roles really well. The scenario is very well prepared. When you come to the end, there are no questions left in your mind."
367,Hotel Del Luna,"Please watch this. It's true it is slow, there were a lot of scenes that didn't need to drag on the way they did but trust me this show is beautiful in every way.The writting is really good, the acting and visuals stunning. The music in the show as a total is one of best soundtracks I've heard in a while in a drama and will get stuck to your head."
368,Hotel Del Luna,"Too slow, the plot doesn't progress at all. While in theory the plot is good , however execution fails completely. As far as the romance involving the second leads , it seems to me a plot involving a school girl with older man seems bordering on child abuse ( however ghostly )."
369,Hotel Del Luna,Must watch kdrama. Waiting for season 2 if possible
370,Hotel Del Luna,"I have had a little knowledge of movies that are made in korean language.. And phones .Its the 1st time i saw this series on netflix , clicked started watching and all i can say is .. I am memorized.
I had no interest in watching a foreign lauguage suff but this changed everything .Never have i imagine i will watch such a serious that will make me love a country (korea) so much !"
371,Hotel Del Luna,"HDL was an extremely hyped up drama when it came out and I thought the title was appealing in the sense that it really evoked fantasy cinematic vibes. Having briefly looked at the plot however, it reminded me a bit too much of the 2013 drama the Master's Sun (also listed as one of the dramas which I thought was exceptional IMO). That latter named drama's leading lady's character involved her ability to see ghosts despite being a human inside and out and was thereby an exact replica of Gu Chan-sung's (GCS) character in HDL. Both character's goal? In order to get rid of one's fears, they must face their fears. How to do that? By communicating with ghosts and fulfilling their needs and wants (whether good or bad) and then dealing with vengeful ghosts who held a powerful capability to attack the living.On another note, considering these kinds of themes/ideas explored are unique to a specific writer for a drama, I was wondering which writer(s) wrote HDL and it turned out to be none other than the talented Hong Sisters (both of who also just happened to write the script for the Master's Sun all those years back). So, in that respect, perhaps one of the many reasons why I didn't enjoy HDL as much was because I found myself re-watching a drama which had almost the same premise as its predecessor. Having said that, HDL was just not hype-worthy sorry to say, but what I will say is that it was exceptional in many other aspects other than its storyline.Firstly, I'll give it to the people in the costume department for the array of outfits Jang Man-wol (JMW) had the fantastic opportunity of wearing throughout the drama. I've never seen anything quite like it before to be honest, whereby the female lead had about ten different outfits, hairstyles, and accessories per episode thanks to her elegant, impeccable taste in fashion. Secondly, the production was quite amazing wasn't it? I could not fault one episode which did not scream ""attention to detail"". In particular, I was in awe of the hotel setting just because of how classy and grandeur it looked both inside and out.However, was this enough to save the storyline? Let's start with the Mago deities (for now - will explain a bit more below).If I can recall correctly, there were about six deities in total which starred in HDL (i.e. The rich, poor, life, death, health, and love deity). Each served a different purpose, but it was mainly just one which really contributed to JMW's existence (save for the rest which had more involvement with GCS's character). The biggest weakness for me though was the fact that I couldn't seem to grasp why JMW had that long-standing curse imposed on her when the reality is the main Mago could have given the sword to anyone. (Actually, I'm not even sure where that moon sword came from). For example, yes, I can see how JMW's character was by far the most significant in terms of the drama's storyline - she did after all commit fraud, murder, treason and ended up killing the one man she loved (who then Mago thought could be reincarnated into some firefly for the next 1000 years). But if you killed someone, why have them stick around to save you? By the end, I realised that in order for JMW to move onto the next life, all she needed to do was retrieve from her memory collection of how she killed that guy before letting him escape from the jar and assisting him with the next phase of his life. And so, then what of GCS? For me, he was nothing more than a scapegoat that Mago planted into JMW's life.In terms of JMW's character, I really did not like her one bit. I've seen many dramas where the leading lady is not painted out to be the damsel-in-distress, and I can tell you now that JMW is in fact one. Either way, I felt very disengaged from her character for many reasons and whilst I understand that these are all the traits which pins down her character, I can't help but to feel that these are traits which makes me dislike her even more.First, she thrives off money and luxurious purchases - without this materialistic aspect, she would be nothing she says. Not to mention, she's addicted to sourcing only the finest of French wine and foods which only adds to the increasing debt; hardly making her self-sufficient and independent. Second, why was GCS made the sacrificial lamb when JMW's previous human managers could have done been given the same responsibilities and duties as GCS thereby speeding up her process of heading to the afterlife by helping resolve the wishes of her hotel guests. Sure, I get her past managers weren't all men, or as young, handsome and savvy like GCS, but at least they were too humans who were emotionally present and could have helped her realise her mistakes sooner if Mago planted that flower inside any one of them. Third, her character lacks depth and JMW for the most part did not budge an inch until the last episodes.GCS's character was well... I'm not sure? I love Yeo Jin-goo, but his character I feel was more like a supporting cast type of character rather than a breaking lead role. He went and helped JMW be a better version of herself, and even risked his life by helping out the ghosts who were either wronged or died under very sad and distressing circumstances. However, all the ghosts' side stories were more touching than JMW and GCS's stories combined. At least, and for the most part, each character ghost had unique storylines.As we are all aware, what is a drama without a plotting romance between the two leads? Sadly, and much to my dismay, I felt absolutely zero connection between JMW and GCS. Whilst you could see that GCS cared deeply for JMW, and JMW very subtly did the same, there was no romance to simply put it. For there to be romance, you have to feel it - the intensity, the chemistry and the pain in the eyes and portrayal of emotions. Here, I can't help but feel that everyone who says they witnessed the deep love those two characters are lying to themselves. You want to see real on-screen romance? Go watch Crash Landing on You, that Winter the Wind Blows, the Master's Sun, Healer, Reply 1997, Secret, She Was Pretty, etc.StorylineWell, this one was just lacking in all aspects. I understand JMW spent 1000 years living to right her wrongs but as per my previous statement, why did it take 1000 years when another human could have landed the scapegoat role within the 1000 years? Even the receptionist/bell boy, bartender and room attendant's stories were far more touching and compelling, and even if it was only showcased for what seemed like 20 minutes each (which was too little IMO).There is no plot hole - the plot is simply finding out what murder she committed (which was hardly a surprise by the end) and then being freed from the chains of the tree which tied her spirits down initially, including all her grudges. When I read the plot analysis and saw the sentence ""for a crime she committed but could not remember"", I just thought well, what crime could be worse than murder itself? It's pretty self-explanatory isn't it? But the most predictable was her finding out the crime and then being sent to the afterlife before coming back as herself (I think it was) at the very end. But come to think of it, the only plot holes were that of the ghosts - why did they die? How did they die? What were the circumstances surrounding their death? In many ways, they weren't all that interesting considering most didn't even talk and had to keep leading GCS on a chase/mission to help them get to the afterlife. That said, they were nonetheless still far more interesting than JMW's story.As for Mago and the five other Mago's - why are there so many is my question? I understand the purpose of each one, but I found the whole premise of having a ""deity"" by the end extremely convoluted and random. The deity of health and wellbeing for example - I mean, what does she do with all the other medicines she makes apart from the flower-based drink JMW eventually drinks?Deity of wealth - extremely random and unnecessary given she appeared for less than 5 minutes to give JMW advice and then poof into thin air. The grim reaper Mago I also felt was extremely unnecessary because in most dramas, there is only ever one grim reaper who does the job. All in all, there could have just been the very one Mago bcos most followed the actions of the very first one, instead of each making their own dutiful decisions.Final comments.Camera compositions and flashbacks - I have never been bored with so many of the same camera positions in one drama. The tree, the entrance, the open space of the hotel, etc. And too many to name got a bit boring. Not to mention, the flashbacks were repetitive and didn't add to the excitement of the drama."
372,Hotel Del Luna,"Hotel Del Luna (HDL) was an extremely hyped up drama when it came out in 2019 and I thought the title was appealing in the sense that it really evoked fantasy cinematic vibes. Having briefly looked at the premise however, it reminded me a bit too much of the 2013 drama, The Master's Sun (TMS). Despite being a human, the leading lady in that latter named drama also had this exceptionally rare capability of being able to see and communicate with spirits; thereby being an exact replica of Gu Chan-sung's (GCS) character here in HDL.Now it's also important to keep in mind that these kinds of themes/ideas are unique to a specific writer(s) for a drama, and so as it turned out, it was none other than the Hong Sisters who wrote the scripts for both HDL TMS.

Secondly, the production was quite amazing needless to say; I could not fault one episode which did not scream ""attention to detail"". In particular, I was in awe of the grand magnificence, size and classiness of the hotel.However, was this enough to save the storyline?CharactersIf I can recall correctly, there were about six deities in total which starred in HDL (i.e. rich, poor, life, death, health, and love). Each served a different purpose, but it was mainly just one which really contributed to JMW's existence (save for the rest which had more involvement with GCS's character).In terms of JMW's character, I thought there were some aspects of her which painted her to be quite headstrong, but also many others where she came across as needy and short-tempered; thereby making her seem like a damsen-in-distress and very unlikeable. But just some further exampls. First, thriving off money and luxurious purchases to be able to live is not a new concept in the K-drama world - without this materialistic aspect, JMW would be nothing she says. Second, JMW's elegant fashion sense and mesmerising beauty no doubt won the heart of many viewers, but that alone could not save her character's god-awful temperament.GCS's character was well... I'm not sure? I love Yeo Jin-goo, but his character I felt was more like a supporting cast type of role rather than a breaking male-lead kind. The characters around him were so twisted yet he treated them all nicely only to be the sacrificial lamb. Not to mention, why him? All of JMW's previous human managers could have done been given the same responsibilities and duties as GCS thereby speeding up her process of heading to the afterlife by helping resolve the wishes of her hotel guests. Sure, I get her past managers weren't all men, or as young, handsome and savvy like GCS, but at least they humans who were emotionally present and could have helped her realise her mistakes sooner if Mago planted that moon flower inside any one of them.As for Mago and the five other Mago's - why are there so many is my question?

In many ways, they weren't all that interesting considering most didn't even talk and had to keep leading GCS on a chase/mission to help them get to the afterlife.

Sadly, and much to my dismay, I felt absolutely zero connection between JMW and GCS. Whilst you could see that GCS cared deeply for JMW, and JMW very subtly did the same, there was no romance to simply put it. For there to be romance, you have to feel it - the intensity, the chemistry and the pain in the eyes and portrayal of emotions.Other commentsUnfortunately, the camera compositions and flashbacks became very tedious to look at. The tree, the entrance, the grand hotel foyer, and hallways, etc. - each setting/backdrop did very little to present new ideas and was more or less the same each time. For example, the significance of the Moon Tree was that it claimed JMW's immortality and in many ways served as a powerful symbol of growth, death, and rebirth. Yet, a lot of the time was dedicated to the protagonists standing in front of it trying to pull out any emotions you would have developed towards them and sure, you may feel some sympathy towards JMW, but not me. Similarly, the hotel served as a safe haven for lost/restless souls who were unable to move onto the afterlife but by the end, its purpose was made redundant when it disappeared after JMW's ties with the Moon Tree severed.Finally, the flashbacks were repetitive and didn't add any excitement to the drama. While I understand each flashback served as a memory/indicator of the people JMW was surrounded by, including the events leading up to JMW's vengeance, they did very little to contribute to her character growth. In the present, she remained just as arrogant, uptight and vain as she was/did in the past and that made it all the more difficult for me to feel any sympathy for her. If anything, I thought JMW's ties to the hotel and Moon Tree served her just right, and felt way more pity for GCS who was chosen to be her sacrificial lamb."
373,Hotel Del Luna,"So I have to admit, I'm kinda new to Kdrama, but if this show is representative of the genre, consider me hooked. This show excels at conveying strong emotions in understated ways, making the show feel intimate and sincere, and it never gets cheesy (like so many Hollywood productions). The fantasy aspect is lovely and functional rather than spectacular. The storytelling takes it time, which I like. The storyline is leading in the length of the episode, so nothing feels rushed. But I can imagine that some people feel the pace of this series is slow, but I never felt that way. I highly recommend it!"
374,Hotel Del Luna,So much bored EP 14-16 especially 16. Why become like this?
375,Hotel Del Luna,Extraordinary !! From story to the cast. One of the best series of 2019. Well done!!
376,Hotel Del Luna,"As someone else wrote....get past the first 2 episodes and you'll be hooked. I really enjoyed this drama and all of the characters but I feel absolutely robbed by the long awaited interaction between Ms Jang and Go Chung Myung. It was terribly written, short and completely unsatisfying. It leaves you with the classic ""WHF?"" feeling. It pretty much ruined the remaining episodes for me."
377,Hotel Del Luna,"I love this show exponentially!! It's spooky buy not too scary; it has comedy and romance; great sets and costumes, great actors. The cinematography is amazing! I was looking for a TV show that broke away from the same old boring drivel I kept running into; and, man, did this show deliver!! Unique plotlines with twists and turns. I recommend it for anybody looking for an mini-mental vacation. You will not be disappointed."
378,Hotel Del Luna,"Hotel del Luna had me in tears all throughout. I honestly watched this one way too quickly, and I'm so sad that it's already time to move on to the next show. It made me happy, and laugh, and ball my eyes out, but it was so worth it. I would rewatch this again in a heartbeat, and not just for the queen that is IU. There was everything to like about this show- the characters, the plot, the chemistry between the main and secondary leads, the world building, the fashion (I loved every single one of IU's outfits), the soundtrack- I could go on. One of my all-time favorites (which means the next week or so will mean major withdrawals and a TV slump)."
379,Hotel Del Luna,"If you are familiar with K-drama, this review can be concluded in one sentence: watch it, and it will be one of the series you will remember forever.For other parts of the world, you have to watch this series. It contains the combination of humor and horror in a perfect recipe, with a meaningful story to many Asian culture about what love, relationship and regret mean.The image and cinematography of this series is just pure honey to your eyes. Every shot having IU there is just a picture that you want to remember or frame it and hang in your bedroom. The story telling is on point so that you satisfy after every episode, while deciding you should set aside your bedtime to watch the next one.The only concern I have with this series is the pace overall. It would be OK (or excellent) for a K-drama lover, but seems to be a little bit slow for Western audience. Some of the plot can be reduced, so 13-14 episodes would be more appropriate for Western release."
380,Hotel Del Luna,"What i like:
Story, setting, script is really good. Capturing the tragedy, emotions of the dead, and of those left behind is excellently done. Every episode's story is beautiful and told well. Costume is great. Music is good.What i dont like:
There's only little chemistry between the main leads, IU's not believable as Jang Wan Wol. The leads are talking past each other.I find myself skipping IU's backstory and more invested in the side characters and hotel guests. Scenes and dialogues are unnecessarily long. Especially in the last 3 episodes."
381,Hotel Del Luna,"Story plot is unique, Character development is really good, I love the music, I dont like romantic movies but i love the chemistry of leads in this series. Visuals are good. I really liked it.Talking about acting.. i liked it.. it suits the entire plot.. !"
382,Hotel Del Luna,The ideology of myth - in this story is wornderful.
383,Hotel Del Luna,"This is one of those productions done right. The story holds on its own, and strong actors have played it out well. I rank this show as one of my top three, along with My Mister and Black. Well, the Korean Odyssey is up there too.The team has managed to keep it emotional but not maudlin, humorous but not silly, filled with fantasy yet credible. The slowly unraveling backstory makes perfect sense, and every character is given the time he or she deserves. Even the love story, the thing I find most formulaic in Korean dramas, is done very well.I had no idea who IU was before watching the show, so I was able to appreciate the power of the entire cast on its own merit. I recommend this highly."
384,Hotel Del Luna,"Overall, I liked this series very much. Basically it's a romance across time. The main characters are Jang Man Wol, the bitter and cynical ""owner"" of Hotel Del Luna, superbly played by the drop-dead gorgeous (no pun intended), Lee Ji-eun, and Goo Chan Seong, the hotel manager, initially forced into service by Man Wol and played by the almost too-pretty-to-be-a-man, Yeo Jin-gu.The plot revolves around reincarnation, revenge and forgiveness, and
most of all, coming to terms with Man Wol's traumatic and unresolved past. The supporting characters play a role, but mainly, they have their own stories and sub-plots that provide the occasional nudge to evolve Man Wol's character. The sub-plots and the supporting characters however, are interesting enough to keep your attention with genuine tension, and the reincarnation twists and turns were imaginative.Chan Seong is not a random guy thrown into the mix, he carries keys to her past that make him a catalyst to Man Wol's transformation. He's real enough, but he's also a plant by unpredictable deities, some of whom had pity on Man Wol and wanted her to move on and reincarnate, and one who wanted to destroy her soul forever -- high stakes that would be determined by her own actions.The series went on too long. The last three or four episodes went on with the usual fillers, long slow gazes between the characters, long pauses between sentences, expressive scenery, and even one interminable annoying scene with snow falling down -- in slow motion -- while Man Wol and Chan Seol just stare at each other. It took longer than necessary to wrap up the supporting characters' destinies, and while the ending was, unlike so many Korean dramas, a ""good"" ending -- it wasn't entirely clear."
385,Hotel Del Luna,"Hotel Del Luna is a show that borrows well-known elements from most genres out there yet manages to fizzle out into nothing.Now, don't get me wrong the show has its positives. For one, the sets and costumes are beautiful. The CGI is for the most part impressive considering this is a TV-show and not a movie, although I suspect they had quite the budget to work with. Music is another aspect where this series delivers even though some songs were overused the soundtrack alone saved many scenes, especially towards the end when emotional impact was lacking otherwise. As for acting, the only one who had anything at all to work with was IU and she delivered.Unfortunately, this is where everything gets stinky. The writing is just bad. Yeo Jin Goo's character is reduced early on to solely being the love interest and the show suffers because of that. The few times the script allowed him to show emotion there are glimpses of what could have been of his character. Side-characters are nothing more than comic relief or hollow emotional impact, except for their 20-minute individual story, all hurridly concluded in the final episode mind you. Plot elements are introduced in the final episode in an attempt to make the foreshadowed ending seem more poignant than it is, but ultimately only takes away from the little that had already been established. I could go on and on but it is such a waste since the first few episodes where promising and then it completely stumbles and falls less than halfway in.The direction was okay. There were loads of reused compositions and camera angles which quickly became tedious and did the stunning sets no favors. This was particularly the case inside the hotel and around the ""tunnel""-part.In my opinion, the show had its best moments when it deviated from the main story and dealt with the ""hotel cases"". These were often concluded in the same episode and managed to subtly touch upon various topics. But overall this was a huge letdown."
386,Hotel Del Luna,"I hardly give a gap between in episode to episode, if i started any serious
But this web serious gave me slow pain for ever episode and it got heavy and heavy by each episodeit took me 4 day to complete them allAt the end, they did what they said at the BeginningAnd Ever time ""punch- done for me"" score started to play tears just role out from my eyesThey really stuck to the themeAnd the ending painful but somehow it was sweet painEven it is really braking my heart
I just loved itBest k drama I saw😍 ,but a bit slow cause it dramaGot it!!!😏"
387,Hotel Del Luna,"If you want to forget all your troubles and be transported to a different world then Hotel Del Luna is ideal. I've never watched any K-drama before but this is utterly magical.The sets, the costumes and the gorgeous leading actors are mesmerising enough, add to that the strangely beautiful tale of this irascible woman with a penchant for champagne and luxury good forced to manage a hotel for ghosts with unfinished business and it's binge watching time.There is a lot of heart in the show and for me I found the premise comforting. I often had a tear in my eye during an episode but there is a perfect mix of drama, slight horror, comedy and romance. I genuinely hope there is a second season because shows this good are a rare find."
388,Hotel Del Luna,IU and Jin-gu Yeo were very attractive actors. The story was not impressive to me.
389,Hotel Del Luna,"Absolutely loved it everything acting,story,scenes i might watch it again in the future."
390,Hotel Del Luna,I just love these how each Character they really make you feel the soul of them. Love all the costumes and story lines. I enjoyed having something to keep my interest a while.
391,Hotel Del Luna,"Literally I loved this Drama,Till the last episode I was down to tears and if elt like so much happy about the ending each Moment Of this drama was memorable and Awesome I suggest everyone to watch this as it is the most Epic Drama ever It also Reminded me of The Goblin in some scenes And I Can't forget the Impact this drama left behind on me Loved it I can't say anything now Literally Epicest Drama Ever."
392,Hotel Del Luna,"Amazing acting and IU just steals the show with her beauty , elegance , dressing and acting and ensure you fall in love with her . The chemistry is awesome . A must watch I say"
393,Hotel Del Luna,"I loved all things in this drama, emotions are abundant with a social message too, Great performance from each artists especially IU, I would love to go Hotel Del Luna to work and stay with those awesome souls for 1000 yrs :)."
394,Hotel Del Luna,I gave this series a try because of the hype and good reviews but I found the plot is painfully slow for me. There are some series that make you eager to watch the next episodes but not this one. I could simply stop watching it in the middle and continue it 2-3 days later.
395,Hotel Del Luna,"The most amazing series I've ever seen. It's got magic, past live, spirits,hot people what more do you need. The storyline is forever growing and it's all tied together. I hope there's a season 2 of it this needs to be continued. Let's hope netflix does something right for once."
396,Hotel Del Luna,"Story and Direction was good.I like the Concept of Two souls falling in love after eions of Struggling without knowing of their destiny, I was full of tears When ""Jang man wol"" didn't returned from Styx,
I like the plot when they finally realize There Past Connection.Soundtrack was Amazing in the series.Actors have made Significance Performance to their Characters.I would to like see the Same Characters Once Again in Season2
I hope Season 2 will be Released Soon."
397,Hotel Del Luna,"I've fallen in love with IU since she started as a solo singer, how she keep fighting for her own musical style, then she jumped in the acting department, I guess her performance in this drama is one of the best result of her efforts as an actress & leading role. And also she admitted by herself that she feels she has a great chemistry with Yeo Jin Goo in this drama. That's no wonder it turns out very powerful & emotional when they do every scene together. Yeo Jin Goo is also very charismatic & innocent in this drama. LOL"
398,Hotel Del Luna,I want to say just that people are making this film are great heroes. Thank you very much! Interesting to watch!
399,Hotel Del Luna,"I've seen a few dozen K-Dramas, and most of them have forced romance stories, but this one takes the cake. The female lead basically enslaves the male lead, then goes out of her way to put him in danger, only to change her mind at the last moment, to swoop in and ""save the day."" The male lead seems to have the attention span of a mosquito as he eats it up and falls for the female lead. This is less 'Romance' and more 'Stockholm Syndrome.'Moreover, the plot of this drama is mediocre at best, since there doesn't seem to be any overarching plot, just episodic subplots.There's also a lack of juxtaposition and contrast between the supernatural world and the normal world. It's this sort of contrast that makes these types of shows relatable for the audience, but it's absent in this series. 90% of this show is set in the supernatural world, with supernatural problems, and the remaining 10% of the plot that's set in the normal world only serves as a foundation for the plot that takes place in the supernatural world. So the characters and subplots aren't really relatable at all.Overall, this probably is in my list of top 3 worst K-Dramas I've seen. Though to be fair, I usually don't watch any K-Dramas that receive a bad rating, so I'm sure that there are many K-dramas that are much worse than this one, I just haven't seen them."
400,Hotel Del Luna,This is one of the best Korean drama that I've ever seen after a long time!
401,Hotel Del Luna,You will never get bored in any episode and I completed it within a day fully. Very much interesting south korean drama and one of the best drama of iu💥💯💓.
402,Hotel Del Luna,The story plot for the drama is very good and the flashback scenes makes it really interesting.
403,Hotel Del Luna,"My moderate expectations were exceeded by an interesting story, great performances and an overall consistency that is often lacking in many of these dramas. While it is common to have the story move and change as the series progresses Hotel Del Luna showed it's cards then managed to retain interest as it went further into the story. Being both ""nothing is what it seems"" and ""everything is what it appears to be"" is a hard line to straddle yet this series manages to deftly accomplish this.It is time well spent."
404,Hotel Del Luna,"SO glad i took the chance on watching this, amazing korean tv drama, definitely had all the feels watching this. I also love that each episode is slightly over an hour long and 16 in the first season. I sincerely hope they make a 2nd season but the cast absolutely MADE the 1st season. Light and comedic at times, deep and meaningful in others, just an amazing concept and really enjoyable and easy to watch. Would love another series with these actors if not a 2nd season."
405,Hotel Del Luna,"Tbh I am a man that is addicted to romance movies and recently I am addicted to k drama and so far I have seen 3 Tv k dramas but this takes the cake it is not that ""corny"" and not so cringe and its plot is very unexpected and very unreal, and this series played with my emotions for that reason this is my most favorite k drama so far"
406,Hotel Del Luna,"This drama is my all time favourite one . Because the Plot that shows us has a different meaning underneath it . I hope everyone who watch this drama would recognize that part . The way we start relationships and the way we end them , all of them were nicely described using characters , plot and the OST s So Don't mss this one"
407,Hotel Del Luna,"This drama is perfect,its one of the best drama i ever watch"
408,Hotel Del Luna,"Best story line ever, great narration, acting and cinematography."
409,Hotel Del Luna,"I enjoyed the series, with good actors and beautiful scenes. However, at times the scenes dragged on a little bit and I found it a bit slow. Also, I was really sad for her first love. The misunderstood lover who kept an watch over her for so many years and put a curse on himself. I wish she would go with him at the end and her new love would take over the hotel. That would have been a perfect ending for me."
410,Hotel Del Luna,"I've never watched a Korean drama before & I really cannot remember why I decided to watch this one! However, from start to finish this has been the most enjoyable series Ive ever seen & I cannot fault a single element. IU was without question, the star of the show. She is utterly captivating with her acting ability, visuals, charm & mannerisms. Actually, everyone involved should be extremely proud of themselves. Hollywood take note, good screenplay doesn't always need to involve sex & violence."
411,Hotel Del Luna,"It really gets u rethinking what u prioritise in your life, delves into themes of forgiveness and hardship and money and relationships and youth, AND IUs OUTFITS THO OMG ARE THE GOLD STANDARD, sometimes the pacing of the stories are slow, the ending is not extremely satisfying because they dragged it out so much but it's so thought provoking it's definitely worth watching."
412,Hotel Del Luna,"Even though this series is really slow, the breathtaking visuals of each scene do compensate for it. Doesn't mean that the story line lacks in any way, everything will make sense towards the end of the series which is what makes it worth to watch till the end. Amazing performances by the whole cast should also be applauded. Even though this series are full of supernatural themes, there are times it does try to connect with the current reality as well as humans inner most desires and insecurities. Overall its a fun yet tear jerking drama(towards the end especially) but requires a large amount of patience and time to give it a watch."
413,Hotel Del Luna,"I just got around to watching this. Let me start by saying I fell absolutely in love with this show. It has a really unique fusion of whimsy, humor, romance, horror and drama. I loved the soundtrack score and the visuals were beautiful. The story was imaginative and endearing. The ending was beautiful and heartwrenching. Where the show lost a couple of points for me is that it dragged at times with very slow and sappy romantic scenes. I'm not opposed to romance and I liked the chemistry between the main characters. I enjoyed their relationship. But there was just too much lengthy, wistful staring laid over sappy romance ballads that felt like a million other shows you might see. They really had something special with the premise of this show and I think they lost that in the pace. I would still recommend this show and would love to see more like this."
414,Hotel Del Luna,"This was such a beautiful enchanting story it truly transports you to another realm , I appreciate the beauty, intricacy, the details, special effects the music the actors were amazing and I binged watched this whole movie over a 3 day weekend , after such a stressful week , this was the best Ive seen just yet , they did a magnificent job , I laughed, cryed, and cant wait for the Blue moon!!- Definitely a must watch , dedicate some time to emerse yourself in a bit of the afterlife , such a fun memorable story line."
415,Hotel Del Luna,"If you are bout 40 years old, you will understand the meaning in this series in every part of characters showing.Good story good actors/actresses"
416,Hotel Del Luna,"IU is hauntingly beautiful in this series. Watching her alone is more than worth the investment of time in watching this series. But add on top of that a multi layered storyline that will keep you guessing, one of the best sound tracks that will have you watching the music videos over and over and finally topping it off is the performance of Ji-goo as the Hotels manager. This series will stay with you long after the last episode."
417,Hotel Del Luna,"I'm not really into Korean drama, but when I saw this, I felt the topic was unique. And when I watched it, it has the scary part, the romance part, the funny part, and the importan lesson part. I usually also do not listen to K drama songs thag I happened to watch, but after finishing this one, I opened Spotify and listened to the songs. I would never regret to have invested my time watching this."
418,Hotel Del Luna,"I've seen probably 50 or 60 K-Dramas, and this ranks as second only to Goblin on my list. So many are good, but this is something special. I cried about 30 different times while watching. The emotions are deep and strong and real. I will definitely be watching it more than once. The two leads are beautiful and their relationship fraught with uncertainties. It covers a thousand years and so many good-byes and bittersweet reunions. It transcends death itself. Don't miss this jewel."
419,Hotel Del Luna,"Generally i don't like romantic drama series or films. I statrted this series because of horror genere. But Del luna is great combination if all the generes. Good performances, story direction.Simply Amazing...."
420,Hotel Del Luna,Love the storyline. Main actor and actress are well played in their roles. Highly recommended!!
421,Hotel Del Luna,Very few series change a person's mood from sadness to utterly joyful and this is one of those
422,Hotel Del Luna,"No Korean drama made me so emotional ever, until i found this online. I especially love the soundtrack for this drama, because it suits the theme to the drama. For me personally i think this drama is mixed with every drama genre and i love the cast. I've never been so excited waiting for an episode, suggesting that this is one of the best dramas i've seen."
423,Hotel Del Luna,This is so far one of my favorite K dramas. So far from the first episode until the end is good and easy to follow. Unfortunately the ending seemed to be ended abruptly that the viewer couldn't understand.
424,Hotel Del Luna,"I don't understand the admiration for this drama. For me, the best scenes are those showing the past (completely different filmed, the second camera operator?).
Most sparked between Go Chung Myung and Jang Man-wol. The scenes with them were magical. An unfulfilled love that had no chance to develop in such circumstances.
However, the romance of Jang Man-wol and Jin-gu Yeo at the beginning more like a bromance, and finally strongly sugary. Overall, drama is a big plus."
425,Hotel Del Luna,"It's been a while since i've ever hooked up to a drama this much , the stories are so well written and it tells a lot of stories from just 1 episode, which make it a roller coaster of ""feels"" . the stories progress in a nice pace which is really nice ,couldn't get bored and keeps you wanting more every week"
426,Hotel Del Luna,The best drama ever !!! And good actress especially for iu
427,Hotel Del Luna,"Well i must say that this drama has really touched my heart, i usually don't sad while watching k-drama but this drama or this type of dramas really made me sad (Good kind of sadness). The End was really a new way of journey after a short cameo of Kim Soo-Hyun. All the characters have played their roles very well. Sometimes you laugh sometimes you sad, this is what a good drama must be. Thumbs up to the main characters - IU and Yeo Jin-goo. Sulli's role was also good. This must be the best k-drama of 2019!"

544,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Yes there is a love story, yes it can be described as sappy/cliche. But you would do the show a disservice if you'd just boil it down to that (which a few have done according to others commenting on this)! This is made with gamers in mind and as a gamer, I do appreciate it.A very interesting and complex story (at least at first). For the uninitiated it may seem strange, but I probably would be doing similar things our hero is doing here. Having said that, it sometimes feels weird just watching certain things unfold, instead of doing them. It is not as enticing ... still the show does an overall good job portraying certain things and our main character has to go on quite a journey and evolve! He has flaws to put it mildly. Predictability issues, the mentioned ""love affair"" and cliches in general (with repetition, you couldn't not get what this was about if you tried) are a bit in the way ... like an enemy not letting this level up, where it could be, to put it in terms the show is engaging at ... Still decent if you are into that sort of thing"
545,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,This is a must watch series that is so unique imaginative and original. Each episode is so unpredictable. The way the game and reality are merged is clever. Love the structure and flashbacks that explain things in the complex story. The emotional part of the story and the romance is surprisingly involving. Park Shin Hye is excellent at acting sad worried and crying. Hyun Bin has the right attitude for the role. The scenes in Spain are atmospheric and the music is haunting.The South Koreans have made a series much better than many a Hollywood series. This is a groundbreaking series and I hope for season 2.
546,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Memories of the Alhambra is an ambitious drama. It creates interest right from the start, with the mysterious disappearance of the creator of a live action game in Spain. Actually, the first two episodes were really good. As the viewer is trying to figure out what is going on and to understand the new technology and new drama genre that this drama introduces, the tension builts up and the action scenes become more and more. So, the good parts about this drama were : A) the game plot, B) the ending, C) the performances, D) SGI and action scenes. However, there were major wrongs about this one. First of all, the romance was weak and just wrong. They got together out of the blue and it is hard to believe that they developed feelings so strong to the point that they would worry so much for each other that it made them desperate. Also, the leading lady was really annoying. Not that the actress didn't play her role well. However, the script just killed the character. She ended up being this weak character who the only thing that did was worry about everyone and cry. And then there were the plot holes. Like, they just left their brother to another country, moved to Korea and a year later they remembered that he was missing (?!!). Finally, the plot was so slow paced that it felt like I was watching still the first episodes when the drama was halfway finished.
So, 5.5 out of 10, because this one had so much potential but the romance and the weak leading lady ruined it."
547,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This is truly a fun show. Sadly, I do not speak Korean, but I am fluent in Subtitle and that's good enough. Well paced and just plain awesome."
548,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Viewers should first be cautioned there is a heavy, heavy body count and no shortage of bloody scenes in this. Yes, this takes place in a ""game environment"", but the film doesn't spare any detail in the representation of PVP or PV-NPC violence. Personally I'd have rather seen a bit less red gelatin strewn around and a bit more logical story-telling.This is a Kdrama 8-episode story done in 16 episodes. The last 4 episodes weren't a total loss, but they were excessively drawn out, using numerous and excessive flashbacks. One flashbackwas severely inconsistent with an earlier episode (the return home. Those who have seen this know what I refer to). The entire series could have probably been done in 8 to 10 episodes and held up better. Seriously, how many massive battle scenes does one need to establish the point of the plot? How many subplots, minor unimportant characters, how many flashbacks on flashbacks?How many times will they play that annoying ""My heart is You"" love song (get the pun? Huh? Huh?) .Get on with the story! Sixteeeeen long episodes...Add to that the annoying habit of the director building to a huge climax and suddenly cutting away to another scene (repeatedly throughout the series). I frankly felt like hunting down the director and practicing a bit of PVP myself.This series has a highly interesting (but not unique) premise: a virtual world that becomes all too real. But it's excessively drawn out; they could have made this leaner and wound up with a far better story.The American subtitle translation once again includes gratuitous language not in the original story. (Did they have nothing more intelligent to write?). This growing habit betrays integrity to the original writing.One aspect of the story really jumped the shark: the concept that a virtual game and a pair of contact lenses could actually create a dimensional rift and alter reality itself. Agreed they did mention that in the story telling, but it was still pretty difficult to swallow. That way-too-fictional plot element caused quite a bit of user comment and concern, and rightfully so.As far as the system being able to wound and even kill a player, that's not so difficult to believe. The lenses already tapped into the human psyche. There have been actual real-life cases of people dying because they *thought* they had been shot or otherwise wounded... and apparently their mind just gave up on being alive. That concept was intrinsic to the plot and not difficult to accept. However, the system continuing to work and even tying in to game data when the lenses were removed? That made no logical sense, and no effort was taken to explain why.THE ENDING sucked swamp water. Sixteen episodes and then they drop that unpolished turd of an ending in the audiences lap. What happened, did the writers run out of the oh-so-product-placement coffee packets? All of the complaints about the lousy ending are warranted and well-founded.Regarding their use of female lead Shin-Hye Park: whatever chops she showed during the first several episodes was quickly smothered as they directed her into a continually weepy emo-figure who was oh so woefully sad and upset all the time. Yes, there were times she was strong, and loyal, and romantic, and she certainly was lovely (especially when playing Emma), but I'm not sure which required more water on set: the thunderstorms or the continual flow of tears. Creds though to the actress for doing her very best. She worked well with what they gave her. Would she have done better as a double-blade wielding Samurai rather than a guitar-maker? We will never know.Creds also to the costuming and makeup staff for Emma. A total vision of loveliness in multiple beautiful dresses, each presentation perfectly executed.The grandmother was a chuckle, and the young sister was a hoot. Her presentation of total honesty was well-portrayed. She played off perfectly against Yoo, who was continually amazed at her audacity. An enjoyable character.I could say more about the characters, about parts I enjoyed, about things they got right. It is certainly a memorable series and story... and made me a big fan of the titular song (Memories of the Alhambra), but sadly the series could have been done so much better. I'd have liked to seen it with fewer episodes, far fewer flashbacks, with less emo and more pro-active, leaner and yes, a far more satisfying ending than what they dropped on us after 16 episodes."
549,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"A series based on gaming gone bad and that only has life when it focuses on character which is rare and gets rarer is bound to screw up. Thus the horrifically bad last two episodes. Shame because the actors are among Korea's best and tried hard, but couldn't overcome the bad writing and silly bug issues."
550,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"If your going to do a sci-fi series that has to be the focus. Sometimes it can be combined with a mysterious element, romantic, or comedic.
I was immediately sucked into this show, which pretty much stayed mainstream on topic for the first 7 episodes.
Then for some reason all sorts of ridiculous undeveloped cheesy drama is thrown in and to add salt to the open wound, chunks of episodes are like reruns, because the ""dramatic-interpersonal enlightenment"" is supposed to make me have a different or better understanding of an old scene.
The primary focus ""The flaws"" in this game and I assume how it interacts with brain chemistry being investigated gets interrupted by launch deadlines, deaths that have no forensic murder evidence and a giant mish-mash of what turns out to be garbage.
I've also seen this pattern in ""Possessed"" & ""A Korean Oddesy"".
I don't know if it's cultural. I know for the first 6.5/7 episodes I'm rating these series a 8-9 for story and entertainment. But to say ""Jump The Shark"" is too generous! These writers take the show to the top of the Freedom tower and leap straight down to death. I'm not even watching and saying to myself ""I hope this will get back on track""...The show takes such a U turn with pointless time jumps that you know it can't redeem itself.
As a series I'd say don't watch this, but the polarization of the first half and second half is like artistic Manic Depression! So I gave it a five.
My general opinion not every episode needs to be 90 minutes nor does it need 16 episodes. Stay focused on the primary story line otherwise all your doing is baiting an audience and then frustrating them. I feel if this show stayed on course and wrapped up in 12 episodes it could have been a classic sci-fi-thriller.
Instead I start off with Black Mirror and end up with late seasons of Scandal."
551,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I don't like tv series usually too long but this was grt
Hope they make a no2 series pref shorter or best yet turn into a movie sequelKingdom was grt as was 4 parts but sometimes linger dint mean grt. But in this case it was ok"
552,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I so wanted to like this more then I did as parts of it were brilliant. The problem isnt with the clever plot or acting but my enjoyment was marred by the direction. They tried to be too clever with using timelines and the bouncing back and forth just led to repeating storylines and disjointed flow. Also aspects of the story such as the romance of the lead actors just feels forced.
553,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This drama is definitely worth watching. Its extremely exciting and engaging, with unique adventures and characters packed with unexpected twists. This scriptwriter specialises in this wonderful branch of suspenseful tantalising fantasy mixed in a slice of life drama. Thank you for providing us another magical timeless piece."
554,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I give no rating since i just see one epd. But i heresay in forum and newspaper in my city that the ending is terribly dull. It is lucky that i have not finished watching it. Or i would be in the midst of Mr Sunshine ending symdrum again.
555,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This digs deep in intertwining virtual gaming and reality. A major investment company is going to invest in software that is the next level in the gaming world. The CEO gets a call from a young man who actually developed the game and wants to meet him In Granada. When the CEO gets there it seems the young man has disappeared. The CEO starts to play the game to find out what happened to the developer. Early on the CEO has an opportunity to get revenge through the game on his former co-founder and best friend. His former friend had stolen his wife. However something goes horribly wrong during their virtual battle and while he thought he killed him in the game it seems he died in reality. This cast suspicion on the CEO as having been the last one to see his former friend. Under suspicion, the CEO continues to play the game not only to test it but try to find out what happened to the developer as well as discover if it's dangerous and should not be released. He meets the young developer's sister and they begin to have feelings for each other. This movie really had it all a compelling mystery, lots of action, and what if about the future as well as a very believable romance. It also had a bit of a Cinderella element in that the lead character goes from rags to riches thanks to the money the family is given for the virtual game. I liked it and stayed entertained the whole way through and actually would've rated this much much higher if the ending was not left so up in the air. This one in particular seems like it was set up for second season. I would've much preferred if they had wrapped it up and left it up to viewers whether or not to watch subsequent seasons. The next season could have had some elements or even been a different storyline related to the game. One thing I've always liked about Asian dramas they typically only run one season. I also thought it was sad towards the ending when it really didn't need to be. I'm just someone that really likes happily ever after and I thought there was a perfect opportunity for that to happen. There were some really sad happenings along the route and I was willing to accept that but I really do not like it when things are not happy with the main characters. It is the first I have watched where I really did not like the second guy. Second guy did things that were really uncalled for and the female lead did not take him to task as much as she should. I really wanted to see the main male lead character happy because he had such a tragic life according to what he shared with the female lead. The female lead's sister had a cute personality and I loved all her interactions with the male lead. Great characters, great story, just not a very good ending. Still well worth the watch."
556,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This series has so much going for it: an unusual and compelling plot; two wonderfully likeable central characters written and acted to perfection; and an involving love story.I wanted to award it a rating on 9 or 10.Then came the final episode. I think I understand what the program makers were striving for - something more nuanced and memorable than a standard happy ending, a high with a difference that would linger in the memory. If they achieved that then I have no doubt I will be back to upgrade my rating from the 8 I have awarded.My initial reaction is one of disappointment. When you like the characters so much you want things to work out for them in a more obvious way."
557,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Excellent Korean drama that keeps you fascinated most of the time. I say most of on purpose because there are some small cultural annoyances that break the spirit every now and then, and some logical fallacies that are mostly visible for people with a technical background (like me).
And there are over the top product placements that are sometimes silly like there seems to be only one brand of cars in the world and always positioned best looking. Also the Korean idea of a love-song is...well...Korean pink sugarcane...just a bit too much for western liking. Also the sideline with yu-ra is a bit far-fetched and doesn't add too muchHaving that said I have to immediately add that these are small annoyances compared to the excellent story-line and acting. The show is fun to watch and keeps you wanting more....too bad it is 16 hours of binge-watch, a bit too much."
558,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I'm really stumped as to why this show is considered one of the best Kdramas. I'm a software developer who loves fantasy shows, two themes featured in this drama. I also loved Hyun Bin in Crash Landing On You and Secret Garden. But why why why couldn't I get drawn in to this? Might it have been because of my pet peeves - excessive gore and a wimpy, weepy female lead?"
559,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I watched up to ep 6, and I found it boring, the romantic screens are so cheesy and terrible, and the revenge game started not to make senses. I searched online and I found many disappointed reviews, hence I gave up.Pro: the beginning setting was mind blowing, playing reality game in real life with eye contacts. Good CGI, exotic style and architecture.
Con: weak social relationships between characters, zero chemistry. Most importantly is lacking realistic to being poor and act poor in Spain when the character has so many jobs, just plainly cliche."
560,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I just watched episode 15, which means there's only one more episode before this story ends. I really don't want to say goodbye to these characters and this gripping saga. But I'm glad that I've had the opportunity to enjoy this amazing drama/action/romance plot.I am already a big fan of Park Shin-hye, but this is my first time seeing Hyun Bin in action - I'm definitely a convert to his work too. The rest of the cast does an excellent job as well.I'm intrigued to know if the writers of the show are going to manage to tie all the loose ends together by the end. One more hour to find out!!This drama is one that I highly recommend."
561,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Slowest drama I have watched. The idea is great and has loads of potential the acting is good and I believe the action scenes have quality , but unfortunately the characters are poorly developed and if I talk about the female lead ( although her performance is great) her character is completely useless and lacks personality, such a shame. The ending also leaves you so unsatisfied."
562,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The 1st two episodes of this series were just perfect. Any gamer would totally dig this series but that's until episode 3. From then, all kind of balance the story had will go away. The protagonist literally went through hell dealing with an impossible situation related to the VR game that made him lose so much in the process. I had to put up with it in hopes of an ending that can at least make it all worth it but they ended up messing that up as well. In the end, we were left with a continuous storytelling of stress and misery throughout the whole series with no moment of breath for us or the protagonist. And to make it even worse, the ending killed this series entirely. This series at least requires two extra episodes just to subdue the amount of hopelessness it portrayed. The way they left things was so infuriating. This series had so much potential and they had to ruin it. What a big loss for real."
563,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I knew from the reviews that the ending wasn't good so I didn't have high hopes but it turned to be of pretty unique concept and really liked it altogether. There were few drawbacks but other than that quite enjoyable. The finishing isn't that bad either cz it's obvious that he did exist as a master and continued playing and didn't get erased as a bug
564,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,Was giving 9 star but then I watched finale .. disappointed end
565,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"An excellent series, we'll played, well directed.... strongly recommend 😊"
566,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I love the series but honestly the last two episodes were a disaster. They screwed up the whole series.
567,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I love both the main actors, probably why I started watching this. Then I loved the first few episodes because it seemed like scifi meets magic or scifi(alternate world/reality), and so many questions and plots were created about the game in the beginning that I kept on watching till the last episode hoping to get some clues or answers, but all the writers did was create more plot holes. And to all that's happening in the entire show, the reason was ""a bug"", like seriously dude wtf? The writers created something they didn't know what to do about it. And they were clueless about explaining things scientifically.5 stars to premise, the actors, the beginning of the show. But rest of it is just clueless."
568,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"If you have a romance that is part of the story, then you MUST give the audience that feel-good, happy romantic, sugary ending. All the audience got was Yoo helping another Virtual Player...
Jung Hee and Yoo HAD TO MEET in a tear-jerking reunion."
569,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Very well put together. Its little bit like sword Art online. I'm sure something like this is coming in the future. We already have so much technology. This serie has a lot of science fiction and fantasy of course. I noticed that the actor likes music in many series🙂
Good job and good acting!👍"
570,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"So captivated by the story, the acting, but most of all the setting: beautiful Granada, Spain, and the magnificent Alhambra! with some scenes in Barcelona and Paris. Watch this show just to get a glimpse of the locales is enough. For some of us, we may never get to see these places in person. You must suspend your disbelief in order to fully enjoy the show: A gaming program gone wrong and how it interwove with reality was a stretch. But it was an innovative idea nonetheless. Acting all around was superb. I was on the edge of my seat. But the ending left me feeling cheated. Maybe the producers are hoping/planning to make a sequel...dunno. But I hate open-ended endings. They should give this one a solid close. There were a few plot holes, but I'm not going to nitpick. Overall, I enjoyed it all the way up to the final episode's ending. Sequel, pppplease."
571,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"One of the best short dramas I have watched. Very engaging and well played by all actors. Unlike silly Hollywood dramas which from the beginning you know what is going to happen in here you have to guess and wait for the next episode to find out, which adds to the mystery. In addition the characters were all three dimensional and good. In response to a silly reviewer who said the leading lady was weak. So a young girl who runs a business and keeps the family together as well as works 3 or four different jobs to keep the money flowing is weak? Go and watch your brainless unrealistic Hollywood shows, there you see women punching men and acting like men to be acceptable, here women can be themselves and still play a significant role.
Highly recommended."
572,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"We have reached the point where science fiction cn at last be shown properly i films and now on tv, This show has great special effects, intelligently used that really add to the story, Great acting, especially Hyun Bin but all really good, exciting story with twists and turns and for me at east a great ambiguous ending, ready for season 2 if it is ever made. Loved all the European settings and the parts shot in Seoul. Can't think of anything I would have improved."
573,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"It has it all! Very intelligent sci-fi story, together with suspense and romance in beautiful places. The two basic actors were very good.Actually I saw this TV series after having seen Crash Landing on You, where I fell in love with it and also with Hyun Bin. I strongly suggest you to see Crash Landing on You too. For me it was one of the best love stories I've seen so far!Memories of the Alhambra is a great story, well structured and filmed. One of the good things it's the suspense, because you never know how the game will evolve and how the basic character will resolve each situation. Very engaging.Lovely heroes. The rich CEO and the innocent girl. How could these two so different people find a point where they could mix their worlds? Well, the story made it happen in a very good way.And despite that some users here did not like the ending, I found it very intelligent and quite promising! Definitely expecting for Season 2!!! :)Excellent!!! Highly recommended!!!! :)"
574,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Very unconventional story, i was so engaged watching it but i suppose the ending was too abrupt, that it left a lot of things unexplained in the story, such as:
how to explain the demarcation of physical and AR matter/ particles, like the spilling of blood, death, injury.. it doesn't really make sense.how did se-ju manage to free himself from his hidingwhat happened to marco? Isn't he a bug himself?does the ending imply that Hee-Ju can only meet Jin Woo in AR realm? Can't she see hum if she logs out of the game? Unexplained.why is Jin Woo able to see the NPCs even after logging out of the game? He was not yet the master to have such abilities.A lot more plotholes, left unexplained. But I suppose MOTA is a niche performance by Hyun Bin. Park Shin Hye is a delight though her character does not have that exciting edge, more or less a damsel looking for her love. Nevertheless, the spark between the two leads seemed forced.It should be stretched to 20 episodes.. or the director could've cut out the repetitive scenes."
575,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I loved the storyline of this drama. It is all about internet gaming in a big way, but something goes wrong with the game and people are getting killed. I had to keep watching to find out what was going on.Things I would have liked more--there was a lot of fighting (within the game) with swords, guns, snipers, knives and it seemed a bit excessive.I would also have liked to see more of the romantic part of the storyline.The ending was a little bit unsatisfactory for me. I probably won't watch this again as I have watched other dramas more than once. Something has to have a really good ending for me to watch it more than once.I still give this 9 out of 10 stars because it is refreshingly original."
576,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I watched Memories of Alhambra because I am a Hyun Bin fan by way of Crash Landing On You. I am not a gamer. So this review is for anyone like me who wanted to see Hyun Bin in something else available on Netflix.I'd say the beginning is fascinating because of the premise and special effects. Those are well done. And it's nice to see Hyun Bin's cheekbones again. BUT... the writing in this show is nowhere near the caliber of CLOY. About halfway through, the plot falls apart, and my impression is the writers just started throwing stuff out there like spaghetti on the wall to see what would stick. The logic completely breaks down, there's lots of shooting and killing, and Hyun Bin's character is a bit of an ass.The female lead loses her personality quickly, and becomes a mere function instead of a character. The chemistry between her and Hyun Bin is very meh, no sparks as there are in CLOY. (He has more chemistry with her kid sister, and she's a tween!) It's all very beige. No heat. Just rain and lightning flashes and the tune Memories of Alhambra playing over and over again. At this point (I'm at Episode 14), I am sooooo sick of the song. Nothing like the poignant song placement in CLOY. No clever intertwined plot like CLOY. No fun side characters like CLOY. The women are all especially disappointing. By episode 10 is when the plot fizzles out and it just feels like random fights, blood and guitar.So if you are curious, I'd say watch up to Episode 10 and call it a day. I'm really glad Hyun Bin found a meatier project with CLOY, where he can play a more complex character. Memories of Alhambra is a waste of his talent.Ps - If you decide to slog through the second half, I wanted to add an extra note regarding the last two episodes. I don't know what people are going on about, because there is definitely closure to the story. All characters (except Marco?) have a resolution. It's very clear what the author has decided to do with the main character. Not sure why people are mystified by this.But honestly, I think you can spend better time doing something else."
577,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I have to say that the beginning can be a little confusing and even sort of random. The story gets better as it goes on but the last episode is just the worse. I can't believe they developed the whole story to have the main character killed by ""her loved one"" (Emma from the game). They didn't even made it clear if they were going to see which other or not. Disappointing end (and sad)"
578,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This grabbed my attention from very first episode. It was tough connecting the dots. But a lot has been either overlooked or kept unanswered. Why wasn't Marco's bug destroyed? There was deadbody for everyone except Jin woo. He was destroyed but still in the game after reset. Why heeju left playing guitar? I mean this is not important but why was that part never completed? Why only these people couldn't logout even after removing lens? How jinwoo could walk without support in later episodes in the game, while in earlier ones he wanted to have guns because he couldn't walk and fight?"
579,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"It is a well done series with elements of fantasy, comedy, romance, mystery all bundled into one program. Hyun Bin plays the attractive CEO of a gaming company who wants a game created by a young Korean living in Spain who has disappeared. Park Shin Hye plays the sister of that game creator and who runs a hostel in Granada. Once Hyun Bin starts playing the game, there is no getting out and he becomes more and more drawn into the fantasy world. Each episode is exciting-moving between the fantasy world and the real world."
580,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Tenth episode. I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what was actually going on, racking my mind, trying to wrap my head around that... scam of a show.Beautiful scenery, a pair of my favourite actors, black people in a Korean drama! Above all, the atmosphere of a real video game is there.What then? It drives me crazy that a story does not stick to it's own set of rules!!! Especially when it targets geeks. Geeks are people who care about logic and consistency! I certainly do. Again, writters, even if you mix science and magic and dreams and drugs, you can't just go and do anything in hope the spectator won't notice.How does a player feel stuff in the game when they are not wearing gloves or special outfits? In the beginning, Jin Woo wears lenses and earplugs. Turns out earplugs aren't necessary. Only possible explanation: the lenses are actually stimulating the brain, so they provide illusions involving all five senses. BUT... they were never designed for this!How does Jin Woo stay in the game while logged out? Because the game is installed in his brain, right? Why does this only happen with a few players? Because they are bugs. Because they killed dear ones in the game. Why then does Jin Woo's secretary still see his ennemies without the lenses? He didn't kill anybody. Ah, because he's an ally. But why does this only happen right before his death, after spending months helping his boss?Last but not least. How does the game reset when all the bugs aren't removed? Wasn't Marco a bug? What about the Creator? Ok, he's the creator, so rules don't apply to him. But Marco??The biggest scam is the ""secret hiding place"" referred to as ""another dimension"". Damn, this game is something else! It opens doors to other (personal) dimensions! Le'ts buy this one. If the New Master is hiding there, how come he can get out to help other players, while the creator himself couldn't manage to contact anyone?With that and Shin Hye crying all the time...Gosh! It wasn't even a good romance.When I see all the good ratings, I understand how lame and uncaring writters still succeed. Sadly, it seems most people don't notice these things indeed.At any rate, this left me with the same feeling of betrayal (and being deeply scr**ed) as ""The King: Eternal Monarch"". Yuck."
581,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"""Memories of the Alhambra"" is a must to watch; A rollercoaster ride that keeps you hooked to the last episode and yet you want more!This show is indeed a work of art; it is beautiful, exciting, creative, smart, mysterious and mesmerizing and filled with action, thriller and adventure!Exactly like the rollercoasters where it takes you to the highest level in a slow-motion speed and from there to throw you in an exciting ride where your adrenaline strikes the roof it is the same effect with this show!The writers, creators and the actors who made this show are genius! Awesome story and the magic behind every episode compels you to watch the next episode and then the next... After episode 5 you are stuck, you get obsessed to find out how the next episode will play out! The animation and cinematography were an absolute delight and the story is just mind-blowing!I love the actors, the story and the music! And Hyun Bin is brilliant as an actor!I love how the story incorporated some of Alhambra story especially the part of Fatimas Hand and the Key. Beautiful! Love it!I am not gamer but this show gave me a lot of respect to the game-creators haha :)Like many else mentioned in their reviews the end wasn't exactly what I hoped for but maybe the creators wanted the viewer's own magic to craft their own ending to the story ;)All love and respect to Korean series! I am glad I discovered and I just love Korean series!Korean series are way much better than the depressing Hollywood and Bollywood series where you either get depressed or bored out.Peace and thank you!"
582,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,Writers Should have put in more efort into making Augmented Reality twist in the story a little believable.The four stars is for the acting and screenplay inspite of the flawed AR fantasy concept.Do not waste your life's16 hours if you are a busy person.
583,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I enjoyed the show up to the 13th ep. It was downhill from there. I would give 10/10 for the idea. 3/10 for the romance. there was NO chemistry between the mail leaders although both did a great job. But the ending.....horrible.
584,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"If I could, I would give a 10/10 , but this ending does not suit these series.. I watched 16 episodes for this? I can't accept it. My heart still hurts."
585,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Memories of the Alhambra is a fascinating, totally engrossing TV series, whose main character is at times confused or even lost (as is the viewer) in his pursuit, because the boundaries between reality and augmented reality are often blurred in the film. The world of state-of-the-art technology blends with that of ancient warriors and primitive weapons in a way that constantly keeps the watcher's attention on the edge. What is truly intriguing is that the plot is not predictable: when you think you can anticipate the next move, something goes amiss and you are again trapped in the labyrinth of the story, just like in a video game.The continuous overlapping of the two realities is an interesting concept in that it proposes a brand new future to video-gaming. Although I could not identify myself with the hero because I am not a gamer, I can instead imagine that players will be able to do it. Also, to help a little, there's a fine line between the world of people and that of sci-fi, and this threshold is created in terms of atmosphere. The colorful streets of Granada, the girl's house, the guitar shop, are all so lively and hopeful, while the realm of the game is always preceded by thunder and storm, or even light rain, anyway things that cloud not only the eye, but the mind as well, trapping the users into a deceitfully similar, but actually completely different place.As for the ending, it is quite powerful. While it does leave room for season 2, I personally do not think there will be one, nor does it need to be. I cannot decide whether, as the last message of the film clearly states, "" faith is the magic that changes the world, not technology -""which is obviously the clue for Jin Woo's fate - or, especially because the game goes on, it is actually the other way round..."
586,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"From the first episode I began wishing someone would actually make a game like this (minus the bugs).
Hyun Bin is superb and was such a convincing actor.
I gave this a 10 because of Hyun Bin and because of the premise.However, these are my cons:
1. I could have done without the romance element. She was too young, immature and had the same worried look on her face for all 16 episodes. I would have been happy if all her character did was get yelled at by Jin Woo for running a crappy hotel then selling the hotel to him.2. It was annoying that for every 2 lines of script, someone's phone would ring. It would be at the least opportune time and they would all be ringing up each other and taking forever to get to the point.3. The ending - yes it's everyone's pet peeve. It would have been nice to see him remain the Master and be reinstated as CEO and make a helluva lot of money by rolling out the game worldwide.I kinda wish they had made this into a hollywood style movie intead, with a faster pace, lots of action, a more believable romance subplot and a satisfying ending."
587,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Good plot, Hyun Bin acting is outstanding. Excellent direction with high quality making.All 16 episodes keeps to glued to the screen with nice editing. Watch it."
588,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I fell in love with the story within the first 3 episodes. Luckily I didn't have to be disappointed. But in the end the director disappointed me. After watching a few episodes, I was wondering why the rating of this drama is less than 8 despite having such a beautiful story. Even at the last minute I was so excited that there was going to be a great ending. But in the end I had to be disappointed. It feels really bad to accept the consequences of such a wonderful story."
589,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Excellent sci-fi- creative, intelligent, full of excitement. Hyun Bin is wonderful in main part. Acting great all round. Ending very clever, complex - leaves you wondering."
590,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"My first K-drama, first 6 episodes were arguably the strongest but it managed to hold my hold my attention for the rest 10 pretty well. But boy did that ending suck as hell. I mean, what were the writers thinking?! So, disappointed had to take off a star off my rating. Overall, an entertaining but flawed show."
591,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I don't understand why it has low rating on IMDB. yes they could have given it a better ending. They could have made it a lot a lot better. But it is also true it's a show of its own. It is gripping if not anything. It will keep you hooked till the end. Yes, they could have explored many parts . They could have given it a better ending but as much as it is true it is also true that I loved the show. I enjoyed every single episode. It gripped me till the end. It has a very creative and original plot that I loved it.Watch it if you are a fan of Sci fi dramas or W.
P.S I AM LOOKING FORWARD FOR A PART 2"
592,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The idea of the show is great and till now, I am on episode 11, and i enjoy it a lot. The acting is good, the general idea interesting and some of the scenes are very impressive.
There are many plot holes that i hope to be explained but from what i read this wont happen, at least not in this season, which will be very disappointing.On the other hand although i am not from Spain i feel insulted by the way Koreans portray the country. Supposedly the family lives there for more than 10 years, the 2 younger siblings actually grew up there and know no other motherland and yet they have no Spanish friends. Not even one...like Spanish people are too unlikable to associate with. They eat no Spanish food, not even once. The grandmother at some point even emphasizes how the Korean students study a lot unlike the students in Spain and the whole plot shows them that they are parasites that lived in Spain and didnt even appreciate the country. Yes you are Koreans we know but at least show some respect to the country you use as your story base."
593,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This is such a delightful series. Its been on my watchlist since forever, finally made time for it and binge watched in 2 days.Plus points - The unique concept, very well implemented, fine actors.. Hyun Bin and Park Shin Hye are such a delight to watch! Its fast paced, keeps your attention till the last scene... Really wishing for season 2, but it's still ok to leave as is so that the quality is not diluted with sequels.Surprised that this series didn't get the hype it deserves!"
594,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The director simply should seek another job in another industry after ruining this.
Terrible and nonsense finale. No comments about the soundtracks I thought I should pull my hair off everytime I hear the same think over and over again during soft scenes."
595,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I read so much about this drama over articles and much watch list, but the overview of the plot was so vague I kept it in my watchlist for a while. But man I am like mind blown now. I would not nit-pick or criticize even one scene of the series, cause that is how strong the story is and explaining technology in words is not easy at all. The characters had such strong tight roles and they did absolute justice. This is one of those series you would watch and say, no one could have done it better than this couple. The animation and cinematography were an absolute delight. And that story is just so fresh and new. The thought that went into the tiny details are a wonder. the final salutations of the season still makes me smile ""Trust is where is magic is not in technology"". I am not a person to hope and wait for a sequel. But for this i would wait woth fingers crossed. xOxO"
596,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,7 stars is only for the male lead Hyun bin .. got addicted to it upto episode 6 but lost interest after it..
597,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Interesting premise for the story which was in general executed quite well. Light science fiction, which is to say the world in which the story is set is based on non-existent technology (though the sort of thing we might see before too very long), but the show is not ""about"" the technology. Great location shooting, good production values, strong acting. Same director as Stranger, which I liked even more and very highly recommend.The ending was reasonable in my opinion. From reading some other reviews, some would have liked, in effect, further explanation of the fate of a key character. I however was fine with the omission, as a) I do think it would have added that much, and more so, b) science fiction often fails, embarrassingly, when it tries to form an explanation around a phenomenon (as an example, the Star Wars franchise was not helped by a seeming obsession with explaining ""the Force"" after the original trilogy).As with many good dramas, sometimes well-loved characters die while a loathed one may survive until the end, but this is just the nature of things. And indeed, others may not find the ""loathed"" character of whom I am thinking as annoying as I did.In general, if you like K-dramas which are not primarily romances, I strongly recommend this."
598,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Relentless thriller the score itself underlines the story really well. Interesting to watch the plot unfold and follow the characters through it all. Leaves you guessing to the very end, and wanting the story to continue in another instalment!"
599,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The story at core is great; the cinematography, the visuals, special effects, CGI, acting, outfits, scenery, and soundtrack are all great. However, the script is lacking. It could have been written better. The dialogues are plain and boring. The story feels dragged out. The action scenes are repetitive, they keep fast-forwarding in the future and
then going back to the past, I get its for dramatic effects, but it gets confusing and frustrating at some point. Its very slow paced and nothing much happens.Park shin hye doesnt get much screen time, she acts like a supporting character for Hyun Bin. To top that it has a disappointing ending. Feels like all the characters efforts have been for nothing"
600,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"From the previews I thought this was just another sappy K drama love story, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was a whole lot more than just a love story. There's a sci-fi element that makes this series worth watching. The concept is so original and even the love story is compelling. After each episode I couldn't wait to see where the story was going next so of course I ended up binge watching it over the weekend.The acting is great, the production values are top notch, and the characters are very likeable. Even when they do something questionable, you still want to root for them. The main character does some very shady things but that never seems to make him less likeable. The writers deserve a lot of credit because that's not an easy thing to do. I hope they'll do a second season soon because I want more."
601,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Enjoyable drama series. Skyrim must be a favourite of one's who worked on this series. I personally am not really into romance movies, but at times this show had me like ""kiss each other already dangit"".
Many people are complaining about the ending/plot holes, which is fine if that's how they feel. But most fantasy/sci fi movies have significant plot holes and yet we still love them. I.e Matrix, most Star Wars, Star Trek... It's a fantasy show, enjoy it for what it is.As for the ending, sure, some instant gratification would have been nice but alas, we can't always get what we want.
The main issue I had with this show were the many repeated scenes and minutes of staring long fully in the distance but hey. It is a K Drama. If it seems to interest you at all, check it out.
Enjoy! 😊"
602,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"A very good and unique storyline, I had fun watching it and recommend it if you like romance and video games."
603,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I definitely expected this to be more light-hearted than it ended up being, but I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it. From the trailers, I expected a cheery action-adventure, but this show is more dystopian and has a number of sad moments. However, I loved the idea of a Skyrim-type RPG in real life and thought especially that the choreography of the NPGs was excellent - the way they move and die is just like they would in a computer game. It had enough suspense and excitement to keep me hooked all the way through. I've seen a number of reviews saying that the last two episodes were a let down, but here I disagree. It's true that they weren't as happy as I would have liked, but the ending was consistent with the rest of show and left the plot open enough that the producers could feasibly release a second season. I don't know if that's something that they have planned, but I'd definitely watch it if it ended up being made.P. S. Jeong-hun is the best and Sang-beom is the worst. Why is he even there. He just follows Hee-ju around like a sad puppy."
604,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,Story made no sense. Scenes are scattered all over the place and never in chronological order. Sooooo many flashbacks. Could have been condensed to eight episodes.
605,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I watched the first episode and nearly didn't go to second but am glad I did. It was engaging and covered many genres, comedy, romance, fantasy.
Cons: I felt at times (every time) when the actors were displaying an emotion, it was too strung out i.e. the camera/scene lingered too long on the actors moment of sadness or whatever emotion being acted, instead of showing the emotion, moving on, it just went on too long which then had the effect of bringing you back out of the world that you were emmersed in whilst watching as it was like 'ok ok I get it she's upset or he is pondering his fate, move on to next scene now'. As the emotions were diplayed quite beautifully at times, I can understand why they wanted to build on it but there comes a point when its too drawn out.
Playing the same 'romantic' song each time the female lead was emotional' was pretty irritating as it was 'too much' and instead of being left to admire her acting or the moment, I found myself rolling my eyes as it was too much like making her seem like a weak victim type character.
I felt the two female actresses 'ex'wives, were one dimensional, not their acting, but their roles within the show, one was a doctor, which you would think would depict an intelligent and strong character but instead she was a wimpering victim, and all you got to her of her character were timid and sad glances but no plot to display her acting skills, the second exwife was also one dimensional, I felt she was believable as a scorned ex but you only see snippets of her being mean as with 1st wife snippets of her being weak but no actual character building. I got the impression that whoever either wrote or directed it, sees men as the strong, intelligent decision makers and the women as weak chattels. Though I was pleased lead female's character devloped throughout to become stronger/intelligent.
I also found the repeating of scenes from a 'different angle' in each episode from previous episode also too dragged out and though at times these 'explanations' worked, at times they didn't and it was just a bit irritating as often they didn't really add anything as a 'reveal' to the story that you wouldnt have surmised already.
Perhaps it is a tv culture difference between Korea and UK, but I found the male/female status very patronising for the most part of series where it seemed like the main character was always crying, running (quite gracefuly and beautifully I may add) and the male lead was always 'playing' with her emotions and acting 'superior' to her. Though I do feel this was slightly balanced out by her emerging intelligence and steadfastness, at the same time it was quite annoying.
Pros: fantastic plot idea
many scenes were beautiful, the actors were all engaging
quite often there would be a moment or scene that was like its own piecce of art it was so lovely
as the show went from episode to episode it really showcased some of the actors who at the beginning were not that 'relevant'. I adored the secretary, he was fantastic in his role, the lawer Park was too.
As the shows progressed my investment in the characters did too.
The camera work, sets, wardrobe, whole set up, was fantastic.
The plot has a lot of potential as a scifi thriller, there are so many directions that come to my mind that the story could go in based on the AR route that focuses more on a thriller avenue than romance so I hope something is made along that path.
I see it was cancelled, I think that is a shame and feel that this may be in part due to its focus on romance as as a thriller there are so many more avenues it could have gone down whilst still having the beautiful additition of the lead female input as a romantic interest.
I would recommend as worth watching as it certainly grows on you, just be prepared for many momemnts of lingering dewy eyed looks and glances off in the distance which drag on a bit(I just fast forward a few minutes) and I think you will enjoy the sweet, gentle and at times moving story as it unfolds."
606,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"First if my english spelling wrong,I am sorry for this.
I really don't understand about this story.But I admit that this series cociliate me to watch next episode and cannot wait it.And I think this series is not lazy for me and don't like korea drama series that lazy for me.Also,Park Shin Hye is the actress that I like.I knowed her in the Doctor drama series.She is excellent in the acting and I was attributed that she make her work very well."
607,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I like the actors a lot. Hyun Bin and Park Shin-hye are both talented and gave very good portrait of the characters.
My biggest complaint about this show is the plot. For one thing, the idea that a bug in an AR game affected the player's health in real life just doesn't hold... I can live with this idea for the first 14 episodes. However, in the last 2 episodes, when the writer tries to sell that Emma, a NPC in the game, can debug the code by ""killing off"" buggy characters and players, I just can't buy it. Based on the last 2 episodes, the whole story came down to a series of tragic events caused by a crappy and irresponsible teenage programmer.
Another thing I don't like is that the show uses nonlinear narrative, e.g. flashback way too much... At first, it gets the audiences curious and want to follow up. But when the writer/director uses flashback in almost every episode, it just gets old and boring..."
608,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This k-drama is so thrilling and exciting that it keeps you wanting more. Even when it ended, it still wasn't satisfying for me. I think the writer intended this sort of ending to keep the mystery aspect of this drama haunting you. It worked for me! loved every second of Hyun Bin's role, fit perfectly along side Shin Hye."
609,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This is a series where they show you something amazing and explain its mystery little by little.
It's about a super realistic Augmented Reality game. It's fun, but there is a problem.
I'm a technical person myself and I understand they want to keep it mysterious and interesting, but throughout the series I was continually making comments like: A programmer wouldn't do this, this isn't correct, why don't you check the servers, debug your program, ...
But the worst part is that the series often violates the logic they created themselves. The first season ended with an open ending leaving many questions unanswered. I wouldn't want to go through a whole second season just to see the unanswered questions answered, since I feel they messed up the ""mystery logic"" too much.
I would want to see a satisfying ending in the form of a movie tho."
610,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I enjoyed every second of it,but the ending didnt satisfy me😕"
611,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Many people hate this drama ending. I don't.
Personally, for me I believe not every drama going to have happy ending.
Amazing drama anyway. You've been warn. Watch at your own risk. Because this drama is so addictive."
612,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This series began very interesting. Good characters, actors. A fantastic and unusual show. But when it goes to end I felt something is wrong. Again and again same things happened. Then last 3 episodes were really really dull. Finale episode was the worst one. That unsolved ending. I am really disappointed."
613,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Terribly flawed, lots of bugs - pun intended, and uninteresting love story. This series tried too much to be original and complicated, making the story convoluted. Utterly disappointing."
614,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I have been binge watching this series from a while . The demonstration of the game concept and plot is nice. Romance is of one kind even though the whole series has a less of romance and more of sticking to story line. A lot of questions are still not justified on the series however may be a second part will be nice. Park Shin Hye has been always good with her acting and so pretty as always. Hyun Bin and the other supporting character steal the show and are more prominent . Over all it is nice and one of a king movie. With a new concept and story .
615,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"It wont take long for an American version to come out, as they copy all the best tv from around the world.It has an amazing concept and its executed really well, it gets a bit slow in the middle but picks up again towards the end."
616,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Firstly, i want to admit that i watched this drama because i love Park Shin-Hye . but when i watched the first Ep, my first reaction was :"" OMG, this so creative, i wanna watch more of this"". but this time i didn't said so because of her only, but also because of the story itself. i was so attracted to this drama for the whole time i watched it that i couldn't sleep. Thinking what will happen with these charters. It's the first time i watch such an outstanding drama which effect me that much. i laughed with it, cried for it, and thought of it even in the shower lol but it's true :) ... Also enjoyed watching Hyun Bin and Park Shin-hye together, they are so beautiful couple. i rate it 9 of 10 because i wanted more of this story, i hope there will be season 2."
617,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I can't say much and speak my mind about this amazing series without spoiling key events, but i can tell you from a lifetime experience in watching all kinds of series and movies of all languages and all genres that this is one TV that you would never forget, a must watch!"
618,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"If u like the kdrama ""w"" (lee jong suk) u will definitely love this! it's so cool!! i love it!! (and if u like exo, u should watch this because there is chanyeol:)"
619,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,The drama was great! I've enjoy so much but why with this ending??
620,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"When I saw who wrote this serial was the same person who wrote W, I was basically sure that this one also is very bad. But I wanted to give Netflix a chance and the concept was pretty similar to W but this serial is way better then W. But still with no surprise, scenario is confusing, has goofs and mistakes and makes no sense at some parts but director made a good job keeping you enjoy it anyway. Granada was marvelous and I liked the lead actor. Cinematography was pretty good. And I gotta say the song ""memories of Alhambra"" is fabulous so it took this serial to another level."
621,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Absolutely enjoyed the show, action wasnt the best but story line was neat along with the graphics! :) Wish there were more movies/shows like so released!!"
622,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Just finished and loved it!Don't miss it!Of course, it could be much better if we could have clearer conclusions at the end but the cast and performances were incredibly great so you are gonna love watching it."
623,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,First episode and it's record in Slovenia and in Girona (Catalonia) but not in Granada.
624,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,I've always loved Korean series and this one is by far my favourite. It had a very unpredictable ending both lead actors do a great job!
625,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"So I watched CLOY and having loved it, I asked my friend for a good k drama suggestion. He urged me to watch this drama. I'm forever indebted to him. This is by far my favorite k drama. I don't know why everyone's complaining about the ending, but I loved it as much as the entire show. This is A MUST WATCH. Don't think twice, just GO WATCH IT."
626,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Must watch.Contains action,romance,AR,emotional stuff,friendship and so on❤."
627,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"It's just my opinion....i started watching this drama with a lot of expectations and because of the cast. But i really could not get into the drama and stopped it at the 10th episode.
But a lot of people seemed to enjoy it, so give it a try! :)"
628,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,The first few episodes were so slow but after that it got interesting until the last 2 episodes. There were too many flashbacks in this drama that I skipped most of the time! Hyun bin did an amazing job as usual I find the FL had so many crying scenes actually all her scenes she was crying it got annoying and i fast forward then all! They had zero chemistry they should have cut out their love story it was not necessary!
629,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Firstly I started this series for hyun bin! And he didn't disappoint either. The use of VFX technology is brilliant.. concept is really good. I am not a gaming person but still enjoyed a lot watching. The lanes of Granada , Spain were beautifully captured.The initial episodes keeps you hooked. The narration was craftly done. By 10th episode the story seemed to be stretched a lot.There were many loop holes thoughout the series. Repeated storyline made it a little boring. The death of CEO of a company in mysterious circumstances is not properly investigated. There was no relevance given to ex and current wife of main protagonist.Professor cha's character could have been given better depth.The connection between lead couple wasn't working for me. The girl seemed to be very lost.The ending was no relief. For over an year the CEO of company has been missing and no body tries to find the whereabouts.Every one has assumed him to be dead but without any traces. No body was found. He could have died in virtual world but what about reality since all the bugs were deleted and game was reset.Sea ju apprears very dumb.At first he convinced all that mr. Yoo must have died.And in the end he is heard disscussing that mr.yoo may have been survived.Please if he is so genius why didn't he try to get him out of game then. Although he himself got missing for an year.Stupid ending with appearance of silhouette resembling mr. Yoo. Ending could have been little better."
630,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"From the first episode, I was hooked! Hyun Bin is a very good actor, which makes this show even more enjoyable. The store is very interesting and it keeps you wondering what's next. I am always amazed how high rated some Kdramas are for no reason, but this one, definitely deserves the 10 stars rating, I've seen 16 episodes and I still can't wait to see more, kind of dreding the fact that it will end soon, I wish there was an American version of this show, it's that good!"
631,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,Storyline amazing! Acting superb! Graphics wow! Bring on Season 2 please!!!
632,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This series has so many genres: action, thriller, romance. I like the idea of using virtual game as the main story. If you're a fan of black mirror, you will like this drama."
633,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,Exellent.. park shin hye is goddess😍😍 acting diva.
634,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Ive been seeing this show on netflix for a while, but the promo pic didnt quite cought my attention. It just looked like another asian love drama. Then one night I was bored and decided to watch the show to see la alhambra and basicaly seightseeing. Oh surprise, it is a sci-fi kdrama. I love the premise, the suspense, the very light love story, the characters.... i cant wait for the new episodes to come out!! 100% recomenden if u r a sci-fi fan."
635,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The first few episodes were a bit boring for me. But if you can get passed the slow start and all the korean shoutings, the story starts to pick up and gets interesting. Another minus point is too many flashbacks which I always skip."
636,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The beginning is simply amazing. I got hooked on the mystery and the atmosphere. However, I feel the story had much-much more potential than realised.I did not like the role of the lead actress. This ""damsel in distress"" part is something I don't feel comfortable with. Be scared, be afraid and be strong. Act. Do something. I like when a woman is determined. When you miss your brother you should be determined, you should do something.The ending feels forced. In the world of the story there are so many possibilities. As a long time gamer I can relate to the main actor, but I can't understand the ""I do everything alone"" attitude. Common! Get a team, do it together. I wanted the leads to team up and face the challenges together.Anyway, it's a good series, worth 8/10. I wanted, oh so much wanted the guitar to play the Memories of Alhambra again and again."
637,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I was so in love with this show since I first saw the trailer. I knew this was for me because I'm so down for Sci-fi series. Usually, there's not much sci-fi in Korean dramas but this one is outstanding. The beginning of the show is so attracting. It hooked me from the first ep.The idea of bringing AR game to real life is brilliant. So creative, you could hardly imagine. Movie pace is pretty slow for viewers to catch things up easily. (I wish it was faster like US shows). They did an overwhelming great job on VFX!!
The casts in this drama are good as well (they are famous for their great acting). I'm especially impressed by Chanyeol's acting (plays SeJu).But from Ep.13 til the end, it's full of ""flashbacks"". They put together cutscenes from previous episodes, which is a waste of screen time. It shows they lack of storyline for the ending. And that's why the ending is very disappointing.Could've rated 6/10 but because I love the idea, the VFX, and how they film is really cinematic, so 7/10."
638,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I really enjoyed this k-drama until the last episode. The series has so many genres, and I loved it (action, romance, little bit of sci-fi prbbly). It's a new idea of a k-drama, and I think it was great. Terrible ending, if it wasnt for it, I'd have rated this series with a 9, but I'll give it an 8. One of the best dramas I've ever watched though."
639,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Imagine a sentence that starts like this and suddenly it sheriff blue left right the end.
And it is exactly like that. Starts good, interesting new approach....but there is 0 Plot..too many holes, certain characters have no meaning at all, logical errors and the end is the worst ever. Great cast, horrible writer (it is not her first messing up plots) ------- and don't get me started on the bluntly ""hidden"" adds, 30% is a zoom in on her doing her makeup, eating at subway or drinking that damn water."
640,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The first time I watch this, I really thing it was just another drama romance. After that I see it for Exo member Chanyeol and I REALLY LOVE how Netflix mix the love, mystery and technology in a only one drama! I couldn't stop to watch it! I think in my mind is a drama different and so good to see"
641,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This is the best plot I've ever seen for a TV show. Best show I've ever seen, actors and creativity of writers and directors, Koreans really know how to make the best shows. I hope there will be a season 2 :-D because I'm obsessed! Thank you for making this show! And thank you Netflix for adding it to your database"
642,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Try Crash Landing if you want to watch a contemporary Korean series. It's far superior in every wayThe first episodes are wonderful, mysterious, and with both male and female leads getting good lines. Then it all goes downhill around episode 7. The pace becomes absolutely sluggish.And then spoiler alert! We get an allegory for christianity and the once spunky and accomplished Hee Ju essentially become a nun. Blech."
643,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I thoroughly enjoyed the sci-fi aspect of this drama. The sci-fi aspect was much more believable than the supposed romance between the two leads. I felt like there weren't enough moments with them together for the two to have developed something. It was really hard for me to watch the female lead character cry almost EVERY TIME she saw or thought about the protagonist. However, I may be biased because I came looking for another k-drama to watch after finishing my first, Crash Landing on You (which also stars Hyun Bin as the male lead). The chemistry in that one was outstanding so it was hard for me to immerse myself in another romance drama."
644,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The fight with the Nazari warrior in episode one is magnificent, as is the square in Granada where it is shot! But, wait a minute, is that a Slovenian letterbox I can see right next to the old couple watching in disbelief? Oh dear, please remind me to shoot in Vietnam my next series located in South Korea 😂😂😂I known, suspension of disbelief is a director's best friend!"
645,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"The representation of place 'Granada' with such an imaginative scene. The mind blowing story telling, every episode reminds you of past plot, and give chills about what's going to happen. If you don't find any of the above what I mentioned, then it will be at a point where it's dwells into emotions(story) of romance and relationship. So much different aspects/genre in one series, Glad I didn't miss this experience."
646,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,In episode 7 and this is great! Remind me of W Two Worlds which is one of my favorites.
647,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I dont understand those who didnt like the ending. This series is one of the Korean masterpieces. It's not a romance type of show, so for those who want feel swoony, you come to the wrong place but it's such a joy to watch. Having said that, i need season 2. Kinda feel like it's not over yet!"
648,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I am a big fan of Augmented Reality, and that is the best part of this all. Of course, it also has beautiful characters. It has its faults, underdeveloped relationships, loopholes in story. But I enjoyed it immensely."
649,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"We all know that a drama don't always end as we expected, but this one is a disaster.
This Korea drama have a such great materials and actors, The first half and the middle of this series are so beautiful, so I always recommend it with my friends.But the ending is really rotten.Obviously it would be a good ending or a bad ending but it gave the audience an unresolved ending. I was really disappointed."
650,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Omg, I. Have. Never. Been. Hooked. On. Anything. In. My. Life. Before like I am hooked on this show!!! Thrilling,suspenseful, I'm constantly getting surprises with my mouth open the entire time!!! A must watch! Good plot great story!"
651,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Loved everything about this k-drama.
I started the show for curiosity and then I fell in love with everything. The game story is so cool and well written like the love story.
Amazing show, plot and actors 👏🏻
I fell in love with Hyun Bin thanks to this drama.
Now I wanna travel to Spain and Korea
A must watch for sure"
652,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This was recommended by my colleague. I've completed 2nd Episode.
It's mind-blowing exponentially ! Kudos to the imagination and execution of the AR concept !! One of the best series !!"
653,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This is my first K drama and I have to say it did blow my mind at a few occasions, however the hype just petered out as the show progressed. What impressed me the most was the plot development at the beginning, how well the whole story was kicking in and grooving me into it, but the amount of plot holes there were in the story ruined my interest as it went on. The non linear style of direction was certainly eye catching but the repeated use of this for every episode made my it too boring. After the surreal idea of a story, the next best thing about this show would be the actors. Both the leads absolutely nailed their roles. The side characters were also portrayed very well by their actors. And then comes the music of the show. The background music added the perfect amount of intensity and emotion to the scenes, especially the scenes with plot twists and tension. The first part of the show was really worthy of praise. However this was the extent of the positives in this show. One of the biggest problems with the show is the lazy writing of the plot (ironic since the idea of the plot was the best part of the show). At times the plot devices used felt too convenient, like how the male lead just had to be the bug in the game while every other bug in the game, were the characters who diedplaying the game. And nobody knows what happened to the bug of the character Marco. How the male lead had to complete the quest in order to free the creator of the game who put himself in that 'dungeon' while its unexplained as to how the male lead freed himself out of the dungeon when no one else completed the quest to save him. Also how the game was affecting certain characters who played it directly, in real life. It's never told 'convincingly' why certain characters like the main lead and his allies, Dr. cha, Marco and Se ju were having real life injuries and deaths due to the consequences of the game while others users were not. Why only they were able to see the NPCs even after logging out (basically how they were the only ones getting affected by the bug of the game). Why Only few users were killed by the game while many other users still lived even after being defeated (the ones from Seoul). These are only a of the few mistakes I found that were either completely unexplained or were too conveniently told. The other big issue I had with the show were the characters. The female characters felt too one dimensional, lacking any depth in their character. And the female lead's character was confined to an overly worrisome and crying woman. The first ex wife's personality and past were too shallow to form an understanding. And the second ex wife's character felt like her presence was just to spice up the male lead's distraught life, as she was only represented as a meanie and nothing more. The humour in the show was well timed in certain occasions and at the same time, felt too forced in other occasions. The romance felt completely out of the blue and didn't really fit in well in this story(not to mention the repeated use of that same song whenever the female lead was crying in agony). But at the same time, they represented many emotions nicely. So in conclusion, I can say that this show has issues but is still an enjoyable experience if watched with low expectations."
654,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I love this drama since the 1st episode aired on netflix. I watched it with my sister every saturday and sunday night. We were hooked instantly. The story is gripping and made us curious the whole time.Then came the final episode. It wasn't a bad ending. I do understand if the writer wanted to give us an open ended finale, I get it. This whole stories wasn't about Hee Joo and Zinu relationship on the 1st place. It's about Zinu resolving and finishing the game which he finally achieved in the final episode.BUT...there was no closure regarding Zinu's character. The writer didn't give an explanation on how is he becoming a bug to the game? I don't care if he finally met He Joo again or not but his character deserves better!"
655,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"This kdrama is halfway airing and I couldn't wait to write my review. That's such a quality series, it's been such a long time ever since i watched a good kdrama. From the 5 first minutes of the 1st episode i got chills! Im hooked on it. There are a lot of unanswered questions, yes. But thats what it gets you hooked on this drama."
656,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I've never written a review before, so I guess it goes to show how much I loved this series that I'm writing a review for it! From the beginning to the end I was absolutely hooked and counted the days until the next couple of episodes were released (the last time I was this involved in a show was LOST!). One plot twist chases the next and you never know what to expect. Acting, story telling, visuals and graphics are all superb- you really get immersed in the story and the characters. They also struck a really good balance between Action, Drama, Suspence, Comedy and Romance. It has all those things but in good measure, so it never gets dull. You will be on an emotional rollercoaster ride but it will be worth it! LOVE"
657,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,This is honestly one of the best dramas I've seen it's rlly interesting and good and It has such a good plot looking forward for more episodes 👌🏻
658,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,This is by far the best thrilling suspense korean drama Ive ever watched! I started binging Korean dramas last 2017 and the rest of the series I watched were either romantic comedy or tragic/romantic genre. MOA is different and refreshing. This is a must watch!
659,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"One of the most interesting kdrama I have ever watched! I hate hate HATE the usual kdramas mostly consist with romance and no story at all. But this one, amazed me. The graphics and the story line was amazing and I love how some of the scenes really touched my heart! I hated the ending tho. I felt like he deserved to live and see how the game succeeded."
660,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,The story is very unique i've never seen anything like it before ...the one hour episode flies very quickly plus i really love the chemistry between the lead actors
661,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Wow, I can't even remember when was the last time I was this obsessed with a program. I'll admit I was a little afraid of how this experience would turn out since it's the first Korean drama I'm watching. I have nothing bad to say about the drama. Plot is great, actors are wonderful. Every episode answer my questions but fills me up with new ones to be answered in the following episodes. Basically, if you're reading this and asking yourself ""should I watch it?"", the answer is yes, you should."
662,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Wow! This show is suspenseful and addicting. The story is well organized. For all the gamer's out there, this is a MUST watch!"
663,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"Hyun Bin, Park Shin Hye and the rest of the cast did a phenomenal job in this brilliant and exhilarating piece. Anyone who's a Korean drama fanatic should definitely watch this one. We are all hoping for a season 2 or another fantastic drama where hyun bin and park shin hye will star in together again.Memories of the Alhambra was so different for all other Korean dramas and it was a definite breath of fresh air that kept us all glued to the television. I am so thankful that Netflix took on this drama for us international fans. How lucky are we. I am so thankful for the talent this whole team put together and how creative the writer is. It was so unpredictable and always kept us entertained. The soundtrack is amazing as ever! I applaud the whole team with this one.Hyun Bin portrayed his character magnificently and brought on so many emotions that I didn't even know I had :) The last 2 months have been exciting and I am so proud to say that I have been a long time fan of his work.Park Shin Hye - no one can portray her character better than she did. This girl can show so many emotions and you could tell from your very heart and soul how much her character loves Jin Woo.I hope and pray there's a special episode or a season two for these two. I feel that the story has so much to tell yet and hyun bin and park shin hye are NOT done with their characters yet. We need more. We crave more! Please give us more. Thank you :)"
664,Alhambeura Goongjeonui Chooeok,"I was very surprised and interested in the plot as it's very captivating and innovative but the coordination place with the actual place is VERY poor. It was very annoying to see that they were in ""Granada"" but it was definitely filmed in ""Barcelona"". Sometimes in the same scene, a character takes a taxi in ""Granada"" but it ends up, theoretically in Granada but definitely in Barcelona.
I stopped watching it cause those mistakes were constantly. Please make sure that if you film in a city you stay in that city!"

786,The Silent Sea,"Another good Korean show courtesy of Netflix. This one riffs heavily on the ALIEN trilogy but the story is engaging and fresh-feeling enough for that not to matter. Great to see some of the stars of SQUID GAME show up alongside KINGDOM's Doona Bae and of course nobody puts a foot wrong. Quality wise, it does rely on cliche at times and it's not quite up there with SQUID GAME, but then what is? This one's a slow-moving atmosphere piece with some unusual scenes and growing suspense as it goes on; the last couple of episodes are quite thrilling. I liked it a lot."
787,The Silent Sea,"This eight part Korea science fiction series is set in a near future where events have led to almost total desertification of the Earth. Water is a treasured commodity. With this in the backdrop Captain Han Yun-Jae has been tasked with leading a mission to retrieve samples from an abandoned lunar base. Amongst the team is scientist Dr Song Ji-An. Dr Song's sister had been one of the base's staff that was lost in a 'radiation leak' five years previously. The mission, which was due to take twenty four hours, gets off to a bad start; a crash landing leaves the crew having to walk several miles on the moon with limited oxygen. Things don't get much better when they reach the station. It soon becomes clear that not everything they were told was true, there are plenty of hidden dangers, they have difficulty finding the samples and what they find appears to be dangerous; to make matters worse it would appear that they are not alone.I thought this was a pretty solid series. It might not have been the most original but it delivered plenty of tension throughout. It is science fiction but there are also good horror elements such as what happens when people come in contact with the strange 'Luna water'. The characters were the sort one would expect in such a series; the leader who insists on sticking to the mission even after things go wrong; one trying to learn what happened to a family member; one constantly complaining and one who can't quite be trusted to mention just a few. The cast is solid; most obviously Bae Doona, who always seems to impress, as Dr Song. The effects are pretty good even if science is often ignored... for example I never though characters were operating in one sixth of Earth gravity. There are some nice surprises and ultimately I enjoyed the series so would recommend it to fans of the genre; just be prepared to suspend your disbelief.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles."
788,The Silent Sea,"One of the most agonizing efforts to watch not just one movie but a whole eight-episode series. Wanted to quit after the first two episodes. The South Korean scriptwriters threw together a whole mess of movie genres, cliches, and created an overlong, disjointed, unbelievable space disaster, thriller, espionage, medical horror television series that went beyond credibility. The one of the few reasons to watch this series is the star, Bae Doona, who came on the movie scene in the intriguing sci fi movie Cloud Atlas (2012). But the script writers with their poor dialogue and eclectic plot devices practically ruined a possibly decent movie. With way better editing, cutting two episodes, and focusing primarily on fewer characters, and a main plot outline, The Silent Sea might have been a credible sci fi movie worth watching. But a lot of what happens in this final product does not make sense and there is way too much going on. More is definitely not better here. Never to be watched again and re-experience a bewildering, convoluted, and unbelievable story."
789,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea got a solid production but that's more ore less the one and only positive aspect of the show. The story itself is a rather generic blend of well known stuff and the crew, like in so many shows and movies these days, behaves like, well, people where all brain functions are put on standby mode (I guess this is just mirroring the mental capacities of the writing staff or how much they use to write their stuff). On top, some of the physics and science stuff are, lets be tender, questionable. Cut down to a full length movie this may have worked better, but for a show there is not enough substance and too much filler time that drags that whole thing on and on. Just imagine Carpenter's masterpiece The Thing blown up to a 10 hour long tv show... Anyway, watchable, to a certain degree, but more or less you just get a warmed up and stale dish served."
790,The Silent Sea,"Korean Drama ""The Silent Sea"" is a decent attempt to create a post-apocalyptic drama with loads of suspense and thriller factors.And for sure, the drama keeps things edgy and suspenseful till the very last minute. The viewer is thrown straight away into the action, with the earth struggling to find water to support the needs of the population, and a scientist is forced to leave the planet. And there is a nudging feeling that something is off right up when the team lands on the moon and goes into the base. That feeling is maintained all throughout the story. In addition, the mystery that is formed and solved is well constructed, well presented, and perfectly paced. It gives small cheese bites throughout the episodes, and it concludes everything nicely in the final one.However, the drama leaves a lot of things out. The condition of the earth and the dystopian current situation is not well explained and just given as a fact rather than something that needs more exploration. The characters are also the losers of the mystery-thriller focused story. There are some flashbacks that indicate some short of past and personalities, but other than those, the characters are left as blank ones that were acting on based on their initial introductions. The CGI, moreover, were bad and almost ruined the atmosphere of the drama at times.On the other hand, the performances were top notch, as expected by top tier actors and actresses.So, overall, 7.5 out of 10."
791,The Silent Sea,The technology and space equipment on the moon was a cool setting. However there were some moments that were just left as luck - when Chief Han woke up after climbing down the ladder and the elevator shaft came up. When Dr. Song woke up in the infirmary after locking herself in the room as she throws up water. The doctor thinks Luna is an antidote.Dr. Song finding out that her sister who was the chief researcher illegally made human clones to test the lunar water.Then all the men died except for women and children. Not sure what happens in the end but a reporter narrates survivors were found. I was unsatisfied with the ending. The earth is running out of water and global warming has dried up the world. Interesting premise but I wanted more development to the story.
792,The Silent Sea,"In a time of global drought. An infinite supply of liquid unobtainium is discovered on the moon that could save mankind (or at least the nasty social elites) if only it can be rendered non-lethal for human consumption. Neither the physics nor the biology make any sense, so calling this 'science' fiction is a bit of a stretch (despite the incessant stream of clichés usually associated with the genre such as a crash landing leaving the spaceship dangling on the edge of a precipice, a mysterious monster that no one ever gets a good look at, constant running up and down corridors looking worried and/or frightened, etc). The plot drifts from the implausible to the ridiculous when the true nature of the monster is revealed (a big letdown) and the final scenes are so ludicrous that the entire story could have simply been a guilt-induced fever dream as po-faced Song Ji-an (Bae Doona ) stares out the window at the barren lunar landscape. The cast is fine in relatively undemanding roles and some of the moon imagery is good (although marred as usual by the filmmakers' insistence at including sounds in a vacuum). Despite an interesting initial premise and some effective tension building in the first few episodes 'The Silent Sea' is an incoherent and uninteresting entry in the 'abandoned space-base' sci-fi sub-genre and not really worth eight hours of couch-time. I find it hard to believe that anyone would care enough about the story or the characters to warrant a second season."
793,The Silent Sea,"This whole happens in moon whereas the team search for water source to bring for earth..
Unfortunately some mysterious thing happened previous team and this crew also face samethng..
The protagonist and another lady try to save other people and bring water to earth..
But some lagging in story and screenplay..
Once watchable web series..!"
794,The Silent Sea,"Probably the most thirsty show on Netflix.A new South Korean space-travel thriller on Netflix. The cast got many familiar faces, so I was pretty excited for this show.Sadly I think this was a generic sci-fi with a lot of predictable plot points. The more I watched, the more I was sure of what the show was heading towards. I wasn't surprised much when certain twists got revealed. Even worse, some subplots felt unnecessary and also some visual scenes didn't create that much impact.The characters were also generic. They all got backgrounds that I have seen countless times before. Even so I don't think they have enough for me to invest in their outcomes.Overall, the show got a unique concept, but the execution was subpar. 5.5-6/10."
795,The Silent Sea,"Following their consecutive triumphs in a myriad of genres & styles in the recent past; Koreans have now finally decided to take the initiative into this fairly newer ground i.e. Sci-fi/Space. On a concept level, this was a terrific attempt, a fascinating idea indeed. If only the execution was able to correspond accordingly, this could have resulted in something else entirely!The budget was sufficient as were the available resources. There were absolutely no problems whatsoever regarding how it looked and felt. The Cinematography, the Sound, the all-around production is nothing but a testimony to my aforesaid statement. Performances too satisfied the prerequisites! Albeit, the characterization leaves a much bigger room for improvement.The same goes for the Screenplay as well. Which was, by and large, an uninteresting and uneventful affair. All thanks to its dismal pace; which should have had better consistency and nourishment. As you can probably tell by now, the primary issue isn't with the idea or the particular way it is conceptualized; it is more about the implementation, which failed to take advantage of its much broader potential in the end.While, on one hand, I do praise the creators for their covetous and pragmatic intents; on the other hand, I don't see this getting much of a success. Let's just say, I fear, in the majority of cases, people's exact expectations wouldn't be met!"
796,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea acts as a procedural sci-fi drama, but in reality, feels like a superslow cosplay event.The science part in ""science fiction"" is mutilated by the script. They didn't hire at least a university professor to brief them on how space works (this hits hard in the first and especially the last episode). This heavily undermines the overall investment of the viewer, since so many things make absolutely no sense. Even the basics of a space mission are all over the place, random people show up carrying random items (essential to the plot), the spacecraft feels like a low-cost with free seating. Even our main group is basically sent on a suicide mission with zero information and preparation whatsoever. And in a world where space travel is more accessible, the existence of such an empty space base with important stuff is barely believable.There is no planning, problem-solving, actual management, or allocation of responsibilities. People in space suits act like 15-year-olds and make stupid decisions after stupid decisions. This is where the procedural part comes in since we are shown everything that happens, whenever someone discusses something, goes somewhere, does something. From time to time such scenes are used for exposition, but all the character stuff is a background to the moving around the facility. Only two people have at least cardboard basic characteristics and sort-of-backstories. Timeflow is also messed up, I'm not sure, but the subtitles said something about a 24-hr mission, and since nobody is seen sleeping or eating during 8 episodes, I assume this is the case. Although I don't know how can you reach the Moon in 24 hours, this is the future, right. Again, adding to the nonsensical nature of the ""science"" part, the base didn't make any sense at all. It's huge, yet it held only around 100 people, it looks and feels like it has no purpose, just huge empty halls of empty.I can't discuss the main plot point without going into spoilers though, so I won't. Although I was able to play a fun game just by counting things that were introduced and then abandoned right away. Like the elevator situation, the corporate espionage plot, the space company director/deputy doctor motivations.Acting-wise nobody tried too hard, yet the script was as undemanding as possible, so no real effort was necessary. I got some enjoyment from the static face of the main female lead. I really did like that she has no visible emotions whatsoever, I'm not even kidding. There were a couple of likable people on the mission, but not because they were special in any way, but because they acted less like naughty children than anyone else.If you get past ep. 1, you will probably finish it just to see how it ends (microspoiler - there is no satisfying end to season 1). Also, there were probably some alterations done since ep. 7 is around 10 minutes shorter than all the other ones.The Silent Sea can be endured, even with all the abovementioned things + obligatory tearjerking. But you have to prepare yourself for one important thing - the pacing. It never changes. The show is moving at a constant pace. Even during action scenes.I'm not sure I can recommend this to a specific audience, sci-fi fans will get confused by this new Space, general audiences will not survive ep. 1. So I guess I cannot recommend this at all."
797,The Silent Sea,Because it seemed like 90% of it was about people walking down long dark halls and talking in slightly above whispers. Also there was a lot of overacting. The characters got fake concerned looks on their faces so often as to be humorous. I think the SoKo's blew this one. Back to the drawing board. Hope Netflix didn't pay a lot of money for this. I know the Koreans can do better.
798,The Silent Sea,"This tense South Korean sci-fi thriller rattles along rather nicely, it can be a little melodramatic at times, the digital effects are occasionally ropey but despite the coldness there's a winningly retro space telly vibe here that I found myself drawn to. It's also nice to see some non-western sci fi foolishness for once. Not a hard recommend but certainly worth a gander for fans of the genre."
799,The Silent Sea,"Why because they do stupid things, they get into the space station lab they find dead bodies, so far no autopsy and they walk around unprotected with there elements off.So they are bound to get infected by what ever killed those bodies....For suppose to be so intelligent scientist they are pretty stupid.So far i am in episode 3 the fx are amazing the actors are believable in the sense its not all super hot looking actors but more real life like."
800,The Silent Sea,Feels like a video game run through and doesn't have the cash spent on it that it at first looks like. Still having said that it's core concept/back story is fine and the acting is better than a lot of similar outings.
801,The Silent Sea,"I don't care about bad reviews. All I know, I loved it. I watched it within a day. People are claiming it doesn't make sense but a fictional drama doesn't need to make sense, I guess :3
I thought, I would watch the next episodes in next day as I started watching it 7pm but I watched it till it ends. I regret why I watch it! Now I have to wait til the next season comes ://"
802,The Silent Sea,"The cast of course is wonderful; the writing and direction are not. Any time a series we've spent time on leaves more questions than answers, after that time spent, it's a problem. This is a visually appealing film that for me is also annoying and then forgettable."
803,The Silent Sea,"SummaryGreat Korean series of space and dystopian science fiction that combines very well its interesting approach to hard science fiction with terror, suspense, horror, action and melodrama, achieving remarkable climates and scenes of great beauty.ReviewIn a dystopian future, the Earth suffers from a severe lack of water, an element that is unevenly rationed according to certain hierarchies. The government forms a team whose mission is to reach a lunar base that had been closed 5 years earlier to search and rescue mysterious samples.The team is made up of professional astronauts, including Captain Han Yun-jae (Gong Yoo, actor from Zombie Station and The Squid Game), a doctor, and Dr. Song, an astrobiologist (Bae Doona, actress from Cloud Atlas and Sense8)Thus begins a story that takes place basically in that present, although with some flash backs referring to some crew members, who in more than one case hide some secrets and motivations.The series combines a very good and interesting hard science fiction with horror, horror, suspense, action and very oriental hints of melodrama. All these components combine very well, enhancing each other, thanks to an intelligent script that knows how to dose the information but always moves the story forward and a direction that puts these ideas and genres into action and creates highly successful climates. On the other hand, the theme of a crew, their secrets and their mistrust is not new, but the script and the staging put it totally at the service of the story and not the other way around.The production display is generous, with many formal finds, great photography, remarkable scenery (the moon base is very accomplished)and a sophisticated soundtrack; The series offers moments of great visual beauty and always sports the characteristic elegance of Korean fiction.As for the performances, an ""oriental"" style coexists at times ""abrupt"" with intense moments, of enormous introspection and sobriety, a record in which a concentrated Bae Doona stands out, for whom the journey of her Dr. Song means much more than a scientific mission."
804,The Silent Sea,Interesting but uneventful trip to the moon to save human race from extinction. Choi Hang-yong's dystopian sci-fi drama miniseries had striking visuals over less suspicious pattern and predictable outcome. Bae Doona & Gong Yoo still transcended the boisterous parts of fairly limited emotional core and space explorers' character arcs.
805,The Silent Sea,Future Earth is a planet where water is rationed. A crew of people are assembled to go to an abandoned space station on the moon which may have the answer to Earths plight. Once there they discover that the authorities had lied about the space station closure and they discover dark secrets. Excellent cast and a well made set draws you in to this sci-fi drama with enough twists to keep you invested.
806,The Silent Sea,"I liked the actors (from Sense 8 and Train from Busan), but they appear to be miscast in this movie. So many of the characters are so over-the-top; the non-stop talker, the sex-hog, the super dramatic, the one that fears everything, the non-emotional captain, which would not be wrong, but here each character is played to the extreme. Plus, for people who are apparently top of their fields in science, makes very basic mistakes that a fifth-grader would know better. For example, let's touch unknown item without protective clothing, lets breathe air where we see dead bodies with unknown deaths, let get into a life-support suit without checking to see how much oxygen if left or lets walk down dark corridors away from everyone else AFTER there has been deaths and unknown entity lurking (this happens often).As mentioned in other comments, this would have been a tighter, more enjoyable 4-hr miniseries and not this drawn-out plot-device driven mess."
807,The Silent Sea,"Seems I've been watching a lot of SciFi lately. Specifically, SciFi mystery thrillers. However the story is on the thin side in this one.The setup borrows heavily from Aliens 2. Little girl, strong woman lead, solider guys, mission to recover, corporate interference, government secrets ....etc. The crux and secrets of the story, however and plot is somewhat unique, reasonable, mysterious and technically well done. Acting also solid (except for Chairperson) and no comic relief at all, fittingly. The intent of RX corporation is too simple but I guess that adds a another complication.Part of the ending where one doesn't need a space suit glaringly doesn't make sense. Microgenomics what have you but that's a pretty quick genetic mutation in 4 years or so. And wasn't too clear why the lead solider need to do the sacrifice move. Slow pacing can turn some audience off and the classical music theme ....well barely worked for me."
808,The Silent Sea,"Prior to this short 8 part, South Korean, TV series was a short film called, ""The Sea of Tranquility (2014)"" (which I am going to check out as soon as I am done here). The Silent Sea is based on the Sea of Tranquility as is revealed in the season 1 part 4 episode, 'The Truth Comes Out'. Dr. Song's older sister, Song Wonkyung, refers to ""Mare Tranquillitatis"" as the ""Silent Sea."" Mare Tranquillitatis is a Latin phrase that translates (""Mare"" meaning Sea) to English as the ""Sea of Tranquility"".There have been a couple of things over the years that had H2O as the basis for the story being laid out but, I can't ever remember having seen a TV series where the star of it was ""WATER (H2O)"". It also has the usual backgrounds - which are the basics of all media output - such as corporate corruption/greed, secret scumbags with their own agenda's going on, intertwining flashbacks, plenty of dramatic moments and total tension throughout its 8 episode run. Oh yes! There is also a twist at the end, that you won't see coming...at all!I don't know why so many reviewers have lambasted this highly entertaining series; using the feeble old saying that its too similar to many things that have been done before. There is hardly anything made in this day and age that is (or can claim to be) totally original...is there? The end result for any film or TV show is to make sure you have a good script, piece together a perfectly matched ensemble cast and make certain that the director can bring out the drama, tension, fear, joy etc, etc! You would never watch anything if you continuously whined on about it not being original!From late 2021 to this year, 2022, we have been gifted some truly incredible television shows - and not one of them American - coming out of South Korea. If you are dyslexic it of course will be too hard to make it through translated subtitles. If you are just too lazy to read subtitles, or you are an idiot racist, you will be missing out on some really great television!"
809,The Silent Sea,"A well paced space drama with lost of challenges for the characters. There were a few items in this that were immensely illogical which makes you wonder if the writers know much about science?For example they have the characters walking in slow motion whenever they're out in the vacuum. Well, this is plain silly and doesn't happen in reality. Just look at real moon-walking footage. Where is the resistance in a vacuum?And taking off their helmets in a facility where they know there could be undetectable bio-hazards, where the staff previously died of unknown causes and before they have checked the air for hazards. Much like the similar ridiculous scene in Prometheus where so called 'scientists' remove their helmets in a building on a new alien planet after they just arrived.Apart from this the main story in quite fine. Do hire a science advisor in the future though :)"
810,The Silent Sea,"A great series, thanks to all the production team, actors and writers. Corano's hundred has been making great strides in series and movies for a few years, with good original and fresh scripts."
811,The Silent Sea,"I am in the middle of Episode 3 on a binge and realize, I have done the dishes, had a long phone conversation, picked up this and that - all rather than watching this series. Now that I've ""settled in"", I realize that I Just. Don't. Care. I don't care about any of them, except for Dr. Song's dog. Otherwise, I have no connection to them or why there are where they are. In the first (or was it the second?) episode some things happened that had me going, ""Oh. THAT would never happen!"" a few times. To pick on one person doesn't seem fair, but Dr. Song has one facial expression and I'm very weary of it. So I chose to end this binge and watch something else that either challenges or entertains me. But this ain't it."
812,The Silent Sea,"Great to see something different in the world of Sci fi. There's also a great sense of tension and mystery. The astronauts were believable characters instead of those portrayed in western media eg all handsome, witty, macho ex fighter pilots."
813,The Silent Sea,"Very slow 8 hour movie with dodgy science behind the fiction. We've seen movies where a team gets picked off one by one in a closed environment, and there's at least one with a separate agenda, before. Throw in some Korean mistrust of big corporations and government elites but it's still a miss. May have been a tight show in a 90-120 minute format."
814,The Silent Sea,"Let's just get to the problems straight away. The science in the show has many errors, it could and should of been done a bit better.Then there is the pacing, oh my does it ever get slow and boring from time to time. The first episode is a good example of a too slow and too boring. And why are we watching same things again and again, same bloody boring conversations in same boring dark rooms with same boring faces.These special individuals chosen for this extremely important mission seem to be ridiculously bad at what they are doing. Pretty much nothing they are doing is even making sense unless they are all suicidal.And the story ain't exactly brilliant either."
815,The Silent Sea,"I was kind of excited when I first started watching this because it had a cool concept and the trailer looked good. And even though the visuals were stunning and the actors did an amazing job, it felt like something was missing. It's definitely a thriller but once the unknown was known, its momentum slowed down. And that ending was kind of anticlimactic, with some plot holes included."
816,The Silent Sea,"While The Silent Sea isn't a groundbreaking space thriller, I think it was very well done and a very entertaining watch. The moon renderings were gorgeous and realistic looking, and the story is interesting and pulls you in quickly. The cast is star-studded, with Gong Yoo at the helm in one of his most gorgeous looks yet, and most of the time he's just wearing a space suit! Acting is great across the board, the mystery of the lunar water is very cool, and the show set up for a great second season (please let us get a second season!)
Personally found this to be very entertaining and a great binge watch!"
817,The Silent Sea,"Ugh .. something kills everyone on the moon base but it's not radioactivity like they were told. So, what do they do? Take their helmets off before determining if it was a virus or bacteria or sometime similar... Too stupid :P Other than that, their budget spaceship, and a crew that is both careless and inept, it's almost watchable... Not sure I'm going to make it through episode 3..."
818,The Silent Sea,"First episode was intriguing enough, even though a global draught on Earth is hard to believe.They go to the moon, and then the show become a 4th grade science fanfiction.Moon walking was unrealistic...
Artificial gravity on a ground base ? Ok...
Molecules multiplying from nowhere, because who cares about physics ?Green plants growing without sun...
And the best one : crew removing their helmets in a zone where people died mysteriously. Prometheuse school of space exploration, 101.Nothing to say about the acting. I little bit overacted, as expected from a K-drama.If you liked Squid game, or if you like sci-fi, skip this one."
819,The Silent Sea,"You like Alien 1? Or maybe Prometheus? Have you seen ""The moon"" ? Or maybe Apollo 14, well you know what to expect then pretty much... The show is pure sci fi, decent dialogues, minimal soap , so far I am enjoying everything from CG to story as well as production sets..."
820,The Silent Sea,An interesting concept delivered with excellent special effects and fine acting.Unfortunately the storyline demanded a little more willingness to accept that Sci-Fi can have its own illogical logic than I was able to grant it. My rating would otherwise have been rather higher.But still worth watching.
821,The Silent Sea,"Dont let the neg reviews distract you - this show was very mysterious, and reminded me of the rain. Is it the best show ever, no, but its not close to the worst either. People saying its generic dont know what they talkin about and prob loved squid game and worthship it. And yet that show rip scenes from movies and tv shows."
822,The Silent Sea,"This is a nice idea and story sci-fi movie. The cast, story, effects are nice but not up to superb yet. Its worth to pay to watch at home only, no more."
823,The Silent Sea,"It's a bit difficult to get into at first, but gets interesting and creepier the further you go along. The setting is a distopian sci-fi future with a water shortage on Earth. With social issues, and government conspiracies.The production value is pretty high, so it's pretty to look at."
824,The Silent Sea,"This series may not be for the impatient viewer pampered by decades of conventional sci-fi expectations of I need to know everything now and show me the monsters quick. This is a mellow, slow but artful measured dose of peeling off layers to the final reveal of what truly is a dire foreboding to come. What strikes the engaged will not be the storyline of fiction but the ominous possibility of what our future toward our finite most precious resource will pose to humanity if humans don't start finding true measures to save our dying planet with fatalistic urgency."
825,The Silent Sea,"Despite lackluster reviews, this is a good series. Well worth the watch. Even in the dubbed version it still creates suspense and intrigue. If you are a true Sci-Fi Adventure fan don't miss this. Great special effects and great story."
826,The Silent Sea,"I finished this because I hoped there must be something to justify the good reviews but there isn't.Firstly it is called science fiction but it isn't, it is fantasy wearing sciency clothing, there is no sense or intelligence in the story let alone science. That alone isn't enough to kill a show, I am happy to watch fantasy and suspend disbelief for a good story but unfortunately that was a mistake here.The plot is so paper thin it barely qualifies as a plot, it makes no sense and is just cliche after cliche, no originality or thought at all, like a really poor action movie stretched out for hour after hour.The ending forces in extra cliches for no sane reason making the last episode almost unwatchable.The acting is ok, that is the only positive I can think of, but everything else is awful."
827,The Silent Sea,"No, not adult as in ""adult"" but for cinematic adults. To wit, those who do not bring to their viewing a truckload of expectations baggage but are open to meeting a new offering with an unclouded judgement and some good will.It's not ""slow"", it's paced without the frenetic stroke inducing mindless CGIs of so much ""Sci-fi"". It has time to build atmosphere, themes and character nuance through the action. Which is the purest form of cinema of all.Some ""critic"" made me ROTFL when they suggested there's insufficient character build up at the beginning: LOL, exposition and voiceover narration: the death knell of cinematic quality.Want those? Sure, go read Dickens, Tolstoy, and watch Scorsese. The best cinema doesn't work that way. If you can't work out the characters from what they do and say and their facial expressions and body language, you're not really seeing what's on the screen.I worked out the different personalities involved virtually in the opening ""teaser"". Knowing where they literally came from and what their life was before this mission is cinematically irrelevant.Comparisons to Squid Game are seriously misguided. Puerile. Just because it's Korean doesn't mean it's gonna be the same stuff all over. Two entirely different genres, indeed each is cutting edge in its daring genre busting efforts.Worst thing U can do is go watch something with preconceptions of what it should be. What an insult to everyone involved!Netflix can often present real clunkers, but it saves its reputation overall with much quality viewing as well.So viewer: divest yourself of your cinematic cliches and watch this without fear or favour.It's not perfect, nothing human can be so. But the greatest part of this series is thoughtful, thought provoking, satisfying adult viewing that respects the viewer's intelligence and dispenses with popular tricks.Ten for overall quality. Well done again, Netflix."
828,The Silent Sea,"I think South Korea is trying too hard to cash in on the forward momentum of Squid Game. That was an excellent show. This one had potential. So many things did not make sense which ruined the immersive effect. It is annoying when people make stupid decisions simply because the writers cannot think of another reason to get the characters in a hot spot. But when they use ""smart"" characters (scientists) to make stupid decisions it is even worse.Oh look, everyone died inside this sealed building so let's take off our environmental gear before we figure out why. Faking gravity on a stationary platform is lame also but I suppose there could be some scientific explanation other than the standard rotational gravity.Then they added some ""supernatural"" aspects with the dead sister supposedly being able to contact the other sister and give her information she had no way of knowing unless talking to her dead sister. Then there is the doctor who is frightened of dead bodies. Do they not work on dead bodies when training? If anyone should be at ease around dead bodies it would be the doctor but she is in the top of freaked out.The astro-biologist is the most annoying character. No team leader would have put up with her disobeying orders so many times. Especially when she left another team member alone and they were killed.The visuals and special effects were good but the script was lacking. They should have read through it to see if it makes sense. There was also a lot of things not explained. I suppose they can address them in the next series but it's usually better to answer all of the questions in the same series and use the last episode to create new ones to be answered in the next season. That way if it does get cancelled at least you have most of the questions answered.Overall, it is worth the watch but do not expect it to be up there with Squid Game. I have watched a few movies/tv shows from South Korea that seem to be cashing in on Squid Game but none of them so far reach the greatness of Squid Game. I think it was the script more than anything else that made Squid Game great. It wasn't a highly CGI show, and you had the dubbing or reading the translation for most so it wasn't the acting. Perhaps, Silent Sea isn't as good because none of their characters were ones on the pretty scale. They all looked like the regular Joe off the street.Anyway, you won't be upset if you give it a shot. It is not a 1-2 nor is it a 9-10. People who give shows like this those ratings are doing it to fudge the ratings. There are far better and far worse shows out there. This is a middling show. Not great but not horrible either. I hope that SoKo stops trying to ride Squid Game coattails and puts some more effort into their shows before they are forgotten as a flash in the pan."
829,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea was so original, suspenseful, exciting...interesting. The idea behind the story,nobody could have guess it, was not a ""we know how it ends..."" at all. Nobody will even guess the end of the plot, just amazing. Hoping for a second season, I hope will come. The only detail that confuses me: seems that the 8 chapters happened on the same day...or not? What is missing is the part where they take a rest after the crash...some food, some shower...what about going for a nap? Uh? None of that happened..."
830,The Silent Sea,"Like many of the handful of sci-fi movies and series that came out in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, this Korean series unfortunately fails at basic storytelling.Despite having talented actors such as Bae Doona (Cloud Atlas) and Gong Yoo (Train to Busan), without equally talented direction or a good script, the series could not be saved.The problem started right at the beginning with episode one, in which character setups were poorly done and the mission inexplicably (and laughably) vague. Thus it really required monumental suspension of disbelief to continue watching.-To be continued -"
831,The Silent Sea,"It no wonder the Balhae station in this series was lost. The entire South Korean space program is plagued by second rate engineering and incompetent astronauts with IQs below 100.A shuttle that fails on a single bolt and fails to ignite the engine for no reason, check.Forcing an injured person to walk despite his weighing in at less than 1/5 earth gravity and can easily be carried, check.No questions are asked of the most important person in the story until it's too late, check.Netflix needs to put some basic quality control over script and direction. This is just Lost in Space with Koreans. Same bad writing and uninteresting one dimensional characters."
832,The Silent Sea,"Extremely slow passed and with many, many plot holes. It is strange because usually the main actors and the second leads are known for being in successful series /movies."
833,The Silent Sea,"For a big part, it is a trivial story, I won't go into details in order to avoid spoiling and this ties my hands to better review it. Still, the core idea is original, maybe a bit weird, but I find that as a positive, actually it is something you don't get at the start, but like after half the series. They might not goo too intense, if you expect that - no. Neither go slow, I think this is the best way the events are happening and you can enjoy some very nice scenery in 16:9 which is always to note. And I think all of that greatly represents how hostile the Moon is for us.Acting and music good enough, not spectacular, not an impressive ending, but still it is a nice show just because of its dose of weirdness, I'd say, which seems to disappoint some viewers. And that is the thing that makes me see it as seven stars, otherwise would be too standard six one, which is still good, but seven is above average for me."
834,The Silent Sea,"I nearly didn't watch this because of the negative reviews but I'm so glad that I gave it a chance .It's gritty and has a realistic feel to it without being drab . It's not like the usual Hollywood sci-fi series whereby everything is glossy and the women have perfect hair and make up ( Even when the spaceship crashes , their hair is still in place! Lol!)The Silent Sea is exciting and invokes your curiosity about what's actually going on . The acting is superb and there are some famous Korean actors in the series,
I don't like Shows that are slow and It's not slow as some others have stated. It's very atmospheric and there's always something happening . If you like Hollywood glossy type shows then this is not for you . But if you like shows with substance and not just pretty looking , then I believe that you'll enjoy this ."
835,The Silent Sea,"This year we didn't see much of new sci-fi shows. As a fan of kinda shows, I was really hungry for that. It hooked me but only because there is nothing else to watch. The show is watchable but plot itself is kinda mediocre as everything else here.P. S. 10/10 reviews are fake as for most of the other NETFLIX shows."
836,The Silent Sea,"At first glance it reminded me of Prometheus, but a lot smarter , and lots of cliche scenes. Very believable CGI shots of the moon and craters, The corridors are so atmospheric , you feel like playing Dead Space to be honest. Hidden agendas and powerful messages, Gruesome ending thou. I liked the series , i say season 2 on your start - GO !"
837,The Silent Sea,"I really enjoyed most aspects of The Silent Sea. There was some fantastic set design and nice call-backs to other movies in the genre like Moon and The Abyss. Some suspension of disbelief is a must in places and the last episode falls into some rather tired cliches that I thought had been well avoided up to that point but as a slice of science fiction TV this was entertaining.The earlier episodes as the crew explore the station were very well shot and there was an excellent tension that reminded me of Alien and the video game Dead Space. The ultimate reveal that Luna can walk and breathe on the Moon with no suit wasn't really set up so didn't quite carry the weight I think it was intended to have and the sudden reappearance of the captain outside destroyed the already paper-thin layer of credulity the show was resting on. Personally I would have liked the show to continue the darker tone of earlier episodes but I can also see they wanted a more uplifting ending.At the end of the day though, this is science fiction entertainment, and the fact this series kept me well engaged for over 7 episodes is worth applauding."
838,The Silent Sea,"It was just awesome start was little slow ,I never liked space movie but this become my favourite now .awesome cinematography,music and moon .actors and acting both were super 1st time I like Korean cast they didn't put lady looking male hehe totally watchable."
839,The Silent Sea,"Sadly, a production of this magnitude falls flat for its poorly thought out imagination for lack of realism! It nullifies the caption of one's imagination. For example; roaming a powerless space station, with prior knowledge, with flashlights? Jeez, what happened to infrared shielding? Also, how do you get the magnitude of cement needed to construct a space station of the size of what is seen in the show? Please, spare me the ineptness..."
840,The Silent Sea,"I don't know whether to laugh or cry, when I finally discovered the folly of the Prometheus's crews finally found a match. From taking off their helmet before knowing was going on, to never wearing personal protective equipments although so many dead bodies lying around with a very much outbreak indications. And who in their right minds would design a reset system outside the building, ten stories below?! This is a moon base building, not an apartment downtown of Seoul!The premise of the movie that's actually very good was ruined by small but snub errors all over the place. I give this movie 6/10 only because its setting and decent acting. Bae Donna and Gong Yoo delivered good performance as always and supporting cast did their parts well.Better luck next time 6/10."
841,The Silent Sea,"Not the most intelligent sci-fi out there, it sure likes to play fast and loose with several laws of physics and chemistry, but you know what, it still got me. Like someone said, there's a bit of that Annihilation feel to this, and that wasn't hardcore science-based either but it was still engrossing. Slow pace wasn't a problem for me except the running around dark corridors which got old real quick. Other than that, good acting, fully believable sense of danger and mystery, they made a few really interesting decisions in some right places, and they got a winner, pure and simple.It's hard to imagine what could follow this in season 2 while keeping it just as good, but I'm in for it, give me that notification when it comes out."
842,The Silent Sea,"Time would've been better spent getting the story and script into shape for a 1 hr, 45 min movie feature, b/c this series is all over the place and full of time-wasting pointlessness and used-up ideas.Lacks logic, continuity, and decent dialogue. It's repetitive, immature, and idiotically melodramatic on occasion, too. [You'd think they were looking for a cure for Short-Arms, with the number of times the drama depicts an ""I juuuussst can't reach (an object)"" moment.] The science is also ridiculous, and whatever budget there was looked to be misused because of it.Had to turn the dubbing off and use subtitles instead, since the Eng. Voice-acting wasn't good (and didn't match the subs, either).Lastly, everyone having projectile weapons on a retrieval/research mission in space makes no effing sense, but at least the men's arms are long enough for them to panic, draw, and shoot spastically whenever one of them sees a creepy, weaponless kid dart around in a lunar station. Of course, she never really gets mortally wounded, because apparently no one actually has decent aim unless they're shooting at each other."
843,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea is a pretty good effort at a SciFi thriller. Sure it has its moments of clumsiness, but it unfolds an interesting story.Beyond the human drama aspect - where some of the inter character communication is a little strange perhaps for Western audiences - there's a good angle in the story that then develops into several layers.I do get a bit tired of sci-fi that shows characters in endless corridors - when you pay so much per sq foot to build in space the last thing you'd do is waste so much space on corridors - but bad space station design isn't unique to this show - and plenty of aspects of the internals are also quite satisfyingly detailed.All in all this is a good sci-fi show that's worth a look and persevering with - worth a 7."
844,The Silent Sea,"I was initially put off by the initial low-budget feel, such as some well-known facts like zero-G, the moon having 1/6th Earth's gravity that goes ignored for what seems to be for the sake of keeping the production costs down. Flimsy mission premise and prep, some stiff acting and dialogue, round out a bland start.A lot of tropes are there--dystopian future desert Earth (presumably global warming), water rationing, (but technologically advanced and resources enough to have built a massive lunar station, Earth to lunar space shuttles and launch systems, competitive/adversarial government and corporations; some similarities with Aliens, abandoned station, military/para-military/civilian mission team. And of course, some manufactured crisis as a plot device to kick things off.BUT--if you get past the first two episodes, your suspension of disbelief kicks in, and the real story unfolds. Some good ideas get under way, and good actors in the cast start to shine. This is not a deep, ground-breaking sci-fi, but they do manage to start tying together elements into an engaging, if somewhat of a short, predictable thriller.Could they make a Season 2? They left enough threads to pick up on, but it feels like there is enough resolution to leave it alone without wanting more."
845,The Silent Sea,"I was wondering for a few episodes, why is this adventure, sci-fi, drama shot like a horror show? Turns out, it's because for the most part it is one, and to my surprise these horror elements are good. The series doesn't try to scare you, it tries to convey to you the fear the characters feel and it does so rather effectively. While there is barely any gore, characters are constantly under a lot of pressure, and suffer horrifying and painful deaths.Unfortunately it has pacing issues. I found it to be overly long, not much was happening between episodes 3 and 5. The show would have been much better was it 6 episodes long, or if they had used that extra time to flesh out the characters. Some of them are very superficially written, I could barely tell them apart. It was the last 3 episodes that won me over and the reason I would recommend the Silent Sea. The show really picks up.I have a couple more complaints, but I also liked many of the shots, the atmosphere, the lightning and sound, and also most of the acting. Doona Bae is good as always, Gong Yoo whom I've only seen in Goblin and Train to Busan also delivered a good performance, tbh all but one did a pretty good job.Overall it is a character driven sci-fi drama with a lot of horror elements, which has an okayish start, a rather boring middle section and a strong ending. First Korean sci-fi I've seen, give it a try."
846,The Silent Sea,"This could have just been a well done movie. Instead of a stretched out TV series. It is more of a mystery as supposed to a scary thriller. Once this gets spoiled, it ruins the whole thing. Based on that alone, I don't even believe this to be re-watchable."
847,The Silent Sea,"The silent sea
The first Sci-Fi space drama to be attempted in Korea is set in a dystopian world where water is scarce. It is a slow and suspenseful piece that builds up to a spectacular finish.The silent sea borrows from various sci-fi movies before it but also has a fresh element to it that is brimming with melodrama, espionage, secrets, and horror.An easy recommendation!"
848,The Silent Sea,"Tried 4 times watch this.. can't get past 1st episode it's so bad.. can't even work out what it's About..nice make up on the guys though,they really love men's lipstick in Korea."
849,The Silent Sea,"I really loved this sci fi horror mysteryGreat acting, great caststory is out of a cheesy 80's b-movie (which i also love), but its done really well with a good budget."
850,The Silent Sea,"This show is basically just the movie Aliens except if Newt was a literal Newt >.>. Seriously though, it's alright but it really is just a straight rip off of aliens, sent to a station by some shady people who don't tell them the full story, discover the horrifying truth, yadda yadda. Production values are pretty good, just a shame the story is so generic."
851,The Silent Sea,"First off: The set-designers did an amazing job. This is probably one of the best TV sets I've seen in a long time. This could've easily been a movie set.And the rest of the production crew did an outstanding job. I really do hope this wins at least some reward, because a lot of hard work went into this.As a viewer; Pay attention to details, there is a lot of foreshadowing and smart little things included that will make sense later on. But you need to be alert. This is not a show you should watch on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn. This requires a little bit more brain-activity than that.However, I'm a little bit disappointed. There is some stuff that is left unresolved, and there is a lot of ""suspend your disbelief"" going on here. You can't take this show to seriously, but at the same time you have to talk it seriously enough.The show demands a lot of the viewer, and I have to think that is a failing of the script.I also think 8 episodes are either too much or not enough. They either needed another 4 episode to really get into the nitty gritty details, OR, they need to cut this down to a movie. The 8 episode format works for netflix, because in a sense, you are probably going to binge this and watch it as a long movie. But there are some fat they could have cut out, if that is the case.I would say this is leaps and bounds above the average sci-fi TV-show, but it's still just a sci-fi TV-show. So don't expect James Cameron or Ripley Scott.Go in with low expectations, enjoy it for what it is, and you might get a good viewing out of it."
852,The Silent Sea,"Production is top-notch on this one. Some good actors too.The concept is very promising: a Korean governmental lunar permanent research facility found something very important, potentially profitable but hard to manage and very lethal.Things go awry and they bury everything for 5 years. Then a salvage crew is put together to retrieve samples of that something.There are corporate spies infiltrated in the crew (very profitable, remember?) and some people in the crew have deep personal reasons to have joined.Enter Netflix's monkeys with typewriters.The Earth has, for some unexplained reason, LOST ALMOST ALL WATER. There are no more rivers, lakes and OCEANS.Notwithstanding that, people keep on living, with governments supplying water rations. No wars, no riots. Just a merry cattle-like populace.Seriously, the major writer selection criteria at Netflix must be the candidates' IQ. The lower, the better.....So, the salvage crew goes up in a fancy shuttle. Which, naturally, metts with a critical failure that forces the team to separate from the side rockets before a stable moon orbit can be reached.Then the shuttle's own rockets won't start (Korean space engineers must love this show...). Luckily, the trusters do, just so that they can level the shuttle for a crash landing.Where do they end up?At a huge crater rim, half in, half out the border.Netflix should be ashamed.....Well, they have to get out of the shuttle. Some are hanging on seatbelts to avoid falling to the tip of the shuttle (now severely tilted towards the fall).The captain tries to lift a woman hanging. He has to truly exert himself.Moon's gravity is about 16% of the Earth's. In other words, the woman would be weighing some 15 kg.Hardly something that would need a boy to exert himself, let alone an astronaut.Then they get out, just in time for the shuttle to fall. And gravity now seems ok....they walk in little jumpy steps.The station is some 8 km away. On Earth, an average adult covers 6 km/h on foot. Given the gravity on the Moon, this should be at least doubled, so it would take them some 40 min - but it takes a couple of hours, during which they allow a seriously injured man to walk, instead of simply carrying the guy (low gravity.....).Naturally, the air in their cannisters ends just as they get to the station. Very innovative take, Netflix!The stations is a huge place. A lot larger than they knew.They get in, turn on the power.....AND ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY!!!!It's mind-boggling!They have developed artificial gravity for a ground station (so, no rotating rings to use centripetal force as gravity), but they still use combustible fuels on the rockets.....Ah, well.....ok, they have artificial gravity.Let's not be picky and enjoy the show. After all, what other horrid new blunder can the monkeys write in the story?Wait for it.....They find the substance they went looking for. It interacts with living tissue PRODUCING HUGE AMOUNTS OF WATER inside affected individuals without reducing their original mass and quickly killing them, leaving drowning signs on the body. Water from thin air, then....
Oh...dead bodies are unnafeccted by it.Astounding......The same substance, applied to plants, promote their accelerated growth instead of killing them.Makes absolute sense....Well, among the hundreds dead in the station (no, it wasn't evacuated....) they find an improbable survivor (FIVE YEARS alone in the station....) in the person of a girl of about 12 years of age.She doesn't seem to be negatively affected by the substance, has hugely increased speed and strength (not to mention claw-like nails) and is hellbent in preventing the crew from retrieving any samples.By the way: there's no food left in the station. The girl must have lived on happy memories....or on the strangely non decayed bodies of the original station crew....Seriously.....how do they come up with this level of crap????The girl turns out to be the 79th in an unknown number of clones. All preceding clones died as the substance turned them into water fountains.Things evolve, spies are eliminated, crew members get killed, thousands of tons of water get released in the station, some of it gets out and instantly freezes (at least they didn't make the water flow outside....).The station's structure is severely compromised and the team must get out.Now we are down to 2 women medical doctors, the cloned girl and the captain. The girl has been lovingly tamed and poses no threat.The man must die, so the women don't need to share the glory. As he was a nice guy throughout the series, he gets an honourable death, staving off death for the women and girl for a while.But there are uncountable liters of water spurting non-stop from somewhere.This water wants out - and no puny bulkhead will stop it!So, it comes to pass that the water breaks through the last bulkhead just as the women and girl are getting their feet on lunar sands....and throws them far before freezing.The pressure was enough to blow the bulkhead away, but not enough to crush the captain (paper bulkheads, no doubt....). He is mortally wounded, but alive outside the station.As his suit fails, we see the girl approaching him. She is NO LONGER in her suit. She's exposed to the Moon's surface temperature, but she doesn't freeze at all! Even her eyes work normally!Really, they should have made her pick everybody up and fly back to Earth. At least we could have ended it laughing."
853,The Silent Sea,"There has NEVER been an 8-episode science fiction miniseries produced for television or in theaters. So what they are trying to do with this series is totally new. They are trying to sustain a story over 8 full-length 1-hr episodes. That works - partially - but doesn't work very well.About the only way to sustain 8 episodes is to make the series a mystery story, and my recent view of ""Stay Close"" is a good example of how to do that very, very well. In ""Stay Close"" the character development is half the show, people have old relationships which are methodically revealed and new ones develop, and you are given 3 suspects on day one to ponder and the author does an excellent job of fingering the suspects one by one to confuse the viewer, and it ends tragically with not one but TWO twists. In a similar fashion ""Dark Matter"" concerns 8 people who wake up on a space ship with amnesia and they discover one of them is a traitor and the first season is gripping because everyone is trying to decide ""who is the traitor and even more importantly, who are we?""In ""The Silent Sea"" the characters are sent to the moon to recover samples from a derelict research station that had a severe accident 5Y ago and was destroyed. I don't know about you but I'm not going unless I get the lowdown on exactly what happened WTF? We as viewers don't! Sadly, the character development is severely lacking. There are flashbacks for the main character and her sister and the space commissioner, but that's about it. We would expect to have a traitor (after all each of Alien I and Alien II had a traitor) but there wasn't really a traitor, just incompetent or excessively rigid middle managers! The show is reduced to a series of shocking reveals - maybe 5 in total - but that cannot sustain a high level of interest and concentration over 8 episodes. It becomes a sort of ""Towering Inferno"" / ""Poseidon Adventure"" type of story - a story of attrition - but I'm not really sad to see anybody go because I'm getting impatient to see this end of this film.Production quality is top-notch and I admire what they are trying to do, but the story genre just doesn't support 8 hours of mental concentration, and so the overall impression is that the story is just slow, almost annoyingly slow. The sci-fi is there but the drama is missing."
854,The Silent Sea,"I am glad I have ignored the bad reviews, as this serie is excellent. Engaging, atmospheric and, as always, full of South Korean uniqueness. I have in fact enjoyed this more than The Squid Game as, although the plot may sound familiar, it feels over all a of higher production quality. It definitely looks better than most similar Hollywood style Netflix Sci-Fi series.CGIs, visuals and sets look great and all actors are convincing and likeable. I have even found more bearable the American accent dubbing actors and translation, for once."
855,The Silent Sea,"For once the many negative reviews of a show here are justified. A group of astronauts go up to an abandoned space base on the moon to retrieve (whatever) and end up skulking through endless hallways. Very early on, they discover of a room full of bodies of the former crew in a locked compartment that's been there for weeks in an oxygen environment and NOBODY reacts to the smell? What are they saying? That Koreans don't decompose like the rest of us? This sloppy attention to details and glacial pacing undermine and ruin the meticulous and beautifully executed sets that recreate the lunar environment. Along with the stoic boring leads, the stock Korean 'comic' characters also slow the story and annoy. A wasted opportunity."
856,The Silent Sea,"For a show/film to be worthy of belief or emotional investment, it will usually set up a series of boundaries. Most of the time they're based on earthly rules such as our real world physics. That means that if someone performs magic we're wowed by it, someone loses a lot of blood, we worry for them etc. The silent sea throws all that out, instead giving you a set of physics that are completely inconsistent.For example: in the first episode a spaceship vents it's air after the windows crack when a heavy object hits it. Not only is the glass super fragile (for a god damn spaceship) but the air that escapes and vents out in to space for so long that the shuttle would have to be the size of a large roofed stadium to contain so much air. Maybe that sounds like a minor complaint...but you're faced with these issues every 5 seconds. The Shuttle RCS thrusters are referred to as engines. Conversations that peoppe have are beyond bizzare, with low ranking military having the weirdest conversations with their superiors. At one point, the captain meets a member of the team for the first time....as they're taking off in to space!It's just nonsense. Nothing makes sense, nothing."
857,The Silent Sea,"It's near funny to see the negative reviews here by people who probably just finished watching Squid Game and now consider themselves experts on Korean shows. Lol. Reading between the lines there's also a fair share of xenophobic Trumpers behind these negative reviews.Having said that - this is a very well crafted, well acted and beautifully shot sci fi show. It has enough of a plot to keep you interested but the real draw comes from the actors and their on-screen relationships."
858,The Silent Sea,"I was really surprised to see the show didn't waste any time for extra buildups, or side stories for characters. The story instantly instigates from the very first episode. Some of the elements in the show are very similar to the ones in Aliens by James Cameron, but the unique concept of the Silent Sea makes it stand alone completely. Some of the scenes are a bit rushed in, but overall, the show is overall very well made."
859,The Silent Sea,"If there is one thing that south Korea does like no other, it has to be the drama and believeable acting from really great cast. Now while this movie does have the quality a good narrative and well defined characters all wrapped in a very well made sci-fi story, I can't help but nitpick how flawed it feels towards the end.I'm not going to give away any spoilers, so what I can say is that while I find this show to be good and not a waste of time, I cant say that it struck me like other shows did.I am very much into sci-fi mystery and thrillers, but it felt like the suspense of disbelief got thinner and thinner towards the last portion of the film.Overall, I enjoyed it for the most part and I think there's things to like even if the show pales in comparison to ''My Name'' or ''squid game'' But it's my view on it.7/10."
860,The Silent Sea,"There isn't very much that is scientifically accurate in this show, but it does have some twists and turns and an otherwise engaging storyline that keeps you interested until the end."
861,The Silent Sea,"Binge-watched it. Liked the intriguing and suspenseful story. Solid actors. CGI is good. Set design in my opinion great! Pacing unfortunately was often wrong. The fake walk in different gravity on the moon - well - not everything has to be perfect and i think it's because of budget reasons. But hey, if you have seen Star Trek Discovery EVERYTHING is GOLD to this trash. So, good attempt and i am looking forward to Season 2!"
862,The Silent Sea,"This started off so good, but it became silly.I think up to episode 3 it was good and seemed mysterious, but when it came evident it was something to solve the water issue, and how the water virus spread it became less interesting."
863,The Silent Sea,"Part Aliens part Doctor Who part Resident Evil, this is a curious mix of many homages and a good few cliches, but it's all done well and there's some interesting new ideas in there too.Not all of it entirely gels, the science quickly wanders into fantasy and some of the in-universe logic doesn't quite hold together, but it all looks great, all the effects and sets are solid, it has a lovely creepy atmosphere and the story holds plenty of intrigue & mystery, even poignancy.I doubt it's going to be a classic, but it is certainly worthy of a watch for any sci-fi fan and I'd happily catch a series two."
864,The Silent Sea,"I mean if you took a stopwatch & tracked the total time they were endlessly tunnel walking, I can PROMISE YOU, that it is MINIMUM 2 hours of the total 7! AND THAT'S EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE! Just Pointlessly and aimlessly wondering around the tunnels stalling, what is an already stalling show! And literally NEVER ONCE helped, in the absolute slightest, with the progression of the overall story.. It's entire purpose is to create a time filler, stall out to try to greedily maximize profits at the cost & quality of the story.. & as we all know, quality is always better than quantity. This is especially true in cinema! And 1 after another of these very low grade movies, just continue being pumped out non-stop as fast as possible!! Why?!?"
865,The Silent Sea,"As usually you get the slew of reviews trashing it because it wasn't perfect, but in reality there is far more to like than dislike, particularly as the mystery is revealed.There are too many tropes and cliches in use, but there is still genuine excitement, chills, tension, and surprise. The premise is unique and the horror is peeled away to reveal something possibly more sinister.Give it a try."
866,The Silent Sea,"I had great expectations for this. I coildn't have disappointed more. Absolute boring conversations. The characters are all the same without any purpise they just go where tge script takes them do what they have to do. After the first episode i felt like i don't even care if they all just die and the show ends. In the second episode the creators tried to draw some tension some mistique, horror kind of feeling but it was just boring. The set decoration is simple nothing extra. The anoying empty useless conversations the lack of interest in the fate of the characters kills the show. Avoid."
867,The Silent Sea,"The limited budget and blatant plagiarism don't hide the positives. Some great performances, if a little slow. It's very derivative but includes some good writing among the lack of originality. Sets, like the costumes felt a bit limited by budget. I watched it and enjoyed it."
868,The Silent Sea,"First this series is technically extremly well made. There is no scene wich looks anyhow like bad cgi or not real.The physics, oh my god! Everything about it is so wrong that it is fun again. There are scenes were they try to open the hatch of a space shuttle without initial pressure compensation. Even in a space suit they would all be at least heavily wounded after that. But luckly the window of the shuttle breaks leaving out the pressure. Wich leads to a lady hanging out of the window unable to drag herself up. Why? It's moon gravity. Even with a heavy spacesuit on she would have to pull up like 20 kilograms.And we do not even discuss the overly stupid crash landing of the shuttle itself.The acting and the talking ... well it is a South Korean movie. They are known for not caring to much about that at all, but instead focusing on making movies and series that are real fun for the audience.And i have to say as a space buff, i enjoy the series just for the optics. It's beautifully made. Also i like those South Korean guys for making entertainment only for the audience and not including any ""message"" or propaganda into their productions."
869,The Silent Sea,"Stunning exterior visuals. This is what Star Citizen used to look like in its good years. And there was certain promise in the plot. But it was poorly executed, poorly acted and there were so many plot holes, I just could not force myself to superficially like it. Finale was a joke. Would not care much for another season."
870,The Silent Sea,"After enjoying so many great Korean shows in recent years, I had high hopes for Silent Sea. Unfortunately, despite solid production values, this show is a cliched mess of generic science fiction plot devices lifted from older, better movies. It's proof of one thing - water is not the critical resource that Korea needs, it's good writers and directors that are in short supply around the globe!Some of the production choices are quite puzzling. For example, the moonbase set is ridiculously oversized and very impressive, equal to anything you'd see in Hollywood perhaps short only of a Christopher Nolan movie. But the scenes at the Korean space agency on Earth are all filmed in small drab offices and random spaces that scream low budget rather than mission control. It's like they spent all their money on one huge set and had to back fill the other locations with whatever they could scrounge up.It can be hard to get a read on the acting when watching subtitles but overall, we are given no reason to care about the characters fates and it appears the actors didn't care much either. Gong Yoo is so amazing in Train to Busan that I had to check IMDB to see this was actually the same actor, because he makes no real impression here.It's really disappointing, because with better writing this show clearly had the people and budget to make an impact. Instead it's really painful to slog through all eight episodes."
871,The Silent Sea,"I recently got into Korean dramas and was looking forward to a sci-fi series sadly that was the silent sea.Not going into spoilers this is a total miss, a dystopian set in the near future that takes you to the moon, a horror with comedic elements
World building is non existent and character development is a second thought.I'd say watch this if you need some background noise the show itself is undeveloped and forgettable.Still better than the woke carp from Hollywood."
872,The Silent Sea,"Lost interest after 30 mins. No science , no logic. Characters have no communication between them from the beginning which irritates the most. Atleast show some respect for science if nothing else."
873,The Silent Sea,The direction and even the topic of the series is excellent as the director shows it amazingly that how one day we'll be doomed and our resources will come to end. The only drawback of this series for me is that the writer of the story find solution in moon. Come on..! As a science student I can't believe on it. If they show us some different planet even it was imaginary I would welcome it but they show perfect solution on moon which is kind of weird. Otherwise the acting of the actors and actresses is no doubt amazing. No doubt Koreans are best in making movies & dramas.
874,The Silent Sea,"Just finished watching the first episode, so my rating might change. But in the first episode, it feels like science was thrown out the hatch. Oh, wait, the hatch wasn't working correctly - along with everything else on the ship! It would be a shorter list if we counted what WAS working on this space ship. And didn't it occur to anyone involved with this production that moon gravity is about 1/6 earth gravity? Perhaps if the story was compelling I might be distracted from the series' glaring science holes. (I also couldn't care less whether the characters live or die, so that's a major problem with the story telling.)
I'm going to give it another episode or two, but I may not even finish the first season of this series.It sure is beautiful though. Top-notch visuals.I'm on episode 4 and they still haven't figured out how gravity works on the moon or the science behind plant growth. And I still don't care who lives or dies - although I was happy that the most obnoxious character died in the first episode. I didn't know how much of him I was going to be able to tolerate.I'm watching the last episode. Not sure why I wasted my time with this series. And they found more science to ignore. The same side of the moon always faces the earth. All their science blunders are grade school science! I just saw the finale and it stunk as bad as the rest of the series. If it gets a season 2, I'm not going to waste my time on it."
875,The Silent Sea,"These series ( or movies) all share one common plot point. The crew for this vitally important mission are the best their country has to offer. Yet invariably there will be at least one asshole, one shady character who has his own agenda.The audience knows which one of the crew who's to be trusted ( probably the lead actor). When the good guy sees something, like a monster, that no one else sees, he's immediately dismissed and told ""he's imagining things. Despite being picked for the crew because of his strengths and abilities. After 3 episodes I'm interested to see where it goes from here. So many movies follow along this same story line and it sags in the middle and flops at the end."
876,The Silent Sea,"So much drama. OMG I'm screaming during this entire series.The Earth is dying because of water loss, so scientists go to the Moon to find help. But of course, there are always conspiracy groups out to get rich or power.I felt sad, depressed and overwhelmed by this movie. Korea obviously realizes the crap is gonna hit the fan in the next 30-50 years, so watch fiction which is reality.Sorry so depressing."
877,The Silent Sea,"they arrive on the Lunar station, find dead bodies, no radiation and they still take off their helmets ignoring basic safety measures where the probability of contamimation is high.The little girl Luna survives for 5 years with what? She has extraordinary physical capabilites which normally requires a tremendous amount of energy which she get from what?Luna can walk on the moon without any protection. Her blood, fluids do not freeze!?!?! She Breathes?!?Lunar water has unplausible properties not organic...it multiplies itself from...nothing1?!?Seriously don't loose your time. Avoid."
878,The Silent Sea,"The idea looked promesing, the budget was there, the cast is good, but its sooo boring.... nothing really happens, from time to time comes an interesting scene but thazs about it. Not really worth the time."
879,The Silent Sea,Why would a mining and research base have a keypad that lets people into the airlocks? Like there are people just out there strolling around on the moon and might want to break in and steal some Soju? When the shuttle crashed and nearly skid over the edge into the canyon how did Dr Soon fall out of her chair? No gravity? Then the windsheild blows out with such force it almost blows Dr Soon out of the shuttle ? The moon is no atmosphere and inside the shuttle is 1 atmosphere. Thats not enough to blow anything out after a few seconds of smashing out? Boo...
880,The Silent Sea,"It's a story that doesn't really tell anything new. The show is nevertheless quite entertaining and in places really exciting. However, the story is not quite convincing, especially since there are some rough plot-holes and logic errors, and the ending is not really satisfying either. Some effects and also the set can't always convince. But since it was not a boring story, I can give 6 stars."
881,The Silent Sea,"One of the few shows that succeeds so well in developing a gripping plot and ambience while dealing with the Sci-fi genre. The topic of the show was rather intelligent, well thought and different. Though in the starting it had Interstellar vibes, however, the concept and execution of the whole thing were quite unique. The suspense that the show managed to create amongst its viewers is something I highly appreciate. Moreover, it took it's time to develop the plot and the suspense which is taken to be a drawback by many yet I believe that it was one of the strongest factors as the show didn't dive directly into conclusions and give up the mystery. The performances were also fantastic.Highly Recommended!!!"
882,The Silent Sea,"Great visuals, both on earth and the moon. Acting was fine, in spite of some moments of unnecessary banter in the script. Powerful suspense. Like someone else said, Solaris-like feel. The bleak dystopian world seemed sadly credible to me.There were some plotholes which I'll mention with the spoilers. But all in all worth the watch to me (I binged it).**** Spoiler alert ***** Certain crew handlings seemed amateur to me, like the lack of precautions when dealing with the bodies of people whose deaths have yet to be investigated. You'd think they'd be wise enough to consider contamination, virus or otherwise.* When the captain checks Dr. Song's body cam to see why and how a crew member died, I wondered why they didn't check their deceased crew member's body cam too. It would've given them an immediate clue about his death (contact with dead body).* Shooting at the cloned ""girl"" blindly, endangering everyone, what with the dangerous test-tubes.* Unnecessary small talk in episode 5. In ep5 I also started questioning credibility (and, again, crew choices).* Discrepancies, like: when a test-tube breaks down the plant shaft there's great panic, though we're not shown what happens (though we do see massive flooding later). The next time a test-tube breaks (with the clone) there isn't half the panic and nothing happens, water-wise.* The communication between crew members could've been better. Someone vomitting water incessantly seems like something to alert the entire force about, first up the captain.One could argue the astronauts are under a lot of stress, but the script might've benifited from an astute script doctor.Having said all that, many great sci-fi movies have such plotholes. I really enjoyed the watch."
883,The Silent Sea,"Painfully _painfully_ slow, badly written and nothing to add to the genre.It really does suck. I put myself through six episodes but after the first two I was jumping whole scenes at a time to find anything resembling action or interest, and lost none of the plot at all doing so..
Even then it wasn't enough for me to bear watching any more.Just.. don't bother!"
884,The Silent Sea,"This tv series is soooooo long and boring. They tried alot, put so much effort but all these things done couldn't save the plot. So many clichés, so ambitious but the script somehow ruined everything. At the end of the day, I didn't even know what they trying to say, trying to do or how to solve their problem. And trust me, we this Plot developing so far, I do not think it is gonna end well for Luna."
885,The Silent Sea,"What a surprise, a pretty descent Sci-Fi series minus the some of the lines Gong Yoo who played Han Yoon-jae was given, some of his lines came across as a WTH did he just say moment, maybe a translation thing?Other than that, I'm really hoping for a second season!"
886,The Silent Sea,"This a good series . It will keep you entertained and that's it. It's actually better than the last movies of this genre by Hollywood and since Interstellar.The pace: Thanks there are only 8 episodes. Dragging it to 12 or 16 will be too much boring. Though this could have been shorter like 5 episodes max.Plot: the story isn't bad. It's interesting and original. If you are able to ignore the fact that people supposed to be smart have a limited IQ, you can spend a good time watching this.Character development: the main characters' stories are visited at the beginning of all the episodes. This is a good idea. Only a few times, there will be flash back.Overall, Silent Sea has some good ideas. It speaks of the current themes that affect our planet and what could happen in the future. But the rest (survival horror) is just things that are revisited again and again which makes the series too predictable."
887,The Silent Sea,"Felt this was the direct result of an algorithm churning scripts in a basement. I feel no decent scientific advisors were ever consulted. Only Good thing from this movie was the scenic CGI shots of the moon.Checklist for the Korean Sci-fi movie Cliche Bot:Earth destroyed beyond repair broken into water based caste system

888,The Silent Sea,"This bucket of slop doesn't even rate a ""meh"" for being science fanasy. It's too stupid for that. Certainly the whole mess could have been reduced to a single two hour stupid movie instead of being nearly eight hours of stupid series. I kept watching because there had to be _some_ sort of payoff, y'know? But no, there was nothing but more stupidity.Yet Another ""Water Becomes Rare"" dorkiness, in this craprod water is a valuable commodity on Earth. Never mind that 70% of the planet is covered with the stuff. Forget about the fact that adults need over a liter of water per day just to stay alive , and that water is consumed in massive quantities by every operation that produces the food humans need to stay alive as well. In this cluster of fakery it's rare and under allocation.Oh, and then there are the sappy, sickeningly sweet side stories about the motivations of the main characters. Silly, dull, predictable, and downright dumb. What a combination. None of the stories told through flashback made any real difference in the character buildup at all.Please don't ask me to go into depth about the plot holes large enough for a Mack truck or the absolutely flabbergastingly dunce way the characters behaved (especially towards each other), or the utterly non-science way matter just ""multiplied"" out of nothing at all.Anybody who graduated high school will have their intelligence insulted by this flick. Actually, I'm pretty sure sophmores in high school will have their education insulted by this colassal turd in the punchbowl of moviedom. Avoid at all costs. You will lose precious brain cells as well as your time by watching this mastermess."
889,The Silent Sea,"The production value is good, the sets and costumes are well designed and seem practical. Some of the plots seem to be derived from other sources and, while well written, the familiarity of the plots do detract from the overall story. The most familiar is the 'Ripley/Newt' relationship which is developed, with the little touches like the tracker, and the escape through the facility.Overall, an enjoyable program with some recognizable faces from Korean cinema."
890,The Silent Sea,"I'm disappointed with the series. Not enough story and idea. Acting, not really impressive. Music, I don't really care. Quite waste my time watching the series."
891,The Silent Sea,"These people are on a space mission to the moon and they're all acting like they're on a school trip. They immediately crash as if they bought the shuttle on wish and never flew it before and yet they're all pretty chill about it and wondering if they'll be able to complete their mission in 24 hours. With a crashed shuttle. I get the FI but a little SCI is meeded to. These are like randos they found on the street with no engineering or science skills, or even common sense. It's comedic."
892,The Silent Sea,Do the writers and directors know what gravity is and how it works? The premise isn't a foreign one but the direction and arcs are completely illogical and unnecessary.
893,The Silent Sea,"It's a Korean show, so I was already expecting a lot of emotional baggage and cheesy acting.Well, you get that and more. Some serious plot holes that defy logic, Here are a couple:1. If you go into a lab without knowing why people died, you can take your helmet off. Really?!2. Let me reach over this dead body to pick something up.3. Duct tape fixes everything including holes in space suits.4. As soon as you leave a contaminated area, it's perfectly safe to remove your mask, because viruses know to stay in the contaminated area.5. Wait until the last second to do everything because it's cool.6. Space shuttles all have these handy trap doors just below the crew area.7. Space base's ventilation ducts are big enough to walk in standing up.I managed to get through the whole season, but the last couple episodes got really unrealistic, so, watcher beware.I am praying there will be No season 2."
894,The Silent Sea,"I read through some of the reviews and it became clear why such dichotomous scores appear here. For those who have not seen the show and are considering whether to give it a try, your guidance on review scores is as follows:Scores of 2 or below: The setting of this story is 2075. The devastation mankind is facing is water depletion. Rationing of water based on some kind of class rank system, which also includes ""no pets"" policy. Due to this basic premise, you are going to have few climate change deniers and animal lovers bombing the reviews with low scores.Scores of 9 or higher: With so many plot holes, these high scores represent nothing more than show of fandom.The show has a somewhat interesting premise, but it truly fails to live up to its potential. Some of the military crew members act emotionlessly on purpose, and as a result, some scenes are simply monotonous. There are too many plot holes and implausibility that cannot be accepted even for a sci-fi show like this. I can go on and on, but the conclusion is that the show is very average at best. If you're a fan of this genre and have seen all of the Alien series and others, this might be an interesting take with a new form of ""danger"" the crew members must deal with. For others, I highly doubt it will worth the time invested."
895,The Silent Sea,The visuals are ok but that's about it.I find myself watching it because i've got nothing else to watch atm but there's not a single moment this series managed to grab my attention (even though i'm a sci-fi thriller/horror) type of guy.The story just isn't engaging enough and never really picks up speed.Also the fact that a lot of Squid Game actors are in this made it a bit hard to flip the switch to being all serious.6/10 purely for the visuals and cinematography but all the rest is really 'bland'...
896,The Silent Sea,"I want to love this show. It's got some of my favorite actors, and the premise is great. Earth is dying because of a water shortage, and a mysterious new type of water has been discovered on the moon. But the water comes at a cost...So far that's a good premise and it would have made for a good show. Unfortunately the show quickly devolves into a mediocre 80's Hollywood sci-fi with questionable logic. Low gravity makes you move in slow-motion? Characters take their helmets off for no reason?The biggest problem is the monster which turns out not to be a monster. You can't have your cake and eat it too, show. First you make it like the Grudge and have it rip people's arms off, and then you have it take candy from a woman. It's daft.Last but not least another issue is the amount of ""just made it"" moments. There's too many moments where characters are low on oxygen but make it when it's at 1%. They pull this cheap trick from episode 1 onwards and it's extremely tiring.Let's hope Kingdom returns soon.4/10."
897,The Silent Sea,"I was going to give a 6, mainly for special effects, but I cut a point for the crappy ending. An android that can walk barefoot and unsuited on the moon's surface in a vacuum, but is also supposed to be a human-substitute test subject? Seriously? And the female lead seems practically devoid of the ability to emote, having a single facial expression throughout, except for a single smile. And the characters all appear to be very slow to realize what's really going on despite overwhelming evidence. Only watch if you're desperate for entertainment."
898,The Silent Sea,"Great sets and solid graphics give a real feel of a lunar setting, but the script is filled with creative ideas completely unsupported by any kind of consistency or credible science so then it is more like a lunar-fantasy-horror. Unfortunately, the script is merely a vehicle to propel us from one interesting-though-improbable scene to the next...really just a string of genre cliches.Personally, I like this kind of slow-moving isolation drama so I enjoyed most of it, chiefly for the atmosphere, but the last 2 episodes were so filled with illogic that it became painful. (Especially irritating to me was the gun-wielding without reason, followed by not using guns when there was every reason in the world to do so.)To top it all off, there is no satisfactory conclusion...we end up not knowing a whole lot about lunar-water, we don't find out for sure what happens next to what's left of our heroes and there were hints of deeper mysteries and they hit us with one last completely super-hero-like impossibility right at the end as if it will shock us and keep us guessing except that it's all so vague and beyond possibility that, basically, it's now just magic.Ultimately, except for the mood, there is nothing of value here. I kind of enjoyed it for that but expected some revelations in the last 2 episodes and was bitterly disappointed. I definitely will not waste my time if there is a second season."
899,The Silent Sea,"It seems that many in the international audience began watching Korean shows/movies after the surprise success of Squid Game. However, Korea has been making amazing shows/movies for many years. The Silent Sea is another one of these amazing shows. This show tells the story of humans trying to find answers in a foreign world. This is not a story about fighting aliens, but about a group of people separated from the world they know, struggling to find answers in a world they cannot comprehend. The acting, directing, plot, and CGI are wonderful. This is a good series worth watching."
900,The Silent Sea,"Not sure about this trend of Korean movies and series, perhaps Netflix could chill with it a bit.Passable camera work and sound, but script, dialogues and acting are pretty terrible. Boring as hell, should have made it a 3 part series at most. Watched it only due to Sci Fi setting, but still regret the time wasted on it..."
901,The Silent Sea,"There's food for a good Sci-Fi in the plot, but the implementation falls short.It should have been a movie. They barely have enough material for two hours, but they tell it soooooo slowly to milk a series from the bulletpoints.Ultimately it yields a series so slow paced that it is ridiculously boring throughout most of the runtime.Bring your phone or internet surf tool of choice to this series so you can entertain yourself in the slow filler hours."
902,The Silent Sea,"I like South Korean filmmaking. I expected to like this series.I'd tune in for almost anything Bae Doona is in, but sadly her talents are wasted in this overlong mess. The premise is outstanding: In the dystopian future, the Earth has become a desert wasteland. With the population on the verge of dying of thirst, a new source of unlimited water is discovered, but it's toxic.9.5 for sets and visual effects
5 for slooooooooooooooow pacing.3 for disjointed story lines and lack of character development.It would have been far better as a 4 episode limited series with much tighter pacing."
903,The Silent Sea,"There's a very solid idea here, extremely creative as far as I know within the sci-fi genre, but they lost their way, though I'd bet they weren't sure how to tell a story to make the central idea of the show interesting."
904,The Silent Sea,"VERY slow beginning, but the show is hardly as bad as the negative reviews are making. It picks up about midway through and gets interesting. I suspect they didn't watch all the way through, which is understandable, as I almost gave it up myself. It is very creative. If you can stand the slow first half, and if you're cool with weirder shows, give it a shot."
905,The Silent Sea,"I dislike series that aim to capture audience thru polemics and one popular way to do this is to make the cast do stupid things that noone would do in real life.How realistic should a production be and still be entertainment? Depends on the genre, noone expects a superhero film to be realistic but a proper science fiction has to have a high level of realism or at the very least a solid core concept.Alas, here we have gross stupidity, a crew is sent to a ruined lunar station where there were mass casualties and all died. They are to retrieve some delicate substance in a small container but the space agency does not give them even the basic info so they do not know the core of their mission.But why do we have this stupidity? The answer is business, the producers target and aim to capture a low-culture audience (aka masses) who lack a refined mind. They need actors who would do stupid things on screen but with a character show so audiences associate themselves with these characters or behaviors and not with the science.My low-culture comment is not an insult but only the identification of a social glass ceiling. Low culture is not about freedom or the empowerment of working class or even equality of opportunity but the opposite because it leads to human husbandry.Low culture is often immediate and visceral so there is a limited value to it and it certainly colors the world when high culture can be sterile however when it comes in the form of a production that claims to be science fiction when it is not, this is an insult to Aldous Huxley, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov and others."
906,The Silent Sea,"I truly believe South Korean movies are some of the best out there in every genre there is. Lately their foray into science fiction has been successful but this show right here doesn't hit the mark. Nothing really happens in the first 3 episodes. The ""science fiction drama"" is a very tough genre to break into and a very niche market compared to ""action or thriller"". The trailer promised to be something the show isn't. It is quite boring and uninteresting at most times. There isn't much CGI to being with and you don't really connect with any of the characters. However I will never NOT watch a South Korean science fiction film because sometimes they hit it out of the park but this show doesn't!"
907,The Silent Sea,"The problem with making Sc-fi these days is that there are a lot of sci-fi movies. The bar goes up each year. That said, given the amount of per-release attention this was getting, I expected more. Overall it's not a bad movie. I think 8 episodes really stretched it. Five episodes would have been enough. The ending was wonky. The Silent Sea didn't earn a second season IMO."
908,The Silent Sea,"The eye rolls pertain to horrible science, lack of anyone asking questions, and unconscionable lunar station design.Acting was good. Suspense was available. With that, I could finish the season.Really broken science, dystopian setting and random illogic.Honestly, it rates 5.5."
909,The Silent Sea,"Watched for half the eps before I called it quits. It's not bad, just boring. It's the virtual equivalent of watching paint dry. I've grown quite fond of the stuff coming out of Korea over the last several years but this one is a definite miss."
910,The Silent Sea,Very solid show well crafted delivering a different experience then other show I love it.The characters arc & development is simple and not to much filler .The end is good The music 🎶 as well.
911,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea has potential. It's enjoyable in the meaning of watching until the end, but some scene is boring and very ""skip-able"". I love the mystery element that is revealed slowly one by one in each episode. Fortunately, it's just eight episodes and makes me didn't more bad rate. The ending also doesn't give an impression."
912,The Silent Sea,"Every comment I read about this series focuses in the lack of science knowledge in the script. Well, since when is it important in a sci-fi movie? We all know there's no such thing as telekinesis and that there's no way to build a litghtsaber or to clone a person, but I'm sure all these critics love Star Wars... I really don't understand why scientific coherence is suddenly so important.That said, I think both the story and the acting were very good. The pace was correct to build the mood. I found it very entertaining and mostly well done. (But not always: the way they faked walking in zero gravity was very lame) The only bad thing, in my opinion, is that I think they changed the ending. The characters knew what they could expect and what they wanted to do, and it would have been more logical to end the series that way instead of the ""deus ex machine"" solution they adopted. It was very disappointing."
913,The Silent Sea,"This is one of those series I ended up binge watching in one sitting, feeling like an 8 hour movie. And I never do that. It pays homage to some of the sci-fi classics while still remaining very unique in premise and science, and very feasible knowing how our history has progressed thus far. The suspense is very well written and driven. A thrilling addition to the Netflix sci-fi canon that i predict will become a classic (non English are slow to evolving) or a cult classic. Either way, a classic. Bravo Korea, and my favorite actors from Korea. Very nice seeing you again. I pray for a second season, but if it stops here, it's still a nice finish."
914,The Silent Sea,"It's a show that catches your attention and makes you want to keep watching, but only by making every single scene overly dramatic and thrilling. Every step of the way, it's a down to the wire scenario. Tries way too hard...last minute things should be here and there. Not every single scene."
915,The Silent Sea,"As a person with a physics degree, I do enjoy sci-fi horrors but this is more fantasy than sci-fi. A few simple issues could have been fixed in regard to the story to make it at least somewhat realistic. Matter just creating itself from nothing? Really? At least have something to turn into water.However, it was fun and well filmed."
916,The Silent Sea,"I went into this movie intrigued by the premise. Even the fast-paced talking and subtitles were OK though demanding of close attention. I had to quit in the first episode though because of the shaky camera work, presumably a hand-held camera. It made me too queasy to continue watching."
917,The Silent Sea,"The whole series is satisfying enough. I managed to watch all episodes...But, however, it really could have been an excellent 2 hr movie perhaps, and quite a remarkable one for that matter. Most of the episodes are just drawn out unnecessarily. The good ends up lost and obscured by unnecessary scenes. Wasted potential that could have been better than many in the Alien 👽 franchise in my opinion, had it been executed properly."
918,The Silent Sea,"Prometheus set the benchmark for seemingly smart scientists acting against their core logic by doing incredibly stupid things. The Silent Sea does fall into that trap on more than a few times which is its major unfortunate flaw, but despite that I found myself enjoying the show. There are also other moments where the science just goes out of the window also. I guess I was more forgiving as Ridley Scott had directed more than a few Sci-Fi/Adventures and should have known better and Prometheus was just the 1st of many for him.The show is set in the future when due to environmental damage by humans, water has become scarcity and now a valuable resource. A team of astronauts is despatched to an abandoned space station to retrieve some highly classified mysterious samples. The mission is steeped in secrecy from the onset, this is slowly peeled away throughout the show's episodes, as terrible choices and actions are made to serve the better good, or worse for the outcome of it. There are some recognisable faces here, Bae Doona from the hugely underrated Sense8, and Gong Yoo from the superb Train to Busan.The Silent Sea impressed me with it's set design, FX and atmospheric cinematography which was way above what a TV show should have. It wasn't all about the eye candy though, the acting was uniformly great, and the story kept me interested. Compared to other vile and horrid Sci-Fi we have been subjected to recently, Picard, Star Trek Discovery & Dr Who, this is Oscar winning stuff compared to them. There are obvious influences here to other films such as Aliens, but then again doing original Sci-Fi is very difficult now as most of it has been done before. I also got the Dead Space vibes from this if anyone has played that game.I found it to be a solid well-crafted show if you are willing to ignore its shortcomings and have a little patience with it."
919,The Silent Sea,"I started watching this series because it kept appearing on the Netflix home; partly out of curiosity and partly because I didn't have other series to see, I started the first episode... I couldn't get away from the screen.I really like both series and movies that deal with space, science fiction, mysteries, but no one has ever taken me so much. The story is very well written, I don't think I can find places where the story falls or becomes boring. The twists are very interesting and the characters are amazing, especially Han, one of the protagonists.I find that the result is nothing short of exceptional, I really wish there was a sequel to find some characters but the story is over and also with a satisfying ending.Highly recommended for all those passionate about the genre and who want to see something engaging."
920,The Silent Sea,This series felt alot like Prometheus. The science in this is flawed. It's more fantasy than science fiction. Having earth-like gravity on a moon base? Really? But if you're able to cast aside the flaws and just enjoy the suspenseful story then it's all good. It kepted me hooked the entire time so I'll at least give it a 7/10.
921,The Silent Sea,"If you love scifi great show.Best special effects beautiful script.Lunar Water....
For sure there is water outside there. Moon? Mars?And how do we care about drinking water in our planet?Great show to watch. Enjoy
Hope there's part 2
Eduardo."
922,The Silent Sea,"If only the writers were as good as the cgi artists and programmers this series could have been brilliant.But they are not and I bailed halfway through episode 2 not wanting to waste another 6 hours on it. All the usual tropes are there. Captain who won't listen to legitimate concerns. Amature inexperienced crew on an mission so important they aren't told what it is!. Stupidity. Example someone dies and with oxygen running out they just leave the body with it's remaining tank and walk off, helmets off when no one knows if it's safe. Physics. Gravity which comes and goes. Ect, ect,ect. I gave up when the captain said the equivalent of "" lets split up""
3 stars for the cgi."
923,The Silent Sea,"I thought the teaching in Korea was excellent, but how to justify the lack of water on a planet whose surface is covered by 2/3 of water that can be desalinated? Why fetch water from the Moon if Antarctica's ice contains 70% of the planet's fresh water?Just out there, you can already know the intellectual level of the writers, the producer and the director... and also of the people who enjoyed the series."
924,The Silent Sea,"This was a painful experience for me. The Silent Sea seems to have all the worst parts of other space-centered movies I personally can't stand, like Prometheus or The Cloverfield Paradox. It's all there, perfectly recreated - the wonky space physics, the roster of characters who consistently behave in irrational manners, fail at the most basic steps of communication or just stand there, staring into the distance, while their oxygen runs low or the monster catches up to them. There is a staggering lack of competence amidst the crew, despite their supposedly crucial mission to save humanity.Don't even get me started on the profoundly stale trope of greedy corporations manipulating researchers and soldiers to go on a mission they don't understand to get something dangerous, withholding crucial information that actively jeopardizes their chances of success.At the end of the day this was supposed to be a very simple story - just a bunch of astronauts visiting a space station to retrieve samples. Except from the very beginning the show just insists on twisting and contorting itself to create artificial, unconvincing drama. It might have been innovative... back in the 90s. At least fans of Gong Yoo or Bae Dona get to have their fix, I guess?"
925,The Silent Sea,"The show was amazing, I finished all 8 episodes in one go because it had me hooked. The actors are terrific, and the storyline amazing. However, there were certain parts that were dragged out a bit too long for my liking (the characters would be running away from danger but taking their sweet time to do so). Other than that there were no other faults that I could pick up, had the show dealt with the issues mentioned above I would've given this show a 10/10. This show might not be for everyone and that's perfectly fine. I saw one reviewer stating that a 10/10 score was a fake score, and it really isn't. Some people connected to the show more so than others."
926,The Silent Sea,"I have no idea where to start. If you are looking for better SciFi than this trash Netflix has been putting out lately like Another Life or Nightflyers, I'm sorry, no such luck here.To make it short:Terrible acting, totally dumb decisions that are far beyond anything the dumbest people on the planet would do, horribly stilted dialogues and totally unbelievable space-fantasy. Nothing in this series has any anchor in reality.This is totally unrealistic from start to finish. If you in any way watch it to the end, you will see the dumbest and most unscientific ending you will ever see.There is one thing that would redeem this abomination:
Watch it as a comedy. If you do that, you can laugh at the absurdity of it all and have a good time, with dumb dialogues, stupid decisions, totally unrealistic plot developments, space magic etc.If you watch it as a grounded sfi fi series, it falls apart in the first 20 minutes in episode 1."
927,The Silent Sea,"You always have to suspend your disbelief when it comes to sci-fi movies. That's just a given but there is only so much disbelief you can ignore before it crosses into the ridiculous. The series crosses into the ridiculous a little too often especially with the climax. It's just not possible for what happens at the end unless the mystery girl is part tardigrade. There is definitely a Prometheus vibe going on and it also repeats the same problems as that movie. If you are around an unknown environment with many dead people for unknown causes, by all that is holy wear your helmet and take all safety measures. For a show with 8 episodes, they leave too many unanswered questions. There is moon flora native to the moon? Why not investigate how that's possible?This show should have really been 6 episodes. Too many scenes were just filler parts. I have no idea in what universe people compare this to Squid Game or other recent South Korean shows. There is nothing at all in common except a couple of actors. Bae Doona is in the excellent South Korean show Kingdom but no one compares it to that. She was also in Sense8 but this show is nothing like that either. This show was obviously written for there to be a second season to answer all those unanswered questions. The writers need to do a better job of making the events more plausible. A guy, who none of the crew has worked with or knows, isn't just going to be allowed to join a top secret mission the day of the launch just because. It makes it super obvious he is up to no good so when we discover he is in fact up to no good it is no surprise."
928,The Silent Sea,"I can't be as down on this series as many of the sci-fi masters herein seem to want to be. It's not the best I've seen but I was intrigued enough to keep watching and ultimately I enjoyed the series. This is an early attempt at sci-fi by k-dramatists and I think they have made a good start. Tension and mystery abound and I wasn't really bothered by familiar tropes. Lots of ""don't go in there"" moments. Don't get too bogged down with high expectations. It's good enough, enjoy."
929,The Silent Sea,Omg what a series...what a cinematography.top notch vfx...unique plot.execution is unique thrilling upto end.jaw biting suspense.................love this.
930,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea is high-concept science-fantasy that isn't bad or particularly remarkable. However, you have to treat it a lot like Sweet Home in that if you watch it, it's fun, but you shouldn't think too deeply about any one concept or character motivation/choice or you're going to be annoyed at the plot holes and (pun intended) moon logic. I would say give it a try for its visuals and sci-fi elements and just discount everything else going in, and you should be fine."
931,The Silent Sea,Dr Song just stares. The story is interesting. They go to the moon but acts like scared children. I'm still curious and whatched it to the end. The main actor is great. I do recomend it.
932,The Silent Sea,"Starts off a bit slow but builds momentum. I became hooked. Contrary to some other reviews, I found it the opposite of boring! Do give it a chance. (I always watch with subtitles, never dubbing, for what it's worth.)
The premise might seem far-fetched to some, but I didn't find it out of the realm of possibility. After all, we don't know what the future brings. Great acting and effects. Not too much sci-fi mumbo jumbo, like reaching into the air for calculations that magically appear, but the astronauts wear wrist screens that seem more realistic. Another element to a series that I always appreciate is the music, and it's very, very good here. Well done, and thank you, South Korea!"
933,The Silent Sea,"I think all the previous reviews (those of 6 stars and lower) have already said enough about the show; it's boring, dragging, lacks logic and is missing basic laws of physics. I will only summarise with final scene of the first episode - the scene of entering the station. No, not going to the station, but actually entering it. They are already at the station and the road from the the entrance to the door (about 10-15 meters) takes them 4 minutes!! Or actually the scene lasts for 4 minutes....."
934,The Silent Sea,Im still watching it only because im a sucker for space stuff. Im on the last episode and i was lucky i was watching it while doing something or else i would not have made it past episode 2. Cliché dialogue and the actors are motionless. And i dont get why nteflix uses the same actors for all their Korean movies.
935,The Silent Sea,"True sci-fi entertainment instead of woke garbage. It takes watching Korean movies for escaping the global trend.Good action pace, better story, some predictability, but overall a very enthralling story.End could be better, it seems to be weird on several aspects, for opening the door for a 2nd season.Korean productions seem to get better, and this serie is a proof of it."
936,The Silent Sea,"It's definitely a fresh start for the Korean drama industry. The idea is certainly intriguing, and it keeps me watching it in one sitting. But things could never be perfect, as it has so many things I dislike. I can't point all of them, but I just hate the way it unfolds the Luna water story, and don't get me started on the weird and abrupt ending it has. Some scenes are unnecessary to put it into the big picture considering not even we got the closure of the woman main character's sister that her whereabouts still remains a mystery. Not to forget about the unnecessary drama of deaths that eventually makes me bored because it could've done otherwise. The ending is obviously the most hilarious part in which the main problem of rescuing Sample became a meh situation because they don't give us any closure on how they will act forth after that. They don't even unravel the behind of the survival of one, its survivor as if they don't know how to elaborate more into that matter when it's actually the main topic of this whole journey to the moon. And instead, they gave us a way too open ending that ends abruptly while they had given 8 episodes to explain. The cinematography was quite enjoyable after the first episode and the suspense was also nice and not too long that could make it too boring for me. The acting was excellent considering the cast are all top actors, and I've seen them a lot in a better story. But that's it I guess. I need Korean dramas from Netflix original doesn't always need to have an open ending to hint us for another season, sometimes some stories can only be resolved within a season, and you can make up another issue after that for the next season if only making another season is plausible."
937,The Silent Sea,"I don't really write reviews much but just had to say I loved this series. No nonsense, Hollywood degeneracy or anything ... just an epic space/moon/sci-fi slow-building drama/adventure with great acting, an engaging story, high production on all fronts along with near flawless special effects. I wouldn't say no to a 2nd season but not sure how they could top this. Man I wish more TV ""shows"" were this good ... sadly gems like this are very rare!"
938,The Silent Sea,"The sole reason im making this review is due to the negative reviews some people make.As you can see most of the reviews giving this below 5 include things like cliches or unrealistic etc.I would to quote here and say ""without cliche characters there would not be a movie"" unless you only want to watch documentaries about real life scenarios....even those sometimes fail due to human errors though...
Dont expect physics and science to work just fine in a sci-fi.If you come prepared you will enjoy the show."
939,The Silent Sea,"1. They ripped off Alen/Aliens so many times it felt like a Korean reboot.2. Weak writing once again throws the ""Law of Conservation of Mass"" right out the airlock.3. The moon has a lower gravity than earth... act like it.4. The space station on the moon has magic gravity with a flip of the switch. Sigh... Once again weak science.5. No redundancies. There should be 2-3 redundancies for every life and mission critical system.6. They are in a Hazmat situation but instead of donning their space suit helmets they put on full face respirators. You'd think during these pandemic times they would grasp the concept.7. The plants grow without light.8. The acting is forced.9. Cinematography is constrained and Ridgid. Feel like a soap opera. It's a space epic on the moon. Try a wide shot every once in a while.10. The plot is Trite.11. The ""monster"" is Trite.There is so much more to list and I'm only on episode 5...."
940,The Silent Sea,"I'm 43 years old and i'm getting tired of all the recent agenda driven series.So i had to look beyond Hollywood. And lo and behold Korea gave to me exactly what i wanted.Someone else said in his review that it reminds of the game Dead Space and i agree 100%
So if space isolation and mystery is your thing this series is for you.I loved every episode and hoping to see a season 2 announced. PLEASE producers greenlight a season 2."
941,The Silent Sea,"Since squid game ended i haven't really found any good kdrama to watch. Hellbound was sadly disappointing. So my hopes for Silent Sea was high not just because of Gong Yoo but the trailer seemed well made and intriguing. Also Bae Donna so I was hyped.I literally binged the show in a day and I have to say that I actually really liked it. I was sort of expecting the usual kdrama tropes abt relationship drama/forced comedy or just melodrama in general but this show had none of those. They jumped on the plot on the 1st episode and since then the events keep happening one after the other.Pros : Coming to the plot of the show its nothing unique about going to space to
collect some mysterious specimen with no proper explanation to the crew and obviously a new member with mysterious past is added. I am sure these sort of stories are done many times but what I found interesting was the the social commentary on the earth which was facing drought causing extreme class division. Also how water is something one can't live without but when they find that even a drop of lunar water turns out be to humans biggest enemy bcz it kills the host.I am glad the science talks were sort of dumbed down and explained for ppl to understand, and it wasnt some super complicated mumbo jumbo.The twists and turns were sort of unpredictable i didn't see some of them coming so that was fun.Coming to the characters, I know it's a 8 part series but I wd have liked some back stories for the supporting cast to be able to connect with them as a viewer. Even for Gong Yoo he seemed to have been given a very one toned character. He is a great actor they could have done more with his role by giving him some depth. Bae Dona was the most fleshed out character and she did well !Now the pace of the show at times was very sluggish they cud have easily edited out scenes of them just walking or standing and breathing. I understand that at times it necessary to create the claustrophobic space atmosphere but there were too many scenes like this.The CGI was at times looking funny but I dont expect it to be Hollywood movie like so I can ignore that.All in all I would definitely suggest this show as a sci fi fan i thoroughly enjoyed it even with some faults. It ended in cliffhanger so am hoping for another season with better explanations."
942,The Silent Sea,Such a great cast.It definitely dragged out in the beginning. Has an interesting story once it begins to get on with it. So many dead and no answers ever answered. What was the point of this. What is the point of these shows that are made up of endless seasons?This felt like a drama where nothing was resolved.
943,The Silent Sea,"I as a sci-fi fan I've watched this show mainly because the story plays out mostly on a lunar base and famous actress Bae Doona.The script writers took their creative expressionism to the absolute limit, because, 95% of the events depicted are physically and biologically impossible.Forget the physics of space flight that 90% of sci-fi movies/TV series get completely wrong, you won't be able to land the space shuttle on the Moon in configuration depicted and flight characteristics requiring presence of the atmosphere, your mass/weight on the Moon won't automatically increase just by pressurizing airlock, your body will not magically produce 2-3x more water than it contains no matter what extraterrestrial virus is used.The final nail to the coffin that this is a fantasy show is ability of human-hybrid walking and surviving on the surface of the Moon without space suit."
944,The Silent Sea,"If you like watching a tv serie consisting mostly of characters walking through halls this may be your cup of tea. It seems that writers had a cast but not a plot. Reason and logic is nowhere to be found. I'm so sad the director took the cheesy south Korean formula: children in danger? Check!, Villain with no motivation beside of ""just because""? Check!, Heroes and main characters being easily defeated? Check!, Stupid non sense response from otherwise intelligent people? Check! Many unconnected sub plots? Check!."
945,The Silent Sea,"I think an AI came up with the plot, and script, because it's so damn nonsensical.They tried, but got *obvious* things so very wrong. Physics, cause, effect, etc, are apparently optional. Basic human behavior does not follow logic in this show."
946,The Silent Sea,"Given one of the main character also casts Train to Bushan, I thought it should be the only similarity between them. But I was wrong.The whole show could have been compressed into a movie and avoided so many strange plotholes introduced by the long and unnecessary story."
947,The Silent Sea,"Full of platitudes, artficial dialogues and terrible acting this creation anountvto sensless yet pretentious visual atrocity.And the core idea is simply idiotic and impossible to buy. To start with idea of multiplying water. It is an insult to vewers well aware that water is a molecular structure and not a living organism. Do not sell an idiotic sci fi novelty especially half concocted and unsupported even by a semblance of a theory."
948,The Silent Sea,"There are a lot of people that already pointed some ""wrongs"" of this series-the walking on the moon
the... let us take out our helmetsafter one be infected with ""something"" and die ... let not pick our helmets or masksplants without sunetc...but the one that is mostly confused for me... so if the water touch a human (living cell) it will multiply until the human or the ""host"" dies after that it stays inactive...but... if it touches blood... ooooohhh it is the hell unleashed... it will multiply indefinitelyps (after the first death, when the doctor retrieve some blood ... it came more water than blood) and doesn't multiply???And the fish? It only multiplies the specific water to fill the aquarium?"
949,The Silent Sea,I don't know why people are rating it low..were they expecting space horror? Probably. Despite some loose ends it's still a nice watch. Could've been shortened by 1 or 2 episodes. Bt still liked it.
950,The Silent Sea,"I am not a fan of sci-fi or space drama/thrillers but as a fan of S. Korean movies and TV series, I gave it a watch. Overall, it's slow-burning with a somber mood, different from other sci-fis of this kind giving out a realistic feel of their challenges, no aliens or creatures about but something more mysterious and deadly, with intriguing twist and turns and you have to watch all the episodes patiently to really experience the show. There is also a very important message - climate change and the effects on future generations like water shortages which can easily happen if not already. Some of the acting surprisingly was not up to par for me but maybe because this whole project was a complete new experience for all involved. I think, the show would have been better with fewer episodes but for a new director and first attempts at this kind of genre, I was really impressed and enjoyed the show.However, I like to point out somethings based on the comments/reviews I have seen a lot lately (Squid Game, Hellbound, My Name, etc.):1) There is so much comparing every recent S. Korean show that comes out to Squid Game. Even the reputable sites that review films/TV shows are doing it. It's ludicrous and at this point aggravating as if all recent S. Korean shows must somehow be like Squid Game to be worthy or that's all they have to offer!2) I have seen some reviews that seem suspicious and generic whether rated high or low. Sadly, I have even seen few racist ones!! Not sure even any of these ratings were based on actually watching the shows??3) There is always some comparing the shows from other countries to Hollywood ones as if that is the ""ultimate standard"". International shows have become very popular in recent years so they must be doing something right. Viewers these days, at least some, are looking for something really original, unpredictable and emotionally engaging and with natural acting and great character build up/storytelling (fast or slow-burning) which is offered more in international films and TV series than the Hollywood productions. You can find reviews/comments to that effect as well.Anyways, I definitely recommend watching this show because it has a new approach to this type of genre. South Korean filmmaking can be very innovative and this too does not lack in some originality,"
951,The Silent Sea,"Feelings from : Alien
inspired by: Among usits a cool exciting show which captivated me. And as a fan of sci-fi movies which are not taken from tooo fare away i rly liked the show. You can adapt the story on many different ""problems"" in our world and they managed to do it pretty good. First i was a little sceptics about the casts, but the show himself is set up so good that you dont even think about it. The plot is cool and i would recommend it to everyone who likes the feeling of ""dark exciting"" movies with a logical touch and its very good followable."
952,The Silent Sea,"South Korean movies are the most innovative and original in the last few years. If you like pretty good plot without teen drama (like 95% of USA production), then this serie is for you. It's a little slow, but that is their way of doing stuff. Could be better, but it's a good serie and not too much nonsense."
953,The Silent Sea,"I did enjoy this series, it kept me intrigued from start to finish.The good: interesting plot line, beautiful visuals (I especially liked the scenes near the end - which I can't describe without spoilers), pretty good acting, and good suspense.The bad: some baffling actions by the crew, certain scenes were too slow, Dr Song's character was overly flat and morose, and it had some plot holes.Overall: this does rate a watch and most people should enjoy it. If they have a season 2 I hope the creators will be more careful about the technology aspects and increase the plausibility of character actions."
954,The Silent Sea,"This series starring a star studded job does a pretty good job for those who are not big Sci-fi geeks.The reviews are probably from users who definitely know their way in the Sci-fi , interstellar world.The series is a decent series. A generic and stretchy, slow paced but still makes you want to watch all the episodes.If you don't go about comparing it to the big Hollywood Space movies, you will kinda like it.Would want more of the backstories of each character though and also a more deeper look into the water. And the inequalities on earth.Cast acting 10/10
Direction 10/10
Storyline 7/10
CGI 7/10."
955,The Silent Sea,"I watched and liked entire series. But one thing I think is not handled correctly. Water when escapes the station to the outside, it should evaporate, not freeze, as there is no air to hold it in liquid state until its temperature is changed."
956,The Silent Sea,"Water multiplies... out of thin air! Yes, this is a thing in this series! Physically this makes no sense at all, because matter dont just materialize out of thin air, well except when it is in the context of a Fantasy Story, Lord of the Rings style of world. And this is exactly what this series is, pure fantasy. I could go on for ages describing how inaccurate this world building is, there are so many details that made me shake my head. Also a lot of the dialog is nonsense and childish, for example, a crew member decides in mid-flight to go research something banal, and the jokes in the beginning are also very bad.Maybe there are some things lost in translation, as i watched it in English, but overall this series is bad. The lack of scientific understanding of the writers is appalling. This series was a waste of time for me and i cant recommend it to anyone."
957,The Silent Sea,"I honestly can't believe some of the low ratings on here (plot holes, illogical, not realistic, other feedback). One counter argument: suspended disbelief. Just in to it. It's such an amazing ride!! Can't stop watching."
958,The Silent Sea,"It's a silly series with a silly concept.The main ""villain"" is silly and so the entire series ends up silly.It tries to be suspenseful with horror elements, and to be fair it succeeds every now and then, but not often. Time seems to move in mysterious ways and some plot elements seem to be ignored for no good reason.I had fun watching it and that's why it got a 4/10 instead of a 2/10, but I can't really recommend it."
959,The Silent Sea,"I have been a Science fiction ally since very long .The Silent Sea has a good story and quality drama . Set in the future, when the planet suffers from a lack of water and food caused by desertification. Han Yun-Jae (Gong Yoo) is a soldier for the space agency. He is selected for a team, including Song Ji-An (Bae Doo-Na), to travel to the moon. Their mission is to retrieve a mysterious sample from an abandoned research station.Notes
Drama series is based on 2014 short film ""The Sea of Tranquility"" (""Koyoui Bada""). Choi Hang-Yong directed the short film and the Netflix drama series."
960,The Silent Sea,"Here I am, watching this show and wonder, why does nobody learn basic physics in School anymore, not in the US, Europe and to my utter disbelieve not in Korea also. The makers tried to produce something good, the production value is immense, but the result is utterly crap. Non of it makes sense, not the main motivation, not the physics, not the characters.Why is this all happening?So why 3 Stars? They really tried, that must mean something, I hope."
961,The Silent Sea,"I wasn't sure what this was going to be and I wasn't grabbed immediately. I left it on because I wanted something streaming while I folded laundry. By the middle I was totally sucked in. I'm dubious on the science piece, but it asks good questions and wants us to really think about the ethical questions which is the beauty of good science fiction. If you give it a chance to settle it's an enjoyable watch. The lead is fabulous."
962,The Silent Sea,"Some of the reviews on here are way too harsh, talking about aspects of space travel and engineering that were not adhered to in this fictional series... C'mon!I throughly enjoyed this series (yes I watched all 8 episodes before writing my conclusions), I watched in original language with subtitles.The series kept me on the edge of my seat right until the credits rolled on the last episode.What I absolutely loved about this series is they way the directors let certain scenes breathe, it didn't feel like any scene was rushed just to get to the next predicament... it felt like you were living every situation with the cast, it allowed you to watch an analyse what they must be feeling in that moment... Hollywood always pushes scenes too quickly just to get to the next twist or explosion, to some it would be too slow but for me I loved the pace of it.With a team of 9 astronauts its hard to give them all an emotional arc but I felt each character got enough screen time and back story to make me care about their survival.There could definitely be a prequel series from this and even maybe a season 2.If you enjoy suspenseful sci-fi with a sprinkle of emotional drama then this is a series for you!"
963,The Silent Sea,"Having the absolute time of my life with it so far. I had some minor fear watching it last night as usually bad things happen in the dark and I was so sure something bad would happen when they arrived and started looking around in the dark areas. Unfortunately not much happened, but I still had the classic edge of the seat reaction regardless. I'm currently watching it on the small screen on the top right of my 12.9 IPad, in english cause I'm just too tired for subtitles, it's so hot here today. I'm up to the water girl part, it's still holding my attention and I'm still having fun."
964,The Silent Sea,"I'll give 5 stars for the scenery & actors. BUT, I struggled to watch this after episode 3. I would have stopped but I was already invested & wanted to see what was up with the mystery. I can't put my finger on exactly was wrong with this but something was missing & the end was underwhelming."
965,The Silent Sea,"Rubbish. Poorly written, terribly acted, dreadful casting, rubbish direction. Pretty much what I've come to expect of Netflix. Pure crap. Rubbish. Poorly written, terribly acted, dreadful casting, rubbish direction. Pretty much what I've come to expect of Netflix. Pure crap. Rubbish. Poorly written, terribly acted, dreadful casting, rubbish direction. Pretty much what I've come to expect of Netflix. Pure crap."
966,The Silent Sea,The Korean approach to what will be very familiar to fans of sci fi action is refreshing and just original enough to keep you guessing. B movie moments don't detract from the overall solid and entertaining display of Seouliwood in action.
967,The Silent Sea,"Silent sea is a pretty well made series given that South Korea doesn't have any epic SF contents that has mega fans.This series could have been easy 8-9 stars if streamed or shown in 1990s.It had cool settings of dystopian world with water shortage, which addressed something that is very critical in today's world.But the approach in delivering suspense was too old school. I wish the director remembers why ""Alien"" was such a big hit and plenty suspenseful even today, if you haven't watched it yet,
This ""Water World"" like settings of the genetically modified test subject didn't feel like it was related to solutions for the water shortage on earth. There is a disconnect in real problems than the solutions given to viewers. Also the hardship they face was too obvious.Also I personally really didn't like that the government authority was only portrayed by Director Choi.Why do you think there is a disconnect? Because there is no real science behind it. Everything is made up.I criticize that this lazy no science backing SF series doesn't offer anything cool technology other than ""Moon Water"".Still good attempts. But needs to be cleverer or even wilder imagination."
968,The Silent Sea,I love science fiction so I'm very good at suspending disbelief for the sake of a story. This series had me until literally the last 4 minutes. The end was so unbelievable and unrealistic that it actually ruined the show. It also failed to resolve the story.
969,The Silent Sea,"If you're sketical sci-fi fan. Then go and watch DC or Marvel. You'll find your kind of heroes. This series has all that you need on Friday nights in. Suspense. Drama, enough horro and not so heroic characters with multitude. CGI Is superb and acting is reasonable but ther some scenens makes you go 'hmm' but this o e is not going win any awards but definitely a enjoyable watch from beginning to end."
970,The Silent Sea,I really liked the atmosphere of this show. The episodes just flew by because of how engrossing this show is. The show holds the viewers until the very last scene.The performances are all really well done and visual effects are quite good. This series definitely sets a benchmark for all the stories that happen on desolate space stations.
971,The Silent Sea,"It all started great and was exciting but never have I ever seen so many plotholes in such a short series..The more i think about it the less i like the series, the last episode just wants to make me puke.. So many questions.."
972,The Silent Sea,Some people may be critical with the plot holes but there are way worse shows out there. Sure it is a bit slow with some Alien movie tropes but the storyline is interesting and every episode ends with a good cliffhanger resulting in you having to watch the next episode. Korean and Asian shows/movies are always a bit more interesting than typical North American tv. This series is definitely worth watching and I would say a second season would be nice to see where the story goes but I doubt that is in the cards.
973,The Silent Sea,"If you like suspense and thriller movies, and then you also like space related stories, then this one is definitely for you. It keeps you engaged from the start to end. Story is good and plot is convincible even though happens in the future.Acting and cinematography is great. Some side actors have done overacting but you can ignore those as they don't necessarily drive the plot. Overall, a good weekend binge watch."
974,The Silent Sea,"It is unwatchable by anyone with the minimum grasp of logic, let alone science. It would be a great day when science fiction shows of this type all stop being made.I could not make it through the single episode.I could kind of overlook the key premise of the world in decline - global drought. Perhaps there would be an explanation some time later in the series as to where the water went and how. On the surface, it is impossible to have a global anything in a closed system without external influence or permanent loss. Water is an element. It does not arrive (unlike energy) and losing water into space is impossible while the planet is intact.The thing that broke me was the space shuttle with an infinite air supply. I just could not keep going as by that point I was certain that there would be more of the same and I cannot stand it.Nobody should watch this."
975,The Silent Sea,"The series has good potential, but everything is killed by the meager description of the universe and the lack of logic in the actions of the characters. We are shown a world on the verge of extinction, but they do not bother to explain what its inhabitants eat. For the entire season, only a few sweets and lines for water were shown. Everything. As if everyone had stopped washing, eating, going to the toilet and producing anything at once. This is the biggest hole in the plot and ruins the whole story."
976,The Silent Sea,This was just horrid. Go in with low expectations and they will be met. There's just way too many holes in TSS.What's one of the first things they did when they entered the station? THEY TURNED ON EARTH GRAVITY! OMG WHY?So many characters without distinguishing personalities.A lunar spaceship with... wings?Astronauts with no training?Last minute substitutions?A crash due to a... bad bolt?A catastrophic loss of pressure in a school bus sized volume that vents for over a minute?The captain struggles to hold a 100 lb person from falling in 1/8 gravity? Everyone's almost out of oxygen but we should all stand around and emote while someone dies?Just terrible.Adequate for background noise while you're cooking dinner.
977,The Silent Sea,A first episode should hook in a new viewer but this Is just so dull ..... the camera work and direction is about soap opera standard ..... the performances are flat and lifeless ..... confusing flashbacks and flash forwards do nothing to clarify the plot .....after Squid Game and Hellbound we are perhaps expecting all Korean dramas to be of a similar high standard .....and the 9/10 and 10/10 reviewer scores on here are suspicious in the extreme.
978,The Silent Sea,It's not watchable. The movie is boring and poorly made. Just waste of time. So bad. It's not worth it. Every moment of this movie is stupid and not realistic.
979,The Silent Sea,"After previously establishing that the water does not multiply on the blood of dead organisms, we have the water endless multiplying on the blood of the dead generic nameless soldier number-whatever because plot."
980,The Silent Sea,"Do not waste your precious time on this snooze fest . There's nothing to like about this series . One of those cheap , low Budget Netflix series. My rating 1 / 10."
981,The Silent Sea,"What on earth (well the moon) is a Silent Sea have to do with Space?The headline got me intrigued!In a nutshell:
Upon learning that the earth was losing all water, mankind had to return to the moon whereby man had previously tried to create water to bring back to the earth.Instead, they found a young girl who had been cloned over and over again for mankind's research to see if the water they were recreating would work on humans.In short, the water turned the girl into a fish looking thing with gill's. However, when the water they created touched any normal human, it would drown them internally.Fast forward, the girl bit one of the astronauts hands who came back to retrieve the water, and through this, it showed humans that her DNA was the saviour to their failure (of the intake of the created water drowning the humans).Hope you're with me. So literally if you get some of the fish gill looking girls' DNA, you can then consume the man made created water, and will not drown internally and die from it. Inevitably, saving the earth from mankind dying of not having water. :DWell, that's how I perceived it!I found the music to be very good! Calming and serene. It matched the epic scenes and moments throughout the series. Even though this was dubbed in English, I still was able to follow on with ease.I actually thought it was a great series and I've come to enjoy watching these actors! From other Netflix series that have been aired."
982,The Silent Sea,"A unique take on the Alien movie, but maybe not different enough to make this great. Certainly better than a lot of titles on Netflix recently. Worth giving a go if you crave watching sci-fi."
983,The Silent Sea,"Wow, if I were on a mission that involved a high level of danger, I would not expect fellow members of my crew to react to questions with hesitation or no response at all. Prompt and unambiguous communication is vital to the success of the mission and the well-being of the crew.There should have been at least 5 times as much dialog taking place. Multiple simple status checks and prompt responses were entirely lacking, making this look like a slo-mo parody of actual space missions.Houston, we have a...."
984,The Silent Sea,I really enjoyed this series. Clever use of silence in the right places to create a lot of suspense. Some great ideas and concepts. Nods to other sci fi classics. Some of the reviews on here are awful and the series deserves a lot more credit.
985,The Silent Sea,"I am annoyed on how characters were developed or presented:
1. The captain did not know the history of his own crew
2. The crew are all stupid and not trained well on responding on threats or situations (and based on the story, these stupid crew wilk save the earth?)
3. The enemy was presented very late in the story
4. The first encounter on the kid, they did not assess that were on the disadvantage in terms of visibility and terrrain and how the enemy moves so fast (really, this is how stupid the crew that will save humanity?)"
986,The Silent Sea,"Man the Koreans are recently doing hits after hit. The story is super dramatic.. that feels so real.A must watch séries, I highly recommend. If only I understand Korean."
987,The Silent Sea,"Gravity anyone? If they could just produce ""artificial gravity"" on a stationary base on moon, the whole starting and landing of spacecrafts would we one hell of a different story. It just doesn't make sence that they are technologicial pretty much in the 21st century, but can influence gravity like that, which would be a technoligical gamechanger in so many ways. This mixture of seriosity and wanting to look like hard sci-fi and then treating basic laws of nature if they wouldn't exist without any explanation is just the worst in my opinion. Just couldn't bare to watch it anymore.If moons gravity is too hard to simulate for you, don't make a show that takes place on the moon."
988,The Silent Sea,Very nice execution of story. But some place they missing to explain. Overall good to watch.i do like to watch this type of web series. Waiting for season 2 on earth.
989,The Silent Sea,Bae Doona is great once again. My only complaint is that the show moves a little bit slow. Great elements of Korean horror and casual sci-fi. If you're looking for detailed sci-fi - this isn't the show for you. I thought it was fun but can definitely understand the poor reviews.
990,The Silent Sea,Not a fan of this genre but after squid game i'm trying to watch other korean works on netflix and give it a try w/o much expectation.Glad i started it cause the plot is very simple but very well done hope for a season 2 Loved the main actors.
991,The Silent Sea,"The premise, the special effects (no sounds in space!!!) and the production values prove that the Korean's have a handle on creating compelling content. But as the Squid Game showed us, the inept translations spoil it all. Indicating that the characters are speaking in some sort of contrived linguistic state pulls you out of the story and into a head scratching what the F... moment.It almost appears that Netflix is using automated translation - like the annoying 'agent' who asks how to redirect your call to whatever company is trying to hide behind their voice mail wall. In this case, the lack of context, profoundly incorrect use of phraseology and other bad translations errors make this ridiculous (At one point in my career I did work as a translator and context is important).That being said, I knocked down the rating due to the language issue. Perhaps if I spoke Korean I could provide a better review. A number of nuances are completely missed due to the fundamental problems with the captioned dialogue. Too bad...."
992,The Silent Sea,"This movie series is very amazing and fantastic
Slowly slowly grow up to entertainment was amazing performance all the character and not be drop any moment of this series from see this series all body is thrilled what a fantastic drama for the series every body go to Netflix and see this series...."
993,The Silent Sea,"The release date for South Korea's Silent Sea is confusing since whoever thought December 24th was a great time to let this out in the public must be fired. This one is an intriguing show with an underlying mystery. There are consequences as the story unfolds with each episode. It may be slow for some, but it leaves enough room for action. Gong Yoo, Bae Donna, Lee Joon, and others are the heavy lifters and provide great depth. I'm hoping for a second season because there's still room to unpack more details and add extra flavor. I enjoyed greatly!"
994,The Silent Sea,Had again high expectations for this after seeing the teasers but oh man what a letdown.Couldn't get myself over the horrendous CGI (and that silly moonwalk that looks like children imitating the moon gravity). 3 episodes in and I'm out. Just can't bear handling the mess it's proving to be.2 stars for the first 2 minutes.
995,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea is a Korean Sci Fi mini-series that is eight episodes long. On NetFlix the series is available in English, and the episodes range from 39-51 minutes long.The story is about a future Earth where water is rationed, so that it is worthwhile to attempt to mine our moon for water to return to Earth. But it gets complicated. Very complicated.The first episode starts the story, but is a little slow. Episode two builds a little more, but the story really takes off in episode three and continues on until the emotional ending. But you do need to pay attention to understand some of the important nuances and call backs in the story.If you enjoy Sci-Fi, it's definitely worth watching. I think it's the most original story I've seen in a long time, and I regret none of the time I spent watching it. I really enjoyed it. Hopefully you will too."
996,The Silent Sea,"They are on Moon. Gravity on Moon is NOT the same gravity on Earth. BUT when they enter the research station, they have Earth gravity. It's always the same goof in sci-fi movies. There is not a machine to get gravity. The only way to get it in space is in a rotating space ship. It also happens in movies about Mars. When I see a space movie, I ask for a bit of accuracy. In other way, this kind of goofs takes me out the story soon! Too bad."
997,The Silent Sea,I don't know why I even watched the whole thing at all. Probably because the trailer looked promising. There is practically no suspense at all. And I generally like science fiction. Not all Korean series are good like Squid Game.
998,The Silent Sea,"It's soooooooooooooo slooooooooooooow and dumb, soooooooooooooo dumb...
For instance: « let's go to the moon. Why? No one knows. »A GREAT way to waste your time and ask yourself regularly « Why? But WHYYYYYYYYY? ».The good part: good actors and decent CGI.The bad: everything else including dialogues, script, directing, inaccuracies, etc."
999,The Silent Sea,"I binge watched The Silent Sea over two nights, (something I rarely do), and thoroughly enjoyed it. The premise was intriguing and the mysteries of Balhae Station were slowly revealed over the course of the series, which meant the viewer was kept guessing as to what was going on.I'm a sucker for Korean films and TV, and The Silent Sea was as good as anything I've watched previously. I was delighted to see the brilliant. Gong Yoo and Bae Doo-na in the lead roles. They are both immensely watchable in this, as you would expect.If you're a sci-fi fan I'd definitely recommend this series, but be aware that the pacing is slower than most western produced fare. That being said, it's worth sticking with it, as it gets into its stride from episode 3 onwards.One final comment I'd make is that, as is usually the case, it's far a better experience to watch in the original Korean with English subtitling. The American accents in any dubbed production are incredibly jarring, and for me, they wrench me out of the action. It's much more enjoyable to hear the actual voices of the actors delivering their lines than the dubbed voices of their English speaking counterparts. Regardless of how accomplished the voice actors are, they can't portray the same emotion as the actors who they are overdubbing."
1000,The Silent Sea,"Engaging Korean series set on the moon.Earth is running out of water, but what did the researchers on the moon's space station discover before they all died?Wonderful acting and it held my attention all the way through.The downsides are the slow pace and the lapses in logic. Strangely, for such a slow pace, there is perhaps too much story crammed in. Might have been better to pare that back - a lot of the stuff that goes maybe a few steps too far revolves around a new character who is introduced.A satisfying ending. What more can I ask for?"
1001,The Silent Sea,"The script isn't fantastic but I suspect it has more nuance in native Korean. Some decent lighting, sets and a very interesting central idea. The fate of the Earth feels all too real. Yoo, Doona, Moo-Saeng and Young give good performances that deliver some characters you care about but all the others are 2D and behave just bizarrely too often for you to care. Engaging for the first couple of episodes, just way too long for the content that's there. And serious work needed on the 1/6 gravity effects. I can see why the station needed magic simulated earth gravity."
1002,The Silent Sea,Don't bother watching this.They come across dead people and immediately decide to remove their helmets. No education is required to know what happens next...
1003,The Silent Sea,"It's good to have series talk about uncomfortable experiment ethical issues. However, the silent sea didn't mention a lot. And the characters didn't show complex emotions. It would be better."
1004,The Silent Sea,"The earth is out of water. There is mysterious water on the moon. Elite scientists travel to the moon to research this mysterious water. Only the water is evil and makes people vomit water until they die. Most episodes consist of people vomiting water.Apparently, some humans can adapt to the evil water which makes them able to walk on the moon without a space suit. After most of unlucky ones have vomited themselves to death, a select few survive and leave the moon."
1005,The Silent Sea,"Never mind some plot holes here and there. This doesn't move fast, but takes it's time telling the story. It's quite sinister and the characters could do with a few more laughs along the way, but overall I think this was really well done. Great acting, beautiful moon set, interesting story that raises relevant questions, and never makes it a matter of simple good/evil people or actions. It takes some patience, but I think it pays off."
1006,The Silent Sea,"Maybe it wanted to become the 2nd Squid game. But it can't.First of all, the acting is horrible!! They literally talk as if they are reading out from a book. Their expression is dull and it is impossible to make any attachment to ANY characters. It's the same cliche. When something happens they ""Open their eyes big"" and ""Talk loud"". Characters have no emotion. Acting is just purely HORRIBLEThey drag storyline way too much. I can't even say how disappointed I was. Not even reviewing beyond this point anymore."
1007,The Silent Sea,The 5 stars goes to mainly cinematography and CGI. The FIRST 10 minutes already made me scratching my head: water will disapear from the face of the earth? That's against all physical and geographical comment sense.Otherwise it's still very comment Korean drama acting.
1008,The Silent Sea,"It is not a movie. It is more like theatre in a videotape... too many needless dialogues, misses science and logic.What did they eat on the moon station?Where did the scientists get the clones from?"
1009,The Silent Sea,"Maybe it is worth watching Sunday morning trying to survive hangover where logic is nonexistent.The crew is a band of morons if their interactions is any indication, and they also act like scared kids when haft the crew should be highly trained veterans.Emergency in a spacecraft oddly doesn't prompt the ""astronauts"" to immediately put on their helmets... crashlanding on the moon with no helmet on, eh okay.Apparently, the shuttle has gravity when the Dr. Released her seatbelt after the crash falling like she would on earth but suddenly outside they seem to be light.The station has an air purification function but is only activated after they have taken their helmets off... because suspense, I guess.Oh yeah, the gravity is like earth on the station... and we are not talking artificial gravity just fantasy gravity that works when they are inside a vehicle or structure.Space is merely a setting they don't act like anything like it. The hangover didn't last long enough to make this interesting past episode 2."
1010,The Silent Sea,"I'd say it has the same problem as most of the zombie movies: you'd think anyone with half a brain would know to stay in spacesuits if there is any chance of infection from ANYTHING, but they can't keep actors's pretty faces and bodies covered, so everyone is risking their lives while knowing full well that any drop of water can be fatal. More than anything, that diminishes the series just too much, just as it does all the Zombie movie/series."
1011,The Silent Sea,"Otherwise I guess it is ok, not super good and not super bad.If you are between shows looking for something to watch this might be a decent choice.The actors are ok and the story is decent."
1012,The Silent Sea,"I have no idea what others problem is with this series... They must be used to cringey Hollywood films or just find anything set in space ""unbelievable"" or ""stupid"" but other than a tiny plot hole in the end with the English spy element, everything is GREAT about this miniseries. From the Emmy-worthy music, through the great performances to the often scary and mysterious yet wholesome adventurous tone with the really impressive CGI and practical effects everything is so well done, I absolutely loved. And I don't just simply watch anything... But hey, problem could be me. Or it's just that people are starting to realize that South Korea does things better than Hollywood these days and that must hurt some.Give it a try. Please. It's amazing.Spoiler: the ending might make you cry. ;)"
1013,The Silent Sea,"Enjoyed my time watching tbh
I liked the story ( for sure there is a 2nd season ) , I like the actors and they show succeeded in keeping me interested until the last minutesAnother good Korean show."
1014,The Silent Sea,So many unanswered questions at the end. For a series that has 8 episodes everything should've been thoroughly explained and concluded. The story drags. Too bad the cast was stellar but the storyline was just holey.
1015,The Silent Sea,This netflix series is aswome its VFX ( visual effects) and actors acting is also good and its concept of moons station and the importance of water for human life.
1016,The Silent Sea,"Let's put aside the 2D, cookie cutter characters ordered in from Mediocre Science Fiction Warehouse for a second. Beyond that, the central premise of the show itself is incredibly stupid. If you can get past that, kudos to you, but The Silent Sea is nothing if not another attempt at plastering lousy science-fiction, lousy charters and bad science with a pretension of moral superiority and, as is the case with many like it, its failure is a catastrophic car crash, but not one worthy of even rubbernecking let alone sitting down for an 8 episode long watch."
1017,The Silent Sea,"Think Event Horizon meets Lost meets Mission Impossible meets the Departed, and add a little bit of cheesiness.An interesting show, it's sort of cross-genre, with elements of sci-fi, horror, spy thriller, cataclysm thriller, and dystopian post-modern.I like the overall plot, though there are gimmicky moments that disrupt the film's momentum. I think they should've made the characters more competent, some of them scare too easily for military trained astronauts, etc. I also wish they would have had a more dark synthpop vibe in the soundtrack like at the beginning.7.5/10, rounding up to 8 since I haven't seen a good sci fi series in awhile, and I enjoy cross-genre efforts more than most, and can forgive the cheesiness when chances are taken."
1018,The Silent Sea,"The show starts off well with a mystery within for you to solve. However, you stop getting this feeling few episodes in and you understand it's a predictable, boring, generic show.It's good as a ""moment"" entertainment if you're really bored. It's full of cliches - ""vehicle on the edge of a cliff"". It's hard to find something new as the plot unfolds, leaving you no room for guessing.It's a solid 5 with a predictable and generic plot."
1019,The Silent Sea,"The series scores good marks on visuals, direction &.... creepy vibes. Unfortunately lazy writing is the villain of the series, sneaking in and making sudden appearances in areas where it has no business to be. Much like Lunar Water, some plot elements proved very difficult to swallow like the co-pilot change at the last minute, the only survivor who could give details on the mission kicking the bucket with 2 words of advice, the captains obstinate refusal to attempt to analyze what killed all scientists (or if he knew, his refusal to communicate it), looking for viruses with a microscope. It's also held back by its religious obedience to horror thriller tropes like fearless fools wandering into dark confined places with utter disregard for safety, comms always dying first, the proverbial evil elevator and more. Not to mention the complete lack of safety protocols observed by an astrobiologist coming into contact with a virus that spreads by contact. It still gets a 7 because of the backstory - a disturbingly chilling thought exercise on the effects of climate change on water and society's reaction to it. Now that was truly chilling."
1020,The Silent Sea,"The plot isn't bad, the acting isn't bad but there is jjst so much emptiness. Nothing happens for minutes, characters are just staring at each other and pauses between sentences are unreasonably long. It really feels like they just wanted to stretch this out into 8 episodes without adding any additional plot lines or scenes. Such a shame."
1021,The Silent Sea,"I can say that this show is the worst I ever watched in terms of realism. The moon have 1/6 of earths gravity but yet them can barely walk. The cliff hanging scene in the moon is a blasphemy. Seriously, this is worst than Armageddon."
1022,The Silent Sea,"I was amazed by the setup and the beauty of the sets,
Harmony in the environment of the studios with very high technical details.Slow moving at the beginning but beautiful on the inception and delivery.The South Koreans made one more milestone at the film industry.For me it was unexpected. Not any more."
1023,The Silent Sea,"The interesting premise of this space drama isn't really much more far-fetched than a lot of other sci-fi shows, even if the execution is somewhat uneven. The excellent acting and beautiful cinematography really bring to life what might otherwise be a fairly weak and cliched plot that requires more than a little suspension of disbelief. If you're looking for great scriptwriting then this is not the show for you, but if you're up for a visually stunning space thriller that doesn't require you to think too much, you'll probably enjoy this as much as I did."
1024,The Silent Sea,"Not quite action packed all the time, at times it did feel a little slow. Good special effects, bad dubbing, words spoken when no faces moving occasionally.Interesting idea that kept developing.After this and Squid Game I'm quite impressed with Kdrama.Sci-Fi interesting, slow burner. Bit predictable occasionally."
1025,The Silent Sea,"Astounding. A really well acted sci-fi drama with all the elements you want - Dystopian future, save the world mission, a secret on the moon. All the characters were nuanced and no cardborad cut-outs here. The pace was excellent and it became totally immersive. Really enjoyed it. Stellar cast who were very, very good as an ensemble."
1026,The Silent Sea,"If you are looking for something thrilling it's gonna disappoint you..
The story lacks a proper plot and is dull plus it's not gonna raise your Curiosity plus the water scarcity plot I found it to be absurd and illogical..
The writers should have put some more thought towards this plot
Some of the characters are from previous korean series."
1027,The Silent Sea,"There is one super fast little girl in the lab, she moved through air vent. They decided to catch her. They decided to shut down doors to trap her, completely ignoring the air vent. Magically, that girl forgot about the air vent and tried to run through a shutting door. After many struggles, she then remembered the air vent and ran back into the air vent and ran away from people. This is ridiculous not logical for me. I can't watch story with bad logic. The guy even forgot to shoot the Anesthetic when the girl was stuck in the door for a few minutes, I have no idea why he was so slow to respond (to drag this episode for 42 mins long enough, this was called episode cheating, I story with 5 episodes yet coming out as 10 etc...) . This shows me that the script writer is not very talented, I won't watch the 2nd season."
1028,The Silent Sea,The moon's gravity is approximately 1/6 of Earth. So a 200# (with suit/gear) man weighs about 33# on the moon. Yet the small woman is struggling & unable to pull herself up after crashing while the injured man is walking when he could be easily carried. Additionally covering the less than 5 miles to base would take mere minutes since it's possible to take 20-30 foot strides on the moon surface.
1029,The Silent Sea,"As a science-fiction fan it saddens me greatly that the genre is so full of clichees and bad script. Important mission? Let's pick a team of unstable morons with zero communication skills. Let's also, as a creator of science-fiction, not do any research on real science or physics. Unwatchable."
1030,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea might not be the most revolutionary space film of the decade but it certainly isn't the dragging, cliché filled series so many viewers seemed to think it was. While it does use familiar elements to more easily immerse you in the world of the show it doesn't do so in a ham-fisted way. It feels very grounded and atmospheric (pun only sort of intended considering the setting) and allows the viewer to instead assimilate the new information needed to follow this particular story.My only real complaint is with the music. Music builds tension and sets tone for scenes. Often the music didn't match the action or pacing and left me wanting something more.!! Spoilers below!!The double cross of the co-pilot may not have been too much of a surprise but the build up to Ryu's ulterior motives was well done and, while not surprising, did leave me feeling betrayed.Each new reveal felt natural and perhaps that's why people complained. It wasn't paced like a shocking thriller in the way many of our mystery shows and movies are now (at least in the west). Instead it was paced in a way that allowed a more natural discovery of information. The audience was there with the crew the whole time and perhaps the suspense came more from always expecting something bigger than what we got.Though the relief of smaller surprises and the satisfaction of being just a step ahead is short-lived.It's undercut at every turn but shocking deaths and the aforementioned betrayals. Leading the audience to a finale where anything can happen and the stakes are astronomically high.The ambiguity of the ending is risky when a lot of viewers will want a satisfying end or a promise for more but the ambiguity is in keeping with the overall tone and really fits the series.It may not be the next best show on Netflix but it certainly is worth a watch."
1031,The Silent Sea,"Wow...So disappointing/
Solid FX but SHABBY science!What's with the ""slow motion"" running instead
of bouncing along like WE KNOW you can do
on the moon? (Hello - Apollo?)
And how is it so hard to lift people or objects
in ONE SIXTH gravity? Then there's the stupid choices of action by the characters. Let's fire up the AIR CIRCULATION in a station we have not even begun to explore. I am too spoiled by the top shelf adherence to hard science exhibited in other great SciFi shows. If they went for satire and laughs like ""Avenue Five"" would get way more of a pass. Even ""Wandering Earth"" rolls its eyes in disgust."
1032,The Silent Sea,"Oh, boy... Where to begin? First, I expect to suspend disbelief with shows like this. Try to make it a teensy bit plausible and I'm good. But rumbling, crunching sounds on the airless moon? And dust swirling in the ""wind""? No, please. Second, the storyline has holes you could drive a truck through. ""We have a top secret mission that requires an astrobiologist to retrieve lost samples...but we, uh, don't know what the samples are. You just need to go get them.""I'll give anything a try, but this show lost me after 35 minutes."
1033,The Silent Sea,"Quite better than Hollywood. Although a couple of astronauts make a coupke of mistakes that
are difficult to justify, they do not reach the stupidity of western series, where scientists seem mindless or anabolic pranksters without any cultural level. In this Korean series the scientists are professionals and they behave as such and in a rational way. They're not complaining all the time, fighting each other, or acting like they're contesting on Big Brother. This series shows us why Asia will be the dominant power soon, while the West will decline. Young Asians dream of being scientists and engineers, young Westerners dream of being athletes, singers and contestants on some stupid reality show."
1034,The Silent Sea,"Story is good but everything else seems to be mediocre.Decision making of the characters are too lousy - unrealistic.The pacing of the movie is too slow, it has 8 episodes but it can be shorten to a movie.Everything seems too be slow motioned."
1035,The Silent Sea,"The story is intriguing. Making audiences wanting to know more with each episodes. However, it is marred by illogical happenings / scenarios as the story goes along.It is as if the story writers have either gone blank in their thoughts at the middle of the story, or the producer decided to cut the budget prematurely mid-way thru filming.The movie left me dumbfounded at the end and without a closure to it."
1036,The Silent Sea,"I watched this hoping to love it. I liked the cast and I love scifi so what could go wrong? The story only warmed up at around episode 3 or 4 and after that I had to see it to the end to not feel cheated. The most annoying part was that the actors had one stoic expression and talked like marionettes. The villain guy from Squid game was in this and even he had zero personality
I couldn't care less about any of the characters and was just plain bored and fell asleep often."
1037,The Silent Sea,"My opinions in no particular order.It is quite slow in places, and tries to make too much of family relationships with flashbacks etc. Luckily you can always skip forward.The pivotal theme of the background story is that a future earth has dried up: no oceans, no lakes, no rivers. How is that even possible when earth is covered 70% by water?! Did the sun go crazy? Perhaps, but then humanity would have all been fried to extinction well before the oceans ran dry. It would have been more believable to mention huge radioactive ocean contamination, maybe...The special ops team is not ""special"" and not a ""team"" at all, they look and behave more like a bunch of friends on a picnic. So similar to Alien but so far!The illogical actions, just so many of them. The team's captain, low IQ and incompetent. Fails to secure, ensure, communicate, protect, act decisevely, regroup, he fails in almost everything.No dialogue, no communication amongst the members of the team, to relay and inform of the discoveries! Had I discovered a body in the fridge and the samples missing, I'd be screaming down the mic within seconds.Then we have a seasoned doctor who (like most doctors) is quite at ease performing autopsies and cutting bodies open, and in the next scene suffering a total break down when they discover a body!On the moon's surface, team precariously low on oxygen, running to make it to the station in time, yet the 5ft doctor has to help carry the injured team member? And afterwards the whole team sitting around while he is eventually dying on a rock, with no knowledge whether they can even make it to the station? Without sending some of the men at least forward to prepare and unlock the doors?And again, the whole team are running to escape from the deluge, and the commando at the rear letting a 5ft female doctor hop along carrying a very large samples case, instead of taking it himself! On one hand running to escape danger, but obviously not in a hurry?!In many cases the team's actions so slow, so hesitant, with no sense of urgency, even when they are running away from danger. They stop to talk, to look at each other meaningfully, spending ages on inaction...In the end scenes, a seasoned commando, faced with a crazy sociopath/murderer/traitor, and with a tidal wave right on them, takes his sweet time and small talk before finally deciding to shoot him, and when he eventually does, in such a clumsy manner, that ends up getting shot himself!Communications down and the whole team cannot reach earth base using the station's ultra powerful transmitters, yet the traitors in the team carry pocket radios which do the job just fine?! Why can't the captain also carry one of those little pocket radios then?How could this mission ever leave earth with no clear instructions, and having to depend solely on random chance to discover a hidden and undocumented 50% of the lunar station. They do not know what they are looking for and what they are meant to retrieve. It is utterly illogical. No, it is trash.How can green plants grow in complete darkness?The lunar water carries a novel virus which is undetectable and allows the water to replicate when in close proximity to ""living cells"". Define ""living cells""? And where does the extra matter come from? Why did the substation fill up with water, what ""living organism"" triggered it? And again where did the extra matter come from to fill up the whole lunar station?"
1038,The Silent Sea,"Top to bottom, I liked this series. A nicely paced story with enough twists to keep you guessing.This series has a message, considering climate change. It's worth paying attention to it, because we cannot rely on space to save us from our mistakes.All in all, the performances were fine, the story moved along and the result was satisfying.I loved it. 10 out of 10, in my books."
1039,The Silent Sea,"So much totally unbelievable rubbish in this series. Space shuttle at interplanetary speeds crash lands on the moon in one piece, just for a starter. But the worst part is that the Korean dialogue was just badly translated into dubbed English, so that it sounds forced and unnatural."
1040,The Silent Sea,"I am someone who has been heard to say ""even bad SciFi is better than no SciFi.""
This is the exception.Science is ignored. Characters, who are supposed to be professional are annoyingly stupid.This cannot even be filed under the label of ""it's so bad it's good"" because it takes itself too seriously.Come on, Korea/Netflix, you can do better."
1041,The Silent Sea,"Why would a lunar lander have glide surfaces? Why would bodies (human, spacecraft) fall so rapidly on the moon, which has so little gravity? Maybe things will get more accurate WRT physics as things progress, maybe not."
1042,The Silent Sea,"I can't stand watching the science in this series. It's not logic, being that they are on the moon and the gravity is non existence? Can you imagine the shuttle is falling down at high velocity? The main character went out of the station and fell off. Also, can you imagine them bouncing around pretending there's gravity? My basic physics can't even comprehend why that happens! Also, how did they even manage to grow plants when there's no light source? Basic photosynthesis, guys!"
1043,The Silent Sea,I like the story and the visuals. Like others have said the science is not goid so far. Only one episode in but they don't really understand the gravity part of walking on the moon. Astronauts that went there found it easier to bunny hop then to walk. Also if someone that weighed 200 lbs normally would weigh in at 33 lbs so when hurt four people could carry him with out to much trouble. Will watch more and see if they fix the science.
1044,The Silent Sea,"I love SF and I am willing to accept some ""magic"" when it come to still unknown science or technology as well as the challenges to create of planet situations - at least if the story and the acting is fine and that they at least understand current science. The Expanse is an example of a good story, good actors (at least most) and almost perfect when it comes to near future science.This show is at the other end of the scale. The effects are not too bad, but the show is way too long for the story, most actors are really bad and their characters act way too stupid for astronauts and scientist. But the worst is the totally unbelievable background:
old setting were earth lost the water - strange as the temperature and the atmosphere are still fine, but ok,they fly to the moon, where there is water ... right.there is a huge station, but they grow no foodeven though the moon has 1/6 of the gravity everyone really struggles with climbing ladders, running, carrying ....the find a strange looking corps and other signs of potential infections, but when searching the station none wears protectionwhat really fried my brain is, that come up with a self-multiplying molecules which come from nowhere. First I though, that the bodies are dissolved and they just had not enough money for the effect showing dehydrating bodies, but no the molecules really come from nothing.But still, if the characters and the story would have been better, this still could have been an ok popcorn show. But as it is, it is just a waste of time."
1045,The Silent Sea,"A story with a great potential for a great science-fiction. Alas, the execution of the idea fell to ground totally. The script, the directing and most of all, acting are simply pathetic. A total waste of watching time."
1046,The Silent Sea,There was at most 4 episodes of content. 8 episodes made it painful to watch. There was very little resolution to most of the story lines. Maybe they are planning a season 2. I hope not.
1047,The Silent Sea,"With the cast of Gong Yoo and Bae Doona I would expect something much better than this. The production quality was great but it was hampered from poor writings, scripts and dialogues.The actors and actresses act like either they are on a school picnic trip or immature adults standing there not knowing what to do. Can't believe these are the so called professionals or experts sent to the moon to run a job....Really can't stand how some of the actors react to certain situations and didn't react according to common sense just to progress the plots...Big disappointment. Should go for The Expanse instead. Much better."
1048,The Silent Sea,"Script, acting, CGI so bad I could do it better myself. Didn't even make it through the first episode quite disappointed. When are producers going to learn bad cgi is one of the fastest ways to lose your audience. Netflix is a billion dollar company spend some money on your shows."
1049,The Silent Sea,"At episode 5; am getting a deep hum of revealing deep level quality; timing, coming together of story lines, realisation this is not just sci-fi but a reality of our life in the making, excellent, sparse dialogue and people relating to each others profesional roles, behaviour choices underpinned by their individual humanity. I do not care about the vagueness and improbable as of yet of scientific sketches; its not about exact science innovation ( things will be possible sooner than later) Excited about watching it all, am taking my time tho, to savour the trip 🤓👍😎"
1050,The Silent Sea,After lost in space it's my second favourite space web series . Love the acting and plot of this web series . The silent sea has emotional ending in season 1 . Hope season 2 arrive early can't wait for it .
1051,The Silent Sea,"The show is really slow. Lots of stare and slow motion. We can guess what's gonna happen since first episode. Lots of things doesn't make sense at all. After watching 4 episodes, I really want to ask: Are they trying to sell the water bottles?"
1052,The Silent Sea,"This could have been a really good show, but if you care about logic, this is not for you. There are so many thing that just dont make sense.I really like the idea and find it sad that its executed so bad."
1053,The Silent Sea,It looks like nobody in the series doing something reasonable. Much more annoying is how the stories are told. The same point is repeatedly presented with different scenes and they take so long time. The maker tries to make thriller out of the dark silent long shot. It does not work well. It is just boring and annoying because everything is so predictable and not plausible at all.
1054,The Silent Sea,"I don't understand why they didn't do a little bit of scientific research. We have had the martian and Apollo 13 - we know what spaceflight should look like even when it's fantasy. The sfx are actualy really good for a TV series. However so many dumb things and I'm only 35 minutes in. It's such a shame as the visuals are ok! Nice opening sequence.The rocket takes off and ALL of it flies to the moon??? Whaaat????What joke of an agency are they portraying that has a load of crew mistrusting and criticising each other with no teamwork shown.(Love the ship and the way it attaches to the rocket at the start by the way!)What strain on the rocket makes the bolts rattle? The ship is under very little stress at this point.What's causing all the g forces on approaching the moon - they would be in orbit and then free fall.In free fall they would have been going incredibly fast on hitting the surface but they just skid across the surface using attitude thrusters to ""steer"" the ship. Why are they pulling on the yoke as if it's an airliner - lol.When the screen breaks the air would have evacuated in a very short time - this isn't the huge ship from ""the martian"" - yet it keeps going for many seconds.They strain to lift people but we know it's 1/6g.No sun shields on their visors.Oh. And artificial gravity - doh. There's no need - we could suspend disbelief at that one without it as we know it's 1/6 g.Not sure about the writing yet - there have been some criticisms - I'll give a couple of episodes a go and see......."
1055,The Silent Sea,"The series is stellar, pun intended. If you want realism, go to the moon and figure out for yourself how to contain a virus that also has the ability to save the planet. If you want fast paced, watch some adrenaline induced car theft movie. The problem we Americans, and other countries surely, have, is that we don't know how to wait for anything, we don't know how to stop tearing things apart as soon as we see it, and we don't know how to enjoy anything that doesn't start and end with gunfire and explosions. The Silent Sea is visually stunning, thought provoking, and intense. At the rate we are destroying our planet, we well could find ourselves facing water and food depletion... that's something to consider when watching... there's reality for you."
1056,The Silent Sea,I'm falling in love with Korean series. This is perfectly directed and has thrills in every episode. Giving 8 out of 10 because I still believe that some Korean masterpieces are still to come.
1057,The Silent Sea,"I understand differing tastes and opinions, but for
those who rated this series less than 5 stars - did you actually watch it?! The concept is a good (and frightening) one. The acting is fantastic. If you're like me and learned from Squid Game, you watched this in the original Korean with English subtitles. It improved the quality of the series. The problem with the series was with the execution of the concept. It started with an exciting pace and then lagged greatly in other episodes. It would also have been nice to see more background into some of the key characters. Not a perfect series, but definitely entertaining and far better than some of the other sci-fi shows out there."
1058,The Silent Sea,"Designed by idiots, about idiots, for idiots.Cliched, illogical, frankly stupid.A worthy successor to Prometheus from Ridley Scott.Single star for video filming."
1059,The Silent Sea,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality acting and scenes.Yes, it does 'borrow' a little from Alien in respect of Newt/Luna but I personally thought that it had it's own little twists and turns.And the 💧 💧 💧 was a completely original and clever idea.I found the first few episodes kept giving and left you trying to try work out what was going on and admittedly I got it wrong. (I thought the sister was the creature and I thought that they had found a way to turn blood into water)
There were a few bizarre moments like WHY did the Captain do what he did at the end ?However, I found the series to be captivating and never allowed myself to become critical of said moments and this allowed me to enjoy the whole series reeled of at once.With the ending I think that it would be difficult for a second season.Hope I'm wrong."
1060,The Silent Sea,"This would have been ok if the writers had ?? Googled some basic moon related space science, and maybe watched a you tube or two and then cut it into a two part movie or even just 1 movie on the longer side. Way over drawn, with a lot of boring stagnate periods that don't do anything to move the plot along. Scientists who act like they don't understand what seems like basic Science. Quite a few things that don't make sense. I'm mean you're going to REALLY have to ignore some things to make this work ( more than usual Sci fis). Was really hard to get through it and I'm a big fan of sci-fi /horror/thrillers. ONLY upside is you get to look at Gong Yoo for awhile. Great if you want to watch something to help you nap where sleeping an hour or two won't really effect your understanding of the plot. Korean horror/thrillers are so hit or miss. They've nailed zombies I just wish they could get other genres together and I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Honestly if you have anything else to watch I would recommend doing that instead. 8 hours of my life I won't get back."
1061,The Silent Sea,"Korea! Did it again!Asia number 1 best contents contry!This show really recommended. You will really enjoy it this show.Squid Game, Hellbound, Kingdom,My namekorea is so amazing."
1062,The Silent Sea,Not a fan of sci-fi and watch it only for Gong yoo butnit was very well made and not boring at all.Gong yoo acting was incredibile he was the best one on the drama. Hoping for a season 2.
1063,The Silent Sea,"So much jealousy and hate against the success of the Korean film industry by some online grinches. Here is an honest review. This is a solid 7.5 - 8.0 netflix series (I'm giving it a 10 to balance out these 1/10 ratings from haters). I think the director did a great job in building character of the protagonists. One thing that could be improved was to build background story of the antagonists like the two mercenaries and how they came to deal with an evil organization. The setting was amazingly done to showcase the consequences of water scarcity. Room for improvement would have been to portray the dying lifeforms of earth and go into more depth into how vulnerable human beings would behave when pushed to their limits. The plot was smooth, but I felt that the movie could have utilised the background actors a little more. For example, going on a rampage before they liquefy. Gong-yoo and the protagonists showed amazing acting skills and their emotions really showed. I think Bae Doona's acting could have been a little better in this movie, as her role is imperative to the storyline. All-in-all, this was an enjoyable series to watch."
1064,The Silent Sea,"First few episodes started out good......although as others have said there is absolutely zero logic to this show. Good production value. Story and entire premise just turned out to be horrible. Main character and squid game dude both did good, the story just gets worse every episode.There is so much about this show that doesnt make sense....one of the many silly highlights being ventalation shafts big and tall enough for multiple people to walk in.I don't regret watching this, however it could of been so much better."
1065,The Silent Sea,The plot is bad. The science is even worse. The characters are incredibly stupid for a bunch of military men and doctors with PhDs. The actors left much to be desired. Especially the female lead. She had less facial emotion than Kristen Stewart in Twilight. I was forced to finish it and I hated every minute.
1066,The Silent Sea,"The best Sci-fi movie watched ever by me.Narration of the story is excellent and it got lot of twist and turns from episode to episode, that creates excitement in watchers.Waiting for 2 season.."
1067,The Silent Sea,"I kinda not continue to watch this drama, but after second episode, you must finish a whole eight episodes. This is not first time south korea made drama about sci fi. But this is different, the way how a whole actor and actress made this drama so real. Im totaly forget, that the drama's setting is at the moon. But, my question is, how child like Luna can survive at that rate. However, this drama one of must watch. Happy watching!"
1068,The Silent Sea,"I kinda out for this drama, but after second episode, i finish a whole eight episodes in one day!. This is not the first time South Korea made a sci fi drama. But this is different, the way all actor made this so real. Im totally forget that the setting at the moon. Must watching!"
1069,The Silent Sea,"A painfully slow pseudo sci-fi with poor scripting ...
The entire show could've been done in 5 episodes or less instead of 8.When you find yourself asking the following questions, you know there's a problem with the show.(1) What are half the crew on the search-and-retrieve mission at an abandoned space station even for? Besides the Captain (Gong Yoo), a scientist (Bae Doona), a medical doctor, a pilot and co-pilot (redundancy??), and an original space station member (supposedly to lead the way), the rest are clearly just there as fodder. You don't even what function they serve on the mission, nor do they do anything to clue you in on their role.(2) It's supposed to be a trained and expert search-and-retrieval team comprised of military and scientific personal, but everyone acts like clueless teenagers in a slasher flick.E.g. Why would a scientist (Bae Doona) immediately remove her helmet after being told there's no radiation, and THEN turn on the station air purifier?(3) It's the time of the COVID pandemic. This series was made during the pandemic. You see dead bodies lying all around after FIVE YEARS but don't bother with air-borne pathogens and walked around ""unmasked""? Wow. Ok.(4) It's been FIVE YEARS since the station was abandoned! Why are bodies not rotten, dessicated, etc???!! How can you tell they drowned in just one look, after FIVE YEARS!(5) This is a team of trained military personnel, scientists and doctors. They are NOT teenagers in a slasher flick.And yet the most common reaction is dumbfoundment, and rushing over the help without notifying other team members. Isn't notifying others before going to help just basic first-aid protocol??(6) Why is the show so slow? It's 8 episodes! Could've been done in 5 or 6.Every scene is dragged out seconds longer than necessary. Everyone acts pointlessly stoic and deadpan. I had high hopes for Bae Doona but her deadpan acting just made a slow show even slower, with zero suspense."
1070,The Silent Sea,"Yeah, the visuals were pretty good, actually - but that is all on the plus side.Don't expect logic - do expect headaches from the irrationality of almost every decision made along the way. Let's just say, if that is the best the writers can come up with, I'm not surprised the world in this series is gone down the drain.How come a group of astronauts, scientists and elite soldiers is entirely composed of unqualified, undisciplined idiots and send to the mood on a critical mission?And is it too much to ask to stick at least to the bare minimum of physics on the moon? You don't have to bring artificial gravity to a moon station. The moon has gravity, you know?"
1071,The Silent Sea,"I'm a huge fan of space movies & shows but I just can't get into this show. It's slow & boring even though the plot is very promising. I find the main actress very annoying with her ""always on"" dead stare. They should learn how to make an interesting show from Squid Game."
1072,The Silent Sea,"I think when it comes to sci-fi movies, the evaluation of viewers' expect. For me if the atmosphere of the space is well reflected, actors and actresses are good and there is no fatal error on the story it means a good sci-fi for me. As I am a sci fi lover, i have learned not to expect too much especially after seeing hollywood movies. To sum up The Silent Sea is a good example of this and a milestone for Korean Series in a different genre."
1073,The Silent Sea,"Let get this out first, the actors did a good job with the script and the roles given. In this day in age there is nothing really new about movies. There are a lot of similarities between this movie and the first two Aliens move with Sigourney Weaver - no major issues here, but just wanted to point that out.There is a lot of promise to this movie but there are some glaring issues with the movie. With the internet and movies, most folks understand what to do when you are going into a potentially contaminated area. You watch someone die from a violent infection; you don't put their blood right up to your face! Don't put your phone up on your face, right after it fell in the toilet!One of the leads, Dr. Song seems to be hell bent on destroying the human race with her blatant disregard for contagion protocol calls and basic common sense; who brought the podiatrist to the Contagion movie? Who goes off exploring on their own after watching someone get killed by a mysterious shadow?"
1074,The Silent Sea,"The first episode was so bad I couldn't keep watching. This series makes Korea look incompetent, which I know they aren't. The venting of the atmosphere when the windshield of the space shuttle shattered took an agonizingly long time. The ""astronauts"" labored to walk on the moon as if the gravity was equal to or greater than earth. Why put a complicated password door lock on the only station on the moon? Afraid someone is going to break in? I don't know if the translations are direct to English, but there is an unnecessary amount of swearing by the characters too. I give it a 2 because the CGI, and props look well done."
1075,The Silent Sea,"I can enjoy a good suspense thriller and I'm willing to suspend my disbelieve to an extent. But when a show makes a big deal out of being a science thriller and it's based on such mind-numbingly dumb primes is maddening. It's water, but it defies the law of conservation of mass because... it's on the moon? What?! Also, it's just two tiny hydrogen atoms bound to one oxygen atom, but it behaves like a virus, which is hundreds of thousands of atoms (simple, sure -- but not water simple).But, sure, you're not here for the science. You're here for the thrills. This was eight episodes that should have been four. Other than the idiotic ""it's water, but it's 'lunar water' so it's..."" oh, never mind it's so ludicrous I can't even summarize. Other than that surprise, which is only a surprise because it is so, SO stupid, there are no surprises here. It seems like it could be a modern The Thing, but on the moon. Tense and exciting as they race against an unseen foe, trying to figure out what they're up against. If it were a tense and exciting thriller, the science illiteracy would be easier to accept. It is not a tense and exciting thriller. It's a slog that's at least twice the length it should be."
1076,The Silent Sea,"As a Hard Core Sci-Fi buff, I enjoyed it, not a lot of choice on good Sci-Fi's these days, all the good ones get cancelled, acting was good even with the dubbed English it carried me along, and it had a refreshing plot and not one that was done before, no drama was good, dramas suck. Everyone's a critic these days, just enjoy it for what it is and pull up your big boy/girl pants."
1077,The Silent Sea,Why the Team enters storage rooms and level1 areas with out wearing Helmets.No Brain on how scientists work on tests with out protective gears.Waste of opportunity here.
1078,The Silent Sea,"This show is slow but really well made. Actor are good, story is ok and the scenography is really great.This show is not perfect there are also bad decision (like almost all sci-fi series) but I really enjoy it and I think it deserve a better score."
1079,The Silent Sea,"A pyramid of absurdities, a hopeless script, dialogues like from a silent film, a terrible acting. I had the feeling that I was watching the mega synopsis of the previous season that was made in Hollywood in the 80s. I gave up halfway through episode 3."
1080,The Silent Sea,I don't know about other people but I liked it. The suspense they kept still the end is awesome. Again Gong Yoo and Bae Doona did very well. The story line was also impressive. Very good work from all.
1081,The Silent Sea,"This show has the most annoying horror movie tropes I've ever seen. The characters are often stupid and do things that make you want to scream at how stupid they are.*** very minor spoilers ahead ***The plot device is very incosistent also. Sometimes characters are terrified of even a small piece of it and sometimes they ignore it completely even though there is like a large amount of it on the floor next to them.There is some explanation behind this plot device but it simply doesn't follow those rules and behaves in different ways depending on what the plot requires.Also plenty of stuff happens by accident. Someone gets lost in a ventilation system and finds a room full of plot relevant entities and right away someone else that is searching for this first person (and they have no idea where they are in relation to each other) gets to her and they explore this room toghether. All by accident.The writing in this show is simply awful and it's a shame, because I really like Korean cinema, the idea behind the show seems quite interesting too and it's rather well played and set pieces are very nice too. But what's the point of all of this if you can't suspend your disbelief even for a moment, as your immersion gets destroyed by all the inconsistencies and stupidity of the characters?"
1082,The Silent Sea,"I have seen hundreds of sci fi movies, ranking from the worst to the best.I started off with two episodes and i was hooked up. I finished the whole series in just one day. The storyline was engaging, much much better than most sci fi movies i have watched. Yes, the CGI could have been better, but you cannot be expecting an interstellar- type - of cgi when obviously the production had more budget. This was a decent CGI, it delivered its purpose. The actors are all top notch, played their characters well. If you are hesitating to watch this series, just go for it. It might be your next fav series."
1083,The Silent Sea,"The CGI in the first episode is almost unbearable ...but once they're in the lunar base it's a good set. There are a few questionable scenes where the logic doesn't make sense, but I suspect this is what the director intended - much like any other horror movie.Overall probably a solid 8; only rating it 9 to offset the ratings from people with no interest in the Sci-Fi genre but still feel the need to write a review."
1084,The Silent Sea,"So...this show is just a ripoff of a Doctor Who episode?The whole series is just a ripoff of an episode of Doctor Who - ""The waters of Mars"" They just changed Mars to Moon and added a bit of dystopian drama.The show is good for itself, but i cant stop thinking all the time in the CGI, that is the worst part of the show, and the lack of innovation in a good storyBut they really think no one would notice about the ripoff? Not only did they steal the story, they were incredibly lazy about it.The sheer audacity seems wild to me."
1085,The Silent Sea,"Great acting and character development. It has perfect amount of suspense with beautifully dark cinematography. Slow paced motion usually demotivates audiences but it works in this series. For those who are bitching about the concept of this series, chill the hell out! It's a science fiction. My only wish is they should have kept chief Gong Soo-Hyuk. There's no reason to kill him off. I very much enjoyed his character, strong and very handsome. Looking forward for season 2 😍."
1086,The Silent Sea,"I did complete S1. Many negative reviews gave up on watching the entirety of the show... The concept of the mystery was unique and had promise. Unfortunately it didn't execute in a balanced manner throughout the season. Tedious to watch over the last few episodes. To each their own, but one season is enough..."
1087,The Silent Sea,Seeing many negative reviews I want to get in and add my review as well. The ideas and concept was quite unique I thought. I was fun to watch and always kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what would happen next.
1088,The Silent Sea,"They failed completely at this series,the characters had that stupid dumb stare on their faces through out,the slowness,stupid decisions,ughhh awfullllll,I just couldn't wait for it to end."
1089,The Silent Sea,"The shuttle crash makes no sense.1. They're in space in a vacuum there is no atmosphere for them to hit to cause turbulence for a vibration to make a bolt come loose.2. When they detach from the rockets again they're in a vacuum, there is nothing to grab the ship and yank it backwards and plummeting towards the moon. The shuttle of have stayed where it detached.3. When they're plummeting towards the moon, they can't get the engines to start , yet keep gaining speed without any propellant. The moon has 1/6 our gravity.For these reasons alone I couldn't get past the first episode."
1090,The Silent Sea,Disappointing. Ater 30 min. Into the first episode I came here to check if I'm the only one cannot make sense of how this script was written. Illogical and definitely not taking into consideration most of the science that should support the action portrayed.
1091,The Silent Sea,"I watch this movie because I like the actors. But the story is just full of plot hole and very predictable. We're in the pandemic era and knows that we must wear safety suit, mask etc to fight against the virus (?) but they happily walking without protection at all against the water virus knowing its contagious??? And secondly how did that luna073 clone alive in 5 years without help in that lab is very questionable what did she eat, how did she survive (?) and the ending is just very predictable."
1092,The Silent Sea,"I really enjoyed this series. I felt the tension and mystery at every turn and actually found the storyline to be quite original and well-paced, contrary to what others have stated. Sure, the characters strike me as a bit cliche and, as always, there are some plot holes (to start with, how water can be produced in all eternity out of nothing). Nevertheless, the casting was brilliant and so were the visuals. The space station is very cool, I binged-watched the whole thing."
1093,The Silent Sea,"I enjoyed The Silent Sea despite their slow paced storyline and a lil goofy CGI. It's understandable bcs this is their second sci-fi Netflix series. Way to go! Im rooting for more scifi series in future. The Silent Sea, another K-Netflix series i want for second season after Sweet Home. It was good imo, i love the thrills. Great acting, powerful cast. Overall 8/10."
1094,The Silent Sea,"The plot, the story, the dialogue, and the script all together are amazing, one of the best series I've ever watched that never makes you feel like time."
1095,The Silent Sea,"Just started this...probably won't finish. This might he something lost in translation but jeez are most of the characters painful. Like a strange combination of dumb, goofy, ago, mouthy and plain dopey. They're more caricatures, which really pulls you out of the suspension of disbelief."
1096,The Silent Sea,"I hope it was mostly the translation and voiceovers but if not, maybe the worst production I've suffered through in a long time. Full of clichés and stupid, poorly written lines. Just shoot me! Especially after watching a quality series like ""The Expanse"", this one was beyond horrible and should be an embarrassment for Netflix and everyone associated with it."
1097,The Silent Sea,I could keep focusing on the show from 1 to 8 epi.Its not predictable. I felt like I was there the Moon for few days.I think its the first movie for the moon.It gave me very realistic indirect expierience for the moon. It deserve to watch!
1098,The Silent Sea,"This drama has literally copied the 2009 Doctor Who special ""The Waters of Mars,"" which followed the Doctor as he encounters a Martian base where future humans settled, only to find the planet's water contained an intelligent virus that slowly turned the crew into ""water zombies.""
As you can see, this is very similar to the drama, so I wonder if this drama really took the ""inspiration"" from a short movie called ""The Sea of Tranquility,"" or from doctor who."
1099,The Silent Sea,"I liked the show but I can't be the only one seeing a scary amount of similarities to the hit game among us correct? Turning on O2, imposters and crew mates, venting, sabotaging lights and doors. Seems a little too coincidental if you ask me."
1100,The Silent Sea,"Men = Dead
When Dr.song see the hiding place or monster... she go there without weapon or not request the backup, not telling anyone... then go alone like stupid.Moon gravity is not realistic just look like only walking on earth with act and add a little slow motion.But I enjoyed the story. :)
CGI is better than DC :3Luna is the best actress in this Show."
1101,The Silent Sea,"Just terrible writing, bad dialogue, ridiculous plot holes, uninspiring characters. If i could rate it a ZERO, i would! Totally not worth the time spent watching it.Fun fact :
South Korea doesn't have the technology to send something out of space. That represents the level of this series."
1102,The Silent Sea,I like scene with suspense. Best concept 😗😗.Pilot and ending can b better. Btw not well explained but giving 8 star for such a amazing concept about water. 😗😗
1103,The Silent Sea,"This show was thrilling.There are few slips but over all it was very enjoyable.I liked the music and the atmosphere.I liked the dialogue especially the scene were the main character speaked to her dead sister, that scene showed how good the dialogue writing is. You cam rewatch it and you could listen to every one of the sisters tall on ots own and it stillade since.My only problem is the lack of safety they showed in the series."
1104,The Silent Sea,"My wife and I enjoyed watching all 8 episodes partially due to the shared yelling at the characters for being so stupid.There are many ways this could've been great but they filled it with BIG logic gaps.After arriving at a ""abandoned"" space station without a way home, no one decided to secure food and water.The captain is constantly sending people alone to areas, regardless of how many of them die.Everyone is willing to be shot/killed if anyone in the room says ""wait"".When anyone is dying of a deadly disease, everyone must watch their whole death process and get as close as possible.A super strong girl will rip off the hand of a good person without warning. But only gently push you down if you are a known killer.Water multiplies infinitely when the plot requires it, but will stop when it doesn't.Lack of oxygen does not slow you down ever.The captain sets up a trap in a corridor with access to the ventilation system, the main travel methodology of the monster.Monster can sense where capsules of moon water is, no matter where it is on the station. And only cares about it when there are other people around that water to advance the plot.I could go on and on. This should've been a movie with all the plot holes cut out. It could've been down with fewer characters, less useless steps in between.If you don't want to yell at your tv for hours do not watch this."
1105,The Silent Sea,"The show keeps you on the endge for all the 8 episode. Hoping for a season 2.The cast choice was amazing, Gong yoo and Bea Doona have an amazing chemistry carring on the entire show alone."
1106,The Silent Sea,Awesome seines with good story line cant wait for 2nd season.and also the graphics are good all characters are awesome ever ting perfect...................................................................
1107,The Silent Sea,"It was a great work as a new director.It was boring in the beginning, but the immersion was higher as time went by, and the fear and tension of the set made me more focused.There are also regrets. I'm a little dissatisfied with the overall acting directing and lines. The probability of the last episode is also a little low.However, the cg was good and the material was fresh.If it came out as a two-hour movie, it would have been a very well-made work."
1108,The Silent Sea,"I liked everything in this show
the acting , the story , the cgi , the ending , literally everything was good
i hope this will have a second season somehow."
1109,The Silent Sea,"The Silent sea really matched my expectations with amazing story line, unexpected turns, good direction really make this show a complete entertainment package. Gong yoo and Bae doona done their part really well and other cast too. The best part of this series it binds suspense with thrillers."
1110,The Silent Sea,"Traitors, backstabbing, mixed in with Scifi, action and fantasy. Stand out performance from the actors of squid game and a beautiful set. However, there are some plot holes that could have been better explained."
1111,The Silent Sea,"This series is plagued by uninspired writing, plot holes, and overused tropes, which drag what could have been an interesting setting into the endless swamp of mediocrity, leaving the CGI as its only redeeming quality.As a big fan of the sci-fi and post-apocalyptic genres, I was intrigued by the setting, but after the first episode I had a feeling that I was in for a rough ride. Unfortunately, my faint hope that the show would improve was quickly snuffed out, as characters make comically bad decisions, the tension built feels hollow, and the resolution is wholly unsatisfying.Certain members of this hand-picked team of seasoned professionals, which could very well be mistaken for a bunch of inapt amateurs, perish like flies, while others are protected by plot armour so massive that it has its own gravitational pull.The talented cast is utterly wasted on underdeveloped characters who often appear incapable of logical thinking and engage in pointless bickering which prolongs the audience's suffering. The fact that the second traitor in the team, who acts as the primary villain for the second half of the show, never reveals his motivations, briefly shows signs of regret, only to double down and do everything in his power to hinder the heroes' mission even through his final emotional breakdown, only serves to reveal the true villains of the series - the writers."
1112,The Silent Sea,"Hands down the best korean show of 2021
liked it better than squid game and hellbound
I love horror movies and this didn't disappointed.Main cast sublime."
1113,The Silent Sea,"As a long time fan of both Korean dramas and sci-fi movies, this had a lot of potential. The trailer was interesting enough to lure me in but after watching it on and off for the past 3 days, I came to realise it was a waste of time.The idea behind it was actually really interesting but I feel that they dragged some scenes out way too much - like, I didn't need to watch Dr Song stare into space for 10 minutes. The series could have easily been condensed into half the number of episodes.I will say though, the visuals were somewhat impressive. It definitely captured the vibe of space and the set design was well executed.Apart from that, I can't really say I recommend it unless you have time to waste. If you're after a Korean sci-fi series, 'Happiness' is definitely worth a watch. There's an awesome cast, solid plot, great visuals, and plenty of zombies (if you're into that kind of stuff)."
1114,The Silent Sea,"Don't turn off if you feel the start is slow. Keep watching it's all worth it for its very nicely laid out story line, and beautiful acting. A different story that I've not watched before. Kudos to the entire team."
1115,The Silent Sea,"The acting of the cast, the VFX, the storyline, and the conclusion of the series. This all made sense and rather than calling it fiction, this could be a realistic case in the future when Earth could face desertification. Nothing about the plot was a cliche as it was really unique. I mean Lunar Water, a water which was found on the moon and how it is multiplying. You all will get it once you watch the series."
1116,The Silent Sea,"Although not very science fiction, I loved it! Very exciting and atmospheric. Despite some logical inconsistencies, it's hard to come off until you see it to the end."
1117,The Silent Sea,I was hoping this was going to be a good series but it's disappointing and hard to watch. And I'm scratching my head wondering about the good reviews it's getting.
1118,The Silent Sea,"It's a trashy web show that basically RIPS off Doctor Who with almost no original content. The setting, story and camera are heavily copied from The Waters of Mars. Can there be any shame in such blatant copying?"
1119,The Silent Sea,"The series build up is a little slow in the beginning but it is justifiable to lead the story to it's climax.The combination of an idea of such simple element, could lead to sort of a virus outbreak, I think it's a very creative spin to the story. Something fresh from all the zombie and virus outbreak movies.Drama in between that leads to the end but managed to reflect the motivation of a few key characters, I think this was depicted very well. And ending left me wanting more to see the next chapter of what is gonna happen for the survivors."
1120,The Silent Sea,"Its a Good sifi series, i want second season also,
good concept,
sometimes its slow little bit, but good.Good Netflix series
wanted some new concept Series
.........................................................."
1121,The Silent Sea,"Despite some of the more negative reviews, I really enjoyed this series! It's very much a science-fiction show, so bear in mind that a lot of the ""science"" will be a bit whacky! Suspending my understanding of known scientific rules made the show much more enjoyable. I definitely recommend this title to any science-fiction enthusiast."
1122,The Silent Sea,They went to extract samples of moon water and some of them were killed on the same.Why to kill own team mates and steal those samples to hand over it to another party while there abundant of moon water available there(whole station was drowned in moon water at the end)
1123,The Silent Sea,"The director is not a good story teller, telling a really interesting story in a way that forces tight sleep to anybody who watches it. Such a huge sorry for all the staff except for the director.I just don't know why I am still watching it."
1124,The Silent Sea,"Great watch, was hooked from the first episode, really appreciate this tv series. One of the best sci-fi's for some time and especially on Netflix, who don't have many good offerings within this category."
1125,The Silent Sea,"Good, interesting series, music, story, acting everything is good.... there are flaws but overall its amazing series... if you won't make season 2 then i will give you 3 star... Make season 2."
1126,The Silent Sea,"The show is so dumb and boring that I couldn't even finish the first episode. The dialogues are generic, the science is non-existing, the characters are horrible. Too bad, had high hopes for this show..."
1127,The Silent Sea,I almost did not watch this as I read allot of negative reviews and articles so I was surprised I really liked this. The acting was great and I found myself interested in each new aspect that came along.The concept of what happened when the lunar water touched the characters was super interesting and definetly not something I had seen before. Some of the flashbacks were abit tedious and a couple loose ends but apart from that I really enjoyed it.
1128,The Silent Sea,"Before watching this, I was already aware that not everyone liked it so much. I have done research as well and it seems it was a remake of an old movie.So for me, that's fine. Also, this is a SCIENCE FICTION. Of course you do not expect a lot of logic as it clearly states that the genre is SF. It's not a documentary to have lots of facts and it isn't even based in a real story. Which I do not understand why the people who reviewed this expect a lot of facts and logic.All in all, the production is good. The sequence isn't bad. The mystery is on point. Actors are the best. Although I wish a more climactic reveal. But then again since this is a remake, they cannot go too far from the original story."
1129,The Silent Sea,"The Silent Sea is a sci-fi mystery drama that takes place in a near apocalyptic Earth where water is becoming a rare commodity. An abandoned moon station may have the answer that can save humanity's plight. So how was it?Meh. Lets take a quick dive.Plot/premise - Original idea with boring execution. The first 1-3 episodes are interesting, however it becomes very slow afterwards with a rushed ending that does not conclude a lot of the existing plot. When the mystery is revealed, it still goes on. However, major plot holes will be noticed if you pay attention - particularly with the questionable actions of characters. Also, this plot did not have to take place on the moon. It really doesn't. Nothing about the plot uses elements of space or the moon - rendering the setting just window dressing. They do not explore the moon or its crevasses. They are outside the station 1-3 times (minus the start and end). 'Lunar Water' is a fictional commodity - and thus is not related to the moon in any capacity. The plot could have taken place in Antartica with ""Artic Water"" or an abandon Indian research lab where its gotten too hot and thus the city evacuated. It has no reason to take place on the moon. After realising this, the story is a lot less impressive.Characters - Fun chemistry between a few, but the main protagonist is a bore to follow. Same facial expressions for 7 episodes with constant bickering and complaining. I wish the story followed the captain's story, has his motivations are a lot more fleshed out and reflective of his actions. He has moral decisions to make as the captain - but less so with the current protagonist. She's boring, passive, and I look forward to seeing the other characters. As mentioned previously, the actions of many characters are questionable at best, suspending the immersion.Visuals and setting - Very pretty and realistic. The Moon base had a sense of space and direction, and eventually the viewer will know the ins and outs of it. Sadly, the entire setting is just window dressing. The setting of a dying earth is poorly done. Apart from seeing a small queue of people waiting for water, and a brown earth from space (which may be the only reason this story takes place there), there is ZERO SENSE OF URGENCY. The people on earth look like they are doing just fine, and there is no 'ticking time bomb' of any capacity, given the characters on earth are not suffering, the characters on the moon are vibing and easily communicating with earth.Overall, the tv show has an interesting premise which should have been executed better and with more thought. It was a 'meh' experience, with pretty visuals and some interesting dynamic and original plot. However, when you realise the moon is just window dressing - its all just a disappointing show leaving you wanting more."
1130,The Silent Sea,It's literally so boring and nothing interesting happens. It's just astronauts running back and forth and some of them being killed.In my opinion it's not worth watching.
1131,The Silent Sea,"I admit the cast, the acting, the set are incredible. It's just the writing is a little bit off. It started out good, having a mystery, space, and an unknown virus. But i think the writer are putting a lot of plot twists that it became a plot holes. There's so many things that are unexplained, but there's always something new in each episode. Instead of explaining and finishing things, they decided to put another plot twist.So many exaggeration in the story as well, like in each minute they'll have problems that it makes me tired to watch it. They can't even close the door without something is happening, or i'm not even surprised anymore if ""luna"" can fly to the earth or something.I think the show will be good if they try to keep it down. And not having too many plot twists or incidents in each episode, or at least have a decent ending to give us that the problem has solved entirely, but they decided to hang us in that part as well that makes me hate this show. It's too much, and i can say a bad ending.It's a shame for the actors, they did really well, but the writing is making it boring."
1132,The Silent Sea,I found the silent sea enjoyable and entertaining. Its not an action Sci Fi per se but rather a drama suspense or mystery within a Sci fi setting. I found that it got better as it went along and drew me into the story.There were many twists and turns and the show doesn't rely on special effects or cgi to hold your attention. The plot is believable and realistic.It was not a horror movie although there were scenes of graphic violence.I felt that the characters made logical decisions and they were likable and identifiable.
1133,The Silent Sea,"It is an interesting concept, but it wasn't executed properly. Was expecting some fusion of Resident Evil (2002) and maybe Dead Space/DOOM or Alien, but instead I was pleasantly surprised by this concept. Not that it would have been bad if they did the aforementioned mix. The ending was the culmination of the illogicalities that plagued this series. Still props for trying."
1134,The Silent Sea,"There are many logical mistakes.And there are mistakes in the Cutscenes. That bothered me the most
Like. He have a weapon, and then goes in the other room, then suddenly he had none, and then he got attacked."
1135,The Silent Sea,"Honestly, i watch this drama since eps 1 till eps 8 with no stopped. I'm very enjoy and feels some different things. Cheers to all crew cast, u're best guys!"
1136,The Silent Sea,"Truly recommend the korean thriller series is totally up to the mark and must watch. The concept is really good about lunar water and all. The lead actor and actress with a lead child character did a tremendous job. Netflix hust did the right by launching one by one Korean series.Add, The Silent Sea in your weekend watch list. I have watched it in just a single night."
1137,The Silent Sea,"Well i love to watch Sci-Fi as i get so excited, and this drama never fail to impress me. I liked everything about it from A to Z, although i have only one comment that it ended so quickly while i was waiting for more explanations, why cannot Captain Han go back after he does the depressurization process? And if saying that he died how? Why didn't anyone try to save him. Taking him back to Earth or taking him in the spaceship and giving him an oxygen like what happened episodes back. Where is Dr. Song's sister dead body ? They walk all along through the balhae station and they didn't find her But after all of this, I'm still happy with the drama and i hope there's another season to see what is going to happen with luna and mostly i want Captain Han alive."
1138,The Silent Sea,Great characters. 8 episodes which is not too long not too short for this serie. A surprise episode after episode. Long time ago I've seen such a sience fiction serie with horror! Supense from the very beginning till the end. Not boring at all. I hope a second season will appear. Just watch it and enjoy!
1139,The Silent Sea,"I watched the entire series in one day and when you finish a Korean webseries in one day that means it's damn awesome. Sci-fi with balanced emotions, little bit of action here and there makes it a must watch and enjoyable series...i would definitely recommend this one 👍... enjoy yourselves🍸"
1140,The Silent Sea,"I have heard that it is not a big hit for Korean, but it is actually pretty good for first space SF drama. Ep.1-2 is a bit slow and boring but from Ep. 3 I started to feel excited and can't stop watching. Hope they continue to Season 2 !!!"
1141,The Silent Sea,"After watching the second episode, I often speed up the scene in the next episode. There are too many inconsistencies in the story. The crew's bodies don't rot after years, Luna or the beautiful monsters also don't make sense with a less clear story base. Even the story characters in the SAA office only involve 1-2 characters, which is less realistic. But I admit the acting of the actors is quite good. Too bad it's not accompanied by a better story."
1142,The Silent Sea,"I admit I couldn't make it past the first episode, so my review is written in that context.It started well, but once the space craft took off I am afraid it lost me. The rocket engines were shown burning but the crew were shown in zero g. Entering the moons orbit again the rocket engines were shown burning, but not to slow down into orbit. It's details like these that ruin a fantasy and prevent suspension of disbelief. It's lazy on the part of the production team to to either not do their homework, or assume the audience won't notice.A couple of other things that stood out are the pilot struggling with his joystick as he tries to land the space shuttle. Struggling against what? There is no atmosphere. There is also the amount of air rushing out of what is a fairly small shuttle...Five stars because I didn't get very far and if you can get past the lack of even fantasy physics there might be a story worth watching here.For context I like Star Wars, but that is set in a fantasy universe but this is not which is why I'd hope for at least a little basic realism. Seeing all of the above pulls you back to reality ironically and means I could watch this no further than episode one."
1143,The Silent Sea,"Do u think water will always be free commodity? What will happen when we ran out water? We desperately seek for it at all cost.Silent Sea was well plotted, well written of wide range of human emotion to strive and survive. Beautifully swaying one's emotion, there were more stories behind the stories and i just couldnt stop binge-watching.Most of the character tragically died. Sooooo saaddd. But its all worth it! For all sci fi lover, Gong Yoo's and Lee Joon's fans, u must watch this."
1144,The Silent Sea,Loved spending time on this series..loved acting of the cast..loved Gong yo..loved Luna's Naruto run 😂💜..the series was something I didn't expect looking at its ratings but it was great..the plot was thrilling and it kept me in suspense till the end.
1145,The Silent Sea,"Oh dear lord, what a stinker. I read the negative reviews but decided to give it a try anyway and couldn't make it through the first episode. The production is amateurish, the CGI clunky, the plot is thin and worn out and filled with every single cliche imaginable. None of these should have necessarily meant it would be unwatchable or even bad, but in this case it just means that it has no redeeming values at all.I won't rehash the plot, as there's nothing more to it than the description you've probably already read, with the exception of some presumed twist that I could scarcely have cared less about after 45 mins. You've seen it all before and probably done much better. Despite this, what actually let it down was the script, which is basically your standard Korean fantasy about a group of schoolkids suddenly finding out they have special gifts and have to save the world. Except the actual characters are none of those things - they are supposed to be trained, disciplined, capable adults - scientists, doctors, spacecraft pilots - yet they never act that way. Their dialogue is juvenile babble of the sort teenagers think professional adults speak like. Individuals who are supposed to be skilled and proficient at complicated tasks act like dithering idiots and make the most ridiculous decisions. That a 7km hike across the flat surface of the moon, which has 1/3 the gravity, is portrayed as such an arduous, grueling affair suggests that the writers haven't even walked that far on earth before in their lives. And I think that's the essence of this - the people who manufactured this stinking mess clearly had no ideas of their own and were just given a pile of money to make ""something"" because they'd made something before that had been marginally successful. If you do decide to watch it, just think about how much better it could have been if it was made by people who actually had their own story to tell and had been given the chance to do so instead."
1146,The Silent Sea,"The series looks really really weird. It's as if it was originally not made to be in space / moon. The microgravity looks weird. The way the air behave also weird.On top of the weird looks, the story also moves at glacial pace. Oh and the Astronauts acts like untrained people."
1147,The Silent Sea,"When will Netflix stop it with these bland shows?Is this a character driven show? No it isn't..
Is this a plot driven show? Yes it is.Does the plot go anywhere? No, no it doen'tThe show is incredibly one note from the start to finish, just look at the expression on the main actress's, no feelings just bored out of her mind.. every single characters have nothing for you to like about them, not to root for, the only person with any kind of backstory is the main actress, yet the show fails to make us care for her.This is a snail-paced show and even then, it is not a good slow-burn, it's just... soo... slow..... with barely any payoff what so ever.Even the soundtrack is one-note, notice the pattern?If you are looking to continue the hype train for watchable (but overrated) shows like Kingdoms, Squid Games then this isn't it.This is my first review and it's a pretty lackluster one, much like this series."
1148,The Silent Sea,"I like SF, so I gave it a chance, however... from the same beginning this is barely watchable.There's zero connection with any physics laws, so expect green plants in moon's dungeons, earth-like gravity on moon out of nothing, water doesn't freeze in outer-space, but it freezes later, basically water is just multiplying itself, because moon's water is a virus (?!?!) and more. I need to admit, the authors were really creative but there's no common sense at all. And the final scene... girl taking a walk on moon in nightdress! Enjoy!"
1149,The Silent Sea,When I started watching this I was really in a mood for something like dead space story line or horror space series and this definitely delivered.I think the pacing is good but sometimes the characters in the story can be annoying and slow to watch but the visual effects and story line is compelling and can you hook you in. I'm binge watching now up to e4 and can't wait to watch more. I would definitely recommend the series.
1150,The Silent Sea,"I loved this series. This was a great cinematographic experience with a lot of mystery, suspense and dark/grey as the moon scenes.A bit slow but the pace matches the whole idea of scenery. Remember 2001 a space Odyssey. Not a correct comparison but I want to mention there were slower masterpieces.Better than the Hollywood footage from 1969 :-D. Just kidding. :-)"
1151,The Silent Sea,"I expected a lot more from this. I was being generous giving it a 3. I persevered for 5 episodes, don't waste your time. . END. . MOON. Soochan was an organic water pump."
1152,The Silent Sea,The story is baseless. Lot of flaws in each episode. Just waste of talented actors here. Worst plot and execution shown. I do not recommend it. If you want to waste some time Please do watch it.
1153,The Silent Sea,"The plot is well presented although some scenes felt like they have been dragged for too long. For what is touted to be the first South Korean sci-fi space drama, this series lived up to its expectations.The series is premised on Earth's bleak future where water has become a scarce resource. Humanity's desperation for water as a means to survive in the series is cleverly contrasted with the paradoxical 'drowning' of the mission crew along the way. Imagine being killed by the one thing you need the most in order to survive.Bae Doona gave a strong performance as a woman of science and outshone the rest of the cast. It would have been more interesting if they had shown the developments after the two scientists were rescued from the station at the end, but perhaps they are saving this for a season two. All in all, a worthwhile series to watch."
1154,The Silent Sea,"Where do they find these irritating film crew? Do they drag them from a bar at 2am and hand them an iPhone on a stick? I get that shakycam can be used to add effect during action films, but do we really need to be subjected to an endless vestibular pukefest throughout the scenes, even when it's a couple of people chatting in an office?"
1155,The Silent Sea,Only halfway through the first episode and the science sucks. Dust clouds on the moon! Sorry. Dust clouds require an atmosphere. Not hopeful for the rest of the show.Decompression on the ship lasted way too long.Many other errors.
1156,The Silent Sea,"The plot is good, the setting and production design are great, the CG and SFX's budget are well-spent, but IMO it lack (even it have, but sound dampen) the background music to made me emotional engaged.Anyway, better than ""Space Sweepers"" which i couldn't even finished half."
1157,The Silent Sea,"When I saw this coming with Bae Doona (Sense8) and Gong Yoo (Train to Busan) in the trailer the show went to the top of my watch list. I didn't really know what to expect, but knew it would be good just from those two being in it. The acting was great. Many of the concepts and plot points were excellent. I personally loved the Aliens vibe from the first few episodes and knew there had to be a Newt like character as soon as I saw those tunnels for navigating the base. The idea of Lunar Water was fascinating in its possibilities and dangers. There are some parts that are needlessly drawn out and hurt the momentum of the story. Like Taesuk's death - OMFG I swear he's probably still alive up there. The ending, sadly, is where it fails. It gets ridiculous in its efforts to make emotional impacts and instead robs many events of the significance they should have had. I question so many of the choices in writing for the last episode, but I was definitely with the show from start to finish. It was good, but should have been great with all that it had going for it. And I would really love it if someone could explain to me the significance of the starfish that the infected saw."
1158,The Silent Sea,"Silent Sea is quite clearly a labor of love. The writing is grounded and snappy or poetic and esoteric as is appropriate to the scene. There are very clear references to several well-loved sci fi and horror classics, including, but not limited to, The Shining and Alien. The visuals are pretty good - they do look a little cheap in certain scenes, but it didn't really bother me. What really stands out is the cinematography. It really aides the storytelling. The soundtrack was quite good, as well.The only real drawbacks are the pacing and the worldbuilding. At times, scenes crawl to a halt as the characters are seemingly stuck staring at one another for no apparent reason. It became quite frustrating at times. And while I'm no scientist, there were some pretty immersion-breaking inaccuracies. There were also a few pointless plot threads that weren't enough to be red herrings, and instead ended up just seeming like wastes of screen time.Overall, though, this is a cold, dystopian sci fi that turns into a grounded, emotional tale of magical realism. It is very enjoyable start to finish."
1159,The Silent Sea,"This started out decent, nothing great but actually got pretty good. You became involved in the plot and were looking forward to what is coming up. (BTW the English voice overs where way better than Squid Games)Unfortunately the last two episodes ruin this whole series.Spoilers....Yeah you can't walk around the moon without a space suit. You still need air and never mind the decompression from taking the space suit off.Trust me and skip this. It was mostly OK and got pretty good at some points, only to fall apart at the end."
1160,The Silent Sea,"It's classified as a triller it is it, full of plot holes things that does not make sense even when trying to classify it as sci-fi, good actors but terrible history and it's does not have good visual effects."
1161,The Silent Sea,"Unfortunately the concern from the trailer came true. Astronauts or scientists don't say like that.Just a simple misfire collaborated by someone who doesn't love the genre, someone who doesn't know how to write a script, and someone who couldn't correct the course and let this brought into the world.Don't give it a try. Worthless."
1162,The Silent Sea,"As a scifi fan, I have watched so many tv shows and movies that show outrageous stories and stupid probability. However, I think Korean did good job on approaching this type of genre compare to others. It has a story and a message. I know their budget was not much high as others. However, I hope Netflix keep investing money on Korean directors and create various content to entertain us more and more. It was much better than other stupid tv shows and movies that contain 0 story and only showing stupid visuals and effects. I can't wait to see more creative content from Korean."
1163,The Silent Sea,"The series is bad. I mean really bad.Could have been barely watchable in an 1.5h movie, but in 8 long episodes is too much time wasting.Earth has lost all its water because why not? Shuttle in space loses one bolt out of nothing, then main engine fails to start, just because. Then they crash into the moon, violently shaking all the way like they were going through the atmosphere or some sort. And they crash on the surface almost smoothly, it's not like there were going few km/sec like in real life.The science feels like Armaggedon, it's trully a mess and an insult to every man with a brain. And in contrast with Armaggedon which has bad science, but is enjoyable due to good actors, relatable characters, fast paced action and some dramatism, this series is way too slow, characters are flat and antipathetic, no action or backstory make you care about them if they die or not, the story drags on and on forever without becoming interesting (if that ever happens). Don't waste your time in this Netflix attemp to cash in koreean movies, based on Squid Game success."
1164,The Silent Sea,If you can get through the dubbed dialogue you will be rewarded. A bit slow sometimes but I thought the concept is true to our current world environmental issues. A smart tension filled movie. Makes one feel like a small piece of a huge universe and thought millions of generations.
1165,The Silent Sea,"The first season of 8 episodes is very wonderful and breathtaking, I watched episode after episode, that reminded me of the classic horror movie series Alien."
1166,The Silent Sea,"Honestly one of the worst sci-fy series i´ve ever watched i fell sorry for the time i wasted watching it.Everything the Expanse did right, this series did it all wrong, logic holes which are so big, a death-star could fit through it, there we have a shuttle at almost orbital speed crashing in the planet without much damage, plowing through lunar mountains, then gets destroyed from a 30m fall.The whole scrip was just bad, and without any depth. There was not a single decent dialogue in the series.Elements and Atoms appearing out of nowhere,
Lunar atmosphere? Seriously? What kind of drugs were used writing that script? The Atmosphere on lunar is so thin, it´s whole mass is below 10 metric tons.Plants made no sense.Actors were not really good too, characteres were completly generic
If you cut the series down to 90 minutes, it would probably made a decent B/C movie you could actually enjoy after a lot alcohol after watching other movies like Megashark vs Mechashark etc.Absolute waste of time, only thing thats interessting me is who the hell at netflix wasted money purchasing the rights for that aweful disgrace of a TV series.1/10 Stars, sadly there´s no way to give less, 0,5 would be fair."
1167,The Silent Sea,"Being a sci-fi fan I really wanted this to be good but the characters were kinda boring, it was slow moving and there were too many outlandish things left unexplained. It was visually pretty well done but that's about it."
1168,The Silent Sea,"This low score is for the individuals who disregarded all of science for ""creative purposes"". I understand, it's a show. I'm sure the budget was hell (at least I kind of hope it was, that would explain a lot), but this show is really bad. Like Armageddon(1998) bad. Acting was pretty good though."
1169,The Silent Sea,"Very Solid, on an all round basis. Actually quite blown away at how impressive this TV series was. Ticked all the boxes. And as a space enthusiast, I may possess a little bit of bias BUT they were spot on with attention to detail. A strong plot was the most impressive aspect. Offering a nice balance between Sci-Fi, Thriller, Drama and Horror and executed well. This one season was better than the past 2 seasons of The Expanse, I'm sorry to say. Korean productions are on the rise and should be taken very seriously."
1170,The Silent Sea,"I usually don't write bad reviews but for a Sci-fi fan like me this show felt like a crime. Yes it was that bad.Generic plot, bad dialogues and worst of all extremely stupid characters. You would think they would choose smart people for a space mission like this but somehow these characters are regularly surprised by the most obvious things. They are incapable of putting 2 and 2 together and make the worst decisions. This more than anything makes this show so frustrating to watch."
1171,The Silent Sea,"Not a fan of this genre but after squid game i'm trying to watch other korean works on netflix and give it a try w/o much expectation.Glad i started it cause the plot is very simple but very well done hope for a season 2
Loved the main actors."
1172,The Silent Sea,"Very atmospheric, intriguing and thoughtful. Pace is slow and beautiful but there is a lot going on. So much better than your typical Hollywood sci-fi. Moon shots are truly amazing and breathtaking."
1173,The Silent Sea,"This Korean SciFi should have been rejected by the filmakers before wasting so much time. You can sum it up as:
Film sets clobbered up from airplane parts:Endless time consuming and pointless scenes of various people running around dimly lit tunnels with no dramatic effect.Absurd ignoring of technical impossibilities:
Ex: Space vehicle being driven by manipulation of a control stick as used in airplanes flying in an atmosphere but worthless in space.Water spontaneaously being created from nothing.I can't believe I wasted the time watching the entire season. Please, spare the world from Season two."
