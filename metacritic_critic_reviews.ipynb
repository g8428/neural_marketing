You went to play kids’ games because someone told you you’d get all that cash. So then they had you play Red Light, Green Light, and they shot everyone who got caught. But when you said you wanted to go, they said, ‘Okay, just go,’ and you don’t know what they look like or where this all took place. Is that everything, mister?” ]\n",

      "Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), the officer’s audience, once fully confident in his account of the games, the gunfire, and their grisly aftermath, goes from bold to sheepish as he hears his words echoed back to him. It’s a scenario too grand, too brutal, too inhuman to imagine: Somewhere, somehow, someone has accumulated enough resources to marshal a private army, tempt strangers from around South Korea into participating in a 6-stage series of “games” for cash prizes, kidnap 456 of those strangers, and hold them in an undisclosed remote location where the games commence. They are not fun. People lose more than an eye. It’s a horrific and miserable affair for the players. For the streaming audience at home, it’s colorful, shocking, and shamefully entertaining. It’s “Squid Game,” your new streaming obsession.\n",
      "Netflix’s latest (and completely unexpected) hit series comes to U.S. viewers all the way from South Korea, the land of Park Chan-wook, Bong Joon-ho, and dozens of other great filmmakers unknown to swaths of American audiences because Park and Bong are the only Korean names they have the bandwidth to remember. Maybe they’ll make room for Hwang Dong-hyuk, too; “Squid Game’s” popularity is quite possibly as much a surprise to him as to Netflix and to American critics, who can’t seem to find another reference point for the show than “Parasite.” Admittedly, “Parasite” does feel like kin to “Squid Game”: A merciless class critique focused largely on conflict whipped up between the have-nots by the haves. But that film and this show approach that motif from different angles and have little else in common. There’s no 1% class here. There are instead faceless agents of social attenuation. \n",

      "Hwang’s lead is Gi-hun, though he’s merely one protagonist among an ensemble that includes seven others. Gi-hun has a problem: He’s a bum. He’s a bum for about a half dozen reasons, comprising a blend of bad luck and worse decision-making skills, but a bum nonetheless. With empty pockets on his daughter’s (Cho Ah-in) birthday, he goes to the racetrack, bets big, wins big, is shaken down big by friendly neighborhood loan sharks, and ends the evening a loser as is his habit. (He’s also divorced, in case that needs to be said.) Then, a stroke of fortune, neither good nor bad. Waiting for a train, Gi-hun meets a nameless nattily-dressed man (“Train to Busan‘s” Gong Yoo) who gives him a chance to make fistfuls of money by playing a game. The man leaves the details fuzzy. When, at the end of the first episode, “Red Light, Green Light,” the details come into sharp relief via the percussive reports of gunfire. \n",
      "“Squid Game’s” influences are abundant. Beyond the works of Hwang’s South Korean peers: Films like “Battle Royale,” “Escape Room,” and E. L. Katz’s terrific “Cheap Thrills,” a movie about a bored married couple possessed of immeasurable wealth who pit two friends against each other in a series of sickening pranks and dares. “Squid Game” actually feels closest to that movie for sheer visceral impact; overarching commentaries on South Korea’s problems with wealth inequality and financial/political scandals, as in corruption perpetrated by the state-run developer Korea Land and Housing Corp., give Hwang’s story senses of time and specificity. But the questions posed by “Squid Game” and “Cheap Thrills” remain the same: How much does your loyalty to your friends, your family, and to your fellow man cost? What would you do to yourself and to others for a quick, easy buck, give or take several billion?\n",
      "READ MORE: ‘Succession’ Season 3: Well-Crafted Characters Are The Beating-Heart & Creatives Ooze Confidence [Review]\n",
      "The stakes are so incalculable that judgment feels petty. “Squid Games” has no illusions about its characters’ relative morality; not all of them are “bad,” but practically none of them are “good.” Gi-hun is a deadbeat with a gambling problem, a guy who would steal from his own mother instead of getting a job; Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), Gi-hun’s old childhood chum, embezzled so much money from his securities company’s clients that the cops are out for his arrest; Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon), a North Korean defector, is hellbent on getting her parents over the border by any means necessary; Mi-nyeo (Kim Joo-ryoung) tries to pass herself as a single mom to dubious effect; gangster Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae) is so in over his head with his own gambling debts that his organs are up for grabs. Elderly tumor patient Il-nam (O Yeong-su) and Pakistani worker Ali (Anupam Tripathi) are the 2 most moral people mixed up in the game. \n",
      "Still, apart from Deok-su, “Squid Game” reserves scrutiny. There’s probably not a single soul out there who wouldn’t at least consider playing a life-and-death game where the prize is financial stability for life, and when the starting roster of 456 starts out trying to secure that prize for themselves, the impulse to condemn them for going with the flow disappears. Hwang puts so many people on the board that we immediately wonder if we, too, would sign away our safety for the chance at winning big. This, in the large tradition of “rich people make sport of the poor” genre niche, feels somewhat new. Even newer is the introduction of democracy into that class dynamic. In Episode 2, “Hell,” the players all vote to end the game in accordance with the rules laid out by their hosts. Amazingly, the game ends. \n",
      "But the show goes on. Living on the precipice of bankruptcy isn’t a way to live. There is, perhaps, a conflict of a sort between “Squid Game’s” aesthetic and its material; Hwang gives the show a slick, handsome veneer, as rich in detail as the organization that’s behind the games is in resources. Grime clutters in the corners and at the edges, but for the most part, it’s barely window dressing. Whenever the plot takes us to the compound where the games commence, that grime disappears entirely, replaced by a visual sense best described as a head-on collision between M.C. Escher and “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.” It’s glorious and weird, a combination to savor in a series that demands savoring.\n",
      "Would “Squid Game” be improved with the addition of grit and grain? Probably not. It isn’t a series worth improving on, after all, an unpredictable smash that, like every South Korean show or film Americans latch onto, has unflattering views about the wealthy and a deft hand at turning class assessment into propulsive art. Hwang knows how much convincing he needs to do to bring his viewers on board with the premise; unlike the cop, the audience will buy into “Squid Game’s” world without a fuss, a credit to Hwang’s skills as a filmmaker and writer. Forget the negative connotations the phrase “bingeworthy” stirs up. In the binge era, this show is as good as they come. [A]\n",

      "The biggest show on Netflix might just be a South Korean horror series with a cephalopod name and a violent, disturbing concept.\n",
      "By now you've probably heard of \"Squid Game,\" a dark social satire in which desperately impoverished people are enticed to compete in children's games with deadly stakes for the chance to win a life-changing cash prize. Since its Sept. 17 debut on the streaming service, it has become an online craze, sparking memes and fan theories and becoming the No. 1 show on the streamer in 70 countries, including the U.S., according to Netflix.\n",
      "We may never have appointment television viewing like \"Game of Thrones\" again in the streaming era, but amid the proliferation of content, streaming or otherwise, a genuine word-of-mouth surprise can still surface. And that's what's happened with \"Squid Game,\" which received virtually no press or marketing in the U.S. before its debut. It joins a recent list of successful foreign language series for Netflix stateside (including \"Lupin\" and \"Money Heist\") and will likely stay at the top of the pop-culture conversation as long as people keep telling their friends to watch. \n",
      "So what it is about \"Squid\" (★★★½ out of four), that has so many people suctioned to their screens?\n",
      "There is a visceral, primal, can't-look-away feeling to the nine-episode series, which traffics in gore but also deep psychological horror and disturbances. The protagonist is Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a divorced father who's a bit of a degenerate and a gambler. He's scraping by on the back of his elderly mother, whom he lives with while occasionally stealing her money. \n",
      "More:'Money Heist,' 'Lupin,' 'Unorthodox': How Netflix's non-English shows became global hits\n",
      "After a brutally bad day, Gi-hun is approached by a smartly dressed young man in the subway, who offers him a chance to win money by playing games. After accepting, Gi-hun is whisked (or rather, gassed and kidnapped) to a deserted island, where he awakes in a dormitory with 455 other players. Among them is his childhood friend Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), the bright kid who got out of the neighborhood, only to steal and embezzle, leaving him wanted and in debt. \n",
      "The players sign a vague contract to participate in the games and get started with Red Light Green Light – but if they move when they're not supposed to, they are killed by sniper rifle. That's when the stakes of the game become truly real: If you lose any of the games or refuse to play, you die. The players are given an opportunity to leave, but the 45.6 billion won prize (equivalent to nearly $39 million) and the horrors of their own lives bring many back. Soon the players fear not only dying at the hands of the game masters, but by each other, as the worst parts of human nature come out. \n",
      "\"Squid\" is immediately evocative of similar films, shows and books including the 2000 Japanese film \"Battle Royale\" – about kids forced to fight to the death by a totalitarian government – and \"The Hunger Games\" series. What separates \"Squid\" is that the players in the game have a false sense of agency in their plight: As the game masters repeatedly say, they all chose to be there. But when their only other option is returning to a life of suffering that's worse, how is that really a choice?\n",
      "\"Squid\" harshly critiques society's economic inequalities, especially as the rich controllers and spectators behind the game are revealed. It takes specific aim at South Korea – a North Korean defector is a main character, who ruefully says she escaped the North for a better life in the South, only to find similar desperation – but it's universal in 2021, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare so many injustices. \n",
      "More:50 best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now: 'Seinfeld,' 'You' Season 3 arrive in October\n",
      "Superb acting performances heighten the drama, particularly from Lee, who makes Gi-hun irresistibly likable despite his many flaws. All of the characters undergo enormous trauma and transformation, and the actors rise to the challenge of portraying believable emotions in an unbelievable setting. \n",
      "A big part of the series' success lies in its dramatic and eye-catching aesthetic. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk paints the surreal, colorful world of the deadly games like the backdrop of a video game, all exaggerated shapes and sizes and harsh edges that evoke pixels. Juxtaposed against the gray, gloomy streets of Seoul, where many of the characters reside, there's a feeling that the players have crossed over into Oz when they enter the game. \n",
      "What makes it so well-suited for binge-watching is how well Hwang uses pacing and cliffhangers to make the series absurdly addictive. More than almost any original Netflix series, the endings of each episode seduce you into clicking \"next episode.\" Each is nearly a full hour, but they never feel bloated or boring, like many streaming series do these days. The series is certainly disturbing, although its violence and gore never reaches the bloody levels of \"The Walking Dead,\" instead relying on an insidious psychological horror that wraps its tentacles around you.\n",
      "Trying to predict the next streaming sensation can be a fool's errand in the current era of television, but there is real delight in finding something without A-list stars, huge marketing budgets or the typical trappings of \"prestige\" TV that connects with so many people. \"Squid\" may be so popular because we're in a distinctly bleak moment in history, but connection over something disquieting is better than no connection at all. \n",
      "And don't worry, no actual squids were harmed during filming. \n"

      "most of the world, money equates to survival. Apart from the richest few, people living in capitalist countries have to plan their lives based around their ability to make money: how they can leverage their skills into profit, what jobs have the best earning potential, how much they need to support their lifestyles and their loved ones. At some point, everyone has considered what they’re willing to do for money, and the answer to that question really depends on how desperate we are. So it isn’t unthinkable that someone might be willing to endure physical harm and vast risk for the chance to never have to worry about money again.\n",
      "The new surprise Netflix hit Squid Game plays off that idea, and turns it into a grim game. It starts with when someone offers a desperate man the chance to play childhood games, and wager on the outcome. As that offer escalates, it turns out that more than 450 other desperate people have been lured into a brutal life-or-death contest, where they’re playing popular childhood games for the chance to win 45.6 billion Korean won, about $39 million. The nine-episode Korean drama is one of a small handful of American Netflix’s many K-dramas that have crossed over into wide popularity, and cracked the service’s Top 10.\n",
      "And no wonder — it’s impossible to turn away from, even as it rapidly gets more brutal and bloodthirsty. A Battle Royale-type story where people are forced to kill each other for freedom and resources is nothing new. But Squid Game marks its own territory, first with its especially savage premise and the constant tension around life-or-death scenarios, and second, by focusing on each character’s decisions, as they struggle to choose between survival and humanity.\n",
      "In spite of the initial absurdity of the stylized survival games, Squid Game’s cultural context, motivations, and interpersonal conflicts are startlingly realistic. The show takes place in present-day Korea, and the players are culled from the margins of society. It seems like the entire game could be happening in secret today. Recent East Asian film and television stories like Parasite, Burning, and Itaewon Class have adeptly addressed wealth inequality and class struggle in real-world circumstances, rather than through the dystopian lenses of American fantasies like The Hunger Games and Elysium.\n",
      "Film director Hwang Dong-hyuk (My Father, The Crucible) follows this trend with Squid Game, his first drama series: In spite of the fantastical elements, the show seems to have been designed to show that our present reality can be just as hellish as any imagined world.\n",
      "Each of the series’ players have reasons to value the potential prize money over their own lives. The show’s lead, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), owes a fortune to loan sharks and twice as much to the bank, but he wants to take care of his elderly mother and 10-year-old daughter. His childhood friend, investment banker Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo), has been stealing money from his clients. Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) is a North Korean defector who needs a house to get her brother out of an orphanage. The rest of the cast includes obvious good guys and antagonists, but they all have compelling enough backstories to explain why they would let themselves be lured into the Game in the first place.\n",
      "The game itself is a nightmarish childhood vision, where losing at a traditional Korean kids’ game (including universal games like Red Light, Green Light, or tug of war) means a bullet to the head, or a more gruesome death. Masked attendants in bright costumes machine-gun the field of contestants and collect their bodies after each event, placing the eliminated, both dead and dying, into caskets decorated as gift boxes. The players enter and exit the playgrounds through a pastel maze out of an M.C. Escher painting. Squid Game’s visuals, which juxtapose symbols of immaturity with graphic violence, add to the dissonance that powers the show. It all reads as ridiculous, frivolous fun that Korean adults normally only engage in if they’re celebrities on variety shows like Running Man or Knowing Bros — at least, until the bodies start dropping.\n",
      "Though a decent-sized subplot follows a detective who investigates who’s driving the competition, the game itself is more compelling than the mechanism behind it. The secrets ultimately don’t amount to anything more than what the players and viewers learn while going through the experience. The ride is much more compelling, especially because the game masters’ manipulation of the players, and the players’ manipulation of each other, both keep the audience guessing throughout. The audience is also led to feel the same absence of time as the players, who stay in a windowless compound regulated by lights-out and play times, with one round a day. The haunting score by Parasite composer Jung Jae-il adds to the constant tension.\n",
      "Squid Game, at its simplest, is nine-plus hours of watching average people, loaded with immense debt, make increasingly desperate and homicidal decisions while still trying to hold on to their humanity. The game attendants note at the start that all the players joined the game of their own free will, literally offering up their lives in exchange for a chance at something better. Once the game levels up, and victory involves consciously killing other people to get the largest share of the pot, the hope for wealth gets replaced by questions of humanity. These questions are deeply intimate rather than lofty. There’s no hand-wringing about capitalism and the state of the world, just the question of whether survival is worth watching a friend die.\n",
      "The show’s message sounds like a self-help idiom: A person’s choices make up their life. What you do with your circumstances is what counts. Squid Game is that ethos dialed up to a hundred. Who’s behind the curtain, what societal circumstances led to the Game’s founding, who knows that the Game is occurring, and who turns a blind eye — none of these details are the real point. The show succeeds because it creates two-dimensional characters and respects every choice they make, whether to help or harm, keep their humanity or sacrifice it for profit. While the game itself is a parable, the characters are fully, empathetically human.\n",
      "Watching Squid Game is uncomfortable. It’s tempting to fast-forward, either to skip the gore, or to bypass the sense of dread when the show stretches out some of the lethal rounds. While the discomfort could be written off as the price of admission for watching a death game, it really affirms the audience’s own humanity. If viewers don’t watch with a deep empathy for the characters, the show would be pure voyeurism, the entertainment of watching game pieces knock each other off the board. Hwang and his team take immense care with all of the players, laying out how they’re stuck in a horrible system, and just trying to make it through, at any cost. Squid Game is exciting, and startling, and tense, but that care is what really makes it worth watching.\n",
      "All nine episodes of Squid Game are now available on Netflix.\n",

      "This series was a real treat and I’m really hoping more people discover it.\n",
      "My only complaint is it probably should’ve ended about fifteen-twenty minutes before it actually ended but the ride was still great. Like a rollercoaster that’s finished rollercoasting but takes a little too long to trolley back into the station.\n",
      "But if there’s a second season I’d definitely run through the queue to get on for another ride.\n",
      "Main casts’ performances are incredible. However, immersion was broken when the VIPs were introduced near the end of the show. Their scripts in English and voice acting really needed more work.\n",
      "All in all, for live action and this particular genre, the show is as good as it gets.\n",
      "About your spoiler, there’s a thread on r/outoftheloop (or however that subreddit is actually called) where someone gives an explanation. There’s a person that speaks in name of their friend who was one of the VIPs, and they say that they tried to talk to the director about some of the lines, for example the \"oh, it’s bigger\" line when shown the real glass bridge after seeing the model bridge. The director seems to have wanted them to play it just as it was written, actually being surprised that the actual bridge was big enough for actual people to step on, instead of the model for ants. So IMO it’s a problem of things being lost in translation, ESL writers and directors not understanding why certain things would be very grating. Here’s hoping that if there’s a second season, they hire a few English writers for those pieces.\n",
      "That kind of sounds like someone trying to rationalize why it wasn’t their fault how the performances turned out. The language barrier very well likely played into it, but all performances of all of the VIPs felt direct-to-video compared to the contestants we’d been watching.\n",
      "You do what the director wants you to do. If he tells you to read the lines as they’re written, you do the best you can and hope they know what they’re doing in editing. If those people also can’t hear the difference between a good line and a stupid line, welp, you’re screwed and people will think you did a bad job.\n",
      "Of course, I also don’t know more than \"I read some guy said he knew a guy…\", so yeah, it might just me rationalization without any truth behind it, but I find it could be pretty true.\n",
      "I am definitely not saying that the actors are exclusively at fault, or that the Reddit tale wasn’t real- I just personally think there’s very little evidence that the actors in those scenes brought anything notable, regardless of direction. If this was going into their portfolio, it would really have to be in the middle of their portfolio.\n",
      "It goes both ways.\n",

      "I guess I just lost this round…\n",
      "It’s sooooo sloooow.\n",
      "if I want grim social commentary I’ll watch any number of films like parasite, anything by Ken Loach etc, if I want dystopian arena combat action then there’s BR, hunger games or the excellent Alice in Borderland. I just think Squid Game trys to be both and succeeds at neither.\n",
      "An episode of Squid game just feels like 50 minutes of mediocre Korean kitchen sink drama with 10 minutes of mediocre action somewhere in it. There just aren’t any particularly engaging sub plots or narrative arcs to drive interest throughout the series and I’ve just found it really boring so far.\n",
      "You think it’s slow, I think it went by way too fast and really skipped over a lot of things. To each their own, I guess!\n",
      "Yeah no I posted this after getting through the first 4 episodes, it does pick up the pace a bit later to be fair.\n",
      "I started with this show totally blind to what it was about (without watching a trailer or the short info blurb about what the show was about) and I did not find it too slow.\n",

      "I agree on the cinema. It’s bascially what I watch the most on the channel. But the anime is mostly garabge tbh. And if it is good, it’s mostly older stuff I’ve alteady seen.\n",

      "Also, I’ve been on a Korean show kick for roughly the last year plus and watched a bunch of great things.\n",
      "If they do a follow up I think the entire next season should be about soley taking down the Squid organization for good. Bunch of asshole rich serial killers. They say the games are \"fair\" which made me angry at their bullshit. They want to kill poor and destitute people for sport. People are not horses, so fuck the Squid organization, take them down Seong Gi-hun!\n",

      "I didn’t even know this existed until Friday just gone. Saw it was number 2 in the UK so out of curiosity put it on and I’m hooked. Just done the Gganbu episode and it broke me. My only criticism for the episode is I saw the twist coming, so should some of the characters. But aside from that, I’m loving it. Such a good show. The characters make this. 001 is a legend.\n",

      "Even the freaking Goosebumps movie they felt necessary to make R with extreme levels of mutilation/dismemberment! A kids book! I just don’t understand why everything must be pushed to the absolute limits of an R/MA rating.\n",
      "All I can say is I wish Netflix would stop pushing their trashy sadism onto my Netflix home header.\n",
      "Different stuff floats peoples boats – Clearly a large part of the streaming audience likes watching show with a focus on violence / death. Personally I find 99% of PG-13 movies that are in the thriller/action/horror genera rather boring.\n",
      "Maybe there is a way for you to turn off Mature rated content on your Netflix? That way it would stop recommending things like that to you?\n",
      "What are you talking about? Both Goosebumps movies are rated PG, not even PG-13. And unfortunately most theatrical movies seem to be moving more and more into family-movie territory (superhero movies, Disney movies, etc) so really the only place left more adult-oriented stuff is streaming…\n",
      "They might be referring to Fear Street, which was also written by R.L. Stine.\n",

      "There is more than one Squid Game. There is Squid Game as a cultural idea, the Squid Game Vulture’s Joe Adalian wrote about as “Planet Squid Game”: the Korean Netflix series that has quickly become a world-dominating piece of television and proof of the streamer’s global reach. That Squid Game is a hilariously, almost perversely flattened version of the show itself — it is the Squid Game that exists so that Jeff Bezos can retweet “Planet Squid Game” as a congratulations for Netflix’s “internationalization strategy.” It’s also the Squid Game that has required Netflix to hastily slap together a merchandizing plan (customize a T-shirt with your own player number!), and will no doubt spark many industry conversations about what could be the next Squid Game.\n",
      "A weekly dispatch on the cultural discourse, sent Fridays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That version of Squid Game is real and potent, and it’s aided by elements of the show that are primed for cultural penetration. Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk’s direction and Squid Game’s overall visual design are so striking that images from the series can stand on their own, floating around the internet as pictures with detachable meanings. The first episode features a giant doll with a rotating head and an inescapable, perpetually darting gaze. She is a mysterious obsession, an embodied panopticon, an ironic image of outsize childishness returning to haunt us. Then there are the green track suits with their utilitarian, dehumanizing number badges; there’s the shot of Gong Yoo, calm and disarming, holding up the two red and blue ddakji envelopes. All of those images can refer to specific Squid Game scenes, but memes work by dissociating the image from the original context. The pervasiveness of Squid Game memes is its own kind of meaning, sometimes but not necessarily about the show, but more so about the way its imagery has been so quickly recognized and disseminated.\n",
      "But beyond that — or rather, before that — there is Squid Game the nine-episode Korean TV series, which has achieved this level of global recognition because it is distinctively itself while also playing in markedly familiar spaces. (If you have not seen Squid Game yet and your preference is to watch totally unspoiled by its premise, stop here.) The show’s closest relatives are Battle Royale and Hunger Games–style stories: people who are forced or recruited into a game where the only way to win is for all of your opponents to die. In Squid Game, the protagonist is a down-on-his-luck guy named Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), who finds himself deeply in debt, divorced, struggling to connect with his daughter, and guilty over his inability to support his elderly mother. He has a gambling problem. His debt is enormous — impossible to get out from underneath, and his creditors are closing in. And so, in the meme-able scene where he plays ddakji, an envelope-flipping game, Gi-hun gets enlisted into the Squid Game, a nightmarish facility isolated from the rest of the world where contestants play simple childhood games for the promise of huge wealth: 45.6 billion won, or approximately $38 million. The winner becomes immensely wealthy; the losers die.\n",
      "The connections to modern capitalism and the desperation of financial inequality is more explicit in Squid Game than in a Hunger Games–type setting. There is no veneer of fantasy or lightly rewritten place names to let viewers pretend that Gi-hun’s despair takes place in a faraway made-up world. Gi-hun is interested in the game because offering himself up to a stranger for potential financial gain seems safer than continuing with his life as it is, and later, because even the nightmare of Squid Game offers more possibility than the life he’d been leading.\n",
      "His fellow players are just as desperate. Squid Game populates the game with blunt, schematic character types (an old man, a criminal, an immigrant, a woman from North Korea, a guy who was superficially successful but secretly underwater, a married couple, a doctor, the one lady everyone hates), and if the show were less deft in the writing of Gi-hun or in the cruel nostalgia of its beautifully designed games, the oversimplified side characters might have been more of a detraction. The most frustrating among them is Ali, the show’s Pakistani immigrant character played by Anupam Tripathi, who barely gets more than a few wistful, guileless lines. The mysterious American VIPs introduced later aren’t much better, but they also don’t need to be; even without detail or particularly compelling performances, they fulfill the role Squid Game needs them to play. Sure, the economy might be absurdly complex and the causes of modern inequality might be multifaceted, but at the end of the day, there are some people who have more than enough, and Gi-hun and his doomed co-players are the have-nots.\n",
      "There’s a very small subgenre that Squid Game operates within (survive the brutal games to outlast the larger broken system), but it’s also playing in the broader, longer history of the social-experiment story. “The Most Dangerous Game,” Lord of the Flies, more contemporary TV shows like Amazon Prime’s The Wilds, and even the related group of post-apocalypse stories like the current FX adaptation of Y: The Last Man — there are lots of stories that let us watch human behavior play out in highly controlled, heightened scenarios. It’s as though the stark, rule-bound falseness of the experiment will let us see something about humanity that’s otherwise too hidden under social niceties and real-world messiness. The difference between Squid Game and a post-apocalypse show, though, is where the emphasis falls. In apocalyptic stories, the specific nature of the collapse becomes the social experiment: What if only people who lived in this tiny town survive? What if only people with certain characteristics make it? But there’s an inherent optimism in watching people struggle to look ahead. It’s a form of social experiment that hopes the experiment succeeds.\n",
      "It’s hard to not think about apocalypse while watching Squid Game. Or maybe it’s hard to not think about apocalypse because it’s 2021, and that’s when we’re all watching Squid Game. Whatever the case, although Squid Game does plenty of post-apocalyptic musing about how humanity might behave under extreme conditions, the sense of collapse is different. In Squid Game, as Gi-hun frantically scrambles to locate some bottom to the bottomless pit of inhumanity he finds himself inside, the show is most intense and horrifying, most fully and confidently itself, at the moments when there seems to be no end to the abyss. The show’s gorgeous, intense visuals work best early, when it’s still full of mystery, when the terrifying doll’s eyes see everything and there is no hope of escape. As Squid Game’s ending reaches for answers and for a future, it gets less surprising and less visually virtuosic. It’s not the kind of apocalypse story that longs for hopeful human resilience; it’s most eloquent on the topics of financial despondence and weaponized nostalgia.\n",
      "All of that makes Squid Game’s life as a triumphant poster child for global cultural dominance pretty dark. The show the whole world wants to watch right now is a show that’s best when it’s about realizing that the end has already come, and we’re all just grabbing at straws to distract from how bad it already is. That’s pretty bleak, but that’s also the way Squid Game would want it to be.\n",

      "Netflix’s Korean thriller is on track to be the most watched series in the streamer’s history. It’s also giving people nightmares. What’s behind the disturbing series’ popularity?\n",
      "Senior Entertainment Reporter\n",
      "It was a little over 40 minutes into the first episode of Squid Game when my eyebrow arched in confusion, I squinted closer at the TV, and, without realizing it, stopped breathing. Over the next minute, I reflexively started to lean back into my couch, as if my body was trying to run away from the TV, and began to make this weird combination gasp-yelp sound. I sort of shielded my eyes, but also couldn’t look away. I wonder if I’ll ever stop thinking about it?\n",
      "When I talk about how disturbed I was by Netflix’s hit series Squid Game, it’s not in the way that, at brunch with friends, someone might exclaim, “Oh my God, you guys, this show totally creeped me out,” for dramatic effect and attention. The violence, the psychological warfare, the haunting real-world feasibility of something seemingly so outrageous: it pierces you, but then it stays there. It’s the show’s own brutal gameplay with the audience. A metaphorical stabbing.\n",
      "Few series in the age of streaming have ever become word-of-mouth phenomena at the scale and speed with which the South Korean thriller has since its Sept. 17 debut. Especially in this last week, that peculiar title—what the hell could a “Squid Game” possibly be??!—has been everywhere, spreading its tentacles, so to speak, to news headlines, social media feeds, and group texts, where friends and family debate each episode’s twists and commiserate over the trauma.\n",
      "Proving both how clever and exquisitely cinematic the series is, but also maybe how desperate people are not to be left out, Squid Game is currently the No. 1 show on Netflix in 90 different countries. The streamer is on record saying it is on track to be its most-watched series ever.\n",
      "So here we have this interesting dichotomy: Squid Game may be the most upsetting series I’ve ever seen, and it also may be the most globally popular series in modern times.\n",
      "The less a person knows about Squid Game, the better for their enjoyment. Or, um, the intensity of their waking nightmares after watching. (Good luck to all of us the first time we hear “red light” again.) But here’s a brief primer: The series, which can be watched on Netflix in Korean with English subtitles or dubbed in English, comes from South Korean director and writer Hwang Dong-hyuk.\n",
      "A down-on-his-luck gambler with a mountain of debt, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), is recruited by a mystery man to participate in an ambiguous game that he promises will allow Gi-hun to settle his finances and start his life over. He arrives at a secret venue to find 455 other contestants—he is number 456—all in similarly dire straits, confused about what they’ve gotten into but tantalized at the prospect of a cash prize.\n",
      "Once they sign a strangely sparse contract, it is explained to them that if they make it through six games without being eliminated, they will win 45.6 billion won, or what amounts to $38.7 million. At first, these seem like childhood games, like Red Light, Green Light. (Squid Game, for example, is a variation on tag.) But the contestants soon learn—to their horror and the reason I may never sleep soundly again—that “being eliminated” means being killed.\n",
      "Anecdotally, I’ve noticed different reasons that people have become Squid Game evangelists.\n",
      "There’s a certain thrill to being as shocked and as horrified as the characters in each episode of the series. (The cliffhanger-happy series once ended an episode in the middle of such a tense moment that I impulsively yelled, “Fuck you!” at the TV. And then clicked play on the next one.) That’s intoxicating, even if it is rooted in such darkness, and people want to share that high.\n",
      "A more sinister extension of that is payback. Someone convinced me to traumatize myself with this show, so now I’m going to pass that on, until we’re all collectively disturbed together.\n",
      "More than one person has described the show to me as “fun,” which is absolutely wild.\n",
      "Watching the nine episodes is an intense experience. I think there’s a certain appeal in watching something that is so meticulously drawn. From the way the set pieces are laid out, the framing of certain (spectacular) shots, and the music cues, there is a morbid whimsy purposefully injected into the show. It’s black comedy at its bleakest, a tonal juxtaposition that is to be admired. I think it’s so effective, especially in a genre that is so extreme in its gore, that it masquerades as “fun.”\n",
      "Then there’s the age-old reason: Curiosity kills the cat—or, in this case, the human spirit, which no longer exists after watching. Everyone is talking about it. Especially as it’s caught fire this last week, Netflix has dutifully made sure it shows up on as many home screens as possible. Who wants to feel like they missed out? (As someone who finished the season and may never smile again, maybe it’s OK to miss out!)\n",
      "Watching Squid Game is such a visceral experience, but in a way that we’re not used to when it comes to television.\n",
      "We all have memories of the TV scenes that are so sad that just the thought of them makes you cry. (In fact, that was a viral meme on Twitter this week.) But the feelings I can conjure more explicitly are the times I watched something so upsetting that I nearly vomited—and in one case did. The hanging fake-out scene at the beginning of Handmaid’s Tale season 2. The beach scene in Years and Years. Now, any number of Squid Game sequences join the list.\n",
      "It’s funny how little patience we seem to have for things that make us feel good. The Schitt’s Creek final season into Ted Lasso season 1 admiration was short-lived to the point of receiving intense backlash this year over shows that are “too nice.” We keep finding our way back to the things that are disturbing. What’s interesting is who feels it intensely, and who arrives at it from a remove.\n",
      "The show is everywhere. It’s arrived on TikTok, where the hashtag #squidgame already had over 11 billion views earlier this week. People are having a blast making jokes about how they’d pose during “Red Light, Green Light.” That particular game’s giant porcelain villain is already achieving gay-icon status. The series has been meme’d countless times. The instinct to mine the series’ darkness for comedy is fascinating to me—or maybe that’s just an inevitability in today’s social-media world.\n",
      "Comparisons between Squid Game and both The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are obvious. One friend asked me why someone would want to watch something that’s like The Hunger Games, but more realistic. For a lot of people, that’s exactly why they’re so attracted to the series, which I think says a lot about us as a society. On the other hand, that’s also what makes the show so effective and its impact so undeniable.\n",
      "There is only one thing that I will slightly spoil, and it’s not the biggest plot point, but it’s important for talking about why the show works. Yes, an arena-style death match has been done before in pop culture. But what sets Squid Game apart is agency. The contestants choose to be there in the first place. And once they found out about the deadly repercussions, they were allowed to leave—and did. Then they came back.\n",
      "This isn’t government corruption and abuse as blood sport. It is desperation as blood sport. It is an indictment of the class divide that they become willing participants, twice. The stakes outside of the lethal games are as severe as the ones there.\n",
      "I think we’re in the first wave of conversation/fascination over Squid Game’s unprecedented popularity. (I certainly am only in the first wave of NEVER SHUTTING UP about how traumatized I was by it.)\n",
      "It’s a foreign-language series that became an almost instant hit, at a time when Americans, whose pop-culture tastes have been notoriously xenophobic, are becoming more and more excited by global content. Like Parasite, it uses genre as a Trojan horse for discussions about capitalism and class. We’re a culture attuned to hyper-violence, but the series manages to show it in a way that you never become desensitized. What does that mean? (That’s not to mention how much we need to debate the ending, which I didn’t love…)\n",
      "When it comes to talking about and dissecting Squid Game, we’ve only just heard “green light.”\n",
      "Wallace also confirmed reports that he went to Fox News management to directly complain about Tucker Carlson’s deranged Jan. 6 documentary.\n",
      "Media Reporter\n",
      "Speaking out for the first time since ditching Fox News after nearly two decades, Chris Wallace said it had become “increasingly unsustainable” for him to remain with the conservative cable news giant as the network’s stars were unleashed to push out election denialism and Jan. 6 trutherism.\n",
      "In an extensive interview with the New York Times that was published Sunday, the 74-year-old venerable newsman also confirmed earlier reports that he complained to Fox News management about Tucker Carlson’s docu-series Patriot Purge, which baselessly suggested that the Capitol riots were a “false flag” operation to justify a new “war on terror” against conservatives.\n",
      "“I just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox,” Wallace told the Times.\n",
      "“I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion,” he added. “But when people start to question the truth — Who won the 2020 election? Was Jan. 6 an insurrection? — I found that unsustainable. I spent a lot of 2021 looking to see if there was a different place for me to do my job.”\n",
      "Wallace, who shocked the media world last December when he suddenly ditched Fox News to host a daily interview show for rival CNN’s new streaming service, bemoaned the hard-right shift at Fox News following former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss.\n"

      "Notably, this included expanding the network’s opinion programming, firing its longtime political editor who defended the network’s early and accurate election night projection of Arizona, and the increased prominence of Carlson. Prior to the election, Wallace had loyally defended Fox News to its detractors for years while refusing to publicly condemn its more strident opinion hosts by name, even as he famously pushed back against their rhetoric on the air.\n",
      "“Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Wallace noted. “And since November of 2020, that just became unsustainable, increasingly unsustainable as time went on.”\n",
      "At the same time, the former Fox News Sunday moderator acknowledged that critics would say that it took him too long to finally call it quits.\n",
      "“Some people might have drawn the line earlier, or at a different point,” he declared. “I think Fox has changed over the course of the last year and a half. But I can certainly understand where somebody would say, ‘Gee, you were a slow learner, Chris.’”\n",
      "As for the Kremin-friendly rhetoric pushed by Carlson and other Fox News personalities since the launch of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Wallace—who said he “wanted to get out of politics” when he quit his Sunday show—wasn’t in the mood to pick any new fights.\n",
      "“One of the reasons that I left Fox was because I wanted to put all of that behind me,” he stated, adding that “there has not been a moment when I have second-guessed myself about that decision.”\n",

      "With its simple yet brutal premise that dials right into the recent boom of class-warfare stories, Squid Game is an unsubtle but riveting show fast becoming a global phenomenon. The groundwork for the show’s success (it’s currently on track to become Netflix’s biggest original series of all time) has been laid as far back as 2000, when Japanese horror Battle Royale garnered a cult following for its ruthless teen murder games. More recently in 2019, Todd Phillips’ Joker and Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite swept awards season with their two vastly different takes on the cavernous divide between rich and poor.\n",
      "Squid Game exists right in the pit of this divide, where 456 desperate individuals attempt to survive six violent interpretations of children’s games in the hope of scoring a life-changing 45.6 billion won (around £28 million). Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk demonstrates a real inventive flair when it comes to the tournament itself, from the presence of a chilling, pigtailed mechanical doll in the opening game, to the uniforms that distinguish the contestants from the elusive masked guards; teal tracksuits for the former, hot-pink boilersuits for the latter.\n",
      "The clinical execution of violence is heavy and relentless from the off. Contestants are shot en masse at close range, blood drips off swing sets, and a vicious nocturnal riot is captured via infrared. As the games roll on, an entertainment element is introduced to further twist the already rib-deep knife buried (mostly) figuratively in the contestants’ sides. \n",
      "Its final act twists feel thrilling thanks to Hwang Dong-hyuk’s taut, precise script.\n",
      "Yet there’s heart to be found in the macabre parade of human suffering. Enemies are made amongst the ranks of survivors — notably Jang Deok-su (Heo Sung-tae), a surly gangster with a face tattoo of a gun — but so are allies. Among them are Kang Sae-byeok (standout newcomer Jung Ho-yeon), a pickpocket and North Korean defector who plans to use the prize money to get her remaining family over the border. Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) is a gentle older contestant who suffers from a brain tumour, and on the guards’ side there’s Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon), a cop who has infiltrated the game with the aim of finding his missing brother.\n",
      "Hwang weaves poignant details about Gi-hun and his comrades into the story as he moves frenetically between games, all while ending each episode on a tantalising cliffhanger. Bolstered by unwaveringly engaged performances from Lee and his central co-stars, each backstory pushes the emotional stakes of the show to painstaking new heights, which, when matched with its rising body count, makes for moments of raw tragedy.\n",
      "Even with its final act twists — which feel thrilling thanks to Hwang’s taut, precise script — Squid Game doesn’t say much about privilege, poverty and cruelty that hasn’t been said already. Yet with its propulsive storytelling, robustly drawn characters and thoughtful dialogue — which, it has been discovered, should be watched with ‘English’ rather than ‘English CC’ subtitles on Netflix for a more nuanced translation – there’s still plenty to enjoy within these familiar themes. That Squid Game also manages to be one of the most visually exhilarating shows of the year is a delightful if often gruesome bonus.\n",
